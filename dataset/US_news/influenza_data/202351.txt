The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all adults receive influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, and those aged ≥60 years may receive respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine during the 2023–24 respiratory virus season. What is added by this report? By December 9, 2023, an estimated 42.2% and 18.3% of adults aged ≥18 years had received influenza and updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine, respectively; 17.0% of adults aged ≥60 years had received RSV vaccine. Many adults who had not received the vaccines reported being open to vaccination. What are the implications for public health practice? Strong provider recommendations for and offers of vaccination could increase influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccination coverage. Immunization programs and vaccination partners might benefit from using these within-season data to understand vaccination patterns in their jurisdictions to strengthen vaccination activities.

Data from the National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module, a random-digit–dialed cellular telephone survey of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years, are used to monitor influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccination coverage. By December 9, 2023, an estimated 42.2% and 18.3% of adults aged ≥18 years reported receiving an influenza and updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine, respectively; 17.0% of adults aged ≥60 years had received RSV vaccine. Coverage varied by demographic characteristics. Overall, approximately 27% and 41% of adults aged ≥18 years and 53% of adults aged ≥60 years reported that they definitely or probably will be vaccinated or were unsure whether they would be vaccinated against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, respectively. Strong provider recommendations for and offers of vaccination could increase influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccination coverage. Immunization programs and vaccination partners are encouraged to use these data to understand vaccination patterns and attitudes toward vaccination in their jurisdictions to guide planning, implementation, strengthening, and evaluation of vaccination activities. Top Introduction Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) typically circulate in the United States during the fall through early spring each year, causing epidemics of respiratory illness, although patterns of influenza and RSV transmission shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic (1–3). Certain groups, including older adults (those aged ≥65 years), persons with chronic conditions, and racial and ethnic minority populations, have experienced disproportionate influenza-, COVID-19–, and RSV-associated morbidity and mortality (1–4). Since 2010, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications (1). On September 12, 2023, ACIP recommended updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months to help protect against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants (2). In June 2023, ACIP recommended that adults aged ≥60 years may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making, which is the first time a vaccine for prevention of RSV-associated respiratory disease has been recommended* (3). CDC monitors coverage with these vaccines and makes these data available during the respiratory season for use in planning vaccination activities. Top Methods Data Collection The National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) is a random-digit–dialed cellular telephone survey of adults aged ≥18 years in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and selected local areas and U.S. territories. Data are weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.† The survey includes questions about receipt of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV vaccines, vaccination intent, sociodemographic characteristics, and behavioral and social drivers of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents are asked if they have received a COVID-19 or RSV vaccine or have received an influenza vaccine since July 1, 2023, and for affirmative responses, the month and year of vaccination.§ Those reporting receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine since September 14, 2023, are considered to be vaccinated with the updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine, because this was the only COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the United States after that date. Data Analysis Data collected during September 24–December 9, 2023, are included in this analysis.¶ Estimates of coverage (percentage of the population vaccinated) with influenza, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines were calculated for weekly data collection periods using a nondecreasing composite estimation procedure that uses data from completed interviews from the current week combined with data from all previous weeks (5). Estimates for vaccination intent are based on interviews conducted each respective week and are adjusted to the cumulative vaccination coverage estimate for that week. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage is estimated among adults aged ≥18 years, and RSV vaccination coverage estimates are restricted to respondents aged ≥60 years. Differences among estimates were determined using t-tests with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** Top Results Overall Vaccination Coverage and Intent As of December 9, 2023, estimated influenza and updated COVID-19 vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥18 years was 42.2% and 18.3%, respectively; estimated RSV vaccination coverage among all adults aged ≥60 years was 17.0% and among those with chronic health conditions†† was 21.4% (Figure 1) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/136452). From September 24 through December 9, the percentage of adults who reported being unvaccinated, but who definitely will get vaccinated, decreased over time as vaccination coverage increased, from 33.2% to 9.4% for influenza and from 28.2% to 14.1% for COVID-19 vaccines. The decrease was less for RSV vaccine (from 20.9% to 14.1%). Throughout the study period, the proportion of adults who were unvaccinated and reported they probably or definitely would not get vaccinated was lowest for RSV, whereas the proportion who were unvaccinated and reported they probably would get vaccinated or were unsure was highest for RSV. Vaccination Coverage and Intent by Demographic Characteristics and Jurisdiction Coverage with all vaccines was lowest among uninsured persons. Coverage and intent to be vaccinated increased with age and were higher among adults living in urban and suburban areas compared with those living in rural areas (Figure 2). Influenza vaccination coverage was higher among non-Hispanic White (White) and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) adults than among most other racial and ethnic groups. However, the percentage of persons reporting that they probably or definitely will not get an influenza vaccination was similar among White adults (32.2%) and Black or African American (Black) adults (32.2%) and was lower among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults (24.0%). Updated COVID-19 and RSV vaccination coverage was higher among White adults than among most other racial and ethnic groups. However, a higher percentage of White adults reported that they probably or definitely will not receive a COVID-19 vaccine (43.2%) than did Black (31.3%) and Hispanic (34.7%) adults. Similarly, a higher percentage of White adults reported that they probably or definitely will not receive an RSV vaccine (32.5%) than did Black (15.3%) and Hispanic (19.3%) adults. Coverage with all vaccines varied by jurisdiction, ranging from 15.6% to 54.8% for influenza vaccine, from 2.4% to 35.6% for updated COVID-19 vaccine, and from 1.9% to 32.4% for RSV vaccine (Table). Top Discussion As of December 9, 2023, self-reported coverage with influenza, updated COVID-19, and RSV vaccines among U.S. adults was low, particularly for updated COVID-19 and RSV vaccines. RSV vaccination coverage was low even among persons with chronic conditions who are at highest risk for severe RSV disease and might benefit from vaccination. As of mid-November, influenza vaccination coverage was approximately 2.5 percentage points lower than it was at the same time during the 2022–23 influenza season (6). Approximately 41% of all adults and 53% of adults aged ≥60 years were unvaccinated but reported that they definitely or probably plan to receive or are unsure about receiving updated COVID-19 and RSV vaccines, respectively, suggesting they are open to vaccination. A health care provider recommendation for and offer of vaccination are strongly associated with vaccination (7). A previous report found that unvaccinated adults who were open to receiving a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine had not yet done so mainly because of concerns about side effects, being too busy, or just had not gotten around to getting vaccinated (8). Making vaccination available in provider offices, pharmacies, workplaces, and other convenient locations at convenient times, along with a strong provider recommendation for vaccination, could increase vaccination coverage, particularly for RSV, which is recommended on the basis of shared clinical decision-making between a patient and provider (3). Despite disparities in vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity, when responses indicating the person is open to vaccination are included, the potential vaccination coverage that could be achieved for Hispanic, Black, and Asian adults is similar to or higher than that for White adults. Programmatic measures that helped reduce disparities in coverage with the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine, such as making vaccines available free of charge, use of trusted messengers, and bringing vaccines into communities through nontraditional settings (e.g., local libraries and local businesses such as barber shops and restaurants)§§ (4,9), might increase equitable access to vaccination and decrease disparities for these currently recommended vaccines. CDC is partnering with community-based organizations, health care providers, and other trusted messengers to build vaccine confidence and awareness, including through the Partnering for Vaccine Equity program.¶¶ CDC is also working to expand COVID-19 vaccine access to all through the Bridge Access Program, which provides COVID-19 vaccines for adults without health insurance and adults whose insurance does not cover all COVID-19 vaccine costs. Public health safety net and pharmacy locations offering influenza and COVID-19 vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines through the Bridge Access Program, are available at https://www.vaccines.gov. Communication campaigns,*** such as the “Wild to Mild” and “Get My Flu Shot” influenza vaccine campaign and the “Everything” broad respiratory virus communication initiative, include various materials and resources to promote vaccination, including to persons who are disproportionately affected by disease. Finally, CDC has developed health care provider toolkits to empower providers with knowledge to confidently recommend vaccination.††† CDC makes vaccination coverage estimates rapidly available during the respiratory virus season.§§§,¶¶¶ In addition to data from the NIS-ACM, vaccination data are available from multiple sources and include coverage among children, pregnant persons, Medicare beneficiaries, and national projected vaccination in pharmacies and medical offices. Jurisdiction-level estimates of COVID-19 vaccination coverage and intent stratified by demographic factors, behavioral and social drivers of vaccination, and barriers to vaccination are available.**** CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Geographic Information System Mapping Tool, designed with feedback from several local health departments, provides web maps where jurisdiction-level data including demographic characteristics and social determinants of health can be displayed along with vaccine confidence and vaccination coverage.†††† End-of-season influenza vaccination coverage estimates for children and adults since the 2010–11 influenza season, nationally and by state, are available on FluVaxView.§§§§ Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, response rates for NIS-ACM were relatively low (<25%). Data were weighted to mitigate possible bias resulting from incomplete sample frame (i.e., exclusion of households with no phone service or only landline telephones) or nonresponse, but some selection bias might persist. Second, all responses were self-reported; vaccination receipt, and month and year of receipt of most recent dose might be subject to recall or social desirability bias. Nonresponse and social desirability bias could result in overestimation of coverage. Third, the survey sampled noninstitutionalized U.S. adults; therefore, adults who were incarcerated or who live in long-term care facilities¶¶¶¶ might not be represented in the sample. Implications for Public Health Practice Although influenza, updated COVID-19, and RSV vaccination has slowed for the 2023–24 respiratory season, vaccination is recommended to continue while viruses are circulating (1–3), and many unvaccinated persons continue to report intent to be vaccinated. Health care provider recommendations for and offers of vaccination are important to increasing vaccination coverage (7). Immunization programs and vaccination partners are encouraged to use CDC developed dashboards and tools, as well as other data sources available to them, such as immunization information systems, to identify undervaccinated populations and better understand vaccination patterns, attitudes and behaviors, and systemic barriers to vaccination in their jurisdiction to help tailor vaccination activities to improve coverage and health equity.

Top * On September 22, 2023, ACIP and CDC recommended maternal Pfizer RSVpreF vaccination for pregnant persons as a one-time dose at 32–36 weeks’ gestation using seasonal administration (i.e., September–January in most of the continental United States) for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection among infants aged <6 months. Either maternal RSVpreF vaccination during pregnancy at 32–36 weeks’ gestation or nirsevimab (a human recombinant monoclonal antibody) immunization for infants aged <8 months who are born during or are entering their first RSV season is recommended, but administration of both products is not needed for most infants. (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7241e1). Information about RSV vaccination during pregnancy and nirsevimab receipt among infants is not included in this report. † Data were weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged ≥18 years using population control totals for age group, sex, metropolitan statistical area status, education, Hispanic origin, and race. https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managersis/about.html § Respondents reporting receipt of an influenza vaccine since July 1, 2023, are asked the month and year of first vaccination since July 1, 2023. Respondents reporting receipt of ≥1 dose of any COVID-19 vaccine are asked the month and year of most recent COVID-19 vaccination; if the reported month of vaccination is September 2023, they are further asked if they received a COVID-19 vaccine since September 14, 2023. Those reporting receiving any COVID-19 vaccine since September 14, 2023, are considered vaccinated with the updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents reporting receipt of RSV vaccine are asked the month and year that they received the RSV vaccine. ¶ Respondents were excluded from the analysis if they did not answer the question or questions about receipt of vaccine or intent to be vaccinated, and for RSV, if they did not report age. Number of excluded respondents was 365 for influenza vaccination coverage assessment, 595 for COVID-19 vaccination coverage assessment, and 3,890 for RSV vaccination coverage assessment. Sample sizes for data collected through December 9, 2023, and included in this analysis were 168,899 for influenza vaccination assessment, 168,669 for COVID-19 vaccination assessment, and 62,816 for RSV vaccination assessment. ** 45 C.F.R. part 46.102(l)(2), 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C.

Policies during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the transmission of seasonal influenza, making the timing and magnitude of a potential resurgence difficult to ascertain and its impact important to forecast.MethodsWe have developed a hierarchical generalised additive model (GAM) for the short-term forecasting of hospital admissions with a positive test for the influenza virus sub-regionally across England. The model incorporates a multi-level structure of spatio-temporal splines, weekly cycles in admissions, and spatial correlation. Using multiple performance metrics including interval score, coverage, bias, and median absolute error, the predictive performance is evaluated for the 2022-2023 seasonal wave. Performance is measured against autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Prophet time series models.ResultsAcross the epidemic phases the hierarchical GAM shows improved performance, at all geographic scales relative to the ARIMA and Prophet models. Temporally, the hierarchical GAM has overall an improved performance at 7 and 14 day time horizons. The performance of the GAM is most sensitive to the flexibility of the smoothing function that measures the national epidemic trend.ConclusionsThis study introduces an approach to short-term forecasting of hospital admissions for the influenza virus using hierarchical, spatial, and temporal components. The methodology was designed for the real time forecasting of epidemics. This modelling framework was used across the 2022-2023 winter for healthcare operational planning by the UK Health Security Agency and the National Health Service in England.Plain language summary Seasonal influenza causes a burden for hospitals and therefore it is useful to be able to accurately predict how many patients might be admitted with the disease. We attempted to predict influenza admissions up to 14 days in the future by creating a computational model that incorporates how the disease is reported and how it spreads. We evaluated our optimised model on data acquired during the winter of 2022-2023 data in England and compared it with previously developed models. Our model was better at modelling how influenza spreads and predicting future hospital admissions than the models we compared it to. Improving how influenza admissions are forecast can enable hospitals to prepare better for increased admissions, enabling improved treatment and reduced death for all patients in hospital over winter.

The recent winters of 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 however, were notable exceptions, with little influenza in circulation, which was likely due to the impact of COVID-19 targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions. Influenza admissions reduce the capacity of the healthcare service to provide emergency care and elective treatment7. It is therefore essential that healthcare operational planning are cognisant of the expected demand on the system.In the United Kingdom, influenza has historically been attributed to around 28,000 hospitalisations annually, with substantial inter-seasonal variation8. The disease disproportionately hospitalises young children, the elderly, and adults with high-risk comorbidities9. Between the 1996–2009 seasons, weekly hospitalisation rates in the UK were highest in adults over 75 (252 per 100,000), adults aged 65–74 (101 per 100,000) and children under 5 (93 per 100,000)8. Being able to forecast hospital admissions with influenza accurately allows clinical administrators to deploy mitigations faster that can curtail system pressures. In the winter 2022–2023, the uncertainty around the likely trajectory of the influenza season and impact of COVID-19 waves on system resources increased the need for fast and flexible models that could be used when population level epidemiological parameters (such as immunity, inter-viral competition, and social mixing behaviour) were less clear. Therefore, forecasting models of influenza hospital admissions, that are less dependent upon predetermined seasonal patterns and estimated epidemiological parameters, would allow public health officials and health system leaders to make informed decisions around policy and response during an irregular season. This includes the deployment of staff, mutual aid between locations, changes to triage or discharge practice, or other methods to increase bed capacity.Influenza forecasting is a historically well-studied field, with a wide range of methodologies applied10,11. Previous work includes a mix of statistical and mechanistic approaches, with the aim of understanding the timing, location, and magnitude of epidemic waves. These include when peaks in infection and hospitalisations occur12,13, how large the peaks will be12, and incorporating leading indicators14. Furthermore, there is a spatial component to the spread of influenza with strong phase correlation based on proximity and connectiveness15. This spatial relationship, and the hierarchical nature of spread has been harnessed, such as via mobility data, with either machine learning methods16,17 or Bayesian multi-scale approaches18. The start of an outbreak is also of interest and has been forecast at fine spatial scales19. In the US, many of these policy-relevant metrics are predicted, for example in the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) FluSight forecasting challenge, where a range of models are ensembled20. In winter 2022-2023, several factors (uncertainty around population dynamics, the early season, and lack of comparable seasons to train models) meant that a less mechanistic and historically based model is of increased operational utility.In this paper we present a highly generalisable method for short-term admissions forecasts, which could be applicable to a range of infectious diseases and in a range of settings. It was deployed by UK Health Security Agency in winter 2022–2023. The method could be used nationally, and in local healthcare regions using data within the organisations and using publicly available reference information, without the need for high performance computational resource. The model is a hierarchical generalised additive structure with a spatial component to extrapolate forward 2 weeks the national, regional, and sub-regional trends within England. We score this model’s performance by a range of performance metrics and contrast it with commonly used time series forecasting approaches, highlighting its utility in operational public health response. In this manuscript we show that our model structure out performs other time series forecasting approaches across geographies and forecast horizons.MethodologyDataAn NHS Trust is an organisational unit within the National Health Service (NHS) serving a geographical area or a specialised function; there are 137 acute (containing emergency departments) Trusts in England. Each Trust is within a Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) grouping, formed for NHS Trusts to develop plans to transform healthcare delivery in their shared area21, of which there are 44 in England. Each STP has an associated geographic boundary, each within one of the seven NHS England commissioning regions—this structure is outlined in Supplementary Fig. 1. As all data used in this study was aggregated and anonymised, ethical approval was not required. The UK Health Security Agency provided ethics oversight for the study.NHSE SitRep and admitted patient careNHS England (NHSE) influenza data is provided by individual NHS acute Trusts in England, who deliver a daily situation report (SitRep) covering the previous 24 hours on urgent and emergency care activity (UEC) by 11am each day22. The reporting process for many Trusts is automated and completed via web form23. The data records both hospital bed occupancy and new patients in the past 24 hours with a laboratory-confirmed positive influenza test24. We assume positive test patients in the past 24 hours are analogous to admissions throughout this paper, though they likely include hospital acquired infections. Linking information provided in the data includes the Trust, STP21, and NHS commissioning region. The data available for this study covers 01 Dec 2021 to the week ending 29 Jan 2023.The SitRep is used to forecast influenza admissions because it is timely, with limited missing data, and high spatial coverage of England. The SitRep is provided weekly allowing for analysis in real time as the epidemic progresses and is used by the NHS for operational planning. As of 05 Jan 2023, 137 NHS Trusts were reporting data to the SitRep, of which 123 reported data on >99% of days. This provides high coverage of the English population and is representative in all regions. Equally, this allows modelling at NHS Trust or STP level, increasing the operational utility of the approach with granular insight. Furthermore, patients must have laboratory-confirmed positive influenza tests to be included in the SitRep, which increases the reliability of reporting across NHS Trusts, and avoids convoluting counts with other influenza-like-illnesses. Though a high coverage and well specified data source, there are several Trusts which misreported admissions counts due to the rapid turnaround of the reporting and because this is the first reemergent influenza season since the collection started. This can be handled by data cleaning during the season, though it can be challenging to discern between true and false reporting and was partially accounted for in modelling. Trusts that started reporting part way through the season or had clear misreporting were excluded from the analysis.To support the generalisation of our newly developed model methodology we also produce forecasts using a secondary data set—the Admitted Patient Care (APC) database collected by NHS England25. The APC data contains completed individual patient records, including date of admission and ICD-10 diagnosis codes26, although there is a multiple month reporting lag. We define influenza admissions as patients with either a primary or secondary diagnosis code in the ICD-10 categories: J09, J10, J11. While local coding practices may vary, admitted patients with influenza diagnosis codes are likely to have been tested for influenza. This gives us an alternative view of the Winter 2022-2023 influenza season in England to the SitRep data which we can validate our model against.STP boundariesWhen modelling trends in spatial data we expect nearby locations to be closely related. In this case, we expect neighbouring STPs to be correlated. We created an undirected network based on STP boundary adjacency, such that contiguous neighbours are connected and regions that are not adjacent are not connected. This was done such that a Markov Random Field (MRF)27 spatial smoothing approach could be included within the modelling. The network itself is unweighted and undirected, the network provides the structure upon which the MRF fits the model coefficients itself.STP boundary files were obtained from the ONS Open Geography Portal28. These contain digital vector boundaries for STPs in England as of April 2021. The STP structure of England, NHS commissioning regions, individual Trust locations and catchment population sizes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A, B. The network structure constructed for the MRF component, created via polygon adjacency, is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. This approach using only neighbours, rather than population mobility connection (which would link London to more areas as a highly connected area) reduces the complexity of the space over which the smoothed intercept is estimated. This is a parsimonious approach using only the data available from the spatial locations available—more complex network structures may better estimate true mobility patterns; however, they rely on more information and stronger assumptions. As the MRF is used to estimate a non-time varying fixed effect in the model we do not anticipate the network structure itself having a substantial impact of forecast performance relative to other model components.Respiratory local authority to trust mappingLarger STPs service correspondingly large population catchments, and therefore should have higher daily counts of influenza patients as the epidemic progresses. We normalised admission counts by the population catchment size for an STP, giving a per capita rate. As the hospital an individual visits depends on location, choice29 and age group30 we created a probabilistic mapping between lower tier local authority (LTLA) administrative regions and NHS Trusts, linking resident populations and hospitals. This mapping used counts of patient records from Secondary Use Services—All Patient Care25, linking a discharge location (LTLA) to the service provider (NHS Trust), in a similar manner to the covid19.nhs.data R package31. The counts include all patients admitted from 01 Jan 2021 to 11 Dec 2022 with a respiratory-related primary or secondary diagnosis code, excluding COVID-19 patients— using COVID-19 test linkage with the Second Generation Surveillance Service (SGSS)32. ONS 2019 local authority population estimates are used to produce a weighted sum of populations across Trusts of their feeder LTLAs, giving an effective population catchment size. Since the data were modelled at STP spatial level for these forecasts, admissions and populations were aggregated from reporting Trusts within an STP to calculate the rate.ModelGeneralised additive model (GAM) structureTo forecast hospital admissions with influenza, we first assumed a semi-mechanistic model. We assumed in an exponentially growing epidemic we have the per-capita rate, with population \(p\), of hospitalisations at time \(t\), \(H(t)/p\),$$\frac{H\left(t\right)}{p}=\frac{H\left(0\right)}{p}{e}^{{rt}}.$$Instead of assuming a constant growth rate \(r\), we can consider the growth as a smooth function of time \(s(t)\), i.e.$$\frac{H\left(t\right)}{p}=\frac{H\left(0\right)}{p}{e}^{s\left(t\right)}.$$Such a model can be used to generate short-term forecasts by assuming that the growth rate remains constant outside of the data window, i.e., \(s\left(t\right)=r* t\) when \(t\ge {t}_{\max }\), where \({t}_{\max }\) is the final date for which we have data. To fit such a model, we need to estimate the smooth function \(s\left(t\right)\) for \(t\in [0,{t}_{\max }]\). Taking the logarithm of both sides, this becomes$$\frac{H\left(t\right)}{p}=\frac{H\left(0\right)}{p}{e}^{s\left(t\right)}\Rightarrow \log \left(\frac{H\left(t\right)}{p}\right)=\log \left(\frac{H\left(0\right)}{p}\right)+s\left(t\right).$$$$\Rightarrow \log \left(H(t)\right)=\log \left(\frac{H\left(0\right)}{p}\right)+s\left(t\right)+\log (p).$$The number of hospital admissions on each day, \(H\left(t\right)\), is an overdispersed integer valued count, which can be considered as a random sample from a negative binomial distribution. Therefore, the smoother \(s(t)\) can be estimated as \(y(t)\) by using a GAM with negative binomial error structure, with an intercept term \({\beta }_{0}\), smoothing function of time \(f\left(t\right)\), and offset for the population size \(p\), i.e.$$\log \left(y(t)\right)={\beta }_{0}+f\left(t\right)+\log (p).$$Incorporating STP level structures and population sizeWe aggregated the data to STP level, so all sub-regions have at least one reporting hospital Trust, which allows us to create a connected network of adjacent sub-regions. We assumed a seasonal influenza outbreak will have a national epidemic curve component, as well as trends sub-nationally (STP level), but these sub-national trends are not fully independent of one another in shape. A hierarchical GAM was used to account for the group-level structure. Following the GS form from Pedersen et al.33, we add a global smoother (national level) and group-level smoothers (STP level) that have the same wiggliness—a “Global smoother with individual effects that have a Shared penalty”33. To further account for between-group correlation of adjacent STPs, we estimated an intercept using spatial smoothing, correlating adjacent STPs using a MRF approach, and a network based on adjacency shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.Each STP has different population catchment sizes, so we included an offset, \({p}_{i}\), to calculate an admissions rate per capita for a given STP \(i\); we transform the forecasts back to counts for ease of comparison in reporting. We further included a regional random effect \({\delta }_{{regio}{n}_{i}}\). And as hospital admissions and test reporting are impacted by the day of week (DOW), we include a random effect \({\delta }_{{{dow}}_{t},{st}{p}_{i},{regio}{n}_{i}}\) of DOW by STP nested within region. As reporting quality varied between STP and region the DOW random effect is fitted for each STP, and for those STPs with limited information on effect size, this term converges to the regional effect. The STP intercept was approximated by the Markov Random Field \({f}_{{mrf}}\left(i\right)\), the STP temporal trends by the individual effect shared penalty \({f}_{{st}{p}_{i}}\left(t\right)\) and a national trend by \({f}_{{nat}}\left(t\right)\). This gives the model formulation as$$\log \left({y}_{i}(t)\right)= \, {\beta }_{0}+{f}_{{nat}}\left(t\right)+{f}_{{st}{p}_{i}}\left(t\right)+{f}_{{mrf}}\left(i\right) \\ +{\delta }_{{{dow}}_{t},{st}{p}_{i},{regio}{n}_{i}}+{\delta }_{{regio}{n}_{i}}+\log ({p}_{i}).$$Forecasts at multiple geographies are policy relevant: individual NHS STPs, regions, and nationally. To obtain these, we aggregated the individual time series forecasts using a “bottom up” approach, where disaggregate predictions are aggregated to higher levels, such as STP to region and to nation. This is often more accurate when disaggregate data is available than “top down” methods, where data is first aggregated to a high level, forecasts generated, then disaggregated proportionally to the lower levels34,35. Where STP level count data is weak, the model is still accounting for national trends, which partially mitigates low data quality in individual STPs.This hierarchical structure, with shared parameters between national and STP level splines defining the model structure, reduces the total flexibility in the model—as fewer parameters are penalised. In addition, as the temporal splines are defined by the number of basis functions, the number of basis functions sets the level of flexibility in the model, and its propensity to overfitting—for which the model sensitivity can be explored.Implementing the modelWe implemented the GAM using the R package mgcv36. In mgcv, the negative binomial distribution is parameterised in the terms of the mean, \(\mu\), and variance, \({\sigma }^{2}\), such that \(\mu =E\left[y\right]\) and \({\sigma }^{2}=E\left[y\right]+\frac{E{\left[y\right]}^{2}}{\theta }\). In this formulation, the θ parameter is fitted by the package rather than specified by the user. We selected thin plate splines as the basis functions, with the optimum number of basis functions chosen by scoring different combinations. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the optimal model structure formed by the different additive components and hierarchical relationships during model development. In mgcv, the parameter \(k\) sets the dimensionality of the spline and so the number of basis functions is given by \(k-1\). We define the number of days per basis function as \({t}_{d}\) and the number of days the model is fit with as \({t}_{{length}}\). We round down the ratio \({t}_{{length}}/{t}_{d}\) to the closest integer to calculate \(k-1,\)$$k-1=\left\lfloor \frac{{t}_{{length}}}{{t}_{d}}\right\rfloor .$$The relationship between \({t}_{d}\) and the number of basis functions is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. In this analysis \({t}_{{length}}\) is chosen as 63 days (9 weeks) and td ∈ 1,14 for both \({f}_{{nat}}(t)\) and \({f}_{{st}{p}_{i}}(t)\). The optimal model is found to be \({t}_{d}=5\)—all results are shown for this value for national and STP splines.Baseline ARIMA modelTo contextualise the performance of our newly developed hierarchical GAM model we compared it with a commonly used approach. As a baseline, we chose an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model37, a widely employed technique in time series forecasting in epidemiology10,38,39. The structure of an ARIMA is explained in further detail by Nau40, though we provide a summary of relevant parameters. A seasonal component is also incorporated, SARMIA, to capture periodic trends (e.g., weekly cycles in admission numbers). \((S){ARIMA}\left(p,d,{q}\right){\left[P,D,Q\right]}_{s}\) describes the model, where \(p\) is the number of autoregressive terms, past values of the time series; \(d\) is the number of differences of the time series to make the series stationary; and \(q\) is the number of lagged forecast errors included. \(P,D,Q\) and \(s\) stand respectively for seasonal autoregression, seasonal integration, seasonal moving average, and season period length. We transformed the influenza admission counts using \(\log (x+1)\) to account for the non-negative, exponential trends of the epidemic. We apply the ARIMA models implementing the Hyndman–Khandakar algorithm within the R package forecasts41 via fable42 which determine the characteristic model parameters by minimising the AIC after differencing the data. As with the GAM, we use 9 weeks of historic data to predict a 2-week trend. Regional, national and STP level trends are fit separately rather than aggregating the granular STP forecasts in a bottom-up approach. This differs from the GAM structure as we found that the non-hierarchical structure performed better for the ARIMA model; the scores for the hierarchical and non-hierarchical model can be found in the Supplementary Table 1.Baseline prophet modelTo further contextualise the performance of our GAM model we compared its performance to another alternative method commonly used in industry, Prophet, developed by Facebook43. Prophet is a time-series modelling R package44, which creates additive models of the form$${y}_{i}\left(t\right)=g\left(t\right)+s\left(t\right)+h\left(t\right)+{\epsilon }_{t},$$with \(g\left(t\right)\) defining the trend, \(s\left(t\right)\) the periodic changes (e.g. seasonality), \(h\left(t\right)\) an effect for irregularly placed holidays and \({\epsilon }_{t}\) the error term45. While the model is intended for use with business data, it has been applied to epidemic forecasting during the COVID-19 pandemic46,47, and to other diseases, such as hand, foot and mouth48. As with the GAM and ARIMA we fit the model to the past 9 weeks of data to predict the coming fortnight. We fit separately at national, regional and STP geographic levels. To account for the non-negative exponential trend, we again apply a \(\log (x+1)\) transformation to the influenza admission counts. Prophet allows for daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality—we allowed for weekly seasonality due to the daily granularity of data and sub-year length of data fit to.Model evaluationThe quality of each model was assessed by quantifying the calibration, sharpness, over and underprediction, bias, and median absolute error (MAE) of the predictions. Calibration is defined as the statistical consistency of the forecasts and true observations, for which we chose the 50% and 90% interval coverages generated from 1000 prediction samples. Bias, as well as overprediction and underprediction, refers to whether the predictions are higher or lower than the true response values. The (Weighted) interval score was chosen as it combines over and underprediction, along with sharpness, a measure of the model’s concentration of the predictive distributions-how wide its intervals are49,50. The MAE provides a more intuitive number to explain to end users of the forecast as it is in the natural units of the data presented with the forecast. Scoring metrics were implemented with the scoringutils R package50. We forecasted up to 14 days and evaluated weekly predictions to replicate a real-world application. The performance was examined from the start to end of the winter 2022-2023 seasonal epidemic wave. The predictive performance at STP, regional and national levels are examined for the \(t\in [{t}_{\max }+1,{t}_{\max }+14]\) forecast horizon, as policy decisions are often made at higher geographies. Where appropriate, we scored the predictions at \({t}_{\max }+7\) and \({t}_{\max }+14\) to highlight differences in the length of the forecast horizon in different models. The MAE and bias are reported over time for each prediction to examine the trend across the influenza season.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsInfluenza season 2022–2023The 2022–2023 influenza season saw hospital admissions in England increase rapidly at the start of November and reached a peak by the end of December, after which the number of cases admitted to hospital decreased rapidly, shown in Fig. 1. The data from the NHSE UEC SitRep suggested that the peak would have occurred between the 21 Dec 2022 and 29 Dec 2022 at ~1000 new patients per day, a period of atypical social mixing patterns. However, there were likely data reporting issues and changes to triage behaviour caused by bank holidays, which could have contributed to the decrease in cases reported within that period. From an operational perspective the timing of this peak, just before most surveillance systems were at reduced capacity makes this epidemic wave a particular challenge to forecast, as data is less timely and fewer complimentary data sources are available to validate trends. Additionally, the day of week effect observed in the data was compounded by the timing of bank holidays, for example, Christmas day fell on a Sunday, the day of the week with lowest expected admissions—reducing the clarity of the epidemic structure. The individual STP admission trends are shown in Supplementary Figs. 4–11, highlighting the variation in size of wave and consistency of reporting.Fig. 1: National influenza hospital admissions 2022-2023 season in England.Data from the National Health Service England (NHSE) Urgent and Emergency Care Situational Report, between 18 Sept 2022 and 29 Jan 2023.Full size imageWeekly forecastsSitRep dataThe national forecasts of the GAM, ARIMA and Prophet models are shown in Fig. 2, for the 2022–2023 season in weekly intervals, illustrating the performance at different phases of the epidemic wave. The national forecast shows that the GAM was quicker to identify the turning point at the peak of the epidemic wave, indicated by the forecasts starting 19 Dec 2022 to 02 Jan 2023. The ARIMA model continued the previously observed trend, as expected from an autoregressive model, causing it to overshoot at the peak, and overpredict on the subsequent decay in admissions. However, the ARIMA performance appeared strong in the initial growth phase when the growth rate is more consistent. The Prophet model too overshoots the epidemic peak and was slower to correct on the decline phase compared to the ARIMA. The prediction intervals for the GAM were generally wider than the ARIMA and substantially more than the Prophet models, which captured more overdispersion and variation in weekly reporting patterns. The central estimate of the GAM model near the epidemic peak had a better fit to the data, with reduced underpredictions in the growth phase, and smaller overprediction in the decline, despite this also being an autoregressive model. Individual STP level forecasts are given in Supplementary Figs. 12–18.Fig. 2: Weekly admissions forecasts of the influenza season in England 2022-2023.Weekly forecasts of a 14-day horizon for the GAM (bolded text), ARIMA and Prophet models. Black dots and black lines represent the true admissions on a day. The filled colours correspond to the week of forecast production.Full size imageThe superiority of the GAM extends to the regional modelling of England, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. In multiple regions the ARIMA struggles to adapt to the change in direction at the epidemic peak, such as in the South West, where consecutive forecast intervals are non-overlapping. However, the GAM model also struggled to fit the epidemic decay phase in the South West as well as other regions in the week commencing 02 Jan 2023. For some regions, such as the South East, the ARIMA model has substantially wider prediction intervals. In many weeks Prophet did not appear to fit well to the most recent (and impactful) data, such as on 09 Jan 2023, there is a large gap between the forecast \({{y}_{i}}(t_{\max }+1)\) and the data \({H}_{i}({t}_{\max }+1)\) in the South West. From 09 Jan 2023 onwards, the GAM detected a decline and reduced the width of the prediction intervals, however the ARIMA struggled to do this at a regional level, instead predicting 90% intervals that included growth, shown clearly in the Midlands. The Prophet model appeared to forecast the shape of the epidemic, though weeks after it occurs, such as in the later weeks in London. The models were fit to data of varying quality, which was illustrated by the low counts observed in London and the East of England, which were indicative of low ascertainment rates or poor reporting. The hierarchical component of the GAM allowed for the national smoother to inform the forecasts, pooling the trend from all STPs which helped to improve performance relative to the independent fits of the ARIMA and Prophet approaches.Fig. 3: Weekly admissions forecasts of the influenza season in England 2022-2023 by commissioning region.Weekly forecasts of a 14-day horizon for the GAM (bolded text), ARIMA and Prophet models. Black dots and black lines represent the true admissions on a day. The filled colours correspond to the week of forecast production. Note that the y-axis differs for each region.Full size imageAdmitted patient care dataThe ability of our GAM method to capture the epidemic trend is not limited to the rapid turnaround SitRep data used operationally for this work alone. We applied the same model to the time-lagged Admitted Patient Care influenza admissions 2022 wave to validate its ability is not just an artefact of the rapid situational report data alone. The weekly forecasts are shown in Supplementary Figs. 20, 21. The APC data for 2022 has a similar national and regional shape to the SitRep, however, the counts are higher giving a more pronounced shape. Applied to this data, the GAM captures the direction of the epidemic trend during both growth and decline, although as with the SitRep there is still overprediction at the peak, the GAM does quickly adapt.Comparative performancePerformance over timeThe out-of-sample performance for the interval score, MAE and bias are shown as the epidemic wave progresses through time for each model in Fig. 4. Across most weekly forecasts, the GAM’s bias was closer to zero than the ARIMA and Prophet. The GAM’s bias was further from zero at the very beginning and end of the time series, in early growth and decline phases where counts are lowest. The ARIMA and Prophet models underpredicted during the epidemic growth phase then switched to overprediction at the peak and beyond. This under then over prediction effect was more pronounced in the Prophet model than the simpler ARIMA. The MAE and interval score of each model is broadly consistent during the epidemic growth phase, but the scores diverged sharply at the epidemic peak, as shown in Fig. 2 where the Prophet and ARIMA models overpredicted the peak and then struggled to identify the decay phase in a timely fashion. The interval score in this case was the preferred measure of performance to account for sharpness, how concentrated the intervals are, and under/overprediction.Fig. 4: The epidemic wave and corresponding GAM, ARIMA and Prophet model performances for forecasts starting each week.Performance across a range of metrics for the GAM (red line and point) ARIMA (blue line and point) and Prophet (green line and points). a The counts (blue columns) of daily hospital admissions within the English 2022-2023 winter season. b Interval score for each week of forecasts showing the calibration over time. c Median Absolute Error for each week of forecasts showing the error over time. d Bias for each week of forecasts showing the under/overprediction over time.Full size imageForecast horizon and geographyThe hierarchical GAM introduced in this study consistently outperformed the ARIMA and Prophet models across a wide range of scoring metrics, different geographies, the whole forecast horizon, and for both \({t}_{\max }+7\) and \({t}_{\max }+14\), shown in Table 1. The national and regional forecasts were of greatest interest to public health officials—where the GAM outperformed the Prophet and ARIMA with a lower MAE and better calibration (interval score). Understanding whether the models were likely to over or under predict admissions was also important when disseminating the estimates to decision makers and for both metrics the GAM scored better than Prophet and the ARIMA at coarse geographies. Although, the ARIMA has a better underprediction score at national level for \({t}_{\max }+14\). For all geographies the \({t}_{\max }+14\) GAM outperformed the \({t}_{\max }+7\) Prophet model. The ARIMA performed best for the 50% coverage, whereas the GAM scored best for 90%—as the GAM had generally wider interval coverage particularly for \({t}_{\max }+7\). In some cases the Prophet and the ARIMA had very low coverage which indicated they overconfidently get the direction of the epidemic wrong with coverage below 0.300.Table 1 Interval score, underprediction, overprediction, absolute median error and coverage at 50% and 90% for the ARIMA, GAM and Prophet models at national, regional and STP level.Full size tableGAM spline tuningGAMs use splines to model smooth relationships between response and explanatory variables. The flexibility of splines to fit non-linearities in response variables is determined by the number of basis functions in each smoothing term, with more basis functions allowing for more non-linear relationships to be modelled, but at the increased risk of modelling noise as signal. The amount of smoothing is crucial to the model’s predictive power; therefore, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the model’s two main parameters. The performance of the different GAM parameters is shown in Fig. 5 for multiple scoring metrics and a range of days per basis spline—for the national, \({f}_{{nat}}\left(t\right)\), and STP level \({f}_{{st}{p}_{i}}\left(t\right)\) smoothers. This showed the out-of-sample performance of the forecasts were highly dependent on \({d}_{t}\) for the national smoother (more variation along the x-axis), and to a lesser extent the STP smoother (less variation along the y-axis). The best performance of the national smoother occurred at 5 days per basis function consistently, though the best score for the STP smoother varies across metrics. As the bias metric was aggregated across the forecast horizon and epidemic wave the bias shown represented the average bias, which may be near zero due to both over and under prediction over the study period. The performance for all integer numbers of basis functions td ∈ 1,7 are available in Supplementary Fig. 22 to show more granularity nearer the optimal values.Fig. 5: Scoring for a range of GAM spline parameters used to select the best performing combination.a The median absolute error (b) bias, (c) prediction interval coverage and (d) interval score metrics for combinations of different numbers of basis functions in the hierarchical GAM. Models were evaluated on held out forecasting performance for 2-week projections, each week from 10 Nov 2022 to 08 Jan 2023.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study we show that a hierarchical GAM is an effective approach to short-term forecasting of influenza hospitalisations across England, outperforming the commonly used statistical ARIMA and machine learning Prophet approach. The model performed well both at low spatial levels (STP) and higher (region and national) aggregations. The GAM is impacted less by the expected issues of an autoregressive model at an epidemic peak, was less biased over time, and had a lower interval score than Prophet and the ARIMA at both 7 and 14 days into the future. The model was sensitive to the number of basis functions in a smoother, particularly in the national component of the multi-level model, which highlighted the need for careful parameter tuning during a season.The hierarchical GAM introduced in this study had several strengths, making it a useful addition to the research in forecasting healthcare burdens due to infectious diseases. This modelling approach is easily applicable to other illnesses, does not rely on strong assumptions based on past seasonal patterns or epidemiological parameters and is robust when data quality may be low. Mechanistic models of influenza transmission and hospitalisation rely on detailed parametrisation (e.g., contact rates, infection hospitalisation rate, incubation, and infectious period) and particular initial conditions (e.g., susceptible population, current prevalence), which this approach avoids. Exploring the pairwise combinations of different parameters and scenarios is computationally costly and contentious, as those providing model evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic can attest51. By taking a data-driven semi-mechanistic approach, we principally depend on subtle signals at fine spatial scales to detect upcoming changes in rates, and the computational efficiency of our method allows for weekly updates to projections in a highly localised level. The computational requirements of these models are low compared to mechanistic models; they can be run on a standard laptop producing forecasts in under 15 minutes. From receiving the data to sharing the analysis with decision makers, the main time limitations are the quality assurance and dissemination, rather than the time to produce outputs.By limiting the forecast horizon to 14-days this model avoids overextrapolation while still having high predictive performance and meeting the needs of policy makers. The spatial structure of the model, correlating adjacent STPs, and pooling the temporal trends through the hierarchical structure allows the model to detect the slowing growth rate near the peak of a wave, taking advantage of the spatial variation in influenza peak times52. The explicit encoding of a nested random effect for the day-of-week effect allows the capturing of reporting and presentation patterns which the independent spatial structures of the ARIMA and Prophet models struggle to capture. Due to the nature of basis functions, the GAM is impacted most severely by the most recent data fit to, allowing it to capture short-term changes, such as a recent epidemic peak and changes in growth rate.While the motivation of the structure of this model was to suit the policy needs and NHS SitRep data supplied, this approach is generalisable to data rich surveillance systems. We showed in Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21 that this model approach works well on an alternative data set, the retrospective Admitted Patient Care. Although, further improvements could be made retuning the basis function parameters specifically for this data. The APC data is higher quality (due to the financial incentives and time delay involved) than the SitRep, especially at fine spatial scales, with less stochastic noise associated. Tuning the model’s main parameters to this data would increase its predictive performance by selecting the spline lengths that best characterise the change in growth/decay of the wave, which would match the assumption of constant growth rates better. Evaluation of a probabilistic forecast is crucial to the operational use of a model. We employed robust scoring rules53, particularly the interval score, to show the model calibration and out-of-sample performance in an unbiased and consistent way for quantile forecasts53,54.While this study introduced a newly developed and clearly effective technique for forecasting infectious disease hospitalisations—there were challenges associated with the approach. The reliance on fast turnaround granular situational report data sources were crucial to short term forecasting, however these can often have data quality issues requiring ad hoc fixes. Without these corrections a spline-based model may over interpret inaccurate signals, which can cause incorrect predictions due to the responsiveness of the splines. When deploying a modelling approach at the beginning of a novel epidemic season it cannot be known what the optimal parameter values over the whole wave will be, though consistent scoring with each new week of data helped mitigate this issue. What we cannot know until the next influenza season is whether this method performed well because of the pronounced epidemic shape of the influenza wave, which presented a clear growth then decay phase. Forecasting a season with a longer flatter plateau or several phases of growth and decay could be more challenging for this method, but the spatial and hierarchical components should aid model performance. Future work should apply this method to future seasons which will have different shapes to validate these results. This is not possible to do for historic waves as there are no high coverage test-positive daily admissions data sets in England pre-2021. The prediction intervals of this method are wide, which does introduce challenges for policy decisions, though this is also the case for the ARIMA model. An improved method for aggregating uncertainty from low level prediction samples could improve model confidence. However, as is evidenced by the performance of the Prophet model, projections with thin prediction intervals, but highly inaccurate predictions, could falsely give policy makers confidence in incorrect forecasts. Furthermore, the evaluation of this approach could be improved by incorporating the exponential structure into the scoring metrics55. Now that there has been a seasonal influenza wave, the time invariant spatial components of this epidemic wave, such as population demographics and geographic features should be explored and incorporated for the next season. In addition, the inclusion of leading indicators such as community testing, syndromic surveillance, or age structures, could improve the predictive performance and confidence of the model. Although, this does increase the complexity of the approach and number of dependencies required for real-time forecasting.A core assumption of our model is that the estimated growth rate at the end of the observed time series holds for the following 2 weeks. However, naively calculated growth rates using poorly penalised splines, which often display overfitting behaviour for extrapolation tasks, will confound across this forecast horizon resulting in inaccurate predictions. The strength of our method is to disaggregate to a sensible spatial scale, to allow for differences in the timing and magnitude of changes to growth rates at the local scale to be reflected in estimates for other geographies (through the hierarchical terms in the model). Our analysis has shown this has clear performance benefits over other methods. However, ideally the model would anticipate and include changes to the growth rate that occur within the projected 2-week interval. This could be achieved by including leading indicators of influenza admissions which could reflect upcoming changes in growth rate before they were reflected in admissions, as has been shown for models of COVID-19 admission56.In this study we have introduced a newly developed method for short-term forecasting of influenza admission waves, applied in real time during the England 2022–2023 influenza season. The hierarchical structure, spatial components, and spline-based approach to capturing epidemic trends were shown to substantially out-perform commonly used time-series approaches across a range of scoring metrics and forecast horizons. The hierarchical GAM shown is simple to apply relying only on past time series and open-source reference data, without strong assumptions on population immunity levels, vaccinations, or disease strains. The hierarchical and spatial components allow the model to perform well at peak times comparatively to a purely autoregressive models by adding epidemic relevant domain knowledge. Further study into age structures of disease and leading indicators would perhaps improve model confidence, while coming at the cost of simplicity.

Unfortunately, avian influenza (“bird flu”) is encroaching on the icy continent. The virus has already reached the sub-Antarctic islands between the Antarctic Peninsula and South America. It’s only a matter of time before it reaches the Antarctic continent. So far avian influenza has been detected in several seabird species on South Georgia Island and the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands. These birds are known to travel to Antarctica. Researchers also suspect avian influenza caused mass deaths of southern elephant seals. The arrival of avian influenza in Antarctica could have potentially catastrophic consequences for the wildlife, decimating large populations. Antarctic avian influenza outbreaks may also disrupt tourism and research activities during the busy summer season. So what can we do during this challenging time? Read more: Migrating birds could bring lethal avian flu to Australia's vulnerable birds The bird flu pandemic We are in the midst of a “panzootic” – a large-scale pandemic of avian influenza, which is occurring across the world and has affected more than 200 species of wild birds. While this strain of avian influenza (H5N1) is an old foe, the genetics and epidemiology of the virus have shifted. Once mostly found in poultry, it is now infecting large numbers of wild birds. Migrating birds have spread the virus with substantial outbreaks now occurring in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America. Avian influenza has devastated seabird populations around the world, including a 70% reduction of northern gannets on Bass Rock in the United Kingdom. Many birds are diseased, with signs including loss of coordination, watery eyes, head twisting, breathing distress or lethargy. Beyond birds, this virus may have killed more than 30,000 South American sea lions and over 2,500 southern elephant seal pups in South America. In South Georgia mass deaths have been observed in elephant seal pups but the virus was not detected in samples sent for laboratory tests. Bird flu has been implicated in the deaths of sea lions and elephant seals in South America. Here experts from Peru’s National Forestry and Wildlife Service (Serfor) are examining a dead sea lion on a beach in Peru earlier this year. EPA/Serfor Perú Read more: Invasive species are threatening Antarctica's fragile ecosystems as human activity grows and the world warms Bird flu moving further south The first detection of avian influenza near Antarctica occurred in early October on Bird Island, South Georgia, in brown skuas (seabirds similar to large gulls). A case on the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands was confirmed a few weeks later in another seabird species, the southern fulmar. Genetic analysis revealed the virus entered these regions on two separate occasions. Skuas and kelp gulls were highlighted as species most likely to spread the virus to the Antarctic continent in a recent risk assessment, as they travel into the region from South America. They are also highly susceptible to avian influenza, with related species in the Northern Hemisphere suffering losses of more than 60%. What does this mean for Antarctica? The Antarctic Peninsula, with its ice-free areas, is an important breeding ground for many key Antarctic species. Critically, those species – and others, including the iconic Emperor penguin – live in dense colonies and are not found elsewhere in the world, making them particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Outbreaks on the Antarctic Peninsula will also be extremely disruptive to the tourism industry. More than 104,000 people visited as tourists in the 2022–23 season. People visit to see wildlife, make a continental landing, and enjoy the scenery. Once avian influenza is confirmed at a particular location, sites will be closed to tourists. This will lead to a different experience for visitors, with land-based wildlife encounters pivoting to cruise-based activities. Adelie penguins at Paulet Island, Antarctica. Megan Dewar, Author provided (no reuse) What are we doing? The Antarctic Wildlife Health Network of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research has developed recommendations for the research and tourism communities. These recommendations include information around biosecurity, testing and reporting of cases. The network’s database collates information on suspected and confirmed cases of the H5N1 avian influenza strain in the Antarctic region. This is central to rapid data sharing. During the 2022–23 season, a small number of researchers tested suspected cases and conducted surveys, which excluded the presence of avian influenza. This year, through the generosity of industry partners, we will dramatically expand this effort. The network will conduct surveys across the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic to monitor the presence and impact of the virus on wildlife. Safety and biosecurity measures have been boosted across the scientific community and tourism industry to reduce the risk of people spreading the virus. This should ensure essential scientific research and tourism activities can continue safely. New measures now in place include: disinfection of boots and outer clothing wearing of N95 masks, protective glasses and gloves when working with wildlife restrictions on access to infected sites. Tourism can play an important role in detecting and monitoring the spread of the virus, alerting authorities to new cases in locations not visited by scientists. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators is on high alert. Extra training for field staff will help them identify wildlife illness quickly. Antarctica is connected Many threats to Antarctica – including climate change, pollution, and pathogens – originate elsewhere. Climate change is expected to increase the spread of infectious diseases in wildlife and Antarctica is not immune. Disease surveillance and information sharing between all those active in the far south are vital to help minimise the impacts of avian influenza and future disease threats. The avian influenza example highlights the connectivity of our world, and why we need to care for the planet at home in order to protect the far south.

De Bellis, Research Hospital, Castellana Grotte, Italy Introduction: Patients with chronic liver disease are highly prone to acquiring influenza infection diseases and experiencing associated complications. National and international guidelines recommend the influenza vaccine for patients with liver disorders to reduce the risk of influenza complications. Our study aims to evaluate the risk of flu complications faced by patients with liver disease and assess influenza vaccination coverage. Methods: The archive of hospital discharge forms was used to define the list of Apulian patients with liver disease, considering data from 2017 through 2022. The vaccination status of these patients was assessed via data collected from the Regional Immunization Database. We focused on influenza vaccine shots administered during the 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23 flu seasons. Results: A declining trend across the flu seasons was observed, with a VC of 49.5% in the 2020/21 flu season, 48.1% in the 2021/22 season, and 45.0% in the 2022/23 season. Subjects with multiple comorbidities have higher vaccination rates. Additionally, the multivariate models demonstrate that vaccination compliance increases with age and is strongly associated with having received a previous influenza vaccine shot. Conclusion: The VC rates reported in our study are unsatisfactory and did not reach the minimum achievable goal (75%) the Italian Ministry of Health set. A multifactorial approach is required to raise the immunization rates and therefore protect the patients from the influenza-associated risk of collateral liver damage; the role of gastroenterologists and hepatologists is crucial, as their responsibilities should extend beyond patient care to the prevention of complications after infectious diseases. Introduction Individuals with liver disease are more susceptible to infections due to various pathophysiological mechanisms. These mechanisms include intestinal dysbiosis, increased bacterial translocation, portosystemic shunting, and cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction is a complex condition characterized by dysregulation of both the adaptive and innate immune systems and continuous immune system activation. Additionally, factors such as malnutrition and the use of immunosuppressive medications in liver transplant recipients contribute to a heightened risk of infections in patients with liver disease (1). Consequently, patients with chronic liver disease are highly prone to acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and experiencing associated complications. In particular, influenza infection is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with liver disease. A global pooled analysis in 2009 revealed that individuals with liver disease infected with the 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1) had a 5-fold higher likelihood of hospitalization due to influenza-related complications and a 17-fold higher mortality risk than healthy individuals (2). A multicenter study conducted between 2013 and 2014 reported a two-fold increased risk of hospitalization, specifically for influenza virus in patients with liver disease (3). Moreover, influenza infection can lead to hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis (4). The influenza vaccine can help mitigate the risk of such complications. A prospective multicenter study in 2018, conducted on liver transplant recipients, showed that individuals who received the influenza vaccine were less likely to develop pneumonia or require admission to the intensive care unit if they contracted laboratory-confirmed influenza A (5). Due to the high risk of severe health complications from influenza infection, individuals with liver disease are often the target of influenza vaccination policies. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) both recommend the influenza vaccine for patients with liver disorders to reduce the risk of influenza complications (6, 7). In Italy, at the beginning of each flu season, the Italian Ministry of Health determines the categories considered at higher risk of influenza complications based on recommendations from international public health institutions. Influenza vaccination is actively and freely offered to these high-risk categories, including individuals with underlying conditions that increase the risk of influenza-related complications, such as liver diseases. The vaccination coverage (VC) objectives in Italy were set as follows: a minimum achievable goal of 75% and an optimal goal of 95%. These goals indicate the desired percentage of the population within the target categories that should receive the influenza vaccine (8). However, despite these recommendations, low vaccine coverage is reported among Italian patients with liver disease. Stroffolini et al. (9) focused on the 2020/21 flu season and reported an overall vaccine coverage of 39.6% among cirrhotic patients. The coverage was higher in individuals older than 64 years (51.9%) and lower in those younger than 65 years (26.9%). In a 2023 study evaluating VC in patients with liver disorders aged 6 months to 64 years living in Puglia, southern Italy, during the 2020/21 flu season, a coverage rate of 24% was reported (10). Our study aims to assess the vaccination coverage (VC) of the flu vaccine in patients with liver disease living in Puglia, Southern Italy (4,000,000 inhabitants), and track the trend from the 2020/21 flu season to the 2022/23 flu season. The estimation of VC enables us to determine the proportion of individuals at risk of flu complications and assess any measures necessary to mitigate this risk. Methods This is a retrospective observational study. The study population was identified using the archive of hospital discharge forms (SDO) from Castellana Grotte “De Bellis” research and treatment hospital specializing in gastroenterological diseases. This database contains all information on hospital and inpatient procedures (10). We included all records related to cirrhosis (ICD9 codes 571.5, 571.2), liver disease (ICD9 codes: 571.49, 573.3, 570, 571.1, 070.1, 070, 571.49, 571.40, 573.3, 573.8, 572.0), hemochromatosis (ICD9 code: 275.0), Pompe disease (ICD9 code: 271.0), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ICD9 code: 273.4), steatosis (ICD9 code: 571.8), Wilson’s disease (ICD9 code: 275.1), Budd-Chiari syndrome (ICD9 code: 453.0), and hepato-cholangio- carcinoma (ICD9 codes: 155.0, 155.1), extending our search to all procedures performed from 2017 to 2022. We only considered subjects living in Apulia. The influenza vaccination status of patients was assessed using the Regional Immunization Database (GIAVA) (10). We focused on influenza vaccine shots administered during the 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23 flu seasons. The Edotto platform (Exprivia, Apulia, Italy) was used to identify deceased individuals in Apulia from 2017 to 2023, to exclude subjects who died before the start of each flu season. Information on chronic diseases was obtained from the SDO archive to characterize our sample further. Ten comorbidities were defined: chronic lung diseases, cardiopathies, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases, chronic renal failure/adrenal insufficiency, hematopathies and hemoglobinopathies, tumors, HIV and immunodepression, chronic inflammatory diseases and bowel malabsorption syndromes, multiple pathologies, and dementia. These data sources were extracted and matched using the patients’ unique identification numbers (PINs). The final dataset was created as an Excel spreadsheet that included sex, age at the start of influenza vaccination campaigns, number of comorbidities, and influenza vaccine administration before the 2020/21, 2021/22, and 2022/23 flu seasons. Anonymized data analysis was performed using STATA MP18 software. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation and range, categorical variables are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) where applicable. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to analyze the factors associated with receiving a dose of flu vaccine prior to at least one of the analyzed flu seasons, with sex (male vs. female), age (in years), and the number of comorbidities as determinants. Another model was built to evaluate the association between influenza vaccine uptake before the 2022/23 influenza season and having received at least one flu shot before the previous seasons, adjusted for sex, age, and the number of comorbidities. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were calculated. The Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-squared test was used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the multivariate logistic regression models. A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Results The process of sample selection in the study is depicted in Figure 1. The initial sample of eligible subjects before the 2020/21 flu season comprised 1,574 individuals with liver disease. In the 2021/22 season, the sample size decreased to 1,423 subjects; in the 2022/23 season, it further decreased to 1,325 subjects. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Sample size computation. The characteristics of the study samples are detailed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Table 1. Characteristics of the sample. Our samples’ VC demonstrated a declining trend across the flu seasons, as illustrated in Figure 2. Among the subjects, 936 individuals (59.5%; 95%CI = 57.0–61.9%) received at least one dose of the vaccine over the three flu seasons. Overall, 441 patients (28.0%; 95% CI = 25.8–30.3%) received the flu shot prior to all three seasons analyzed, 242 (15.4%; 95% CI = 13.6–17.3%) received the vaccine before two seasons, 253 (16.1%; 95% CI = 14.3–18.0%) received it prior to one season, and 638 (40.5%; 95% CI = 38.1–43.0%) never received a flu shot. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Influenza vaccine coverage in patients with liver disease. 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23 flu seasons. The values of VC, stratified per age class, and number of comorbidities are reported in Table 2. TABLE 2 Table 2. Influenza vaccine coverage in patients with liver disease, per several characteristics. The logistic multivariate regression analysis indicated that older age (aOR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.04–1.06) and having three or more comorbidities (aOR = 2.24; 95%CI = 1.51–3.23) were associated with receiving a flu shot prior to at least one flu season. The other factors examined did not demonstrate a significant association with the outcome (p > 0.05; Table 3). TABLE 3 Table 3. Analysis of the determinants of a flu shot prior to at least one flu season in a logistic multivariate regression model. Having received at least one flu shot prior to the 2020/21 and 2021/22 flu seasons appeared to be a strong predictor of receiving a flu shot prior to the 2022/23 influenza season (aOR = 26.31; 95% CI = 18.18–38.08; Table 4). TABLE 4 Table 4. Analysis of determinants of receiving a dose of influenza vaccine during the 2022/23 influenza season in a logistic multivariate regression model. Conclusion Our study revealed a vaccination coverage (VC) rate in our subgroup population ranging from 45 to 50% across the flu seasons. The highest VC value was observed during the 2020/21 season, which can be attributed to the co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and the vigorous promotion of influenza vaccination as an essential public health measure. This was particularly important considering the strain on healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and promoting influenza vaccination helped mitigate the crisis’s health effects and social consequences. However, these VC values did not reach the minimum achievable goal (75%) the Italian Ministry of Health set. Previous studies on cirrhotic patients in Italy have reported low VC rates, with an overall VC of 39.6% in 2019, lower in people younger than 65 years of age (26.9%) compared to those 65 years and older (51.9%; p-value < 0.001) (9). Another study published in 2023 reported a VC of 24.0% among Apulian patients with liver disease aged 6 months to 64 years during the 2020/21 flu season (10). A study in Austria conducted in 2021 on 516 patients found that 43.9% of them expressed willingness to be vaccinated before the 2020/2021 flu season, compared to VC rates of 25.4 and 27.3% in the 2019/2020 and 2016/2018 flu seasons, respectively. These values align with our findings, as higher VC rates were observed among patients 65 years and older (57–63%), while lower rates were recorded in younger subjects (26–30%) (11). The analyzed data show that subjects with multiple comorbidities have higher vaccination rates, as confirmed by the multivariate regression model. This finding is consistent with other studies in the literature (10). Additionally, the multivariate models demonstrate that vaccination compliance increases with age and is strongly associated with having received a previous influenza vaccine shot. A 2021 study on liver transplant patients further supported the association between flu shot uptake and previous influenza vaccination history, reporting an aOR of 20 (95% CI = 8–52) (11). This finding is consistent with several other studies in the literature that also demonstrate this association among various high-risk subgroups (12, 13). In summary, our study highlights the need for more significant efforts to achieve higher VC in this population subgroup. It should be noted that liver disease progression is associated with immune dysregulation, and complications from influenza can result in significant morbidity and mortality, making vaccination a priority for these individuals regardless of age. Although not directly targeting the liver, influenza infection can cause collateral liver damage, such as mild and self-limiting hepatitis, and trigger hepatic decompensation in liver disease (4, 14). Furthermore, a 2019 study identified influenza infection as a trigger for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), occurring in almost every fifth patient with liver cirrhosis hospitalized due to influenza infection. The study reported that influenza infection led to organ failures, secondary infections, and death, emphasizing the importance of influenza vaccination in this population (15). Several factors contribute to the low VC values, including a lack of prevention culture among patients, challenges in implementing effective and clear vaccine communication and promotion campaigns by government and public health institutions, fear of adverse events following immunization, and unfounded concerns about worsening clinical conditions after vaccination, all of which contribute to vaccine hesitancy. It is crucial to emphasize the role of physicians, particularly gastroenterologists, and hepatologists, as patients often rely on them as trusted sources of information (9–11). They are responsible for recommending vaccination to protect patients from serious flu complications. Therefore, physicians must receive adequate training and stay updated on seasonal flu vaccine recommendations. Solid evidence supports influenza vaccination’s safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness in patients with liver disease. A 2019 meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with liver disease mount an efficient antibody response to influenza vaccination, reducing hospital admission risk (from 205/1,000 to 149/1,000, risk difference −0.06, 95%CI = −0.07 to 0.04). Vaccinated patients were 27% less likely to be admitted to the hospital than unvaccinated patients (risk ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.66–0.80) (16). The strength of our study lies in its investigation of a topic that has received limited attention in the literature, employing a large sample size and examining data from three flu seasons. The study design allowed us to assess the cause-effect relationship between vaccine uptake and various determinants. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the data sources were initially established for administrative purposes rather than epidemiological research, which introduces the potential for bias. Furthermore, the data sources used in our study do not allow further analysis of vaccine effectiveness or surveillance of adverse events following immunization in this population. Future studies should consider evaluating the role of other vaccines, such as the anti-pneumococcal vaccine, and assessing vaccine coverage values over multiple influenza seasons and with larger sample sizes. The VC rates reported in our study are unsatisfactory, and similar findings have been observed among other infectious high-risk subgroups in Apulia. According to the PASSI survey, the VC among Apulian individuals aged 18–64 years with at least one chronic disease was 38.6% during the 2019/2020 influenza season (17). A study conducted in 2023 on 1,576 splenectomized patients in Apulia showed an influenza VC of 49% for at least one flu shot after splenectomy (18). These results emphasize the need for enhanced immunization strategies to improve vaccination coverage in this subset of patients. A multifactorial approach is required, involving coordination among various healthcare workers involved in the care of patients with liver disease, including general practitioners, public health physicians, and specialists. In this regard, the role of gastroenterologists and hepatologists is crucial, as their responsibilities should extend beyond patient care to the prevention of complications after infectious diseases. The exacerbation and decompensation of a chronic patient lead to increased hospitalizations and workload for specialists, a worsening clinical picture, and additional costs for the community. Hospital facilities should also be involved in immunization strategies by actively offering vaccination prophylaxis to chronic patients, as this has been a successful strategy described in several studies in the literature (19, 20). In conclusion, preventing infectious risks in patients with liver disease must be integrated into their treatment pathways. Reducing the risk of complications leads to better patient management, improved quality of life, and better responses to treatments and care. By prioritizing influenza vaccination in this vulnerable population, we can significantly reduce the incidence of influenza-related hospitalizations, mortality, and liver-related complications.

(Photo Credit: (DOD Photo by Jimell Sanders)) VIEW ORIGINAL FALLS CHURCH, Va. – An annual tradition continued on Oct. 11-12 when the Defense Health Headquarters, DHHQ, held its annual Influenza Vaccination Fair and immunized hundreds against influenza and COVID-19. An annual flu vaccination can keep an individual from getting sick with influenza and can reduce the risk of serious flu-related complications and hospitalizations. A total of 554 flu shots were administered over the two-day fair at DHHQ. Most people received a standard dose of this year’s flu vaccine, and eligible people 65 or older received a high-dose formulation, which contains four times the antigen, the substance that triggers immune response, of a standard flu vaccine dose. “Public Health is predicated on preventing illnesses or injuries before they happen,” said Mr. Sean Friendly, deputy director of DHA Public Health, who received his flu vaccination at the event. “Getting a yearly flu vaccine is a great practice to promote public health and wellness.” U.S. Public Health Service Rear. Adm. Brandon Taylor, director of DHA Public Health, visited the event to personally administer vaccines for the second straight year and was also immunized. He expressed his gratitude to the Mobile Vaccination Team of 59 technicians from Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir who conducted the event. “Everyone worked together to accomplish a great thing here,” Taylor said. “Giving people the protection they need against serious disease threats like the flu and COVID-19 is essential to preserving our health and force readiness.” The Mobile Vaccination Team also administered 100 doses of the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine. “We face the threat of serious respiratory illnesses every year around this time,” said U.S. Public Health Service Capt. John Iskander, Chief, DHA Immunization Healthcare Division, referring to flu, COVID-19, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). “Vaccines are the most important tool we have to protect people from these threats.” Read more about the importance of vaccines to prevent serious illness and where you can get your flu and COVID vaccines here.

Panels are derived from structures reported by Simmons et al., (PDB 7TRH, 7RRI and 3UBE by Xu et al., for the model of receptor engagement). view more Credit: Kevin McCarthy (CC-BY 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) Researchers have identified a previously unrecognized class of antibodies—immune system proteins that protect against disease—that appear capable of neutralizing multiple forms of flu virus. These findings, which could contribute to development of more broadly protective flu vaccines, will publish December 21st by Holly Simmons of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, US, and colleagues in the open access journal PLOS Biology. A flu vaccine prompts the immune system to make antibodies that can bind to a viral protein called hemagglutinin on the outside of an invading flu virus, blocking it from entering a person’s cells. Different antibodies bind to different parts of hemagglutinin in different ways, and hemagglutinin itself evolves over time, resulting in the emergence of new flu strains that can evade old antibodies. New flu vaccines are offered each year based on predictions of whatever the most dominant strains will be. Extensive research efforts are paving the way to development of flu vaccines that are better at protecting against multiple strains at once. Many scientists are focused on antibodies that can simultaneously protect against flu subtypes known as H1 and H3, which come in multiple strains and are responsible for widespread infection. Simmons and colleagues homed in on a particular challenge in this endeavor—a small change found in some H1 strains in the sequence of building blocks that makes up hemagglutinin. Certain antibodies capable of neutralizing H3 can also neutralize H1, but not if its hemagglutinin has this change, known as the 133a insertion. Now, in a series of experiments conducted with blood samples from patients, the researchers have identified a novel class of antibodies capable of neutralizing both certain H3 strains and certain H1 strains with or without the 133a insertion. Distinct molecular characteristics set these antibodies apart from other antibodies capable of cross-neutralizing H1 and H3 strains via other means. This research expands the list of antibodies that could potentially contribute to development of a flu virus that achieves broader protection through an assortment of molecular mechanisms. It also adds to growing evidence supporting a move away from flu vaccines grown in chicken eggs—currently the most common manufacturing approach. The authors add, “We need annual influenza virus vaccines to keep pace with continuing viral evolution. Our work suggests that the barriers to eliciting more broadly protective immunity may be surprisingly low. Given the right series of influenza virus exposures/vaccinations, it is possible to for humans to mount robust antibody responses that neutralize divergent H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, opening new avenues to design improved vaccines.” ##### In your coverage, please use this URL to provide access to the freely available paper in PLOS Biology: http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002415 Citation: Simmons HC, Watanabe A, Oguin III TH, Van Itallie ES, Wiehe KJ, Sempowski GD, et al.

Circulating flu viruses constantly mutate, so "we need annual influenza virus vaccines to keep pace with continuing viral evolution," the researchers behind the discovery said in a statement. "Our work suggests that the barriers to eliciting more broadly protective immunity may be surprisingly low," they said. There are four types of flu virus, known as influenza A, B, C and D, with A and B being responsible for the seasonal flu epidemics in the U.S. every year. Influenza A comes in many subtypes whose differences lie in two proteins that the virus uses to infect our cells: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). For example, H1N1 and H3N2 are subtypes of influenza A that routinely infect people. Within each subtype are different "strains" that constantly tweak their genetic code. For example, a strain of H1N1 is currently the dominant virus causing flu in the U.S. Influenza B, meanwhile, is divided into two lineages — Yamagata and Victoria — and is typically responsible for a much smaller proportion of flu cases.Making effective flu shots relies on harnessing the protective power of antibodies — immune proteins that attack invading pathogens — but the virus' ability to quickly mutate makes this challenging. Flu vaccines prime the immune system to produce specific antibodies that latch onto a flu virus and prevent it from infecting cells after it invades the body. However, these vaccines are formulated to target specific strains, and because those strains mutate year over year, people then need a new flu shot each year to keep up.

The research was conducted only in the lab, so the scientists aren't sure exactly how these antibodies contribute to the body's flu shot response. However, one day, these antibodies could be used to develop vaccines that are more effective at protecting people from multiple strains of flu at the same time. To guard against influenza A, conventional flu vaccines usually prompt the immune system to produce antibodies against the H protein on the surface of the virus. Antibodies have previously been discovered that target two main types of hemagglutinin, called H1 and H3, at the same time. However, they can only do this if there is a specific mutation in H1, namely the insertion of an amino acid in the outer edge of the protein that binds to a receptor on the outside of our cells. This consequently limits the antibodies' efficacy against different flavors of flu virus. Through lab experiments, the study authors identified antibodies that are abundant in human blood and can bind to certain H1 and H3 strains of influenza A, whether or not this hemagglutinin mutation is present. This means that they'd theoretically be able to provide broad protection against both subtypes of virus, potentially even as circulating strains mutate over time. The authors also looked at how well these antibodies targeted strains of H1 and H3 that have circulated in the past. The antibodies reacted with H3 strains from the late 1980s to late 1990s and H1 strains from the early 2000s through to 2015. This suggests the patients whose blood was sampled originally made the antibodies in response to H3 strains of the virus. Then, after a later exposure to H1 strains at a later date through either infection or vaccination, the antibodies became primed to target H1 as well. RELATED STORIES—When should you get a flu shot?

"Given the right series of influenza virus exposures/vaccinations, it is possible for humans to mount robust antibody responses that neutralize divergent H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, opening new avenues to design improved vaccines," the authors said in the statement. In other words, there may be a way to ensure vaccines trigger the production of these broad-acting antibodies, to ensure the shots guard against both subtypes of the virus equally well.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

How to protect yourself and loved ones this season | University of Chicago News Is it COVID, flu, or allergies? How to protect yourself and loved ones this season Dec 21, 2023 Dr. Allison Bartlett answers commonly asked questions about RSV, vaccines, and testing Flu season is here once again. And many questions have formed over the last couple of years about how you can stay safe from both the influenza (flu) and COVID-19 viruses, as well as how to tell if your symptoms may be caused by seasonal allergies or a different virus instead. UChicago Medicine infectious diseases experts are here to help address your concerns and offer up some key advice on how to stay safe this season. Below, Allison Bartlett, professor at University of Chicago Medicine and associate medical director of pediatric infection control, answers commonly asked questions. Does COVID-19 or influenza pose a greater risk for people this season? Either virus can make you very sick or lead to death, which is why it’s essential to get vaccinated and also to avoid close contact with others when sick. There are definitely populations that are more at risk for severe complications from each infection. Older adults and people with chronic underlying health conditions seem to be much more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19. And kids, especially infants under 1, and pregnant women are more likely to have severe infections with influenza. Does having COVID-19 give you any antibodies against a respiratory virus like the flu? Unfortunately not. Having one virus does not protect you from the other. How can you tell if you have the flu, COVID-19, seasonal allergies or a different virus? The best way to tell what kind of respiratory virus you have is to get tested. Symptoms can be nearly impossible to tell apart. This is especially true between COVID-19 and the flu, with the notable exception that some people with COVID-19 lose their sense of taste and smell. Add in the fact that people can have one of these two viruses without symptoms, and it’s basically impossible to tell one from the other on your own. Testing determines the best treatment for your symptoms and how long you should stay home from work or school. The good news is that many health care providers who are doing coronavirus tests should be able to test you for the flu at the same time. There are many other viruses that can cause respiratory symptoms, so even if you test negative for COVID and flu, you should practice good respiratory hygiene: cover your cough, throw tissues away after use, wash your hands frequently. What steps can you take to avoid getting COVID-19 and the flu? Many of the steps we take to protect ourselves from the coronavirus are the same things we need to do to keep us safe from influenza. The most important thing you can do to keep yourself and those around you safe from both viruses is to stay up-to-date on your COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. You should get a flu shot even if you’ve already had the flu this season. The vaccine prevents against four different strains of the virus and we expect at least one more (Flu B) to be circulating later this season. Practicing these good habits is also a great way to stay healthy: If you’re feeling ill, keep your distance from others and avoid close contact with those who may have COVID-19 or the flu. Wash your hands often to prevent the spread of the virus. Cover your mouth when sneezing and keep from rubbing your eyes, mouth and nose. Will the flu shot protect me against the coronavirus? The flu shot can help prevent people from becoming sick from influenza but won’t provide specific protection against COVID-19. And the COVID-19 vaccine alone will not prevent you from getting the flu. It is strongly recommended that you receive both vaccines for maximum protection. Can Tamiflu or the flu shot treat COVID-19? Tamiflu or a flu shot will not directly treat or lessen the symptoms of COVID-19. But you can get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, which can help prevent an infection and lessen severity. And if you get sick with influenza or have been exposed to it, you can take antiviral medication like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to prevent getting sick. COVID-19 treatment options are available and vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and health history. Antiviral treatments can help prevent the virus from spreading and avoid serious illness. What should you do if you develop influenza or COVID-19 symptoms? If you have any symptoms, stay home, stay away from other people and try to isolate yourself to prevent the spread to others. Try to get tested within 48 hours of the start of your symptoms. If it’s influenza, your health care provider can prescribe medication to help your symptoms improve faster. If it’s COVID-19, your health care provider may recommend one of the treatment options referenced above. Will the pneumonia vaccine protect me against the flu or COVID-19? The pneumonia vaccine helps protect against a variety of bacteria that can cause bacterial pneumonia. The pneumonia vaccine won’t prevent flu or COVID-19, but it can help prevent complications that may come after. Can I boost my immune systems to protect against flu or COVID-19? We wish there were a list of things we could do to help our immune systems prevent us from getting sick with the flu or the coronavirus. But there’s no magic immune-boosting drug — only vaccination. Instead, focus on eating a healthy, varied diet and getting enough sleep. Also, make sure you’ve got any chronic medical conditions under control. Can I do anything to decrease my chance of getting very sick if I’ve been exposed? Once an exposure to COVID-19 has happened, there’s not a lot we can do to modify who gets sick from it. If you have been exposed to influenza, your physician may give you some medication like Relenza (zanamivir), Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Rapivab (peramivir) within 48 hours of exposure. However, the best thing you can do is focus on avoiding exposure. Are there new RSV vaccines available for adults? In 2023, there are finally ways to protect infants and loved ones from RSV during virus season. Nirsevimab is a newly-approved, one-time injection that provides immediate protection to infants 0 to 8 months old and reduces risk of RSV-related hospitalization significantly. All infants born at Comer Children’s and Ingalls Memorial during RSV season will be offered this injection. Infants less that 8 months old at the start of RSV season can receive nirsevimab from their pediatrician and it can be given along with other routine immunizations. UChicago Medicine is also offering two newly approved RSV vaccinations to eligible adults. A vaccine known as Abrysvo is available to pregnant individuals between their 32nd and 36th weeks. UChicago Medicine patients over 60 can also receive an RSV vaccine known as Arexvy. These adult vaccinations are available during physician office visits and both provide key protection for those at highest risk of severe RSV symptoms.

Characterizing influenza type A and B virus genomes through whole-genome nanopore sequencing 18 Dec 2023 Written by Oxford Nanopore Company news Microbiology PCR and sequencing Whole-genome studies Influenza is a global health concern, due to annual epidemics of the disease and its potential to cause a pandemic with novel strain variants. Whole-genome sequencing enables ongoing surveillance and identification of new emergent strains, and can therefore provide information to inform the development of seasonal vaccines. There are two main strains of influenza virus, A and B, that are responsible for seasonal epidemics. This overview describes how to generate accurate whole-genome sequences of influenza A and B viruses by PCR amplification and multiplexed nanopore sequencing. This protocol can be used to sequence up to 96 samples in a single sequencing run and provides rapid access to results.

For the test-negative case-control study, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network Collaborators examined the association between maternal flu vaccination and severe disease among 3,764 infants younger than 6 months at seven pediatric care centers in seven states during the 2016-17 through 2019-20 flu seasons. The researchers noted that flu during pregnancy is tied to severe maternal disease and may be linked to poor birth outcomes such as preterm birth, fetuses small for their gestational age, and miscarriage. Infants aren't eligible for flu vaccination until they are 6 months old. "Maternal immune responses to influenza vaccine during pregnancy are comparable to those of nonpregnant adults, and the transfer of influenza antibodies, either naturally acquired or vaccine induced, from mother to fetus is highly efficient," they wrote. Protection highest in youngest babies Among the 3,764 infants, 53% were born to mothers who received the flu vaccine during pregnancy, including 42% of 223 flu-positive infants and 54% of 3,541 flu-negative controls. Overall, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of maternal vaccination against flu-related ED visits or hospitalizations in infants was 34%. Maternal flu vaccination was 19% effective against infant ED visits, 39% against infant hospitalization, 25% against influenza A, and 47% against influenza B in infants. By subtype, VE was 39% and 16% against the H1N1 and H3N2 strains, respectively. VE was 53% among infants younger than 3 months, 52% among those whose mothers were vaccinated in the third trimester, and 17% in those whose mothers were vaccinated in the first or second trimester. Among 223 infants with flu, 28% had retractions (pulling in between the ribs), and 10% had wheezing in the first 24 hours of life. More than half (56%) of flu-positive infants were hospitalized, 5% required intensive care unit admission, 14% required supplemental oxygen, and 1% required intubation. Maternal flu vaccine uptake low "The findings in this study indicate that maternal influenza vaccination during pregnancy provided important protection for the infant in the first few months of life before infants are eligible for vaccination," the study authors wrote. The World Health Organization and numerous other agencies and associations recommend that pregnant women receive the inactivated flu vaccine. While continued efforts are needed to determine optimal timing, clinicians should continue to offer influenza vaccination at any time during pregnancy to protect both the pregnant person and infant. "Despite this recommendation, global maternal influenza vaccine uptake remains suboptimal," the investigators wrote. "In the US, vaccination coverage in pregnant persons during the 2022 to 2023 influenza season was less than 50% and was approximately 5% to 15% lower than in influenza seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic." "While continued efforts are needed to determine optimal timing, clinicians should continue to offer influenza vaccination at any time during pregnancy to protect both the pregnant person and infant," they added. In a related commentary, Matthew Zuber, MD; April Miller, MD, MPH; and Katherine Poehling, MD, MPH, all of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, said that vaccine registries must expand from children to people of all ages to eliminate gaps in record-keeping and that obstetric and pediatric clinicians need to share effective approaches in their communities to enhance access, confidence, and coverage of vaccines and preventive care. "Our patients need us to advocate for universal vaccine registries and roll up our sleeves and work collaboratively to optimize maternal and infant health for all," they wrote Related news Previous Next Low COVID, flu vaccine uptake noted in US healthcare workers Stephanie Soucheray In Florida nursing homes, only 11% say staff flu vaccination is required despite high-risk setting Mary Van Beusekom Adjuvanted flu, shingles vaccines can safely be given together, clinical trial shows Mary Van Beusekom CDC: 35% flu vaccine efficacy in South America may predict similar for US season Mary Van Beusekom Few Americans concerned about upcoming respiratory virus season Stephanie Soucheray 3 studies uncover flu, COVID vaccine reluctance, impact of mental illness on uptake Mary Van Beusekom Heavier social media use tied to more frequent COVID, flu vaccination Mary Van Beusekom Women twice as likely as men to report local flu, COVID vaccine side effects, data suggest Mary Van Beusekom This week's top reads Recent COVID-19 vaccination tied to lower risk of long COVID Overall, the risk of developing 28 out of 36 long-COVID symptoms lessened when vaccines were effective.

Scientists from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Duke University have identified a previously unrecognised class of antibodies that seem to have the ability to neutralise multiple forms of flu virus. These findings could contribute to development of more broadly protective flu vaccines. A flu vaccine prompts the immune system to produce antibodies that can bind to a viral protein named hemagglutinin on the outside of an invading flu virus, preventing it from entering a person’s cells. Different antibodies bind to different parts of hemagglutinin in different ways, and hemagglutinin itself evolves over time, resulting in the emergence of new flu strains that evades old antibodies. Each year, new flu vaccines are offered based on predictions of whatever the most dominant strains will be. There have been extensive research efforts to develop flu vaccines that are better at protecting against multiple strains at once. Many scientists are focused on antibodies that can simultaneously protect against flu subtypes H1 and H3, which come in multiple strains and are cause widespread infection. Dr Holly Simmons from the University of Pittsburgh and her colleagues concentrated on a particular difficulty in this endeavour: a small alteration found in some H1 strains in the sequence of building blocks that makes up hemagglutinin. Certain antibodies capable of neutralising H3 can also neutralise H1, but not if its hemagglutinin has a change called the 133a insertion. In experiments using blood samples from patients, the team found a new class of antibodies capable of neutralising both certain H3 strains and certain H1 strains with or without the 133a insertion. Distinct molecular characteristics set these antibodies apart from other antibodies capable of cross-neutralising H1 and H3 strains via other means. The study expands the list of antibodies that could contribute to development of a flu vaccination that achieves broader protection through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Also, it adds to increasing evidence supporting a move away from the most common flu vaccine manufacturing approach: vaccines grown in chicken eggs. The authors said, “We need annual influenza virus vaccines to keep pace with continuing viral evolution. Our work suggests that the barriers to eliciting more broadly protective immunity may be surprisingly low. Given the right series of influenza virus exposures/vaccinations, it is possible to for humans to mount robust antibody responses that neutralise divergent H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, opening new avenues to design improved vaccines.” This study was published in PLOS Biology.

In addition to burden of disease and vaccine characteristics, PHAC has expanded the mandate of NACI to include the systematic consideration of programmatic factors in developing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate timely decision-making for publicly funded vaccine programs at provincial and territorial levels. The additional factors to be systematically considered by NACI include: economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability. Not all NACI Statements will require in-depth analyses of all programmatic factors. While systematic consideration of programmatic factors will be conducted using evidence-informed tools to identify distinct issues that could impact decision-making for recommendation development, only distinct issues identified as being specific to the vaccine or vaccine-preventable disease will be included. This statement contains NACI's independent advice and recommendations, which are based upon the best current available scientific knowledge. This document is being disseminated for information purposes. People administering the vaccine should also be aware of the contents of the relevant product monograph. Recommendations for use and other information set out herein may differ from that set out in the product monographs of the Canadian manufacturers of the vaccines. Manufacturer(s) have sought approval of the vaccines and provided evidence as to its safety and efficacy only when it is used in accordance with the product monographs. NACI members and liaison members conduct themselves within the context of PHAC's Policy on Conflict of Interest, including yearly declaration of potential conflict of interest. Summary of information contained in this statement The following highlights key information for immunization providers. Please refer to the remainder of the statement for details. What Seasonal influenza infection is a respiratory illness that can lead to serious complications and adverse outcomes, particularly for pregnant individuals, the developing fetus, and infants under 6 months old. Influenza vaccination is safe and the best way to prevent infection in both pregnant people and infants under 6 months old. Pregnant individuals are prioritized to receive influenza vaccines because of the increased risks of severe disease during pregnancy; despite this, influenza vaccination uptake among this group remains suboptimal. The following recommendations for influenza vaccination in pregnancy supplement NACI's overarching recommendations for influenza vaccination, which are available in the NACI seasonal influenza vaccine statement. NACI recommends that individuals at any stage of pregnancy should receive an age-appropriate inactivated unadjuvanted (IIV) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) each influenza season. Who This supplemental statement provides an evidence summary on the safety and vaccine effectiveness (VE) of influenza vaccination in pregnant individuals, and the benefits and risks to the developing fetus and infants under 6 months of age. How IIV or RIV should be offered annually, at any gestational age, during pregnancy. Influenza vaccination may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of another vaccine, including the COVID-19 or pertussis vaccine. Why Pregnant people, their fetuses, and infants are at high risk of complications from influenza; therefore, annual influenza vaccination during pregnancy is strongly recommended. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy has consistently been shown to be safe and is supported by numerous studies, moreover vaccination has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection. Additionally, since influenza-related outcomes experienced during pregnancy can negatively impact the development of the fetus, vaccination of the pregnant person helps protect the fetus. Furthermore, passive transfer of antibodies from vaccination during pregnancy protects newborns during their first months of life when they are at high risk of complications from influenza infection, and too young to be immunized. Overall, the evidence supports the safety and VEs of influenza vaccines during pregnancy. Introduction Background on influenza vaccines, immunization programs and recommendations during pregnancy in Canada Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza viruses caused approximately 40,000 laboratory-confirmed influenza (LCI) cases, 12,200 hospitalizations, and 3,500 deaths among Canadians each yearFootnote 1Footnote 2Footnote 3. As such, NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older who does not have a contraindication to the vaccine. NACI has also identified groups at higher risk of influenza complications for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended (Strong NACI recommendation). NACI has identified pregnant individuals as one of the high-risk groups for whom influenza immunization is particularly important. Because of pregnancy-related changes in anatomy and the immune and cardiovascular systems, pregnant individuals are at higher risk for severe influenza disease and related complications such as pneumonia, hospitalization, and death compared to non-pregnant individualsFootnote 4Footnote 5Footnote 6. Influenza infection during pregnancy not only affects pregnant persons, but can also impact the developing fetus, and increases the risk of late-stage pregnancy loss, still birth, low birth weight and pre-term birthFootnote 6Footnote 7. Therefore, immunizing pregnant persons against influenza is strongly recommended to protect both them and their infants from severe disease, especially as infants under 6 months of age are not eligible for influenza vaccination. The NACI recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines in pregnancy and breastfeeding have evolved over time. Prior to 2007, NACI encouraged all pregnant people to be vaccinated against influenza but did not identify pregnant people without comorbidities as a priority group for vaccination programs. In 2007, NACI revised its recommendation to identify all pregnant individuals as a group for whom influenza vaccine is particularly recommended by nature of being at high-risk of influenza-related complications. NACI now also highlights that influenza vaccination in pregnancy protects both pregnant individuals and their newborn infants with passive immunity via transplacentally-transferred antibodies from the pregnant person up to the time infants can receive the vaccine themselves. Despite pregnant people being prioritized to receive influenza vaccines because of the increased risks of severe disease, vaccine uptake remains lower compared to the non-pregnant population. Further, a disproportionate burden of disease and low uptake is observed among populations who are pregnant and racialized, Indigenous, younger, and/or have lower household incomeFootnote 8Footnote 9Footnote 10Footnote 11. More literature continues to be published on the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in pregnancy. The need for this NACI Supplemental Statement on the use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy was triggered by a study identifying a potential risk of increased early spontaneous abortion in pregnant people who received influenza vaccines in 2010 and 2011Footnote 12. Since then, several studies have been published finding no association of influenza vaccines administered during pregnancy and adverse outcomes in pregnant persons or infantsFootnote 13Footnote 14Footnote 15Footnote 16. NACI has taken this opportunity to review the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of influenza vaccine in pregnancy. Moreover, this statement aims to synthesize the key information and evidence to support provincial and territorial vaccine programs and primary care providers in offering influenza vaccine to pregnant individuals. The beneficial effects of immunization during pregnancy for the fetus as well as the newborn infant have been well documented. Vaccination during pregnancy has consistently been shown to be safe and protects the pregnant individual from vaccine-preventable diseases that may otherwise be acquired and transmitted to the fetus or infant. In addition, protective concentrations of antibodies are transferred to the fetus transplacentally, which usually results in infant protection from infection in the first few months of life. For information on the benefits and safety of recommended vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding, refer to the immunization in pregnancy and breastfeeding chapter in the Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG). Guidance objective The following advisory committee statement on influenza vaccination in pregnancy supplements NACI's overarching recommendations for influenza vaccination, which are available in the NACI seasonal influenza vaccine statement. The objective of this supplemental statement is to provide updated guidance on the use of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. The statement describes the disproportionate risk of morbidity and mortality for pregnant individuals and infants under 6 months old who acquire influenza compared to the general population; reviews the available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy; and explores the EEFA considerations of immunizing pregnant people against influenza. Based on this body of evidence, the supplemental statement reaffirms the safety and importance of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Breastfeeding It is recognized that pregnant and breastfeeding individuals are closely overlapping populations; however, there are differences in the considerations of vaccination for each. The purpose of this supplemental statement is to examine influenza vaccination in pregnancy specifically, given an identified possible concern regarding its safety. Therefore, this supplemental statement does not examine the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination during breastfeeding. As stated in the NACI Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Statement, annual influenza vaccination is recommended during breastfeeding, and either non-live influenza vaccines or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can be administered to breastfeeding individuals. There have been no identified safety signals for influenza vaccination in breastfeeding, and no hypothesized biological mechanism for a safety issue with currently authorized products. For more information on this topic, please see the aforementioned Statement and CIG chapter on immunization in pregnancy and breastfeeding. A note on language NACI recognizes that not all people giving birth or breastfeeding will identify as women or mothers. Much of the research available currently refers only to "women" when discussing pregnancy. When citing research, NACI refers to the language used in the study. In these cases, "woman" refers to someone who was assigned female at birth and "maternal" is used to identify the person who is pregnant or postpartum. For the purposes of this statement, the terms "woman", "women", and "maternal" should be considered to also apply to those individuals who do not specifically identify as female gender but are the parent gestating the fetus or breastfeeding/chestfeeding the infant. Methods In brief, the broad stages in the preparation of a NACI statement are: Knowledge synthesis: retrieval and summary of literature, assessment of the quality of the evidence (summarized in Table 1. Summary of evidence). Synthesis of the body of evidence: benefits (efficacy and effectiveness) and potential harms (safety), considering the quality of the synthesized evidence and, where applicable, the magnitude of effects observed across the studies. Use of a published, peer-reviewed framework and evidence-informed tools to ensure that issues related to EEFA are systematically assessed and integrated into the guidanceFootnote 17. Completion of health economic analyses as needed. Use of the evidence to inform recommendations. Further information on NACI's process and procedures is available elsewhere. To meet the objectives of this statement, a de novo systematic review (SR) was conducted to gather evidence to inform NACI's recommendations regarding the use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy. The methodology was specified a priori in a written protocolFootnote 18. The review protocol and knowledge synthesis were developed and performed in collaboration with the Methods and Applications Group for Indirect Comparisons (MAGIC) through the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN) and supervised by the NACI Influenza Working Group (IWG). An update to the literature search was completed by the NACI Secretariat in conjunction with a librarian from the Health Library of Health Canada and PHAC. A health economic analysis was not conducted as it was not deemed necessary for this statement. The evidence and proposed recommendations were presented to NACI for deliberation on April 27, 2023, and approved following a thorough review of the evidence. Relevant considerations, rationale for specific decisions, and knowledge gaps are described in the following sections. For a comprehensive description of the review methods, including details on the study eligibility, literature search, study selection, data collection and statistical methods, please refer to Wolfe et al. (2020)Footnote 18. Methods related to the review update completed by the NACI Secretariat are reported in Appendix A. The policy question addressed in this statement is: Should pregnancy (regardless of gestational age) continue to be listed as one of the risk categories for priority influenza vaccination? To meet the objective of this statement, other informal literature reviews were conducted as needed to gather data and information including: Epidemiology and estimated burden of influenza illness among pregnant persons and infants under 6 months of age; An environmental scan of recommendations and considerations for use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy in Canadian provinces and territories and in other high-income countries. To develop comprehensive and appropriate immunization program recommendations, NACI considers several factors. In addition to critically appraising evidence on burden of disease and vaccine characteristics such as safety, efficacy, immunogenicity and effectiveness, NACI applies the EEFA framework with accompanying evidence-informed tools (Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, Acceptability Matrix) to systematically consider these programmatic factors for the development of clear, comprehensive, appropriate recommendations for timely and transparent decision-makingFootnote 19. For details on the development and application of NACI's EEFA Framework and aforementioned evidence-informed tools, please see Ismail et al. (2020)Footnote 19. Epidemiology Estimated burden of influenza among pregnant persons Pregnant individuals are more susceptible to severe influenza illness throughout pregnancy, notably in the third trimesterFootnote 20Footnote 21Footnote 22Footnote 23Footnote 24. A 2019 meta-analysis (MA) on seasonal and pandemic (H1N1) influenza found that pregnant persons had a 7-times higher risk of influenza-associated hospital admission compared to non-pregnant persons (odds ratio [OR]=6.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.02-7.68), but were not at higher risk for intensive care unit (ICU) admission or deathFootnote 22. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic however, a SR demonstrated that pregnant persons had a greater risk of influenza-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and death compared to non-pregnant personsFootnote 25. Particularly, the median relative risk of influenza infection was 6.8 (range 3.5-25.3) compared to the general population. Estimated impact of influenza on perinatal outcomes Influenza infection during pregnancy can result in serious perinatal outcomes. A 2021 meta-analysis of worldwide studies on seasonal and pandemic (H1N1) influenza reported that pregnant individuals had a 3-times higher risk of stillbirth following influenza infection (risk ratio [RR]=3.62; 95% CI: 1.60 to 8.20)Footnote 26. Studies from Australia, India, Peru, and Thailand also discovered a significant link between seasonal influenza infection during pregnancy to lower birth weight and late pregnancy lossFootnote 6Footnote 27. Moreover, a 2017 SR reported limited, mixed evidence when evaluating the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, or fetal death, in individuals with clinical influenza disease or LCI infection during pregnancy compared to those without influenzaFootnote 28. Although a small subgroup of higher-quality studies reported an association between pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) disease and preterm birth (with RRs ranging from 2.4 to 4.0 for severe disease) and fetal death (RR of 1.9 for mild-to-moderate disease and 4.2 for severe disease), no firm conclusions about the magnitude of the association can be drawn at this time based on these limited data. Estimated burden of influenza among infants under 6 months of age Young infants are particularly vulnerable to influenza infection and its complications due to their underdeveloped immune systems and ineligibility for the influenza vaccine. Influenza is a leading cause of respiratory infection among children under age 1 year and causes approximately 280,000 respiratory hospitalizations globally in those under 6 months old each year (95% CI: 150,000 to 344,000)Footnote 7Footnote 29Footnote 30Footnote 31. In 2018, hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths due to seasonal influenza in children under 5 years of age occurred disproportionately in infants under 6 months old (23% and 36%, respectively) and predominantly in low and lower-middle-income countriesFootnote 32. In Canada, a national active surveillance study of pediatric influenza admissions revealed that infants under 6 months old accounted for 13.5% of children under 16 years of age admitted for influenza during 2010-2011 to 2020-2021, emphasizing the significant burden of influenza and its associated complications for this age groupFootnote 33. Furthermore US surveillance data from 2004-2012 reported that infants under 3 months of age were 40% more likely while those aged 3-6 months were 45% more likely to be admitted to the ICU with LCI compared to infants aged 6-12 months (OR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.88 and OR=1.45; 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.04, respectively)Footnote 29. The influenza-associated mortality rate was estimated at 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.82)Footnote 34. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a U.S. study reported a LCI hospitalization rate of 20.2 per 10,000 infants under 6 months of ageFootnote 35. Influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant persons in Canada In Canada, influenza vaccination coverage in pregnancy increased from 45.0% in 2019 to 52.7% in 2021Footnote 36. However, coverage varied by provinceerritory; in 2021, Nova Scotia had the highest vaccination rate (82.5%) and Quebec had the lowest (44.2%). Overall, vaccination coverage increased in all jurisdictions from 2019 to 2021, except Saskatchewan (64.9% to 64.8%, respectively) and the Northwest Territories (84.8% to 71.7%, respectively). Vaccination coverage also varied by Indigenous status and income. The gap in influenza vaccination coverage between Indigenous pregnant people and non-Indigenous pregnant people increased in 2021 (vaccination coverage of 28% vs. 54% respectively) compared with 2019 (vaccination coverage of 35% vs. 46% respectively)Footnote 36. As well, those in lower income groups (household income under $80,000) had lower vaccination rates against influenza relative to those in the highest household income groupFootnote 36. Vaccine Concurrent administration with other vaccines Influenza vaccines may be administered concurrently with (i.e., same day), or at any time before or after, other vaccines recommended during pregnancy. Current evidence suggests that administering recommended vaccines concurrently during pregnancy is safe, despite the potential increase in local and systemic adverse reactions, including fever. There is no evidence to support adverse pregnancy sequelae from fever related to vaccine reactogenicity. A cohort study conducted in Australia involving 1,851 participants who received both IIV3 and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and reduced acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines concurrently during pregnancy found a low incidence of adverse events (AEs), providing support for the safety of concurrent vaccine administration during pregnancyFootnote 37. Other studies have similarly reported no significant safety concerns with concurrent administration of these vaccines during pregnancyFootnote 38Footnote 39. Efficacy and effectiveness The DSEN SR assessed the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy against influenza-related infection and hospitalization in pregnant persons and/or their infants using findings from 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs)Footnote 40Footnote 41Footnote 42Footnote 43 and 2 observational studiesFootnote 44Footnote 45. Additional observational studies (n=6) were identified from the updated literature search reporting data on influenza VE in pregnant persons and/or their infants up to 6 months of ageFootnote 46Footnote 47Footnote 48Footnote 49Footnote 50Footnote 51. Benefits to the pregnant person: Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness outcomes Summary of study characteristics Overall, 4 studies reported data on LCI and 3 reported data on hospitalization due to LCI infection during pregnancy or up to 6 months post-partum. Among those, 3 RCTs compared the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy to placebo (n=2)Footnote 40Footnote 41 or active comparator (n=1; meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine, Menactra®, Sanofi)Footnote 42 against LCI from enrollment to 6 months post-partum. In the 3 RCTs, the occurrence of LCI among 5,089 people receiving IIV was compared to 4,985 people randomized to the placebo or active comparator group. One (1) prospective cohort study identified from the updated literature search evaluated the effectiveness of seasonal IIV4 compared to no influenza vaccination during pregnancy against LCIFootnote 46. One (1) study identified from the DSEN SR that used a test-negative study design evaluated the VE of seasonal influenza vaccination amongst pregnant persons hospitalized for acute respiratory or febrile illness against LCI infectionFootnote 44. One (1) prospective cohort study, 1 prospective case-control study and 1 test-negative study design identified from the updated literature search evaluated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy on LCI hospitalization in pregnant personsFootnote 47Footnote 48Footnote 52. Summary of vaccine efficacy/effectiveness A MA of the 3 RCTs suggested that seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of lab-confirmed influenza infection in pregnant persons prior to delivery and up to 6 months post-partum (pooled VE=50%; 95% CI: 22 to 68%, I2=49.22%). The results suggest that the benefit of seasonal influenza vaccination was similar from delivery to 6 months post-partum (pooled VE=57%, 95% CI: 14 to 78%, I2=35.88%) compared to the period between enrollment and delivery (pooled VE=54%, 95% CI: -48 to 86%, I2=72.28%). One (1) prospective cohort study conducted during the 2019-2020 influenza season in Greece also found a protective effect of seasonal IIV4 against LCI infection in pregnant persons (adjusted VE [aVE]=43.5%, 95% CI: 28.4 to 55.6%)Footnote 46. Figure 1. Meta-analysis of RCTs reporting maternal lab-confirmed influenza from enrolment to 6 months post-partum comparing seasonal influenza vaccine to placebo or active comparator Figure 1: Text description Figure 1 depicts a forest plot showing results of a random-effects meta-analysis reporting the risk of maternal lab-confirmed influenza from enrolment to six months post-partum comparing trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines (TIIV) to a placebo or active comparator. The leftmost column lists the three included studies, each identified by the first author's name and the publication year. Next, to the right, the following information is presented: whether the study period was limited to the influenza season or not, the study's risk of bias, the point estimate of the risk ratio, the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval (CI), and the number of individuals having the outcome of interest (events) over the sample size of the intervention (TIIV) and over the sample size of the comparison group (placebo/control). The x-axis representing the risk ratio estimates and 95% CI ranges from 0.1 to 10. The vertical line of 'no effect' appears at the value of 1 and separates the outcomes that favour TIIV (on the left) and the placebo/control (on the right). Each horizontal line of the forest plot represents an individual study with the results plotted as a box and the 95% CI of the result displayed as the line. The size of the box surrounding each estimate represents the relative weight of that study in producing the pooled result. The blue diamond shows the pooled result when the individual studies are combined together and averaged. The horizontal points of the diamond are the limit of the 95% CI of the combined point estimate. The following information is depicted in Figure 1.

Together, these studies suggest that seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of LCI infection and hospitalization due to LCI during pregnancy and up to 6 months post-partum. Infant benefits: Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness outcomes Summary of study characteristics Overall, 7 studies reported data on LCI infection. Among those, 4 RCTs compared the efficacy of IIV to placebo (n=2)Footnote 40Footnote 53 or active comparators (n=2; pneumococcalFootnote 43 or meningococcal vaccineFootnote 42) during pregnancy against LCI infection in infants up to 6 months of age. Three (3) cohort studies identified from the updated literature search compared the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy against LCI infection in infants up to 6 months of ageFootnote 46Footnote 49Footnote 50. A total of 5 studies (3 test-negative studies, including 1 identified from the DSEN SRFootnote 45Footnote 47Footnote 51, and 2 cohort studiesFootnote 49Footnote 50 reported data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination during pregnancy on hospitalization due to LCI infection in infants up to 6 months of age. Summary of vaccine efficacy/effectiveness A MA of the 4 RCTs demonstrated a protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy against LCI infection in infants up to 6 months of age (pooled VE=37%, 95% CI: 22 to 49%, I2=0.00%). Results from the RCTs suggest that the greatest effect of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy against LCI infection in infants was found from birth up to 2 months of age (pooled VE0 to <2 months=61%, 95% CI: 17 to 81%, I2=39.57%), following which the protective effect of vaccination during pregnancy waned as infant age increased (pooled VE2 to <4 months=42%, 95% CI: -13 to 70%, I2=59.67% and pooled VE4 to <6 months=24%, 95% CI: -3 to 44%, I2=0.00), a biologically plausible finding due to the waning of the effects of passive transfer of antibodies in neonates.

Vaccine safety Summary of study characteristics The DSEN SR on the safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy evaluated non-obstetric serious adverse events (SAE) in pregnant persons related to the administration of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy using findings from 3 RCTs and 3 cohort studies. Additionally, the SR included 4 RCTs and 24 observational studies, including 20 cohort and 4 case-control studies, addressing other safety and/or pregnancy/birth related outcomes (i.e., infant death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, SGA, low birth weight and congenital anomalies). Outcomes of seasonal influenza vaccination were compared with those for other vaccines (e.g., meningococcal, or pneumococcal vaccines), placebo or no vaccination. Eleven (11) additional observational studies were identified from the updated literature search evaluating non-obstetric SAEs/AEs and other safety and/or pregnancy/birth outcomes (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, SGA, low birth weight and congenital anomalies) related to the administration of influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Of those, 3 were single-arm cohort studies and one was a case series derived from registries of AEs of interest. These study designs were not included in the DSEN SR, but were included in the updated literature search to capture studies reporting data on the safety of administration during pregnancy of more recently licensed influenza vaccines that are based upon new different technologies, including quadrivalent mammalian cell culture-based vaccines (e.g., IIV4c; Flucelvax® Quad) and RIV (e.g., quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines [RIV4]; Supemtek™), given the limited published peer-reviewed evidence on these vaccines. Summary of vaccine safety Harms to the pregnant person: Non-obstetric serious adverse events in pregnant people Serious systemic reactions within 7 days of vaccination Two (2) RCTs evaluated the risk of severe systemic reactions within 7 days of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant people. One (1) RCT conducted in South Africa by Madhi et al. (2014) found 27 of 181 people who received trivalent IIV (IIV3) (14.9%) and 19 of 172 who received a saline placebo (11.0%) experienced at least one severe systemic reaction, which included severe weaknessiredness, headache, fever, joint pain, and muscle pain, within 7 days of vaccine administrationFootnote 41. A larger RCT conducted in Mali by Tapia et al. (2016) found that 2 of 2,105 women who received IIV3 (0.1%) and none of the 2,082 people who received meningococcal vaccine (0.0%) experienced a severe systemic adverse reaction within 7 days of vaccine administrationFootnote 42; the 2 severe reactions included febrile sensation and headache, and it was unclear whether those 2 events occurred in the same participant. No significant difference in the frequency of severe systemic reactions within 7 days of seasonal influenza vaccination was observed within each individual study (RR=1.35, 95% CI: 0.78 to 2.34Footnote 41, and RR= 4.95, 95% CI: 0.24 to 102.95Footnote 42); pooled estimates were not calculated given the substantial differences in the risks of SAEs in the intervention groups of the 2 studies and the control groups. There were likely unknown differences in outcomes definitions or other sources of heterogeneity. Other serious non-obstetric adverse events Two (2) RCTs, 6 cohort studies and 1 case-series reported data on other non-obstetric SAEs. One (1) RCT conducted by Madhi et al. (2014) found no difference in the occurrence of non-obstetric SAEs that were possibly or probably related to influenza vaccination within 30 days of vaccination administration (1 in 1,062 IIV3 and 0 in 1,054 saline placebo recipients; RR=2.98, 95% CI: 0.12 to 73.01)Footnote 41. Another RCT conducted by Zaman et al. (2008) reported data on peripartum hospitalizations due to non-obstetric causes, with no apparent difference between IIV3 and pneumococcal vaccine recipients (1 event in 159 IIV3 and 2 events in 157 pneumococcal vaccine recipients; RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.05 to 5.39)Footnote 43. Five (5) cohort studies reported non-obstetric SAEs either within 42 days of vaccination or within an unknown time period. In an American study, Munoz et al. (2005) found 2 hospitalization events unrelated to pregnancy in 225 vaccinated pregnant persons and 3 in 826 unvaccinated pregnant persons within 42 days of intervention, with none related to vaccination (RR=2.45, 95% CI: 0.41 to 14.56)Footnote 54. The cause of hospitalization included influenza illness with emesis and migraine headache in the vaccinated group, and influenza with emesis, appendicitis, and calculus ureter-stent replacement in the unvaccinated group. Finally, 4 cohort studies did not report any SAEs after the administration of IIV4 (Fluzone® Quadrivalent)Footnote 55, IIV4-cc (Flucelvax® Quad)Footnote 56 and IIV3 during pregnancyFootnote 57Footnote 58. Guillain-Barré syndrome One (1) cohort study and 1 case-series reported data on Guillain-Barré syndrome following seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Within 42 days of intervention, Nordin et al. (2013) identified no inpatient cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in 75,906 vaccinated pregnant persons and 1 case in 147,992 unvaccinated pregnant persons in the USA (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.03 to 15.95)Footnote 59. One (1) case series identified from the updated literature search reported 1 case (n=239) of Guillain-Barré syndrome that occurred 5 days after IIV4 administration during the third trimester of pregnancy in a 29-year-old woman. The woman gave birth to a healthy baby while recovering and has fully recoveredFootnote 60. These studies suggest that pregnant persons vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines during pregnancy appear to experience the same rates of non-obstetric serious AEs as non-pregnant persons vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines, pregnant persons vaccinated with pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccines, as well as unvaccinated pregnant persons. Infant harms: Infant death from 0 to 6 months of age Four (4) RCTs compared the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination to placebo (n=2)Footnote 40Footnote 41 or active comparators (n=2; meningococcal quadrivalent vaccineFootnote 42 or 23-valent pneumococcal vaccineFootnote 43) during pregnancy on infant death up to 6 months of age. All RCTs were conducted in low-to-middle-income countries, and the control group infant death risk ranged from 1.1% and 2.8%. A MA of these RCTs did not demonstrate an association between seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy and infant death (pooled RR=1.14, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.50, I2=9.33). Figure 6.

These studies suggest that seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy is not associated with infant death up to 6 months of age. Infant harms: Spontaneous abortion Three (3) cohort studies and 3 observational studies evaluated the effect of IIV during pregnancy on spontaneous abortion (SAB) under 20 and 22 weeks gestational age. Two (2) prospective cohort studies were included in a MA and no association between IIV and SAB was demonstrated (pooled adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=0.77, 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.89, I2=37.51%)Footnote 62Footnote 63. A third prospective cohort study conducted in Japan found the same risk of SAB under 22 gestational weeks (0.4%) among unvaccinated and vaccinated pregnant people (first-trimester vaccination)Footnote 64. Figure 7.

The leftmost column lists the two included studies, each identified by the first author's name and the publication year. Next, to the right, the following information is presented: the exposure time, the country where the study was conducted, whether the study period was limited to influenza season or not, the study's risk of bias, the point estimate of the hazard ratio, the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval (CI), and the number of individuals having the outcome of interest (events) over the sample size of the intervention (TIIV; trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) and over the sample size of the comparison group (no vaccine). The x-axis representing the risk ratio estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI) ranges from 0.1 to 10. The vertical line of 'no effect' appears at the value of 1 and separates the outcomes that favour TIIV (on the left) and no vaccine (on the right).

The first study was conducted over 2 consecutive influenza seasons following the 2009 H1N1 pandemicFootnote 12. The authors observed an increased risk of SAB following IIV only in the first post-pandemic season (2010-2011 adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.70, 95% CI: 1.40 to 9.40) but not the second (2011-2012 aOR=1.40, 95% CI: 0.60 to 3.30). Post-hoc analyses of 2010-2011 data found that people who had been previously vaccinated in the 2009-2010 season with the H1N1 pandemic vaccine were at increased risk of SAB following IIV in the 2010-2011 season, which was not observed in those not vaccinated with the H1N1 pandemic vaccine in 2009-2010 but vaccinated with IIV in 2010-2011. The second study conducted over 3 consecutive influenza seasons (i.e., 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015) by Donahue, et al. (2019) sought to confirm the association observed between SAB and history of influenza vaccinationFootnote 65. No association was found between seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy and SAB within 28 days of vaccination (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.10), including among people vaccinated in the previous season. The authors state that the association of prior season vaccination found in the initial study may have been a spurious result due to residual confounding or random error, or it may have been due to differences in the time periods of the 2 studies. One (1) cohort study identified from the updated literature search conducted in the US over the 2008-2009 to 2013-2014 influenza seasons did not find an association between the history of pandemic H1N1 containing influenza vaccination and spontaneous abortion within 28 days of vaccination (aHR=1.19, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.46)Footnote 66. Three (3) additional single-arm cohort studies and 1 case series identified from the updated literature search reported data on SAB in persons vaccinated with IIV during pregnancy. The 1 case-series study described SABs after vaccine exposure that were reported from several countries to the Fluzone® Quadrivalent (IIV4, Sanofi) Pregnancy Registry from 2013 to 2019. Four (4) SABs were captured by the pregnancy registry; however, the frequency of neonatal adverse outcomes presented in the study are consistent across the literature and do not exceed the expected rates in the general population. One (1) cohort study described SABs identified among IIV-exposed pregnancies that were reported to the US registry or through GSK worldwide safety database. From the US registries, 3 spontaneous abortions were reported from 115 pregnancies. From the 3 SABs reported, there were 2 SABs in which exposure occurred during the first trimester, and 1 for which the date of exposure was unknown. From the worldwide database, 26 out of 676 reports of influenza vaccine exposure during pregnancy resulted in SABs; however, there was no information on exposure timing. SABs originate during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (i.e., at risk periods), therefore, exposures occurring in the third trimester are not likely to be causally associated. Two (2) prospective cohort studies that were conducted to fulfill a post-marketing commitment to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluated the safety of IIV4 (Afluria® Quadrivalent) and IIV4-cc (Flucelvax® Quadrivalent) administrated during pregnancy. The studies reported 2.5 and 1.9% SABs after administration of IIV4 and IIV4-cc during the first trimester of pregnancy, respectively, which was not increased when compared to the rate in the general US population. Overall, from the 3 single-arm cohort studies and the case series study, no safety signals were identified among pregnant persons exposed to IIV. One cohort study did not observe a significant association between immunization with a pandemic H1N1-containing influenza vaccine prior to 21 6/7 weeks' gestation and spontaneous abortion, regardless of the vaccine received in the prior influenza season (i.e., pandemic H1N1-containing influenza vaccine or non-pandemic-H1N1-containing influenza vaccine)Footnote 66. Together, these studies suggest that seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Infant harms: Other birth outcomes No safety issues were identified regarding the administration of seasonal influenza vaccines during pregnancy, with respect to other adverse birth outcomes including stillbirth (≥18-22 gestational weeks or ≥500g); preterm birth; SGA; low birth weight; and congenital anomalies identified at birth or up to 6 months of age. Evidence was derived from both RCTs and observational studies, including case-control studies and cohort studies. Limited published peer-reviewed evidence regarding the safety of administration during pregnancy of more recently licensed influenza vaccines that are based upon new different technologies, including mammalian IIV-cc (e.g., IIV4-cc; Flucelvax® Quad) and RIV (e.g., RIV4; Supemtek™) was identified. Details on other adverse birth outcomes are available in Table 1. Summary of evidence. Ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability considerations Ethics considerations NACI evaluated the following ethical considerations when making its recommendations: promoting well-being and minimizing risk of harm; maintaining trust; respect for persons and fostering autonomy; and promoting justice and equity. NACI also identified the ethical imperative to protect the public's health and the health of the most vulnerable. NACI addressed the identified ethical considerations throughout the vaccine guidance development process and these considerations have been incorporated into the recommendations. Equity considerations No distinct inequities that may arise because of the recommendations were identified. However, the following intersectional factors described in NACI's EEFA framework were considered: pre-existing conditions; social factors; place of residence; and access to healthcare. Pregnant individuals and individuals with chronic health conditions are identified among the groups at greater risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalizationFootnote 1. Racialized people and Indigenous people may also be at increased risk for severe influenza disease due to a variety of intersecting factors, including underlying medical conditions and potentially decreased access to healthcare resources. Canadians with low household incomes, unstable or crowded housing, and individuals living in remote or rural areas may face increased exposure to influenza and challenges accessing healthcareFootnote 36. Gender-diverse pregnant people are more likely to face discrimination or poor treatment in medical settings and may be more reluctant to seek healthcare. Individuals such as international students and newcomers to Canada may face language barriers in accessing healthcare. Feasibility considerations Based on the feasibility matrix NACI completed as part of its EEFA analysis, there were no distinct, significant issues identified for feasibility with respect to resource and integration implications that could impact decision making for this recommendation since this is an existing immunization program. Recommendations that allow vaccination at all gestational stages of pregnancy would reduce feasibility barriers in vaccination programs. Acceptability considerations NACI evaluated the following acceptability considerations when making its recommendations: individual beliefs; values and knowledge; socio-demographic factors; and systemic factors. Refusing vaccination during pregnancy is common globally, resulting in a low vaccine coverage rateFootnote 70. Low vaccine uptake in pregnant individuals has been partly attributed to vaccine hesitancy, which is complex and multidimensional and can be influenced by individual, logistical, cultural, and sociologic factors. A pregnant individual's beliefs, values, and knowledge about seasonal influenza and vaccination affect the acceptance of vaccination during pregnancyFootnote 70Footnote 71. Individuals who believe the vaccines to be safe and effective and individuals who perceive themselves to be at risk of seasonal influenza and have the desire to protect others against the virus are more likely to pursue vaccinationFootnote 70Footnote 71Footnote 72Footnote 73. Conversely, pregnant individuals are less likely to pursue vaccination if they have anti-vaccination beliefs and concerns regarding the effects of vaccination on the health of the individual and fetus, and limited knowledge regarding the risks of influenza and the benefits of vaccination during pregnancyFootnote 70Footnote 71Footnote 73. In the 2021 Canadian Survey on Vaccination During Pregnancy Study (SVP), 51% of participants responded that their reason for not getting the influenza vaccine during pregnancy was "not wanting to be vaccinated during pregnancy"Footnote 36. Furthermore, evidence from Okoli et al. (2021) suggests a potential vulnerability of multiparous women with respect to the uptake of preventive careFootnote 74, as they may assume that their current pregnancy will be uneventful because previous pregnancies were uneventful and may become complacent about vaccination. These data suggest that programs designed to enhance pregnant individuals' information and vaccine literacy may promote greater seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance during pregnancyFootnote 74. Additionally, it is important to note that in 2021, the SVP reported a significant increase (53%) in influenza vaccination among pregnant individuals since the 2019 survey (45%)Footnote 36. Systemic factors contribute to the acceptability of seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant individuals. Systems and policies or delivery models that promote universal access to vaccines are most effective at improving uptake and coverage in the Canadian contextFootnote 72. Healthcare providers also play an important role in offering the influenza vaccine and positively influencing pregnant individuals' perceptions of seasonal influenza vaccinationFootnote 70Footnote 71Footnote 73Footnote 75Footnote 76. Increased access to trusted healthcare providers who inform pregnant individuals of the benefits and recommendations of seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with increased acceptabilityFootnote 77. Qiu et al. (2021)'s internationally sourced SR findings suggest that a healthcare provider's recommendation was a main facilitator of vaccine acceptability among pregnant individuals, and its absence was the main barrier reported among unvaccinated womenFootnote 78. Blanchard-Rohner et al. (2012) found in their Switzerland based study that most past-partum people neither recalled being recommended vaccination nor informed about the risks of influenza during pregnancyFootnote 79. Evidence from the SVP study (2021) supports these conclusions in the Canadian context with the proportion of women vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy being substantially higher among women who received a recommendation to be vaccinated (70%), compared to those who did not receive a recommendation to be vaccinated (14%)Footnote 36. Providers' knowledge and beliefs about the influenza vaccine, their experiences supporting pregnant individuals, as well as their workload and time constraints, affect their practices in advocating for the influenza vaccine during pregnancyFootnote 80. These findings suggest that improved access to healthcare providers who are well informed and can communicate the importance of seasonal influenza during pregnancy is the most likely way to increase vaccine acceptability. Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination during pregnancy The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the acceptability of vaccination and seasonal influenza vaccination. The Childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey (CNICS) collects information on national immunization coverage for vaccines administered to children and pregnant individuals. Data from the CNICS released in December 2022 showed the proportion of pregnant people who were more inclined to get vaccinated as a result of the pandemic varied across provinces and territories, from a low of 9% (Quebec) to a high of 32% (Yukon). Survey results also showed that the pandemic increased intent to receive vaccination among racialized groups; for example, a significantly higher proportion of Filipino Canadians (39%) and South Asian Canadians (26%) were more inclined to get vaccinated as a result of the pandemic relative to non-Indigenous and non-racialized people (14%)Footnote 81. Furthermore, the SVP study (2021) identified systematic barriers to receiving vaccinations in Canada in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey (2021) found that 11% of the pregnant individuals surveyed reported that they encountered an obstacle or delayed vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those, 73% reported limited appointment availability, 40% were concerned about being exposed to COVID-19, 25% reported a lack of walk-in options, and 12% received recommendations from a doctor or local public health authority to delay vaccinationFootnote 36. Discussion The present SR and MA examined current literature on the use of influenza vaccines during pregnancy. Findings from this review suggest that influenza vaccination during pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of LCI infection and hospitalization in both pregnant individuals and their infants up to 6 months post-partum. Overall, the evidence from this review indicates that seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in pregnant individuals appear to be comparable to the general population of healthy adults and consistent with VE point estimates reported in a previous MA by Osterholm, et al. (2012)Footnote 82. The evidence also suggests that influenza vaccination during pregnancy does not increase the risk of non-obstetric SAEs in pregnant persons; infant death; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; pre-term birth; small for gestational age; low birth weight; and congenital anomalies. In fact, some studies suggested a protective effect of influenza vaccination for stillbirthFootnote 83Footnote 84Footnote 85 and low birth weightFootnote 63Footnote 86Footnote 87Footnote 88Footnote 89. The SR and MA findings are in accordance with other reviews that have been undertaken to evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness of influenza vaccination during pregnancyFootnote 15Footnote 16Footnote 90. By comparison, the SR and MA by Quach et al. (2020) reported similar protective effects of seasonal influenza vaccine against LCI in pregnant persons (RR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.36 and OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.61)Footnote 16. Moreover, Nunes et al. (2017) and Jarvis et al. (2020) consistently reported similar protective effects, with meta-analyses demonstrating a reduction in the risk of LCI in infants born to the vaccinated parent (RR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.67Footnote 90 and RR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85Footnote 15). Minor differences in the pooled results from the findings of the present review may be attributed to variations in the study inclusion criteria, MA methods and other factors. The findings of this SR are also consistent with previous reviews that investigated the safety of influenza vaccines administered during pregnancy and found no significant association with increased safety riskFootnote 13Footnote 14Footnote 15Footnote 16Footnote 90Footnote 91. Particularly, Minozzi et al. (2022) and Hansen et al. (2021) reported pooled estimates that support the present review's findings, demonstrating a lack of association between the influenza vaccine and infant death (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.60Footnote 13 and RR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.41)Footnote 14. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that there are no adverse early childhood health outcomes associated with influenza immunization during pregnancyFootnote 92Footnote 93Footnote 94. Despite similarities in the estimates of efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines during pregnancy, limitations in the included studies in this review should be noted. Firstly, adjustment for confounding was not consistently conducted in the observational studies, nor was accounting for immortal time bias for time-dependent outcomes. With respect to study design, there was high variability in the outcome definitions and the time points for some outcomes. Furthermore, it was unclear if some RCT outcomes could be generalized to the Canadian context. Finally, assumptions were made regarding equivalence of effect estimates and for VE estimates, as the concordance of influenza vaccine strains with circulating strains was not considered. Beyond the scope of this review, a wide range of additional influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness and safety outcomes regarding influenza vaccination during pregnancy have been systematically explored in the literature. For example, Jarvis et al. (2020) and Quach et al. (2020) assessed influenza vaccine efficacy/effectiveness during pregnancy by investigating the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other respiratory illnessesFootnote 15Footnote 16. Conversely, Hansen et al. (2021) assessed seasonal influenza vaccine safety by reporting on non-influenza infectious AEs, all-cause mortality, and mortality from presumed infectious causesFootnote 14, whereas Jarvis et al. (2020) reported long-term respiratory conditions (asthma)Footnote 15. Studies considering the impact of timing of influenza vaccination on protection of the pregnant individual and fetusewborn are limited. A 2019 SR and MA on optimal timing on influenza vaccination during pregnancy found that individuals vaccinated later during pregnancy had a greater immune response to vaccination and increased antibody transfer to the fetusFootnote 95. However, prioritizing vaccination during a later gestational age could leave the pregnant person vulnerable to influenza infection for a significant proportion of the pregnancy and may be challenging to implement programmatically. NACI will continue to monitor the evidence base and will update its guidance as needed. Recommendations Following the review of available evidence summarized above, as well as the assessment of EFFA considerations with the EEFA Framework, the following section outlines the evidence-informed recommendations made by NACI regarding influenza vaccination in pregnancy. NACI will continue to carefully monitor the scientific developments related to influenza vaccines, as well as ongoing vaccine pharmacovigilance, and will update its recommendations as required. Additional information on the strength of NACI recommendations is available in Table 4. The following recommendation for influenza vaccination in pregnancy supplements NACI's overarching recommendations for influenza vaccination, which are available in the NACI seasonal influenza vaccine statement. The overarching NACI recommendation for influenza vaccination is that an age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone 6 months of age and older (Strong NACI Recommendation), noting product-specific contraindications. 1. NACI recommends that influenza vaccine should be offered to pregnant individuals. Recommended products include: IIV-SD, IIV-cc, and RIV. (Strong NACI Recommendation) There has been no identified safety signal regarding the use of RIV during pregnancy although published clinical data are limited. There has been no identified safety signal regarding the use of LAIV in pregnancy, although there are more data on the safety of other influenza vaccine products in pregnancy. There is also evidence that IIV has higher efficacy than LAIV in healthy adults. Note that vaccination with LAIV during pregnancy should not be considered a reason to terminate pregnancy. The only adjuvanted vaccine in Canada for the 2023/2024 influenza season is the adjuvanted inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-Adj), which is authorized for infants 6 to 23 months (Fluad Pediatric®) and adults 65 years and older (Fluad®). There has been no identified safety signal regarding adjuvanted influenza vaccines in pregnancy; however, IIV3-Adj is not authorized for people of reproductive age. The only high-dose vaccine in Canada for the 2023/2024 influenza season is the high-dose inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine IIV4-HD (Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent) which is authorized for adults 65 years and older. There has been no identified safety signal regarding high-dose influenza vaccines in pregnancy, however, IIV4-HD is not authorized for people of reproductive age. Summary of evidence and rationale: The safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy is consistently supported by numerous studies, including clinical trials and observational studies, and routine pharmacovigilance data from safety reporting systems. Published data, including currently available studies of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, and congenital malformations, do not report unexpected or concerning patterns. The evidence reaffirms that seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with significant safety issues with respect to adverse birth outcomes or maternal non-obstetric SAEs. Published data continue to demonstrate the efficacy/effectiveness of influenza vaccination during pregnancy for protection against LCI infection and to help mitigate the severity of influenza infection. The efficacy/effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant individuals is comparable to the general adult population. Studies have demonstrated that infants receive protection from maternal antibodies as a result of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, and their results suggest that seasonal vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of LCI infections and LCI hospitalizations in infants up to 6 months of age. 2. NACI recommends that influenza vaccination should be offered at any stage of pregnancy (i.e., in any trimester). (Strong NACI recommendation) If an individual's pregnancy extends over 2 influenza seasons, that person may receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine (i.e., one dose in each season, during the course of the pregnancy). Summary of evidence and rationale: There is insufficient evidence to establish the optimal timing of influenza vaccination for maternal or fetalewborn outcomes. Prioritizing vaccination during a specific gestational stage may lead to programmatic challenges and missed vaccination opportunities. 3. NACI recommends the inclusion of all pregnant individuals, at any stage of pregnancy, among those who are particularly recommended to receive influenza vaccination. (Strong NACI recommendation) Summary of evidence and rationale: The evidence consistently shows an association between pregnancy and increased disease severity with influenza infection. This includes hospitalization, admission to the ICU, invasive mechanical ventilation, and maternal mortality. There is also a higher risk of adverse neonatal outcomes (e.g., premature delivery, low birth weight, NICU admission) with influenza infection during pregnancy. The risks for preterm delivery, low birth weight and admission to the NICU increase with disease severity in the pregnant person. Infants under 6 months are at increased risk of hospitalization due to influenza infection compared to children from other ages. However, influenza vaccine is not effective in infants under 6 months; therefore, passive immunization of fetuses through transplacentally transmitted anti-influenza antibodies is currently the best available prevention strategy. Despite the increased risks of severe disease there is a suboptimal uptake of influenza vaccination during pregnancy in Canada, with only approximately 53% of pregnant individuals receiving the vaccine in 2021. Among pregnant people, there is a disproportionate burden of disease and low vaccine uptake among those who are racialized, Indigenous, younger, low-income, and/or living in rural settings. 4. NACI reiterates its recommendation that influenza vaccination may be given at the same time as, or at any time before or after administration of another vaccine, including COVID-19 or pertussis vaccine. (Strong NACI recommendation) Every appropriate opportunity to immunize during pregnancy, with any immunization for which the pregnant person is eligible, should be taken. Summary of evidence and rationale: No known safety signal for concurrent administration of influenza with another vaccine during pregnancy has been identified. Administration of multiple vaccines at the same visit is a strategy for increasing immunization uptake. Research priorities Study the longer-term outcomes of infants and children exposed to influenza infection in-utero. Research on seasonal influenza illness and vaccination rates among pregnant individuals and infants outside of a 2009 H1N1 pandemic context, particularly during/following the COVID-19-pandemic. Collect national-level influenza surveillance data for pregnant individuals and infants under 6 months of age in Canada will help to better define the burden of disease for pregnant people and infants. Study the longer-term outcomes for children born to individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. Collect additional safety data for newer vaccine technologies, including cell culture and RIV. Study the timing of influenza immunization in pregnant individuals with respect to duration or waning of protection against infection and severe disease. Examine vaccine confidence and acceptability among pregnant individuals in Canada, especially among racialized groups. Investigate range and complex interplay of factors that influence acceptability of influenza immunization in general and for high-risk groups (including pregnant individuals). Study the COVID-19 pandemic's potential ongoing impact on vaccine hesitancy and maternal vaccine uptake. Learn more about patient, provider, and system-level barriers to vaccination in pregnancy in Canada, including: Policy and structural factors; Patients' knowledge, understanding and beliefs about influenza vaccination during pregnancy, especially given the heterogeneity of Canada's population (i.e., differences in socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and differences in trust in the medical system). Surveillance priorities Ongoing and systematic data collection, analysis, interpretation, and timely dissemination is fundamental to planning, implementation, evaluation, and evidence-based decision-making. To support such efforts, NACI encourages ongoing surveillance and continued expansion of surveillance details in the epidemiology of influenza in Canada. Overall, there is a gap in knowledge on the impact of seasonal influenza among pregnant persons and perinatal/postnatal outcomes in Canada and worldwide. To date, most epidemiological studies have focused on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in certain high-income countries (e.g., US) and report inconsistent findings on the association between influenza illness and adverse perinatal outcomes. There is also a shortage of studies conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in late 2019/early 2020. Therefore, more updated surveillance on seasonal influenza among pregnant persons and young infants in low, medium, and high-income countries, including Canada, is needed to better understand the burden of disease and develop targeted vaccine campaigns for these high-risk groups. In Canada, FluWatch, the national surveillance system, monitors the spread of influenza and ILI by provinceerritory and age group, but does not specify pregnancy status. Therefore, initiatives are needed to collect influenza information (e.g., ILI incidence, viral strain, hospitalization) from pregnant persons to inform appropriate public health efforts such as targeted vaccination campaigns and education.

Appendix A: Review update methods The methods related to the review update completed by the NACI Secretariat were generally aligned with those used by Wolfe et al. (2020)Footnote 18. Review questions The following research questions were addressed: Research question 1: Are influenza vaccines safe for pregnant persons and their newborn infants if received any time during pregnancy? Research question 2: Are influenza vaccines effective for preventing influenza and its complications for pregnant persons and their newborn infants if received at any time during pregnancy? Study eligibility criteria Eligibility criteria defining studies for inclusions were the same as those used by Wolfe et al. (2020) apart from the inclusion of single-arm cohort studies and studies based on databases of voluntary reporting or surveillance of AEs (Table 5)Footnote 18. These studies were included in the review update completed by the NACI Secretariat to capture evidence on more recently licensed influenza vaccines that are based upon new different technologies, including quadrivalent mammalian cell culture-based vaccines and RIV. Table 5. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Population Pregnant women and their unborn and newborn infants under 6 months of age Women vaccinated preconception or post-partum Interventions Seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines of any valency that were indicated for adults Vaccines contraindicated during pregnancy (e.g., live-attenuated vaccines) Comparators Placebo, no influenza vaccine, active comparators (e.g., other influenza vaccine, meningococcal or pneumococcal vaccines) No comparator or vaccines contraindicated during pregnancy Outcomes Dichotomous measures of the following outcomes: Maternal Vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (LCI) LCI hospitalization Influenza-like illness (ILI) and other influenza-associated outcomes Serious non-obstetric adverse events (SAEs) Infant Vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza (LCI) LCI hospitalization Influenza-like illness (ILI) and other influenza-associated outcomes Early neonatal death within 7 days of birth Death within 6 months of birth Birth outcomes Spontaneous abortion (SAB) Stillbirth Preterm birth (PTB) Small-for-gestational-age birth (SGA) Low birth weight (LBW) Congenital anomalies Immunogenicity outcomes Outcomes with continuous measures Study designs RCTs, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control and test-negative studies, nested designs, single-arm cohort studies, studies based on databases of voluntary reporting or surveillance of adverse events Systematic reviews, narrative reviews, case reports, abstracts Language English and French language publications only Other languages Literature search The updated search strategy was developed in collaboration with librarian from the Health Library of Health Canada and PHAC (search strategy available upon request). Separate strategies were performed for RCTs and observational studies. The RCT search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE® ALL, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The observational studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE® ALL and Embase. All searches were performed on January 13, 2023. Searches were restricted to articles published in English and French. Articles retrieved in the Health Library of Health Canada and PHAC literature searches were loaded into RefWorks (ProQuest LLC, Ann Arbor, MI), and uploaded to DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). Study selection process Two (2) reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for study eligibility. The full texts of studies identified in the first phase of screening were assessed independently by 2 reviewers for inclusion in the SR. Screening conflicts were resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. Data extraction A data extraction form was developed for this SR. The extraction process was piloted independently by 2 reviewers to assess quality and consistency of data collection. Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second. Study authors were contacted by email to obtain additional data or confirm data when necessary. The following data were extracted from each report: study design, population characteristics definition of intervention and comparator, outcome definition, statistical analyses, and key findings. Risk of bias assessment Following data extraction, 2 reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) at the outcome level using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0) or adaptations of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and case-control studies as described by Wolfe et al. (2020)Footnote 18. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. Synthesis and statistical methods Data were combined with Wolfe et al. (2020) findings by outcome to evaluate the availability of quantitative evidence, as well as the feasibility and appropriateness of meta-analysisFootnote 18. Meta-analyses were conducted when 2 or more study reported evidence that was not clinically heterogenous as described by Wolfe et al. (2020)Footnote 18. Briefly, random effect models were used, and statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic, with a threshold of 50% or higher suggesting potentially important heterogeneity. Forest plots were used to present meta-analyses. Evidence was summarized narratively when meta-analysis was deemed inappropriate. All analyses were conducted using the Review Manager software (Version 5.4)Footnote 100. Appendix B: Prisma flow diagram for review update Appendix B: Prisma flow diagram for review update Appendix B: Text description The PRISMA flow diagram describes the process by which studies or records were identified and selected via databases and registers. The process is broken down into three stages: Identification, Screening and Included. Stage 1: Identification There were 1,494 records identified through database and register searching, 351 duplicate records were removed before screening. Stage 2: Screening 1,143 records were screened. Of these 999 records were excluded, with a remainder of 144 full texts. One full text was not retrieved and was excluded. A total of 143 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 126 articles were excluded. The reasons for their exclusion are as follows: 38 articles did not focus on the relevant population of interest, 18 articles did not report outcomes of interest, 30 articles did not involve relevant interventions, 18 articles were not conducted with the desired study design, 4 articles were in languages that were not accessible for review, and 4 articles were excluded for various other reasons. Stage 3: Included 17 articles were included in the review. Of those, 13 were comparative studies, and 4 were descriptive studies.

From the Blanco-Melo lab, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division December 18, 2023 • By J Landazuri The flu is simple, right? You get it, you feel terrible and then you get better. As it turns out, thereÂ is a bit moreÂ going on at the cellular level.Â As soon as the virus enters our cells, it hijacks our cell machinery to make copies of itself, followed budding from the host to go infect more cells.Â Sounds easy right?Â But it is not! Our cells fightÂ infection by activating various host responses.Â During infection, the flu also hijacks various cellular pathways to evade immune surveillance.Â The flu, for example, antagonizes the pattern-recognition receptor (PPR) pathway.Â When PPR detects pathogens in our cells, it secretes interferon (IFN), which induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Â The flu also modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR).Â The UPR pathway is activated when cells are subjected to constant insults, such asÂ viralÂ infections, to promote cell death. So, how do virusesÂ trick cells to escape these pathways?Â Â Viruses encode viral proteins that can inhibit these pathways.Â When it comes to flu, the viral protein NS1 blocks the PPR, inhibits IFN secretion and ISG expression, and blocks the UPR.Â In such a case, is NS1 amount critical to evading cellular pathways?Â In a recent publication, Dr. Daniel Blanco-Melo, an assistant professor at Fred Hutch, demonstrated that theÂ amount of NS1Â that is expressed during flu infection plays a significant role in evading host defenses. âInfluenza A virus (IAV) isÂ an importantÂ human respiratory pathogen that causes millions of cases of severe illness each year, and occasionallyÂ leadsÂ to pandemics,â said Dr. Yang, a postdoctoral fellow in Dr.Â Blanco-Melo'sÂ lab and leader of the study. âIAV deploys multiple strategies to attenuate the host response, most of whichÂ areÂ linkedÂ to the viral protein NS1,â he added. Their study demonstrates that âNS1 operates as a multifaceted immune modulator, selectively prioritizing specific host pathways crucial for its own replication,â he continued. To examine the host transcriptome in response to the expression of NS1, the team infected cells with viruses expressing high, intermediate, or no NS1 followed by bulk RNA sequencing.Â Differential gene expression analysis revealed thatÂ the amount of NS1, in part,Â shapes the host response.Â An intermediate level of NS1 expression inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while failing to inhibit the expression of ISGs.Â Conversely, high expression of NS1 inhibited the expression of ISGs and UPR target genes.Â Furthermore, the team examined single cell transcriptomics during flu infection.Â A cell population was infected with wild type influenza followed by an analysis of NS1 expression in each cell. Individually infected cells were grouped according to their level of NS1 expression.Â Once again, the team found that NS1 has a significant impact on the host's response.Â AlthoughÂ intermediate expression of NS1 was sufficient to evade immune detection by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, high expression of NS1 was necessary to inhibit the expression of ISGs.Â Additionally, high NS1 expression is required for the inhibition of UPR genes, which are usually activated by the later stages of viral replication.Â These results suggest that the virus fine tunes the antagonistic potency of NS1 against different host responses to accommodate its replication needs. âThisÂ work not only refinesÂ our understanding of NS1's role in immune evasion but also introduces a novel perspective on the hierarchy of hostÂ immuneÂ pathways targeted by IAV,â said Dr. Young. âThe findings have broader implications for antiviral strategies, offering insights into potential vulnerabilities in the virus's immune evasion tactics.â The expression of the influenza viral protein NS1 modulates the hostâs antiviral immunity. Image provided by Dr. Yang Going forward the team is interested in identifying the âspecific host factors that mediate NS1's differential effects on pathogen sensing, interferon response, and ER stress responseâ as well as understanding how the âtemporal dynamics of NS1 expression correlate with the progression of IAV infection,â and how âthese dynamics influence host immune responses over time.â The team would also like to better understand if âdifferent strains of IAV exhibit variability in the host-specificity, frequency, and abundance of NS1 in relation to the magnitude of host response suppression.â They ultimately hope that this research will âhelp unveil the intricate dynamics of virus-mediated immune antagonism, providing insights for targeted antiviral therapies.â This work was funded byÂ the University of Washington Department of Global Health T32 postdoctoral training grant, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant, and the Immunology and Vaccine Development Program of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.Â Fred Hutch/University of Washington/Seattle Childrenâs Cancer Consortium member Dr. Daniel blanco-Melo contributed to this study.

(Photo: CBS Austin)TOPICS:InfluenzaCOVID-19FluTexasRSVVaccinesRespiratory virusesHealth precautionsAUSTIN, Texas — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are urging Americans to take holiday health precautions as respiratory viruses continue spreading nationwide.Influenza, COVID-19, and RSV are all circulating right now. According to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services, flu activity is considered high and continuing to climb."We've noticed definitely a big uptick in flu, a small rise in COVID and still having lingering effects of RSV," said Dr. Vard Curtis, emergency department medical director at St. David's South Austin Medical Center. His ER is seeing typical seasonal increases in respiratory viruses."There's a lot of overlap between flu and COVID so the testing is what we rely on. They both cause high fevers, really bad body aches, often cough, sometimes shortness of breath, runny nose, no energy," said Curtis.The same guidance issued during the pandemic applies now:wash hands oftenget vaccinatedstay home if you're sickavoid exposing immunocompromised people to viruses"Flu to you and me can be a couple of days of feeling lousy, but flu to an elderly person or someone with a kidney transplant or cancer diagnosis... it can be fatal," said Curtis.ALSO| New coronavirus subvariant is on the rise in US this holiday seasonStatewide, positive flu tests in hospitals are up 5.5 percent from the previous week, according to Texas DSHS. The latest data shows that 15 percent of flu tests in Texas are positive. In Austin, about 10 percent of flu and COVID tests are positive, according to Austin Public Health."Know there are a lot of people who are out there doing home testing, so that COVID number may not represent the total number of cases that are out there in the community," said Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County Health Authority.Austin Public Health is urging people to think twice before gathering with others when feeling under the weather."We're going to be hugging and sharing meals and laughing and enjoying this holiday season, and its best to do that if you're not sick, so you're not spreading it to loved ones-- especially those that can't fight off infection as well," said Walkes.According to the CDC, this year's influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are proving to be a pretty good match for the strains of the virus going around. Influenza typically peaks between December and February but flu season lasts until May.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Guidance on development and implementation of a national deployment and vaccination plan for vaccines against pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses of pandemic potential - World | ReliefWeb Skip to main content Help Log in ReliefWeb Content Search What are you looking for?

However, planning for accessing, allocating and deploying vaccines in a pandemic situation is a complex endeavour, beset with multiple challenges at all levels – local, regional and global. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners have prepared this revised guidance document to assist countries update their national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs) by leveraging global learnings from past pandemic responses, including the recent COVID-19 vaccination effort. The development and testing of a NDVP would not only advance pandemic preparedness efforts but would also have benefits in terms of increasing national capabilities to manage other health emergencies which require emergency vaccination campaigns.

Back to Healio Key takeawaysInfection with viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can have long-term health consequences.In a study, COVID-19 was linked to a 51% greater risk for death than influenza.Similar to SARS-CoV-2, which can cause long COVID, people hospitalized with influenza are at an increased risk for health issues long after they have cleared the infection, according to a study.“We and others have previously compared short-term outcomes of COVID-19 and influenza but no one had done a comparative analysis for long-term outcomes” Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development at VA Saint Louis Health Care System and clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told Healio. The new study “comparing the burden of health loss in the post-acute phase of influenza infection was inspired by our previous research on long COVID, which showed that the burden of health loss is higher in the post-acute phase of COVID-19 than the acute phase. We wanted to know if this also happens in influenza — and yes, it does,” Al-Aly said.Other viruses are known to cause long-term health problems, including Ebola.Although both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can cause respiratory disease, their potential long-term effects are not the same. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 can attack a wide range of organ systems, influenza is “truly more of a respiratory virus,” according to Al-Aly, and poses more of a risk to the pulmonary system than COVID-19. Al-Aly and colleagues analyzed data from the Department of Veterans Affairs on 81,280 people hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and 10,985 people admitted to the hospital with seasonal influenza between Oct. 1, 2015, and Feb. 28, 2019. They followed study participants for up to 18 months to evaluate their risk for death, 94 individual health outcomes related to 10 organ systems, and admission and readmission to the ICU. The researchers then estimated the risk for adverse events and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 persons.During the 18 months of follow-up, the COVID-19 group had a 51% greater risk for death (HR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.45-1.58) than people in the influenza group, with an excess death rate of 8.62 (95% CI, 7.55-9.44) per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group compared with the influenza group, according to the study.Comparative analyses of the 94 individual health outcomes showed that patients with COVID-19 had an increased risk for 68.1% (64 of 94) of the outcomes compared with 6.4% (six of 94) for people with influenza. The researchers found that COVID-19 posed a higher risk to nine of 10 organ systems compared with influenza, the exception being the pulmonary system. The cumulative rates of adverse health outcomes across all organ systems also was greater for people with COVID-19 at 615.18 (95% CI, 605.17-624.88) compared with influenza, at 536.90 (95% CI, 527.38-544.90). Additionally, DALYs were 45.03 higher among patients with COVID-19 than people with influenza.Although the study showed that COVID-19 poses a greater risk to health than influenza, and a greater risk for long-term symptoms in both the acute and post-acute phases, the researchers determined that both carried a higher burden of health loss in the post-acute phase than during the acute phase.“Before the pandemic, far too many people trivialized acute viral infections as inconsequential,” Al-Aly said. “This pandemic has taught us otherwise. Acute viral infections can have serious and sometimes debilitating long-term consequences.“This will help us understand long COVID, other infection-associated chronic illnesses and also help us be better prepared for the next pandemic. Wasting this historic opportunity to learn would be a colossal and tragic mistake.”Al-Aly said that, based on the study, “long COVID is much more of a health problem than COVID-19, and long flu is much more of a health problem than influenza,” which reveals what he calls a “vastly under-recognized” lesson of the COVID-19 pandemic.“We don’t know why some infectious agents — which can include bacteria in some cases — may also cause chronic illnesses,” he said. “We need to study this more to develop a deeper understanding of why and how some acute infectious agents cause chronic diseases. This should be a major area of investigation and should be prioritized by governments and funding agencies.”References: Al-Aly Z, et al.

Primary respiratory cell lines are used in IAV research to model the host’s upper respiratory tract in vitro. However, primary cell lines are limited by their passaging capacity and are time-consuming for use in industry and research pipelines. We were interested in developing and characterizing a biologically relevant immortalized swine respiratory cell line that could be used for efficient propagation and characterization of swine IAV isolates. Methods: Lung tissue for the generation of primary swine respiratory cells were isolated from the bronchi of an 8-week-old Yorkshire/Hampshire pig, which were immortalized by transduction of the SV40 T antigen using a lentivirus vector. The transduction of the SV40 T antigen was confirmed by Real Time RT-PCR in cells passaged greater than twenty times. Results: Immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed primarily α2,6 sialic acid receptors and were susceptible to both swine and human IAVs, with swine viruses exhibiting higher replication rates. Notably, infection with a swine H3N2 isolate prompted increased IL-6 and IL-1α protein secretion compared to a seasonal human H3N2 virus. Even after 20 passages, the immortalized cells maintained the primary respiratory cell phenotype and remained permissive to IAV infection without exogenous trypsin. Discussion: In summary, our developed immortalized swine respiratory cell line offers an alternative in vitro substrate for studying IAV replication and transmission dynamics in pigs, overcoming the limitations of primary respiratory cells in terms of low passage survivability and cost. Introduction Influenza A viruses (IAV) are enveloped, negative sensed RNA viruses with a single stranded and segmented genome, which belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Wild birds serve as the natural host reservoir for IAV. However, IAV has a relatively wide host range and has been isolated in both avian and mammalian species including: domesticated birds, humans, swine, canines, equines, felines, and aquatic mammals. The ability of IAV to jump multiple species barriers is enabled by the segmented nature of the IAVs genome, which enables reassortment of whole gene segments between co-infecting IAV strains and lack of a proofreading mechanism enabling rapid drift of the viruses surface glycoproteins (1). In mammalian hosts, IAV is known to cause repiratory disease. IAV enters into respiratory tract and enters into primariliy respiratory epithelial cells that express glycoprotein receptors that terminate with sialic acids (SA). The SA is attached to a galactose molecule, which provides a recognition site for the receptor binding domain (RBS) of the IAV haemagluttin (HA) protein, facilitating receptor mediated endocytosis. The HA protein can bind to SA recptors in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linked confirmation. Strains of avian-origin preferentially bind to host cells in an 2,3 confirguration, whilst mammalian-origin strains preferentially bind in an 2,6 configuration (2–6). The distribution of SA receptors is implicated as a host range factor that IAVs must overcome to cross species barriers. In the human and swine hosts, the distribution of α2,3 and α2,6 linked SA are similar in the respiratory tract (7–9). However, IAVs encoding solely human (hu) origin gene segment are isolated from swine during passive survellance (10–13).This suggests that reverse zoonotic transmission of IAVs at the human/swine interface is not solely dependent on SA distribution of the host, and multiple host and viral factors are involved with the ability of the IAV to efficiently transmit and replicate within the swine host (14). Cell lines are often used in IAV research to propagate and to assess the transmission and replicationary potential of novel isolates within a particular host for pandemic prepardation. Primary respiratory epithelial cell lines are currently the gold-standard cellular model for assessing the physical properties of IAV strains and can be fully differentiated in an air–liquid interface (ALI) system to produce a pseudostratified epithelium, containing ciliated cells and goblet cells, that models the respiratory structure and architechture of the hosts lungs in vitro (3, 15–18). However, primary cell lines are limited by the low number of passages before reaching senescense, susceptibility to contamination and verification of the absense of pathogens, high cost of reagents needed to grow and maintain the cells in ALI, donor-to-donor varibility, availability of host tissue, and the time taken to fully differentiate the cells (3–4 weeks in ALI). Consequently, immortalized respiratory cell lines are used as an alternative cellular model to study the properties of IAV isolates to a susceptible host. However, immortalized respiratory cell lines may have altered physical properties to the primary host cell. This includes losing the ability to secrete proteases neccesary for IAV entry into the host cell and differentiate. Immortalized swine tracheal (siTEC) and nasal epithelial (siNEC) cells have been previously developed by transducing the SV40-T antigen using a lentivirus vector (19). The siTEC and siNEC cell lines were permissible to H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 IAV strains and retained the functional characteristics of the primary cells (19). In this study, we developed an immortalized swine bronchial epithelial cell line for IAV research by introducing Simian Virus 40 (SV40-T) antigen into primary swine respiratory cells harvested from the bronchi of an 8 weeks old porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) and IAV seronegative pig. Porcine bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) have been immortalized by delivering human telomerase reverse transcriptase (h-TERT), to extend the replicative capacity of cells through telomerase extention (20). However, our primary objective was to establish an immortalized swine bronchial epithelial cell line via transduction of SV40-T antigen. The immortalized swine respiratory cells appeared mostly of epithelial origin and retained morphological characteristics of the swine primary cells. In addition, both primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells were permissive to human (huIAV) and swine (swIAV) IAVs of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes that most predominantly circulate at the human/swine interface and modelled host restriction of wholly human-origin H3N2 observed in the swine host. Our results suggest that the immortalized swine respiratory cells could be used as an appropriate immortalized cellular model for the lower respiratory tract of the swine host and may serve as a tool to study the transmission and replicationary potential of novel IAV strains. Materials and methods Cell culture and virus stocks Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’ medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. The MDCK cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Influenza A viruses used in this study were propogated in MDCK cells (ATCC). Virus titers were quantified by TCID50 and calculated using the Reed and Muench method (21). Harvesting, isolation, and immortalization of primary respiratory swine cells Lung tissue for the isolation of swine respiratory cells were collected from an 8 weeks-old Yorkshire/Hampshire pig. Lung tissue was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sections from the bronchi were sliced into small pieces. The sliced bronchial tissue was incubated for 2 h with 800 U collagenase at 37°C and 5% CO2. Following collagenase digestion, respiratory cells were strained through a 70 μm cell strainer and centrifuged. The cell pellet was washed twice with PBS and cells were seeded onto collagen coated flasks. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM/F12 supplemented with FBS, retinoic acid, bovine pituitary extract (BPE), epidermal growth factor, cholera toxin, transferrin, insulin, and penicillin/streptomycin (growth media). Following the 24 h incubation, non-adherent cells were transferred to rat-tail collagen (Corning) coated flask and cultured until fully confluent. At passage four, primary swine respiratory cells were plated in growth media onto rat-tail collagen coated 6-well plates (1 × 105). Once the cells reached 70% confluence, the growth media was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Target primary swine respiratory cells were infected and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2 with 107 Lenti-SV40T vector (abm) in the presence of 10 μg/mL polybrene. Following the overnight incubation, supernatant from lentivirus infected swine cells was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Fresh growth media was added to the cells, which were incubated for 72 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. Immortalized swine respiratory cells were passaged >20 times and successful transduction of the SV40 T antigen gene into the immortalized swine respiratory cells was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using SV40 T antigen targeting primers 5’ ACTGAGGGGCCTGAAATGA, 5’ GACTCAGGGCATGAAAC AGG. Swine respiratory cells were confirmed of swine origin using swine GAPDH targeting primers 5’ ACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG and 5’ ACGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC. Immunoflurescent staining and confocal microscopy Immortalized (P20) and primary (P6) swine respiratory cells were seeded (1 × 105) into 6-well plates to 70–80% confluency onto coverslips coated with rat-tail collagen (Corning) and inoculated with either control/PBS, A/TX/12/H3N2 or A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 diluted in PBS (−/−). At 24 hpi, cells were washed twice and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeablised with 0.5% TritonX/PBS for 30 min. The cells were blocked in 10% goat serum with PBS/Tween20 for 1 h prior to staining with the primary antibodies: Cytokeratin 18 staining Immortalized and primary swine respiratory cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-cytokeratin 18 mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) (1,200). Vimentin staining Immortalized and primary swine respiratory cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-vimentin rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam) (1:400). Lectin staining Immortalized and primary swine respiratory cells were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated Maakia amurensis lectin I and II (Vector® Laboratories) (1:800), to stain α2,3-linked SA receptors or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Sambucus nigra agglutinin (Vector® Laboratories) (1,200) to stain for α2,6-linked SA receptors. Influenza A virus staining Immortalized swine respiratory cells were incubated for 45 min with anti-alpha tubulin (1:800), anti-beta-tubulin (1:200), and anti-influenza A nucleoprotein (1:500). After staining with the apprapriate primary antibodies, cells were washed 3× with PBS/Tween20 and stained with secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen) (1:400), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) (1:400) or goat anti-mouse FITC (1:400). Coverslips were transferred to slides and mounted using slowfade mounting medium (Invitrogen). The slides were visualized using ECHO revolve flourescent microscope (ECHO A Bico Company, San Diego, CA). All captured images were edited and process using FIJI software (22). Influenza A virus infections Immortalized (P24) swine respiratory cells were seeded (1 × 105) onto 6-well plates and cultured in growth media onto rat-tail collegen (Corning) coated 6-well plates until 80% confluency. Cells were then washed in PBS and inoculated with a panel of hu- and swIAVs (Table 1) at an MOI of 0.1 diluted in PBS (−/−). Following IAV inoculation, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 before washing cells with PBS and replacing the inoculum with fresh FBS free growth media. The inoculated cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 until the appropriate end point of collection (0-, 24-, 48-, 72-hpi). At this point, cell supernatant was harvested and IAV was quantified by TCID50 and calculated using the Reed and Muench method as previously described. Samples were analyzed using three biological replicates from each time point. TABLE 1 Table 1. Immortalized swine respiratory cells are permissible to hu and swIAV strains of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes. Quantification of cytokine/chemokine secretion from primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells Supernatant from primary (P6) and immortalized (P24) swine respiratory cell inoculated with either A/TX/12/H3N2 or A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 harvested at −24 and −48 hpi was analyzed for IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 secretion using the MILLIPLEX MAP Porcine Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead panel per manufacture’s instruction (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. A two-way ANOVA was used to identify significance differences between IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted from the immortalized (P24) and primary (P6) swine respiratory cells that were either mock infected (PBS), or inoculated independently with A/TX/12/H3N2 or A/swine/MN/12/H3N2. To determine the percentage of vimentin positive cells in the immortalized (P20) and primary (P6) swine respiratory cell lines, IF images taken on the ECHO revolve flourescent microscope (ECHO A Bico Company, San Diego, CA) were processed using FIJI software and vimentin positive cells were counted and subtracted from the number of DAPI positive cells (n = 3). Results Immortalized swine respiratory cells maintain functional properties of primary cell counterparts Primary swine respiratory cells were isolated from the bronchi of an 8 weeks old Yorkshire/Hampshire and immortalized by transduction of the SV40-T antigen following 4 successful passages (Figure 1). The immortalized swine respiratory cells were successfully passaged >20 times, whilst primary swine respiratory cells failed to proliferate at P16. SV40 T antigen retention in the immortalized swine respiratory cells was confirmed by rt-qPCR, with a mean SV40-T antigen Cq value of 27.7 (n = 3) in cells passaged 20 times (Supplementary Table S1). Visually, immortalized swine respiratory cells maintained the morphological features of primary swine respiratory epithelial cells, such as, possessing the ability to form tight-junctions and a cobble-stone like appearance (Figure 2). The primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed both α2,3 and α2,6 linked SA receptors, which are an important host restriction factor for IAV entry into the host cell (Figure 3). Both primary and immortalized cell lines expressed α2,6 linked SA receptors at a higher abundance compared to α2,3 linked SA receptors (Figure 3). In addition, the immortalized swine respiratory cells appeared to be mostly of epithelial origin, which was demonstrated by the majority of visualized cells expressing the epithelial marker cytokeratin 18 (Figure 4). Staining with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibroblast marker vimentin, demonstrated that the isolated primary swine respiratory cells contained a high percentage (56.7%) of contaminating cells (Supplementary Figure S1). However, following trypsin-treatment and immortalization via SV40-T antigen transduction, we observed a decrease in the mean percentage of vimentin positive cells (32.08%), which was maintained up to 20 passages (Supplementary Figure S1). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Experimental design. (A) Respiratory tract tissue was harvested from an 8 weeks-old Yorkshire/Hampshire pig. 1 cm bronchial tissue slices were collagenase digested for 2 h at 37°C and swine respiratory cells were scraped and filtered through a 70 μM sieve. Primary swine respiratory cells were seeded onto uncoated flasks and non-adherent cells were transferred to a collagen coated flask following 4 h incubation. (B) Transduction of SV40 T antigen. Primary swine respiratory cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and inoculated with 10^7 SV40-lentivirus in the presence of polybrene.

Primary (P6) and immortalized swine respiratory (P20) cells were seeded onto 6-well rat-tail collagen coated coverslips and stained with DAPI (blue) and either Maackia amurensis (MAA, red) or Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA, green) lectins. Magnification ×10, Scale Bar 90 μm. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Immortalized swine respiratory cells are primarily of epithelial origin. Following harvesting, isolation, and immortalization, both the primary (P6) and immortalized (P20) swine respiratory cells were seeded onto 6 well rat-tail collagen coated coverslips and stained for cytokeratin 18 (green) and DAPI (blue). Magnification ×10. We evaluated the permissibility of either cell lines to IAV’s of mammalian origin, given the similar distribution of SA receptors to the swine hosts respiratory tract. Both primary and immortalized swine respiratory cell lines were permissive to A/TX/2012/H3N2 (Figure 5A), pdm A/CA/2009/H1N1 (Figure 5B) huIAV strains, A/swine/GA/2019/H1N2 (Figure 5C), and A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 swIAV strains (Figure 5D). However, A/TX/2012/H3N2 replicated to lower titers compared to the other panel of IAV strains, which was most pronounced at 72-hpi (Figure 5A). This trend was reflected in both the primary and immortalized swine respiratory cell lines, which suggests that the host specificity of swine respiratory cells was not impacted by immortalization via SV40 T antigen transduction. FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells are permissible to hu- and swIAVs. Primary (solid black line) and Immortalized (dashed red line) respiratory swine cells (P6 and P24 respectively), were seeded onto 6-well rat-tail collagen coated coverslips and inoculated independently with either A/TX/2012/H3N2 (A), A/CA/2009/H1N1 (B), A/swine/GA/2019/H1N2 (C), or A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 (D) at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatant was harvest, 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-hpi and viral titers were quantified by TCID50. Immortalized swine respiratory cells are permissible to IAV strains of human and swine H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes The viral replication kinetics of both human and swine-origin strains were evaluated to assess the permissiveness of the immortalized cells to IAV strains of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes. The panel of strains were selected to represent IAV subtypes that commonly circulate at the human/swine interface. The immortalized swine respiratory cells were permissible to the entire panel of IAV strains, regardless of IAV host-origin or subtype (Table 1). However, we did measure differences in the ability of individual strains to replicate within the immortalized cell line. Generally, huIAV H3N2 strains replicated poorly within the immortalized swine respiratory cell compared to swIAVs. The highest difference between peak titers were measured between A/swine/GA/2019/H1N2 (7.83 TCID50/mL), and A/TX/2012/H3N2 (1.17 TCID50/mL) at 72-hpi. Whilst the greatest difference in area under curve (AUC) was observed between A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 (438.5), and the A/HongKong/2014/H3N2 huIAV strain (181.8). Overall, the replication kinetics of the panel of IAVs imply that the swIAVs replicate more efficiently in the immortalized swine respiratory cells, which provides evidence of swine host specificity. We observed no differences in the viral titers and AUC values between A/CA/2009/H1N1 (pdm strain), A/NewCal/1999/H1N1 (pre-pandemic strain), and A/WI/2019/H1N1 (post-pandemic-like strain) at 24-, 48-, and 72-hpi (Table 1). Wholly huIAV H3N2 strains replicate poorly and produce a mild pro-inflammatory cytokine response in immortalized swine respiratory cells From the panel of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 hu and sw-origin IAVs evaluated in the immortalized swine respiratory cells (Table 1), we selected A/TX/2012/H3N2 and A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 strain, encoding the triple reassortment internal gene (TRIG) cassette, to compare the replication and pro-inflammatory responses between wholly huIAV and swIAV H3N2 strains. Using immunohistochemistry, we were unable to visualize A/TX/2012/H3N2 nucleoprotein (NP) at 24-hpi (Figure 6). Although, both the A/TX/2012/H3N2 and A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 NP protein was visualized at 72-hpi (Figure 6). This showed that there was a delay in the replication of the wholly huIAV H3N2 strain, compared to the TRIG swIAV H3N2 strain in the immortalized swine respiratory cells. FIGURE 6 Figure 6. Human-origin H3N2 strain replicates poorly in immortalized swine respiratory cells compared to swIAV H3N2 counterpart. Immortalized swine respiratory cells (P20) were seeded onto 6-well rat-tail collagen coated coverslips and inoculated independently with either A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 or A/TX/2012.H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1. At 24 hpi, coverslips were stained with NP (red), alpha/beta actin (green), and DAPI (blue). Magnification ×10, Scale Bar 90 μm. We evaluated IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 pro-inflammatory cytokine protein production from the immortalized swine respiratory cells following independent inoculation from either A/TX/2012/H3N2 or A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2. There was no significant difference in production of IL-1α, IL-6, and IL-8 between the A/TX/2012/H3N2 and A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 infected immortalized swine respiratory cells at 24-hpi (Figures 7D–F). Whilst IL-1α and IL-6 secretion was significantly higher at 48-hpi when infected with A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 (Figures 7D,E). Additionally, IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was significantly higher at 48-hpi following inoculation from either A/TX/2012/H3N2 or A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 compared to the control (Figures 7E,F). FIGURE 7 Figure 7. swIAV of H3N2 subtype promotes robust pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in both immortalized and primary swine respiratory cells. Immortalized (P24) and primary (P6) swine respiratory cells were seeded onto 6-well collagen coated plates and inoculated independently with either control/PBS (black), A/TX/2012/H3N2 (blue), or A/swine/MN/2012/H3N2 (green) at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatant harvested from either primary or immortalized cells at −24 and −48 hpi was tested for (A,D) IL-1α, (B,E) IL-6, and (C,F) IL-8 cytokine/chemokine secretion with MILLIPLEX.

Discussion The development of an immortalized swine respiratory cell line is a useful tool for the assessment of novel IAV isolates from the field. Swine are an important natural and intermediate reservoir host species and are considered the ‘mixing vessel’ for the reassortment of co-infecting IAV strains in a singular host, leading to the generation of novel strains which may pose a pandemic threat to humans. This is partially due to the highly diverse pool of currently circulating IAV strains in the swine host, which increases the potential combinations of novel strains evolving. In addition, many of the circulating strains incorporate wholly human IAV gene segments into their genome and generate novel strains that possess the molecular tools to transmit and replicate within the human host. The gold-standard in vitro model for assessing the pandemic potential of novel isolates at the human/swine interface includes primary respiratory epithelial cells isolated from the host and fully differentiated in ALI. However, given the time taken to fully differentiate the primary cell lines, we were interested in developing an immortalized respiratory epithelial cell line that maintained the characteristic of the primary swine host. This would enable a more efficient pipeline for identifying the transmission and replication success of novel IAV isolates within the swine host and fast-track the development of vaccines against highly virulent strains. In this study, we harvested and isolated respiratory cells from the bronchi of an 8 weeks-old Yorkshire/Hampshire swine and immortalized the cell line by delivering the SV40-T antigen to the isolated primary cells. We demonstrated that immortalized swine respiratory cell lines were primarily of epithelial origin, as indicated through expression of CK18, which has been used as a marker for respiratory epithelial cells and simple epithelia (23). In addition, staining for potential contaminating cells, such as, fibroblasts and epithelial-mesenchymal transitioning (EMT) cells, revealed that there was a decrease in the percentage of contaminating cells following immortalization via SV40 T antigen transduction (Supplementary Figure S1). However, we were unable to develop a pure population of immortalized swine bronchial epithelial cells and our mixed immortalized swine respiratory cell line contained approximately 30% of undesired fibroblastic or EMT cells. We demonstrated that both the primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed both α2,3 and α2,6 SA receptors in a similar distribution to what is observed in the lower respiratory tract of the swine host (2, 4, 9). Since, the primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells expressed α2,6 SA, we proposed that both the primary and immortalized cell lines would be permissible to mammalian IAVs and would be an appropriate model to assess strains isolated at the human/swine interface. We measured the replication kinetics of four IAV isolates in both the primary and immortalized swine respiratory cell lines, which included the wholly human-origin A/TX/12/H3N2 huIAV, A/CA/09/H1N1 pandemic strain (pdm09) belonging to the pandemic clade (1A.3.3.2), A/swine/GA/19/H1N2 delta 2 clade (1B.2.1), and A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 swIAVs (Figure 4). The primary swine respiratory cells were permissible to all tested huIAV and swIAVs. However, A/TX/12/H3N2 huIAV replicated to lower titers and for a reduced time in comparison to either of the tested swIAVs, or A/CA/09/H1N1 that originated from the swine host. We hypothesized that this phenomenon observed within the primary swine respiratory cells was due to a lack of adaptation of the huIAV to the swine respiratory cells leading to a robust innate immune response to prevent viral replication. Additionally, we observed similar replication kinetics of the four IAVs in the immortalized swine respiratory cells. Although, the trends observed with the IAV titers were mostly exaggerated in the immortalized swine respiratory cell line, which we theorize could be caused by the immortalization process selecting for a more homogeneous cellular population. In future studies, it would be interesting to further characterize the immortalized cellular population and identify molecular determinants that are selected for during SV40-T antigen immortalization. In addition, to characterize the innate immune responses within sub-populations of immortalized swine respiratory cells that enable enhanced replication of hu- and swIAVs. We assessed the replication kinetics of an extensive panel of H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 hu- and swIAVs isolated between 1999 and 2019 in the immortalized swine respiratory cells. All isolates used in the study were permissible in the immortalized swine respiratory cells without the need of trypsin protease to enable IAV entry in the host cell. This implies that protease secretion was not lost following SV40-T antigen immortalization. Mostly, H3N2 huIAVs replicated poorly in the immortalized swine respiratory cells compared to H1N1 or H3N2 strains encoding gene segments of swine-origin. This poor replication of wholly huIAV H3N2 strains has been observed experimentally in the swine host and requires further investigation from both a host and viral standpoint. Surprisingly, we observed similar replication titers and total AUC curve values between pre-pdm09 A/NewCal/99/H1N1, pdm09 A/CA/09/H1N1, and post-pdm09 A/WI/19/H1N1 strains. The pdm strain was a novel reassortment of IAV gene segments of human, classical swine, and avian origin, which was first transmitted to the human host in early 2009. The A/CA/2009/H1N1 strain was able to efficiently transmit between humans, leading to a global pandemic outbreak (24). Accordingly, we were surprised to observe no significant differences between the replication kinetics of A/NewCal/99/H1N1 and A/CA/09/H1N1 in the immortalized swine respiratory cells. However, this observation may highlight limitations in utilizing solely in vitro assays to model the complex physiology and immunity of the swine host, which includes multiple physical barriers and cell types that determine the infectivity of IAV within the swine host. Additionally, previous studies have investigated the effects of temperature on the replication kinetics of huIAVs and swIAVs within swine host cells, which we did not address in this study (11, 25). It would be of interest to assess host body temperature and its role as a host factor that IAVs must overcome to efficiently replicate within primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells. In addition, to assess whether temperature influences the replication kinetics of IAVs possessing a specific arrangement of internal gene constellations. We were interested in measuring the differential pro-inflammatory response of the cell line following inoculation of either hu- or swIAVs. This was because of the differences observed between the replication kinetics of H3N2 subtypes in the immortalized swine respiratory cells (Table 1). In this study, we tested and compared A/TX/12/H3N2 huIAV and A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 swIAV, isolated from the same year and of the same subtype. We found that there was a significant increase in the production of IL-1α and IL-6 following inoculation of A/swine/MN/12/H3N2 at 48 hpi, compared to inoculation from A/TX/12/H3N2, and no significant difference in the secretion of IL-8 at 24 and 48 hpi (Figure 7). Previously, it has been demonstrated that fibroblasts secrete IL-6, and under specific conditions, IL-1α (26, 27). Consequently, it is essential to note that the observed increase in IL-6 and IL-1α following IAV inoculation may have been influenced by the proportion of contaminating cells in the primary and immortalized swine respiratory cell lines developed in this study. Nevertheless, despite this potential influence, we observed a significant increase in IL-1α and IL-6 production following inoculation with the swIAV H3N2 strain compared to the huIAV H3N2 counterpart (Figure 7). In the future, we want to further assess the cytokine production from the immortalized swine respiratory cell line inoculated with a broader panel of hu- and swIAVs. In addition, to extend the assessment of time points to compare the kinetics of secreted cytokines (28, 29). Conclusion We have developed an immortalized swine respiratory cell line that retained most of the characteristics of its primary swine respiratory cell counterpart. The immortalized swine respiratory cell line was still permissive to IAVs at passage 24 and did not require the addition of exogenous trypsin for IAV inoculation, which is mostly observed in primary epithelial cell lines that have undergone airlift in an ALI (9, 30, 31). It is important to continue to identify potential applications for the immortalized swine respiratory cell line for IAV research. In this study, we did not assess whether the isolated primary and immortalized swine respiratory cells could fully differentiate in the ALI system, which warrants investigation because the isolated cell were mostly of epithelial origin. This would provide more flexibility for the researcher to study IAV infectivity in an appropriate model that maintains the biological functionality of the swine hosts lower respiratory tract.

You can also get sick by touching something with the flu virus on it and then transferring it to your mouth, nose or eyes.So far this year's flu activity is something between last year's "very aggressive" flu season and pre-pandemic flu seasons, said Dr. Michael Mina, chief science officer at Miami-based telehealth company eMed. Last year's flu season spiked as people who'd been masking and staying at home went back to "pre-pandemic levels of in-person engagement," he said. As a result, the flu virus "spread more rapidly and more robustly," Mina said.This year, holiday travelers are heading out into a population that's been reluctant to get vaccines against viruses. The CDC last week issued a health advisory to medical caregivers saying that low vaccination rates against influenza, COVID-19, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) "could lead to more severe disease and increased healthcare capacity strain in the coming weeks."Across the U.S. visits to health care providers for respiratory illnesses rose 5.1% in the week ending Dec. 16, according to the CDC. Positive lab tests for influenza rose to 12% of all tests given, up from 10% in the previous week. Overall, labs have processed more than 949,800 tests since Oct. 1, 2023, with more than 52,800 being positive for the flu, the CDC says."We're definitely seeing activity (and) it is widespread," Torriani said. With cases of RSV and COVID-19 also on the rise, "we are having a viral respiratory fest."What are some flu symptoms?People who get the flu may have any or all of these symptoms, the CDC says: fever or feeling feverish – not everyone who has the flu will have a fever – chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue.Vomiting and diarrhea may also accompany the flu, however, children are more likely to have those symptoms than adults.About 8% of the U.S. population will get sick with the flu each year. Usually they get a mild to severe illness. However, about 21,000 died from the flu during the 2022-2023 season, the CDC says.COVID-19: How and where to get tests before the holidays as cases of JN.1 variant surgeStates in the US with the most flu activityHere are the latest findings of flu activity from the CDC's Influenza-like Illness Activity Level Indicator (ILINet):Very high flu activity levels (9 states and New York City): Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and New York City.High flu activity (14 states and the District of Columbia): Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.Moderate flu activity (11 states): Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.Low flu activity (9 states): Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Oklahoma, and Utah.Minimal flu activity (10 jurisdictions): Delaware, Minnesota, Oregon, Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.How to protect yourself from flu and viruses during the holidaysWith 115.2 million Americans expected to travel over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, there's a likelihood that some of them will be sick. Here are some tips for travelers and those gathering with them:Mask up. In crowded places such as airports, train stations and shopping malls, wear a mask.Increase ventilation at home. If it's not too cold, crack a few windows to increase the low of air through the home – a preventive measure found to decrease the likelihood of spreading COVID-19 and other viruses, according to the CDC. You can also turn on exhaust fans in bathrooms or above the stove. Have ceiling fans and have other fans running, but pointed away from people.Test to see if you actually are sick before the gathering. Consider who will be at your gathering, suggests eMed's Dr. Mina. "Is your 92-year-old grandma going to be at the Christmas dinner table with you? Or how about your diabetic cousin with three different comorbidities? If so, then it might be a good idea to try to ask people to test the morning before getting together or, at a minimum, ask those who have symptoms of a respiratory infection to test for COVID-Influenza," said Mina, who worked with the National Institutes of Health on The Home Test to Treat program, which provides free COVID-Flu home tests for those who are uninsured or get government health care.Remember other COVID-19 practices. In addition to masking, "wash your hands frequently, practice social distancing … (and) stay home when sick," said Dr. Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network.Many of these tips are similar to how we were expected to act coming out of the COVID-19 lockdown. "We learned some lessons during the pandemic about what we can do to not be miserable," Torriani said.Is it too late to get a flu vaccine?No. While it takes about two weeks for the vaccine to provide full protective effects, remember the flu season can go into March, says Dr. Wesley Self, professor of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He collaborated with several other medical experts and the CDC on a study, released earlier this month, which found flu shots given during last year's flu season reduced the risk of hospitalization by 37% overall."Given what we see currently, we would likely expect flu activity to continue increasing into January and possibly February, which would be similar to last year," he told USA TODAY.Are fewer people getting vaccinations?Yes. Pharmacies and medical offices had administered 7.7 million fewer flu shots as of Nov. 25, compared to the same period in 2022, according to the CDC. Overall, about 32.2 million doses were given in pharmacies and 18.9 million in medical offices, the CDC says.And it's not just flu vaccination rates that are down. People aren't getting shots to fend off COVID-19 and RSV at the levels health care providers would prefer, either. "We are seeing a very low uptake in vaccinations this year and that is worrisome," Torriani said.Flu vaccination rates: About 69.3% of adults 65 and older, 42.2% of adults 18 and older, and 43.3% of children have gotten a flu shot, the CDC says.COVID-19 vaccination rates: The CDC says about 37.4% of adults 66 and older, 18.3% of adults 18 and older, and 7.8% of children have gotten the updated vaccine.RSV vaccination rates: About 17% of adults 60 and older have gotten an RSV vaccination, the CDC says.Follow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.What's everyone talking about?

CNN — The coronavirus subvariant JN.1 is now the fastest growing strain of the virus in the United States. The strain now constitutes about 20% of new Covid-19 infections, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the Northeast, JN.1 has become the dominant variant. Meanwhile, the CDC has issued an alert to clinicians about the need to increase immunizations for influenza, Covid-19, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The public health agency reported that in the past four weeks, hospitalizations across all age groups increased by 200% for influenza, 60% for RSV and 51% for Covid-19. Ill woman looking at thermometer at home. Guido Mieth/Digital Vision/Getty Images As respiratory viruses spread everywhere, what should you do if you get sick? This rise in infections is coming just before the holidays, when families across the country are planning get-togethers. What should people know about the winter viruses that are causing hospitals to fill up once again? What precautions should individuals be taking this holiday season? What should people keep in mind as they are traveling? And what additional steps can event organizers take to help reduce the chance of viruses spreading? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Let’s begin with the coronavirus. What should people know about the JN.1 subvariant? Dr. Leana Wen: The JN.1 subvariant is a descendant of another subvariant, BA.2.86. Both are part of the Omicron strain that has been dominant since 2022. JN.1 has already spread across parts of Europe and Asia, and is now rapidly gaining a foothold in the US. The good news is that the tools we have should still be effective against JN.1. And we have many more tools against the coronavirus than we did two winters ago. The updated coronavirus vaccine is widely available, as are antiviral treatments, such as Paxlovid. The CDC alert to clinicians discussed the importance of urging patients to be up-to-date on their vaccines as well as to make use of available treatments. Together, vaccines and treatments are highly effective in reducing severe illness, which will also help alleviate the strain that many hospitals are facing. CNN: What about the flu and RSV? Why is it important for people to also get vaccinated against these viruses? Wen: Hospitalizations for the flu and RSV are also climbing. There are safe and effective vaccines available for both, but vaccination rates remain low. Sad on Christmas. Unhappy, lonely or tired man with stress, grief or depression. Family fight, loneliness, frustration or money problem on Xmas. Sick person with flu, pain and headache on holiday Tero Vesalainen/iStockphoto/Getty Images Could the most magical time of year be so full of loneliness, anger and stress? According to the CDC’s clinician alert, as of November 18, there were 7.4 million fewer influenza vaccine doses administered to adults in pharmacies and physician offices compared with the 2022-2023 influenza season. Childhood flu vaccination rates are also lagging; they are at under 36% this year, compared with just over 39% at this point last year. As for RSV, only about 15% of eligible older adults have received it. Everyone 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine. And the RSV vaccine is available to those 60 and older. Vaccination reduces the chance of infection, and, crucially, reduces the risk of progression to severe illness and death. CNN: In addition to vaccination, what precautions should individuals be taking this holiday season? Wen: The level of precautions people take will depend on their own medical circumstances and those of people they will be gathering with. If someone is generally healthy, as is everyone they plan to spend time with, general precautions, such as good handwashing and staying away from others when ill, may be sufficient. For these individuals, their holiday gatherings will probably be no different compared with pre-pandemic days. Make a habit of frequent handwashing to help reduce the risk of catching or spreading winter viruses. Charday Penn/E+/Getty Images On the other hand, if someone is elderly, immunocompromised, and/or has serious underlying heart, lung or other conditions, they may opt for additional precautions. These folks may wish to wear an N95 or equivalent mask while in indoor public spaces. When gathering with others, try to stay outdoors or, if indoors, in well-ventilated and uncrowded spaces. If you are healthy but are going to be with those who are vulnerable, it’s advisable to speak with them to find out what precautions they would like for you to take. Perhaps they will ask that you take a rapid Covid-19 test prior to seeing them. Perhaps your loved one would prefer to socialize with you in a room with just a couple of people and not a large, loud party where there are lots of people standing shoulder to shoulder and having to shout at one another to be heard. Perhaps they will ask that everyone gathering reduces their virus exposure in the days prior to the get-together. It’s best to take the cues from the most vulnerable and most cautious people in these situations. CNN: What should people keep in mind as they are traveling? Wen: Again, this will depend on how careful someone is trying to be. For people who prioritize avoiding viruses, they should consider wearing a well-fitting, high-quality mask while in crowded airports and train stations. These folks should stay away from packed restaurants and bars. Consider packing home coronavirus tests when you’re on the go so you can test if you develop symptoms, or if requested by someone you are gathering with. funny cat at home sitting at home Beautiful Christmas background with a new year daccor, Christmas tree with embellishments. Christmas card with a Christmas. Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Moment RF/Getty Images Pets and holidays: A recipe for disaster? People traveling away from home should also have a plan should they become ill. Are they eligible for antiviral treatment, and if so, where and how will they obtain it? If they need to seek urgent medical care, where will they go? If they become symptomatic, where will they isolate? It’s better to think through all of this in advance and make sure those around you know of these plans. CNN: What additional steps can event organizers take to help reduce the chance of viruses spreading? Wen: People organizing holiday gatherings can make them safer by opening doors and windows to improve ventilation. For those living in parts of the country where this is possible, having an outdoor option allows those who are being more cautious the ability to attend and socialize. Buffets can be made safer by asking people to go in small groups, not congregating around food and drink, and making hand sanitizer widely available. If there are people attending who have expressed that they need to take extra precautions, consider asking guests to take a rapid home coronavirus test the same day as the gathering. The home test won’t find every case of Covid-19, but it does help identify those with a high viral load. Keep in mind, though, that the coronavirus is not the only virus that can be dangerous to vulnerable individuals. This is why it’s so important that people are vaccinated to protect themselves and reduce their risk of severe disease.

According to the latest report by the UKHSA, which covers 4-10 December, there was a rise in influenza-like-illness consultations in primary care from 4.6 to 5.3 per 100,000, compared with the previous week.There has also been an increase in influenza hospitalisations, and emergency department attendances and flu admissions to intensive care have both risen.However, the report suggests that while rising, such activity currently remains within baseline or low-impact ranges.‘Long flu’: study finds flu patients at higher risk of longer-term illnessRead more“Influenza infections always rise in the winter, usually peaking some time about December to February. The only uncertainty is how high infections will rise and exactly when the peak will happen,” said Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia. “At present, flu trends look like most years prior to Covid.”What about Covid?Covid levels are also on the rise. While the UKHSA has delayed the release of its winter Covid infection survey results for England and Scotland, the national influenza and Covid-19 surveillance report reveals an increase in case rates and positivity in pillar one (largely hospital testing), with a small increase in Covid hospitalisations.How can I tell whether I have flu or Covid?To know for sure you’d need to have a test, as both can make you feel terrible and they share some common symptoms, including fatigue and fever.“It is increasingly difficult to distinguish the symptoms of flu and Covid,” said Hunter. “Problems with sense of smell are more common in Covid and muscle aches and pains are more common in flu but the difference is not sufficient to be diagnostic.”What should I do?Public health experts have urged all those eligible for Covid or flu jabs on the NHS to make sure they get vaccinated to protect themselves from serious illness.Dr Mary Ramsay, the director for immunisation and programmes at the UKHSA, said while the NHS national booking system had now closed, those eligible for jabs could still talk to their GP or pharmacist about getting vaccinated.“Also if you have been offered the pneumonia (pneumococcal) vaccine, take up that,” said Hunter. “Often flu doesn’t kill directly but triggers people into developing pneumococcal pneumonia, which is what kills.”If you do not qualify for a flu jab on the NHS but wish to be vaccinated, they are available privately – unlike Covid jabs – for a cost of about £10-£20 depending on the pharmacy and whether a loyalty scheme is involved.However, access varies: Boots says it is not currently taking further online bookings for its private winter flu jab service, although walk-in appointments or in-store bookings may still be available, and corporate flu jab service customers can apparently still book online.The UKHSA has also recommended that antiviral medicines can be prescribed in primary care settings for people with flu if they are in clinical at-risk groups or are at risk of severe illness and complications from the virus.Antivirals for Covid are already available for certain groups, although some have expressed confusion and frustration over timely access to such treatments.“If you are someone who would be offered antivirals, test yourself for Covid early,” said Hunter, adding that even if it is negative, it would suggest treatment for flu might be necessary.What about Christmas?With several Covid Christmases under Santa’s sizable belt, much of the advice this winter will be familiar: wash hands, maintain good ventilation, consider wearing a mask in crowded spaces, and if you are feeling rough it is best to stay tucked up and away from others, particularly those who are more vulnerable.Explore more on these topicsFluCoronavirusInfectious diseasesEnglandexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

From getting a flu shot to eating healthy, know preventive measures. As the mercury drops, the threat of winter illnesses go up. Influenza, a common winter illness, poses a significant risk to people. Kids, with their underdeveloped immune systems, not only face an elevated risk of contracting the flu but also grapple with severe complications. It is important to pay attention to symptoms such fever, body ache, runny nose, sore throat, tiredness, headache among others. Parents can play a major role in preventing their little ones from flu. From getting them vaccinated to instilling habits like washing hands frequently, not touching elevator doors, furniture and objects can help prevent the spread. Children should also avoid sharing their personal things with others. Eating a nutritious diet and avoiding junk food can also help boost their immunity. (See pics | Influenza to pneumonia: 5 common winter illnesses; how to prevent) Kids, with their underdeveloped immune systems, not only face an elevated risk of contracting the flu but also grapple with severe complications. (Freepik) "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, can be particularly challenging for children during winter and is highly contagious. Unlike adults, children have less developed immune systems, making them more susceptible to severe complications from the flu virus. In addition, young kids often lack built-up immunity from previous exposure. One of the unique challenges of influenza in children is that it can easily spread in daycare centres and schools due to proximity and shared spaces," says Dr Manjusha Agarwal, Senior Consultant Internal Medicine Global Hospitals Parel Mumbai. Influenza is very much preventable and must not be taken lightly as its symptoms be it fever, coughing or fatigue can disrupt their routine and affect their studies. Getting a flu shot can help prevent the infection. "Remember, that one can have mild to major symptoms and may also require hospital admission. This makes prevention and containment efforts more complex. Moreover, symptoms such as high fever, coughing, and fatigue can disrupt a child's daily routine and lead to missed school days or activities. Parents should ensure their kids receive updated vaccinations each year to protect against new strains. Do not miss or skip the vaccination and try to speak to the doctor if you have any doubts. Parents should not worry as flu vaccines are completely safe for children," says Dr Agarwal. Preventive measures for kids"Encouraging regular hand washing and proper respiratory hygiene can also make a difference, as these simple practices help limit the spread of germs and viruses among children. Another handy tip is to maintain a healthy lifestyle for kids with balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Parents should ensure that their children eat a well-balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and pulses," says Dr Vrushali Bichkar, Consultant Paediatrician and Neonatologist, Motherhood Hospital, Lullanagar, Pune. Dr Bichkar further elaborates on measures to ward off flu risk. Avoid junk food: It is best to avoid junk, oily canned, and processed foods. Parents can take the help of an expert when it comes to diet for their children. Proper hydration: Also, proper hydration is key to staying healthy. Drink plenty of water during the day and add hydrating fruits and vegetables to the diet Do not touch surfaces: A strong immune system serves as a first line of defense against influenza. Avoiding close contact with sick individuals and teaching kids about the importance of not sharing personal items like utensils or water bottles can further reduce their risk of catching the flu during colder months. "By prioritizing prevention strategies, parents and caregivers can help keep influenza at bay for their children as winter approaches. Parents should consult the doctor in case their children have symptoms such as high fever, cough, cold, chills, body pain, and weakness. Do not ignore these symptoms at all. Timely treatment can help children to deal with influenza. Children should stop touching their faces after touching any object," says Dr Bichkar. "Apart from vaccination, children should wash their hands often with soap and water, especially before eating and after coughing, sneezing, wiping noses, and touching infected surfaces such as elevator doors, furniture, faucets, or objects. Avoid crowded places and being around sick people. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces from time to time, wear masks, and maintain a safe distance from others. Children should avoid sharing any personal items with others. Also, children should eat nutritious diets and exercise to boost immunity and prevent influenza," adds Dr Agarwal.

Doctors explain why.Doctors say it’s normal for respiratory symptoms to last for weeks, though people may face a higher chance of more severe illness or back-to-back infections this winter.Get more newsLiveonDec. 23, 2023, 2:00 PM UTCBy Aria BendixIt’s a common complaint this winter: After coming down with a respiratory illness, some people feel like they can’t shake a lingering cough or runny nose despite other symptoms going away. Or they start to recover then see symptoms return a week or two later.Doctors say that course of events isn’t unusual, though it might be more pronounced this year.Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are all circulating widely. As of Dec. 16, flu hospitalizations had increased nearly 200% over the previous four weeks. And Covid hospitalizations increased around 40% over the four-week period ending Dec. 9, the latest data available.NBC News spoke with seven doctors across seven states about why some people’s symptoms can persist for weeks or months. They offered several possible explanations.For one, the experts said, many people are more susceptible to respiratory illnesses this winter because they haven’t had a recent infection or vaccination. Others may have gotten back-to-back infections that they confused with lingering symptoms.It’s also likely that, following the pandemic — when many common viruses weren’t circulating widely — some people simply forgot how long symptoms can linger after a standard respiratory illness.“It can take as long as two weeks or more to recover fully,” said Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist.‘Immunity debt’ may be catching up to peopleBecause masking and isolation slowed the spread of many viruses during the pandemic, some people haven’t been as exposed to flu or RSV over the last few years as they would have been. That can give rise to what doctors call “immunity debt” — decreased immunity that makes people more susceptible to infection.“As more of us are encountering these viruses that we haven’t seen in recent years, it might feel like some of them are a little bit more severe and we have some more severe symptoms than we had before,” said Dr. Molly Fleece, a hospital epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medicine.A lack of vaccine-induced protection can also predispose people to more severe illness and make it harder to recover, doctors said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent an alert to health care providers last week warning about low vaccination rates for Covid, flu and RSV.RSV vaccines have been approved for older adults and pregnant people, but just 17% of those ages 60 and older had gotten an RSV shot as of Dec. 9. Meanwhile, the CDC reported a supply shortage for a newly approved RSV antibody injection for infants in October. However, additional doses became available last month, and 230,000 more are expected in January.The flu vaccination rate so far this year is 42% for adults and 43% for children, compared with 47% and 57%, respectively, the previous season. Just 18% of adults and 8% of eligible children have received the newest Covid vaccine.Last year, doctors said, masking and social distancing were also still more common.“That may be why people are getting more sick now,” said Dr. Caroline Goldzweig, chief medical officer of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Foundation in Los Angeles.Two infections back to backSince this is only the second year with Covid, flu and RSV circulating widely at once, there may simply be more opportunities to get sick than in previous winters, doctors said.“In the past several years, we’ve had primarily Covid or primarily RSV peaking, and now we have multiple respiratory viruses all rising at the same time,” said Dr. Larissa Pisney, an infectious disease specialist at UCHealth in Aurora, Colorado.That could raise the chance of back-to-back infections.“It’s entirely possible to be exposed to several different viruses over the course of the winter and have several different bouts of respiratory infection,” said Dr. Daniel Ouellette, a pulmonary disease specialist at Henry Ford Health in Detroit.It’s also possible to get more than one virus at a time, though the CDC hasn’t noticed that happening much, according to its director, Dr. Mandy Cohen.“We see co-infections at about a similar level to this time last season,” Cohen said.However, several doctors said they’re seeing an increase in bacterial infections — such as strep throat, whooping cough or pneumonia — that either follow a viral illness or occur at the same time.“In some situations, having a viral respiratory illness increases your risk of having bacterial pneumonia, which we’ve classically seen for a long time with the flu, but then we also saw a little bit of that with Covid as well,” said Dr. Shivanjali Shankaran, an infectious disease physician at Rush University Medical Group in Chicago.It’s normal for symptoms to linger or recurSymptoms that go away then reappear could be part of the same viral infection, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chief medical officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.“You can have an initial infection, start to get better and then have some recrudescence — in other words, recurrence of the symptoms as you’re recovering,” he said. “People may mistake that for two separate infections.”It’s also fairly common to feel sick for several weeks, doctors said. And Covid, flu and RSV can all result in a post-viral cough.“That post-viral cough doesn’t necessarily mean the person is still potentially able to spread the infection to others. It’s just a residual effect of their prior infection,” Fleece said.But a small minority of people may not recover for months or years. Long Covid affects around 6% of U.S. adults, according to a June survey by the Census Bureau. Similarly, it’s possible to see lingering effects from flu or colds.A study published last week showed that the flu can lead to a persistent cough or shortness of breath over the course of at least 18 months. And an analysis of U.K. adults published in October found that common cold viruses can lead to coughing, stomach pain and diarrhea more than a month after an initial infection. Scientists are still trying to understand why.Aria BendixAria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoCDC Urges RSV, COVID, Flu Vaccination Amidst Rising Cases ​ Skip to content Health Search the site GO Please fill out this field.

Before joining Health, Julia held an internship position at Verywell Health, where she also covered news. Her work has been featured in The Heights, an independent student newspaper at Boston College, and Minnesota Monthly. health's editorial guidelines Published on December 19, 2023 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Nick Blackmer is a librarian, fact-checker, and researcher with more than 20 years of experience in consumer-facing health and wellness content. health's fact checking process Close A new CDC health alert is warning of increases in RSV, COVID, and flu activity, while vaccination rates are lagging.There’s still time and reason to get vaccinated, the CDC Director told Health, since the country is early into flu season and still nearing a COVID peak.In addition to getting vaccinated before the holidays, people can consider other precautions, such as masks, depending on their individual risk. With the holidays in full swing, the U.S. is seeing high rates of respiratory virus activity, but concerningly low levels of vaccination against COVID, influenza (flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. In a health alert published Thursday, the agency warned healthcare providers that the combination of high virus circulation and low vaccination uptake “could lead to more severe disease and increased healthcare capacity strain in the coming weeks.” Within the last month, the CDC reported that among all ages, hospitalizations have gone up by 200% for flu, 51% for COVID, and 60% for RSV. The CDC recommended that healthcare professionals continue to vaccinate their patients, if eligible, and should recommend antiviral treatments for COVID and flu for those who are at risk of serious disease. “We wanted to make sure our providers know that it is not too late to get folks vaccinated,” Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Health. In addition to data on current virus activity and vaccination rates, the health alert also features a conversation guide for healthcare providers with information on talking people through vaccine concerns. “Importantly, we wanted to give folks tools on how to have those conversations, and to flag some new data that we have,” Cohen added. Junior Asiama/500px/Getty Images Few Americans Vaccinated for Flu, COVID, or RSV According to the CDC’s health alert, vaccinations aren’t where they should be for all age groups. The agency found that as of mid-November, “there were 7.4 million fewer influenza vaccine doses administered to adults in pharmacies and physician offices compared with the 2022–2023 influenza season.” By November 11, 36.1% of adults had gotten a flu shot, including just 58.6% of people over the age of 65. That’s down from 38.4% and 61.3%, respectively, in 2022. It’s worth noting that, according to CDC data from December 15, an estimated 42.2% of adults had gotten their flu shot, including 69.3% of seniors. In general, flu shot uptake declined during the pandemic and has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. This is the first season that the RSV vaccine has been widely available, meaning there’s no comparative data. However, as of December 2, about 16% of adults over 60 reported getting the vaccine. Low rates of vaccination for the updated COVID vaccine is an especially “sorry state,” Mark Cameron, PhD, associate professor and infectious disease researcher at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, told Health. So far, just over 17% of adults have gotten the shot, including 36% of those over the age of 65. These numbers are slightly down from those who got last year’s bivalent COVID shot—according to data gathered between fall 2022 and spring 2023, just over 20% of all adults got that shot, including just over 43% of older adults. These lagging vaccination rates are worrisome, especially for seniors, said Cameron. “If you haven’t been infected for a while or you’re exposed at a point that’s been months or maybe years away from your last vaccine, that really puts up a risk for more severe illness,” he said. “We can’t become complacent. We have to keep up with boosters.” What's the Difference Between COVID-19, the Flu, and RSV? How Bad is Respiratory Virus Activity in the U.S.? Alongside low vaccination rates, the U.S. is also seeing increased rates of all three major respiratory viruses, Cohen explained. “We are probably at the peak of RSV season. Flu is definitely increasing right now, but we’re on the early end of the flu season,” she said. “[COVID is] elevated and increasing across most of the country, particularly in the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic regions.” According to respiratory illness data from last week, over 10% of flu tests came back positive, and 4.4% of all visits to healthcare providers were related to respiratory illness. Health experts are also keeping an eye on COVID, as new Omicron variants are also emerging concurrently with this spike in hospitalizations and virus activity. The HK.3 variant has grown in recent weeks and now makes up an estimated 7.7% of cases. And, having exploded since early November, the JN.1 variant now makes up 1 in 5 COVID cases. The JN.1 variant luckily doesn’t seem to be any more severe than other variants, experts agreed, but it will likely still have an impact in the coming weeks. “It’s still going to lead to a lot of infections that will peak over the holidays, and still up our hospitalizations and deaths,” said Cameron. Though vaccinations can’t completely stem the tide of infections, they will be an integral part of managing this increase in RSV, COVID, and flu. Unmitigated, these viruses can lead to more hospitalizations and death, Cohen explained—vaccines prevent the “worst of what the viruses could bring.” When Does Flu Season Start and End? Gathering Safely This Holiday Season In the face of low vaccination rates, new COVID variants, and increasing case numbers, there’s still good news, said Cohen. “While the virus has continued to change and be more transmissible and spread more quickly, our tools continue to be able to work against it,” she said. COVID cases will likely increase over the next few weeks and peak in mid-January, Cohen explained, and the country still has a long flu season ahead of it. That means “it’s not too late to get those updated vaccines,” Cohen said. If people haven’t yet gotten vaccinated, they should do that before the holidays if possible, she added. But, with holiday gatherings in full swing, it’s important to remember that vaccination is just one way to stay safe. “I want folks to enjoy the holidays, but use the tools that we have to protect themselves,” said Cohen. “If you’re sick, stay home—I know that’s probably the hardest recommendation to give because no one wants to miss a holiday gathering. But if you are sick, get tested, stay home, get treatment.” There’s no correct way to gather safely, Cohen emphasized. It has more to do with evaluating each person’s individual risk, and increasing or decreasing safety measures from there. If someone is visiting an elderly family member or a friend fighting cancer, for example, those may be situations where increased protective measures are necessary. “It could be just opening a window, or it could be gathering outside, or it could be wearing masks,” she said. “But you want to think about yourself and the risk of the folks you are gathering with. But I want folks to be together [...] We can do that in a safe way using all of these tools as layers of protection.” How Often You Should Test for COVID-19 in 2023, According to Experts Was this page helpful?

Flu cases have been increasing in Texas since mid-October. Health officials encourage people to get vaccinated against the flu, along with other respiratory viruses like RSV and COVID-19, to prevent the spread during the holidays.“Let’s spread joy, love, happiness,” said Willie Underwood, the board chair of the American Medical Association. “Let’s have opportunities with our friends and families. Let’s travel, and not be on a plane or a train and giving multiple people the flu at the same time. Best way to do that is to get vaccinated.”Like the COVID-19 vaccine, it takes about two weeks after getting a flu shot to develop immunity to the virus.The flu is especially harmful to infants, people 65 years and older, and people who are pregnant. Since October, more than 1,300 Texans have died from the flu and pneumonia, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. That includes 1,000 people 65 and older.“The flu can kill you, and it can lead to you being hospitalized,” Underwood said. “It can lead to you missing out on family events, missing work, missing opportunities. So, the goal is to prevent that.”The number of flu vaccinations given this year is lower nationally now than in both 2021 and 2022. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 152 million flu vaccine doses have been distributed since Dec. 2.Chris Parker, associate director for field services with the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said flu season peaks between December and February. The CDC recommends everyone be vaccinated by late October, but it’s not too late to get the vaccine now.“As we approach the peak season, it’s important that everyone who hasn’t done so, get their flu shot to protect themselves, their family members and also our communities,” Parker said.Texans can find more information about flu shots near them by visiting GetMyFluShot.org.Got a tip?

While these antivirals are effective at preventing severe disease, not enough people are taking them. If more people at higher risk for severe illness get treatment in a timely manner, we will save lives. This blog helps clarify the most frequently asked questions about COVID-19 treatments. Summary What CDC knows Antivirals are an important tool for treating people with COVID-19, yet often are underused. COVID-19 antivirals help reduce hospitalizations and deaths among people at higher risk, especially people 65 years and older and those with certain underlying conditions. COVID-19 hospitalizations are currently on the rise, especially among those over 65 years of age. COVID-19 antivirals need to be prescribed more often to people who are at risk for severe illness to reduce hospitalizations and save lives. What CDC is doing CDC is working with healthcare providers and the public to improve understanding of the benefits of antivirals. CDC is also conducting research to better explain uptake and effectiveness of these drugs, as well as supporting treatment access programs, developing clinical resources, and communicating with the public and public health partners. CDC is committed to the equitable access and uptake of antivirals among people who are at higher risk for severe illness. 1. COVID-19 antiviral treatments might be for you if you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. Some people are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 or need hospital care. Antivirals can provide additional protection, even if you are vaccinated, if: You are at least 50 years of age, especially 65 and older, OR You have certain underlying medical conditions, such as a weakened immune system, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, or chronic lung disease, regardless of your age You should talk to a medical provider about getting treatment for COVID-19 if you fall into one of the two categories above. 2. There are treatment options available for people with COVID-19. There are treatment options for people at higher risk of severe disease. The antiviral your doctor prescribes depends on whether you're at home or in the hospital, and on which medications you are currently taking. Children under 12 years of age can only take one antiviral. COVID-19 Treatments Treatment Who (Among people who are at higher risk of getting sick and hospitalized) When How Recommended to use first Nirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid) Antiviral Adults and children ages 12 years and older Start as soon as possible Must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start Taken at home by mouth (orally) Remdesivir (Veklury) Antiviral Adults and children at least 28 days old and weighing at least 7 pounds Start as soon as possible Must begin within 7 days of when symptoms start Intravenous (IV) infusions at a healthcare facility for 3 consecutive days Recommended to use if above medications cannot be used or are unavailable Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) Antiviral Adults Start as soon as possible Must begin within 5 days of when symptoms start Taken at home by mouth (orally) 3. Taking antivirals can help decrease your risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19. COVID-19 antivirals can reduce the risks of hospitalization and death if you're at increased risk of getting very sick, regardless of your vaccination status. You should consider treatment for COVID-19 if it is recommended for you. Antivirals are not a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines help reduce the risk of getting very sick before you have COVID-19; treatments can help you feel better if you have COVID-19. Both are helpful tools that can prevent serious illness. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself against the most serious effects of COVID-19. It is important to stay up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations. 4. If you think you have COVID-19, get tested. And if you are at risk for severe disease, talk to your doctor about whether you should take treatment. Because symptoms can change and might get worse quickly, take every step you can to avoid getting very sick and potentially going to the hospital. You can prepare ahead of time by ordering four free at-home test kits for your household by going to COVIDtests.gov. Testing can be important to determine whether you have COVID-19 or flu (or even a different infection). If you have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you can get a COVID-19 test by: Buying at-home test kits online or in pharmacies and retail stores. Getting tested at pharmacies, urgent cares, doctor offices, and other local testing sites. Visiting the testing locator to find a free COVID-19 test, if you are uninsured. Talking to a healthcare provider about other testing options. Testing is not required to begin COVID-19 antivirals. For example, if you have a known exposure and are at higher risk for severe disease, talk to your healthcare provider about treatment as soon as possible, even before test results come back. If you are at risk for severe illness, you can take COVID-19 antivirals if your symptoms are mild to moderate. If you have severe symptoms, your provider will decide if you should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient care. Treatments are most effective when taken within 5-7 days after symptoms begin. It's best to start as soon as you can. 5. Among people who are at risk for severe illness, the benefits of antiviral treatments outweigh the potential risks of rebound. COVID-19 antivirals, such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelviritonavir), are effective at preventing severe disease. Taking antivirals is an important intervention to prevent hospitalization and death due to severe COVID-19 illness. Rebound, a return of symptoms or a new positive test after having tested negative, has been reported in people with and without the use of the COVID-19 antivirals. Current evidence suggests rebound presents as mild symptoms 3-7 days after initial illness resolves. If you are at high risk for severe COVID-19, treatment benefits outweigh the potential risks of rebound. 6. You can take antivirals safely even if you’re taking other medications. Antivirals can be taken safely with other medications. It is important that your healthcare provider review your medications to determine how you can take antivirals safely. Paxlovid is more likely to interact with medications than other COVID-19 antivirals, but most people can still take it. Your healthcare provider might adjust or stop your medications while you take Paxlovid. If you can't take Paxlovid, there are effective treatments that have fewer interactions with other medications. These other treatments, Veklury (remdesivir) and Lagevrio (molnupiravir), may be right for you. 7. You can get treatment even if you don’t see a doctor regularly. You can get evaluated for COVID-19 treatment even if you do not have a primary care physician or cannot quickly be seen by your doctor. You can get a COVID-19 antiviral prescription at a doctor's office or an urgent care. Other options include telehealth, such as the free Home Test to Treat program, which provides COVID-19 and influenza testing and antivirals; test-to-treat sites; Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-supported health centers; and pharmacies with clinics. Check to see if your community has test-to-treat sites for rapid testing and treatment resources. 8. You can get COVID-19 antivirals for free or at a reduced cost even if you don’t have insurance. On Nov. 1, 2023, Paxlovid and Lagevrio became commercially available. Patient assistance programs that help pay for these drugs are available to people who are underinsured, uninsured, or publicly insured through Medicaid, Medicare or other programs. You may be eligible for reduced or no-cost antivirals, once you have a prescription, through: Manufacturer access programs such as PAXCESS (Paxlovid), including the U.S. Government Patient Assistance Program (USG PAP) operated by Pfizer, and Merck Helps (Lagevrio). Home Test to Treat program: free tests, a telehealth appointment with a healthcare provider, and treatment if eligible, shipped directly to you. Patients that use certain federal entities, including Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-supported health centers such as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Indian Health Service provider sites, and others, will have continued access to free, U.S. Government procured Paxlovid and Lagevrio. Sample Antiviral Access Programs Antiviral Programs Patient Eligibility Description Paxlovid Pfizer Co-Pay Savings Program Privately insured Paxlovid reimbursement program Out-of-pocket costs determined by insurer and pharmacy benefit manager Payment as little as $0 with Co-Pay Savings Program U.S. Government Patient Assistance (USG PAP) Uninsured; Medicare (with or without Part D, Part B, or Part C and inclusive of Medicare Advantage); Medicaid/CHIP; TRICARE, VA Community Care Network Paxlovid at no charge Operated by Pfizer Veklury Gilead’s Advancing Access Veklury eligible; insured and uninsured Financial support options to access Veklury may be available Lagevrio Merck Patient Assistance Program Eligible patients with financial hardship; must be enrolled as an urgent request Lagevrio free of charge for patients who can’t afford without assistance COVID-19 & Flu Antivirals Home Test to Treat Program Uninsured or underinsured adult (18+); Medicare; Medicaid; VA healthcare system; receive care from the Indian Health Services Free COVID-19 and flu tests Free telehealth visit with a healthcare provider and treatment, if needed 9. You can take antiviral drugs to treat flu, too! Testing can help determine whether you have COVID-19 or flu (or even a different infection). Testing is not required to begin taking flu antivirals, and treatment should not be delayed for test results. Flu antivirals are recommended for people at higher risk of flu complications, including young children, adults 65 years and older, pregnant people, and people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. Flu antiviral drugs can lessen fever and flu symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by about one day. They also may reduce the risk of complications such as ear infections in children, respiratory complications requiring antibiotics, and hospitalization in adults. Antivirals approved and recommended for flu treatment this season: Oseltamivir (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu) Zanamivir (trade name Relenza) Peramivir (trade name Rapivab) Baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza) Starting flu antivirals later can still be beneficial, especially if the sick person is at higher risk of developing serious flu complications or is in the hospital with severe flu illness. If many people in your community have flu, your healthcare provider may give you an antiviral for flu without a test. On This Page Summary 1.

Cold & FluNewsFlu Levels Rise as the Holidays ArriveHealth officials are urging people to get vaccinated as influenza spreads across the U.S.ByDon RaufFact CheckedPublished on December 22, 2023The southeast, south-central, and West Coast of the U.S. have been hit hardest by flu, but rates are climbing everywhere.iStockAs the winter season officially begins, flu cases are climbing across the United States, and health authorities are warning that the worst is yet to come.In a presentation on YouTube about the current respiratory virus season, Mandy K. Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), cautioned that respiratory illnesses are expected to keep rising in the weeks ahead, with the flu being “the most accelerated.” (COVID-19 is also increasing, but RSV appears to be slowing a bit as it most likely has peaked for the season.)Latest CDC tracking indicates that flu cases and related hospitalizations are trending upward, and deaths from flu also inching up slightly.The CDC Influenza Surveillance Report on December 22 shows the highest levels of flu activity in the southeast, south-central, and West Coast areas of the country, but the illness is spreading in all regions of the United States.With more people traveling and gathering with family and friends for the holidays, Robert H. Hopkins Jr., MD, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), anticipates we will at least see a few more weeks of rates continuing to climb.“We’re seeing a very common pattern this year,” says Dr. Hopkins. “Influenza is a respiratory virus that tends to circulate among people who are in crowded conditions, and as the weather gets colder, more people are crowded together indoors. Also, influenza tends to pass easily among schoolchildren and then they pass it on to the adult population.”How Bad Will This Flu Season Be?So far this season, the CDC estimates that there have been 3.7 to 7.4 million flu illnesses, 1.4 to 3.5 million flu medical visits, 38,000 to 80,000 flu hospitalizations. and 2,300 to 6,800 flu deaths.For the entire U.S. flu season last year, the CDC calculated that there were about 31 million people sick with flu, 14 million visits to a healthcare provider for flu, 360,000 hospitalizations for flu, and 21,000 flu deaths.Last year’s flu season in the U.S. was characterized as highly severe, particularly among children and adolescents, the CDC notes. This was in stark contrast to the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic, when flu rates plummeted as many people took more precautions against respiratory viruses. Then, as COVID slowed and people dropped their guard, a population with lower flu immunity from prior virus exposure experienced an influenza spike.Whether this year will be as bad is still a question.“They had a particularly difficult influenza season in Australia this year in the Southern Hemisphere [which can act as an indication of what’s to come for our flu season],” says Hopkins. “That concerns me that we may be looking at a severe season here, but it’s really challenging to predict.”The CDC is not seeing anything out of the ordinary so far. “We know this time of year, we’re going to see more respiratory illnesses,” Dr. Cohen said in her presentation.Vaccinations Provide Proven Protection Against FluNo matter the trajectory of flu illnesses in the weeks to come, Hopkins stresses that the available flu vaccination should provide strong protection against serious illness. A CDC study from earlier this year found that the vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52 percent in the Southern Hemisphere during their past flu season.Annual vaccination is recommended for people of all ages, including children 6 months and older, and adults over 65 are urged to get a higher dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine, per the CDC. The National Institute on Aging stresses that flu is more dangerous in older adults as peoples’ immune systems weaken with age, increasing the risk of picking up a secondary infection such as pneumonia.Although vaccination provides a powerful defense against influenza, Hopkins is concerned that flu vaccination rates are way down this season compared to last, with about 7 million fewer doses being administered to adults.“Although it does take 10 days to two weeks to develop full immunity from the vaccine, I’d encourage anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to get vaccinated,” he says. “If you haven’t had it, better to get vaccinated now and get protected through the rest of the season than to take a chance. I really encourage people to do everything they can to protect themselves and their families.”Editorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

Last month's sudden spread of influenza-like infections among children in China raised alarm [File: Jade Gao/AFP]By Frederik KelterPublished On 21 Dec 202321 Dec 2023When Evelyn Ma’s two-year-old daughter had a persistently high fever and a bad cough earlier this month, she and her husband began to worry. The couple decided to take their daughter to a nearby children’s hospital in the city of Jinan. But as Ma walked through the doors with her daughter in her arms, she found a scene of chaos. “Doctors and nurses were rushing around everywhere between long lines of patients waiting their turn, and people were even sitting on the floor and against the walls,” Ma, who is 36 and works as a sales representative in China’s northeastern Shandong province, told Al Jazeera. China experienced a sharp rise in cases of influenza, pneumonia, RSV and common cold viruses, particularly among children, in early October. By the next month, the surge in the number of people seeking medical attention had put a strain on hospitals, especially those catering to children. “We arrived at the hospital in the early morning, but we didn’t get to see a doctor until the late afternoon, and I think that was only because my daughter’s symptoms were quite bad and my husband and I made a fuss,” Ma said. The rising infections and reports of undiagnosed pneumonia sparked concern that the world was on the cusp of another novel pandemic outbreak spreading from China, after COVID-19 also first appeared as undiagnosed pneumonia in the central city of Wuhan. But after requesting data from China, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded there was no cause for alarm because the evidence suggested there was no new pathogen. The jump in cases, it appears, was more a reflection of the return of illnesses that had been suppressed by the country’s prolonged pandemic lockdowns. Ma’s daughter soon recovered, but the experience brought back upsetting memories. “Last time I was at the hospital was in late December last year, and I was also sitting in a crowded waiting room filled with coughing people,” she said. “Back then I was holding the hand of my grandmother who was very sick with COVID,” Ma said. The sudden U-turn on the zero-COVID policy followed a series of rare protests across the country [File: Thomas Peter/Reuters] Just a few weeks before that, the Chinese authorities had abandoned the strict COVID measures that were a pillar of the country’s so-called zero-COVID policy after protests in several Chinese cities against the continued enforcement of lockdowns. For three years until then, the zero-COVID policy had defined – and limited – Chinese people’s interactions with each other and the outside world in the name of combatting the pandemic. “So many people suffered under the zero-COVID policy, and so many people died when it ended,” Ma said. “Because of that, my family and I are traumatised to this day.” Mental health struggles Ma’s grandmother succumbed to COVID-19 in early January. At about the same time, 29-year-old translator Lily Wang from Shenzhen also lost her grandmother to the virus. She blames the authorities’ abrupt decision to abandon the zero-COVID policy for her death. “If they had just given us a warning or given us time to prepare, we might have been able to save her,” Wang told Al Jazeera. A wave of infections swept across China after the sudden end of the policy posing a particular hazard to elderly Chinese of whom only 40 percent had received a booster shot by December 2022. In the months that followed, upwards of almost two million more people died compared with the same period in previous years, according to a study by Hong Xiao and Joseph Unger of the Public Health Sciences Division at Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center that was published in August. While the death of Wang’s grandmother was traumatic for her whole family, the strict lockdowns of China’s cities, which became a recurring phenomenon throughout 2022, were traumatic for Wang personally. Her neighbourhood in the southern city of Shenzhen was repeatedly placed under total lockdown for months on end to quell flare-ups of COVID infections. “We were not allowed to go outside – not even to stretch our legs, do grocery shopping or take out the garbage,” she said. Regular and relentless testing was a key feature of the zero-COVID strategy [File: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo] Wang was living alone in a small apartment at the time, and food supplies, provided by the authorities, were often late to arrive at her building. “I was hungry, lonely and trapped, and I started to suffer from panic attacks,” she added. As soon as the COVID policy ended, she moved out of the apartment and back home with her parents. “After zero-COVID, I just couldn’t stay in the apartment any more,” she said. “Even today, it is still difficult for me to be alone for more than a few days.” Ma from Jinan has also struggled to recover mentally. “I am much more concerned about the future than I was before 2022,” she said. During the lockdown of her family’s neighbourhood, they also experienced food supplies arriving late. “Now I get nervous when we don’t have much food left in the apartment, so I make sure that we have lots of meals available in the freezer and the refrigerator in case something happens,” she explained. Hou Feng, a 31-year-old programmer from Shanghai, has also had trouble sleeping since the strict lockdown of Shanghai that took place from April until June 2022. “During that time, people in my building contacted the authorities to accuse each other of breaking the COVID rules,” Hou told Al Jazeera. Residents of Shanghai, China’s biggest city, were required to undergo constant COVID-19 testing, and it was obligatory to report to one of the city’s quarantine centres if the result was positive. Hou witnessed his screaming neighbour getting dragged out of her home by the authorities when she refused to leave of her own volition after testing positive. He still has nightmares about people in white hazmat suits breaking down his door and taking him away to a quarantine facility. “I just saw some really bad sides of China during the lockdown that I never thought I would see.” Loud success, quiet failure While the zero-COVID policy ended in failure and trauma, according to Hou, it was initially quite successful. “In 2020 and 2021, we luckily didn’t really feel the pandemic in China,” he said. After a late response to the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese authorities subsequently managed to get the pandemic under control, and by mid-2020, normal life had resumed and social order was restored. That was a contrast to several high-income countries in the Western world where health services struggled when the pandemic first struck, according to assistant professor Yan Long, who has studied the development of Chinese public health policies at the University of California, Berkeley. That also made the zero-COVID policy a source of national pride in China and an opportunity for the Chinese leadership to showcase, at least domestically, that China had outdone countries such as the United States. “It was a way to say, ‘Look, democracy has failed, we succeeded’,” Long told Al Jazeera. The success began to fray, however, with the emergence of more infectious COVID-19 variants such as omicron. Immense resources were poured into constant rounds of mass testing and the implementation of lockdowns, but the measures failed to put an end to new outbreaks. “The zero-COVID policy became financially unsustainable, and scientifically impossible, while the confidence in the policy also began to drastically decline,” Long said. “By 2022, COVID was no longer the biggest fear. People were more afraid of the disruption of the lockdowns.” After asking Beijing for more data on the ‘influenza-like illness’, the WHO concluded it was not a new pathogen [File: Jade Gao/AFP] Hou from Shanghai agrees that towards the end, the zero-COVID policy felt worse than COVID-19. “The policy made life a living hell,” he said. Hou knows of many people who experienced traumatic episodes during the lockdowns as well as in the subsequent rapid reopening of society. “But unlike me, most people I know don’t want to talk about the COVID times. They just want to forget them,” he said. Long, the academic, doubts that Chinese people have had a chance to heal after what happened. “It is now a year later, and there has been no discussion about COVID, no reflection about what was right and what was wrong,” she said. “When you bury the memory, you don’t learn any lessons, which means there is no guarantee that the same mistakes won’t be made again.” Source: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media NetworkBird flu is back in Wisconsin after a year of no new cases | WUWM 89.7 FM - Milwaukee's NPR Search Query Show Search Home Election Voter Guide Gertie's Guide to Elections Voter Roundtables Voter Guide: Pocket Edition Voter Guide Gertie's Guide to Elections Voter Roundtables Voter Guide: Pocket Edition News Environment Education Race & Ethnicity Climate Solutions WUWM Explains Environment Education Race & Ethnicity Climate Solutions WUWM Explains Lake Effect About Lake Effect Full Shows Behind the Scenes at MPM Books and Beyond Chirp Chat Dig In!

After a year-long lull, highly pathogenic avian influenza is back in Wisconsin.The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection first confirmed the return of the virus in a small backyard flock in Taylor County on Nov. 17.The DATCP has since confirmed five more cases on commercial farms spreading across Barron and Trempealeau County.Wisconsin’s state veterinarian Dr. Darlene Konkle says it’s not surprising to see an uptick in cases during the fall season. She says the fall migration of birds, especially waterfowl like ducks and geese, is attributed to the rise in cases.“Migrating waterfowl, as they move back from areas in the Arctic that are their breeding grounds and back through North America on their way south, they stopped to rest and to eat in these various areas around wetlands, and that's when we start to see more cases,” Konkle says.The H5N1 bird flu strain that’s been circulating throughout the U.S. since late 2021 makes this virus highly pathogenic, or contagious, Konkle says.“This one is a high-path virus that came over to North America from Europe and it’s different from other viruses we've had in the past,” she says. “This virus seems to have some staying power for whatever reason. It's got the capability to remain in the environment a little longer and continue affecting birds.”Konkle says a similar bird flu outbreak took place between 2014 and 2015 due to a different virus strain, H5N2. During the outbreak, more than 50 million chickens and turkeys across the U.S. died of the virus or were killed off to stop the spread of the virus, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Unlike the 2015 outbreak, Konkle says animal health officials are noticing that the virus is not being spread from farm to farm.“In the vast majority of cases in this current outbreak, each one of these detections that we're seeing across the country has been mostly an individual introduction from some kind of contact with the virus in the environment,” she says.Some of the symptoms for this strain of bird flu include advanced respiratory signs like sneezing and snicking, lethargy, decrease in egg production, low feed and water intake. Konkle says it’s most often domestic birds, like chickens, that are infected by the virus experience sudden death.“We're asking our poultry owners to be really vigilant and look closely at their flocks to see any signs to detect those early and to report those to [DATCP] as soon as they notice something unusual, or report them to their veterinarian,” she says.As soon as a positive case is detected by Wisconsin’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, DATCP agriculture officials are notified and work with farm owners to quarantine their flocks.“We do work with the farm owner to depopulate any remaining birds as humanely and as quickly as possible,” Konkle says. “We also work with the farmer and with our [U.S. Department of Agriculture] counterparts to dispose of those birds in a way that eliminates the virus and also prevents any further spread.”More than 300,000 birds in Wisconsin have died of the virus or have been killed off to stop the spread of the virus since the first reported case on Nov. 17. The first case in Taylor County has been the only backyard flock affected so far, the other five cases were detected on commercial poultry farms.Once DATCP has eliminated the virus off a farm, they set up a control and surveillance area around the affected farm to make sure other nearby flocks weren’t infected.Konkle says it’s difficult to know how long the H5N1 virus will continue to impact birds throughout Wisconsin and the rest of the world, but suspects it’ll be a while.“The virus itself can survive just fine in our winters,” she says. “Influenza viruses don't mind cold, wet conditions, which is basically winter in Wisconsin, so we could potentially see more cases over the winter. We tend to see the largest rises [in cases] correspond to the migration season, so I would expect cases to drop off more in the dead of winter. But we still really want to remain vigilant because we certainly could get cases popping up really, at any time of the year.”Konkle says the best thing small, backyard flock owners and large, commercial flock owners can do to help mitigate the spread of bird flu is to practice good biosecurity:Washing your hands before and after handling poultryUsing equipment and clothing dedicated to working with poultryDepending on the size of flock, showering before and after working with poultryIsolating and monitoring new birds before introducing them to the rest of the flockEnsuring birds are kept separated from other birds, especially wild birds and areas where wild birds congregate such as ponds and other waterways_ Tags WUWM NewsLake EffectWisconsin bird fluagricultureWUWMSpotlight Facebook Twitter Email Xcaret Nuñez Xcaret is a WUWM producer for Lake Effect.

From former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro calling COVID-19 a “little flu,” to Donald Trump claiming in February 2020 that the virus would be seasonal and “miraculously” disappear by Easter, this propaganda campaign aimed to minimize the dangers posed by COVID-19 and condition society to “live with” COVID-19 and all other pathogens.With over 27 million excess deaths attributable to COVID-19 and estimates that hundreds of millions of people are now suffering from Long COVID-19 worldwide, such a comparison with the flu was always a transparent falsehood. Still, the propaganda has had an impact on public consciousness, with the great mass of the population unaware of the ongoing dangers they face as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 evolve and sweep across the globe every few months, leaving in their wake ever-growing numbers of dead and disabled.While many principled scientists have exposed this central falsehood of the pandemic, none have done so as comprehensively as a study published last Thursday by the team of researchers led by Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center, chief of research and development service at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Saint Louis Health Care System.Dr. Al-Aly at his desk [Photo by Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly] The study, published in the Infectious Disease section of the Lancet, is an 18-month comparative analysis following patients after hospital admission for COVID-19 versus influenza. It proves definitively that not only is COVID-19 far deadlier than influenza, but it also causes more long-term health injuries and damage to the body.While this was not the authors’ intention, the study also provides the first measurable comprehensive assessment of the long-term health complications of influenza, what is known as “Long Flu,” which are considerable.Event rates per 100 persons are presented for COVID-19 (red) and seasonal influenza (blue). The hazard ratio, rate, and rate difference per 100 persons during the periods of 0–30, 0–180, 0–360 and 0–540 days are also presented.

This phenomenon was already known to some extent by the historical record of the 1918 influenza pandemic, but until now there had been very little quantitative data on “Long Flu.”Senior author Al-Aly said in a news release by the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, “The study illustrates the high toll of death and loss of health following hospitalization with either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza. It is critical to note that the health risks were higher after the first 30 days of infection. Many people think they’re over COVID-19 or the flu after being discharged from the hospital. That may be true for some people. But our research shows that both viruses can cause long-haul illness.”This latest study by Al-Aly’s team, which is responsible for some of the most pioneering research on the impacts of COVID-19, is very timely. The US and much of the world are presently in the grips of a massive winter wave of infections caused by the highly infectious and immune-resistant Omicron JN.1 subvariant. In multiple countries where JN.1 is already dominant, most significantly in Singapore which has very high vaccination rates, COVID-19 hospitalizations are beginning to rise dramatically.Utilizing the VA’s vast database, the study authors included over 82,000 patients who had been admitted for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, encompassing the pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron phases of the pandemic. However, because of influenza’s rarity in the US during this period when some semblance of mitigation measures remained in place to combat COVID-19, the authors resorted to using a historical cohort (between October 1, 2015, and February 28, 2019) of nearly 11,000 influenza patients who had been hospitalized for a comparator.A total of 94 pre-specified health outcome measures were analyzed, encompassing ten organ systems that included “cardiovascular, coagulation and hematological, fatigue, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neurological, and pulmonary.” The acute phase of their infections was defined as the first 30 days after their admission to the hospital and the post-acute phase of infection encompassed days 31 to 540, or 18 months.Unsurprisingly, the absolute death rate was far higher for COVID-19 than the flu, with a cumulative death rate of 28.46 for COVID-19 and 19.84 for influenza per 100 persons, or 43 percent higher for COVID-19. In the first 30 days, the COVID-19 group had an increased risk of death that was 2.5 times higher than those admitted with the flu. Although this discrepancy declined over the intervening six-month intervals, it continued to remain elevated.The acute phase of COVID-19 is far more often severe than that of flu, with roughly three times as many COVID-19 hospitalizations in the past year than the flu—roughly 1 million compared to 360,000—and four times as many official COVID deaths (roughly 83,000) as flu deaths (21,000).Also, over the 18-month period, COVID-19 was associated with “significant increased risk” in 64 of the 94 measured health outcomes that encompassed nearly every organ system in the human body. By comparison, seasonal influenza was only associated with increases in six of the 94 health outcomes that included, angina, tachycardia, type 1 diabetes, and three pulmonary outcomes (cough, hypoxia, and shortness of breath).As just one example of a measured health outcome, those with COVID-19 had a 2.4 times higher risk of heart attack in the first 30 days than those with the flu. This risk factor remained elevated throughout the 18-month period. Those who had COVID-19 also faced an increased risk of pulmonary embolism and many other potentially lethal conditions throughout the study period. Another uniquely devastating impact of COVID-19 pertains to mental health illnesses, including acute stress and suicidal ideations.(A) Rate-based results presented on relative scale.

[Photo: Yan Xie,Taeyoung Choi,Ziyad Al-Aly]The authors highlighted two key findings in their study. With the exception of the gastrointestinal system, more than 50 percent of the total incident burden of disease in both COVID-19 and influenza occurred in the post-acute phase of infection, or between days 31 to 540. Secondly, COVID-19 patients had a higher burden of disease across all organ systems than the flu (except the pulmonary system) in both the acute and post-acute phase.Summarizing these findings in an email communication with the World Socialist Web Site, Dr. Al-Aly wrote, “We observed higher risks of death, healthcare utilization and hits in most organ systems in COVID-19 than the flu. This was evident in pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron. And also evident in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. COVID-19 remain a much more serious threat to human health than the flu.”He added that the study findings underscore that “COVID-19 is really a multisystemic disease and flu is more of a respiratory virus.” That is not to say that the pulmonary consequences of COVID-19 were negligible, as it only slightly trailed the flu in this domain throughout the study period.Dr. Al-Aly then made the point, “The burden of health loss from Long-Flu is substantial, but the burden of health loss from Long-COVID-19 is even higher. Yet, both Long-COVID-19 and Long-Flu lead to more health loss than either acute COVID-19 or Flu. Conceptualizing these illnesses as acute events obscures the much larger burden of health loss that occurs in the post-acute phase.” [Emphasis added]In a press release accompanying the study, Dr. Al-Aly clarified this shift in scientific understanding of these pathogens, writing, “the big ah-ha moment was the realization that the magnitude of long-term health loss eclipsed the problems that these patients endured in the early phase of the infection.”With SAR-CoV-2, a highly infectious non-seasonal pathogen with a robust capacity for further evolution, and for which existing vaccines and prior infections offer very limited immunity, the current global policy of “forever COVID” means that society is being forced to endure multiple annual waves of mass infection, with unknown but far-reaching long-term consequences. This amounts to a continuous, full-scale assault on billions of people who face the consequences of preventable but often non-visible injuries like kidney damage, as well as the more well-known brain fog and severe fatigue brought on by Long-COVID.The recent publication in Statistics Canada on the experiences of Canadians with Long COVID underscores the completely unsustainable character of this policy. It provides striking confirmation of the many studies conducted on the impact of COVID-19 by Dr. Al-Aly and colleagues, above all their study published last year on the compounding risk of Long COVID-19 after each reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.With a population of 38.3 million in Canada, the report noted that about two-thirds of adults reported experiencing at least one confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, while many have had multiple infections since the beginning of the pandemic. Of these, 3.5 million (one in nine) had experienced long-term symptoms, with 2.1 million still experiencing them as of June 2023. Half said they had not seen improvements in their symptomology.Commenting on these data, which had been predicted by many experts, Lond COVID specialist Dr. Claire Taylor wrote, “If you input the Statistics Canada data into David Steadson’s graph, you get 14.6 percent first infection get Long COVID-19 and 38 percent by third infection. The modelling curves were correct. This is literally insane.”Long COVID cumulative risk modeling by epidemiologist David Steadson vs. Statistics Canada data. [Photo: @davidsteadson on X/Twitter]Providing further context to the alarming findings of the latest VA study, The Hill published a report last week highlighting the high number of excess deaths being observed by life insurers in 2023 compared to the same period in 2019. In the first three quarters of this year, close to 160,000 more Americans have died than in the same pre-pandemic period. The Hill wrote, “Actuarial reports—used by insurers to inform decisions—show deaths occurring disproportionately among young working-age people. Nonetheless, America’s chief health manager, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opted in September to archive its excess deaths webpage with a note stating, ‘These datasets will no longer be updated’ … to some extent, we know what is killing the young, with an actuarial analysis of government data showing mortality increases in liver, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.”However, they are incapable of supplying the “why.”The findings of the latest VA study, the data from Statistics Canada, and the ongoing elevated rates of excess deaths place into stark relief the necessity for a preventative strategy towards COVID-19 and all infectious diseases, rather than a reactionary status quo that plays Russian roulette with the health of the working class while funneling ever-greater wealth to the financial oligarchy.Indeed, the trillions being hoarded by the world’s billionaires needs to be immediately appropriated and redirected into a massive global public health program, centered on renovating infrastructure to make all indoor spaces safe against disease transmission, including through the use of HEPA filters, ventilation, safe Far-UVC ultraviolet irradiation devices, and other sanitation measures. Through such a globally coordinated program, SARS-CoV-2, influenza and numerous other pathogens could be eliminated throughout the world, saving millions from death and long-term disability each year.Additionally, funds must be made available for researchers to study the long-term impacts of infections, design treatments and conduct extensive health evaluations to address the developments of new diseases in individuals.Altogether, the latest study led by Al-Aly demands a radical shift in all antiquated conceptions towards viral pathogens and the diseases they cause. Neither the initial damage caused during the acute phase of infections, nor the prolonged suffering that impacts a sizeable percentage of patients, should be accepted by modern society with its vast technological progress and capabilities.Eliminating or drastically reducing transmission of all pathogens will not build up a so-called “immunity debt” that must inevitably be repaid—the latest lie peddled by the same right-wing forces who have compared COVID-19 to the flu. Rather, this socialist public health strategy will free future generations from the unnecessary suffering wrought by an outmoded social order.Dr. Al-Aly and colleagues have provided critical insight into the ongoing mass excess deaths and the “mass disabling event” of Long COVID. However, as the WSWS has previously noted, SARS-CoV-2 is simply a biological entity whose unconscious aim is to infect again and again. It is the social and political response of world capitalism, overseen by a conscious and thoroughly criminal profit-driven ruling class, that has given the virus free rein to carry out its ongoing assault on global society. They must be swept aside to enable the further progress of humanity.Read moreCOVID-19 reinfections substantially increase risk of death and Long COVID10 November 2022Study documents devastating effects of Long COVID two years after infection8 September 2023COVID-19 infection significantly increases one’s risk of a neurological disorder27 September 2022Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:The coronavirus pandemicUnited StatesNorth AmericaLoading© 1998-2024 World Socialist Web Site.

(Jason Franson/The Canadian Press)Social SharingThe Globe and Mail reported Thursday it had obtained documents showing the Alberta government directed Alberta Health Services to remove mention of COVID-19 and influenza from advertisements for this season's immunization campaign.The Globe said it had obtained those documents through an access to information request. CBC News has not seen the documents.Asked for comment by reporters on Thursday, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith did not dispute the report. She said coming out of the respiratory virus season last year, COVID-19, influenza, RSV, adenovirus and other viruses surged and ebbed."This respiratory virus season, we want to make sure people knew what they should be going and looking at for immunizations, there's vaccines for all three — RSV, COVID and influenza," Smith said."It was in our press release that we mentioned that people should talk to their family doctor about it. And it seems … we're also spending almost the same amount of money this year on the campaign as we did last year."Questions about Alberta's vaccination rates11 months agoDuration 3:53Premier Danielle Smith, Health Minister Adriana LaGrange and Alberta Medical Association president Dr. Paul Parks respond to questions from the CBC's Erin Collins about vaccination rates in the province.A new RSV vaccine was approved for Canadians aged 60 years and older earlier this year, but it has a price tag of around $300. The vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza, by contrast, are free.The Globe and Mail story reported that in an email dated Sept. 28, Alberta Health communications director Chris Bourdeau asked AHS officials to remove the government's logo from campaign posters.Bourdeau also asked officials to replace "both influenza and COVID with just 'fall immunizations,'" and on Oct. 3 wrote that the desire "was not to indicate the types of vaccines available, just that they are," according to the Globe.Just 15% of Canadians got updated COVID vaccines this fall, new figures showAlberta's COVID-19 and flu vaccine uptake could be better, expert saysAsked to confirm details from the Globe and Mail's reporting, Alberta Health Minister Adriana LaGrange said "what was actually happening" was that the province has gone from a pandemic state to an endemic state."When you're in an endemic state, then all of the respiratory viruses that are out there are treated in the same manner, and so the language and the documentation and the communication has to be in alignment," she said.When asked by CBC News to respond to the details included in the Globe story, Dr. James Talbot, an adjunct professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Alberta, and the province's former chief medical officer of health, said the behaviour described is "not just outrageous, it's idiotic.""To tell Alberta Health Services it has to cut out what the benefits of taking the vaccine are, is to make any kind of campaign that they put out a waste of money," Talbot said.Timothy Caulfield, a professor in the faculty of law and the School of Public Health at the U of A, said the impression that the province is trying to distance itself from specific language about vaccines is "problematic.""You want your public health messaging to be clear, to be actionable, and to be science-informed. And I fear that they're moving away from that approach," he told CBC News.Caulfield said behaviour like that described in the Globe and Mail story has real-world consequences.Influenza is here. What can Albertans expect?Vaccine passport policies boosted COVID-19 vaccinations in Canada, study suggests"Unfortunately, I think misinformation about the COVID vaccine ... has started to have a real impact on vaccination attitudes. We know this from research," he said."Unless you have a clear message from your health-care system, from your government, the situation is only going to get worse."Alberta's doctors have been raising the alarm in recent weeks as respiratory viruses have been surging. Approximately 22 per cent of Albertans have been immunized against influenza, the lowest rate in more than a decade.Smith was asked by a reporter what she thought was causing the downturn, and why people might be so much more skeptical than they've been in years."I don't know," Smith said in response.Shortly after Thursday's news conference ended, Alberta Health Services issued a public health announcement with the headline "Spread joy, not germs: stay healthy this holiday season." It specifically mentions both COVID-19 and influenza vaccines.ABOUT THE AUTHORJoel DrydenJoel is a reporter/editor with CBC Calgary. In fall 2021, he spent time with CBC's bureau in Lethbridge.

VERIFIED By: Written by Tavishi Dogra |Updated : December 22, 2023 7:11 PM IST Vaccines have been one of the foremost scientific advances of the 21st century. Vaccination, sanitation, and clean drinking water are unquestionably responsible for improving health outcomes worldwide. Dr Akshay Budhraja, Senior Consultant, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Aakash Healthcare, shares that among the vaccines that have significantly impacted humankind, influenza emerges as a critical shield against a virus responsible for seasonal outbreaks and potential complications, particularly within susceptible groups like the elderly. The ElderlyBeing more susceptible to infections due to weakened immune defences, they often face higher risks of TB. The influenza vaccine's preventive measures serve as an additional layer of defence. By reducing the burden of influenza, the vaccine indirectly bolsters the immune system's ability to ward off other infections, potentially including TB. This secondary benefit underscores the broader impact of influenza vaccination in safeguarding the health of the elderly population beyond solely targeting the flu virus.

The illness presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. However, developing influenza vaccines has been a game-changer in bringing down the severity and spread of this viral infection. The vaccine produces antibodies against specific influenza strains and controls its severity and related complications, ultimately saving lives.TB remains a persistent global health concern, characterized by its insidious progression and potentially severe consequences, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems. The elderly, often bearing compromised immune responses due to age-related factors, are at heightened risk for both influenza and TB.The convergence of influenza vaccination and TB incidents among the elderly warrants attention. Studies and scientific inquiries have shown intriguing links between the two. It's been observed that the influenza virus can trigger immune system responses that impact the susceptibility to other respiratory infections, including TB. Vaccination against influenza has displayed direct benefits in reducing the incidence of flu and indirect effects in lessening the risk of co-infections or secondary complications like TB.Therefore, the role of vaccination in preventing complications, particularly the influenza vaccine, cannot be overstated. The role of influenza vaccine extends way beyond preventing seasonal flu outbreaks. Stimulating the immune system protects against potential threats. The correlation between influenza vaccination and reduced incidents of tuberculosis among the elderly highlights the profound impact of preventive measures in reducing disease risk.Thus, advocating for and ensuring widespread access to influenza vaccination is pivotal in protecting vulnerable populations and fostering overall public health resilience against a spectrum of respiratory infections.

[NEWS1] Influenza B is on the rise in Korea as influenza A sweeps the country. A 39-year-old office worker surnamed Kim said he was recently diagnosed with influenza B virus and suffered from a high fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and severe coughing. "When my family contracted influenza A, nothing happened to me. Eventually, I [was diagnosed with] influenza B," Kim said. Amid the soaring cases of influenza A, reaching a five-year peak, Korea is also reporting more cases of influenza B. "Influenza A cases [have been] prevalent, but [now], a dual diagnosis of influenza A and B is common," a doctor who runs a clinic said. "Some patients get influenza B after recovering from influenza A," he added. A mother, surnamed Park, whose nine-year-old son had influenza A in October and influenza B recently, said, "My son got well a day after taking [peramivir] when he had influenza A." "This time, with influenza B, his fever just a momentarily dropped to 37.7 degrees Celsius and rebounded back to 38.5 and 39 degrees Celsius even after receiving intravenous therapy." "Some said influenza B has lighter symptoms than type A, but [in this case] I think it's not," Park added. On the internet, some say that they suffered from influenza A and B in a two-week interval. A baby gets a flu shot at a pediatrics clinic in Seoul on Dec. 7. [NEWS1] There are three types of flu viruses: A, B and C. Type A is associated with the winter season, usually spreading in December. Then, influenza B follows typically in spring, mostly in March or April. The recent epidemic is mainly led by influenza A but also accompanied by influenza B, resulting in a growing number of patients. According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, in the second week of December, 42.2 percent of those tested for the flu tested positive. By virus type, 35.2 percent tested positive for influenza A, while seven percent tested positive for influenza B. In 2019, the number was 4.2 percent for influenza B for the same time period. "Different infectious diseases mingled up together after the Covid-19 pandemic," Lee Young-seok, a professor of respiratory conditions and critical care at Korea University Guro Hospital, said. "While the type A influenza virus is the leading actor, influenza B cases are detected occasionally. No one is immune from influenza even after recovery. If the virus type alters, the person can catch the flu again." "The person sick with the flu has trouble in their immune system. It means that they can have reinfection." A man waits to receive a free flu shot at a hospital in Gwanak District in southern Seoul in October. [YONHAP] Medical professionals noted the importance of getting vaccinated as the flu epidemic can continue until spring next year. They added patients should seek and accept medical treatment as soon as possible. "As there were fewer flu cases over the last three years, [when people maintained strong quarantine measures] the flu antigens that people used to possess are a bit deteriorated. This triggered heavier and serious symptoms [that are seen today]," Lee added. "When flu causes acute respiratory distress syndrome or makes people have difficulty breathing, patients might need to rely on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a medical device providing oxygen to cure their respiratory failure. At worst, it can lead to death." "For any person older than 65 or with illnesses such as diabetes, vaccination is mandatory [as a cautionary measure.] Thankfully, there are medications for cure with no reported tolerance of the substances. Patients should take medicine or have an injection within 48 hours after their symptoms appear," he said. "One-third of hospitalized patients [at the department] are flu patients," Chon Eun-mi, a professor and director of the respiratory center at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, said. "Any older adult patients, even those vaccinated, should take medical treatment when they have symptoms. It would be wiser to see doctors if their symptoms last after the treatment because it could develop into pneumonia complications."

Now is the time to clean frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and mobile devices often. Washing your hands will also help protect you from germs. I’m seeing influenza in both kids and adults.”Dr. Tiffney Widner, Children’s Hospital of Michigan pediatrician:“With RSV, it is ramping up. But I don’t think we’re having any excessive problems; it’s just a typical season. It doesn’t seem like it’s a lot. We’re also seeing Flu A. Sometimes we’ll see Flu A first then Flu B, sometimes it flips. There’s not a rhyme or reason as to when it pops up, and we treat them the same.If people think they have flu and they’re looking for a treatment, they should address it early. You need to treat it within two days of symptoms for it to have an effect. So if they have high-risk kiddos, they should be seen by their primary care physician or pediatrician if they have upper respiratory infection symptoms. Then their PCP can determine whether or not they need treatment.”Dr. Jennifer Stevenson, Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Fairlane:“At Fairlane, we’re seeing more and more COVID-19, consistent with the localational trends. Also, influenza and RSV numbers are on the rise, along with other viral respiratory illness that we can’t specifically identify as readily. There continues to be a significant amount of strep throat in the community as well. Going into the holiday, consider having home COVID-19 tests available (they’re available from the government) and if you’re feeling ill, please test prior to gathering with family and friends. Many are experiencing milder symptoms with covid, though there are vulnerable populations who continue to be at risk. We’re also seeing more patients requiring hospital admission with influenza. If you’re feeling ill and must go out, please consider wearing a mask around others. For your protection, as your immune system is likely stressed, and to protect those around you. No one wants to be sick during the holidays!”Dr. Zafar Shamoon, Chief of the Emergency Department, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital, Dearborn:“We have seen an uptick in RSV in a lot of kids and adults. We’ve also seen a lot of individuals coming in for a common cold/cough. There were a number of slip and fall cases last week with the ice. Now is a good time to check your carbon monoxide detector to make sure it’s working properly.”OAKLAND COUNTY -– Upper respiratory infections, Covid, influenza, stomach viruses, RSV, mononucleosis.Dr. Steven McGraw, Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Novi & Southfield Campus:“I’m seeing a large number of patients with upper respiratory infections including COVID-19 as people start to gather over the holidays. I’m also seeing patients with influenzae and stomach flu. A few other illnesses on the rise are strep throat, pneumonia and sinusitis. This is a reminder to wash your hands and get the flu shot. Over the holidays, people should be aware of the amount of alcohol they consume. Our rate of alcohol related accidents increases during this time.”Dr. Whitney Minnock, Chief of Pediatrics, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak:“We are seeing a lot of RSV, bronchiolitis and other respiratory viruses at this time. It’s very busy in our pediatric department.”Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital Emergency Department:“Here in the Emergency Department, we are seeing an uptick of fever/flu/COVID-19. We have also seen an increase in the amount of shortness of breathespiratory issues and some chest pain.”WASHTENAW COUNTY -– Influenza, RSV, Covid, respiratory viruses, stomach viruses.Dr. Brad Uren, Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine:“Seeing flu, RSV, Covid, and other respiratory viruses this week.

The aim is to create new or improved vaccines for some of the deadliest respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis (TB) and influenza. Developed in partnership with the University of Copenhagen, it is the first vaccines initiative globally to focus solely on understanding how to generate immunity in the airway itself. This is a potentially revolutionary means to block infection and prevent airborne diseases spreading between humans. A key partner in the initiative will be Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut (SSI). Research at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Initiative for Vaccines and Immunity (NIVI) will focus initially on TB, influenza and Group A Streptococcus (GAS), which collectively cause more than 2.5 million deaths per year. There is currently no licensed GAS vaccine, while the only available TB vaccine does not prevent lung disease in adolescents and adults, and influenza vaccines have limited efficacy and provide only short-term protection. Professor Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, sees great potential for NIVI, both in Denmark and globally. “The development of the Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated the extraordinary possibilities when interdisciplinary vaccine research and development are prioritised,” says Krogsgaard Thomsen. “With NIVI, the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the University of Copenhagen are building on that momentum and dreaming even bigger – working towards a world where respiratory diseases no longer end the lives of millions of people every year. “Here in Denmark, NIVI will consolidate current expertise in immunology and vaccine development, helping to establish an internationally renowned vaccine research system and ensuring that Denmark is at the forefront of translational vaccine science globally.” Developing vaccines and advancing knowledge Conventional vaccine design and testing typically focus on generating a systemic immune response that prevents severe disease or death. However, recipients can still get infected and pass the disease to other people. Vaccines that generate a local immune response at the site of infection – in the case of respiratory diseases, in the airways – could help prevent even mild infection, block transmission and generate long-term immunity. This could significantly reduce deaths and the burden on healthcare systems around the world. NIVI aims to develop new vaccines for TB, influenza and GAS that generate robust, local immunity in the airways and, by extension, limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance, a global pandemic driven in part by the overuse or misuse of antibiotics against airway infections. Furthermore, while most vaccine development initiatives focus on a single strategy, NIVI will compare different vaccine antigens, platforms, and delivery methods side by side, increasing the chances of success. In the case of delivery methods, for example, various strategies will be tested and combined, including conventional injection in the muscle and nasal sprays. By studying three very different viral and bacterial diseases and developing a range of vaccine candidates and technologies, NIVI will significantly advance understanding of both systemic and airway immunity, helping the world to tackle existing and future airborne threats. Bridging research and vaccine development NIVI has a unique structure among vaccine initiatives. It comprises two entities, which together will ensure a smooth path between basic research and vaccine development up to Phase II clinical trials. The research arm – the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Vaccines and Immunity (NCVI) – is funded via an eight-year grant and anchored in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen, which has gained global recognition for its expertise in infectious disease, immunology and technological innovation. “Basic research carries great importance when it comes to the health and well-being of the world’s population – both present and future,” says Dean Bente M. Stallknecht from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. “Vaccines and knowledge of immunology is a key part of that. Boosting excellent basic research within this field of research will pave the way for new discoveries and hold potential to make a huge difference to so many people all round the globe.” She also stresses the importance of creating translational pathways that lead from basic science into impact: “We are proud that we, as a faculty and university, are involved in setting up new types of initiatives specifically designed to foster translational research. One of our finest tasks as researchers and as a university is to make our research come to life and be of use, and this is what we can do with a structure like NIVI and the link-up between university and industry.” To this end, the Foundation has also established a limited liability company – the Novo Nordisk Foundation Vaccine Accelerator (NVAC P/S). NVAC will enable and enhance the work of NCVI by licensing and developing vaccine technologies, preparing vaccine formulations, reagents and assays, and coordinating the external clinical-grade production and clinical testing of promising vaccine candidates. Any revenue generated by NVAC will be reinvested in NIVI. National and international partnerships Collaboration with public and private actors will be crucial to the initiative’s success. A key partner will be Statens Serum Institut (SSI), which operates under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health. SSI has substantial expertise in vaccine design and development, and highly relevant research programs and infrastructure. “Vaccine research is crucial to ensure that we have the best possible protection against diseases in the future,” says Sophie Løhde, Minister of the Interior and Health. “There is a need for innovative solutions and public-private partnerships that can help improve vaccine research and thus public health globally. I am therefore pleased that the Novo Nordisk Foundation, in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen and Statens Serum Institut, will contribute to strengthening Denmark’s position as a leader in vaccine research and development.” National and international partnerships with world-leading research teams and experts with similar ambitions will also be established in the coming years, while NVAC will seek manufacturing partnerships to ensure that promising new vaccines have real-world impact and are accessible and affordable. NCVI and NVAC will be headed by the same person – the NIVI Executive Director/CEO, to be announced in 2024 – with the dual role ensuring close integration of the two entities. Until now, development of NIVI has been led by eminent vaccinologist and Senior Vice President of Infectious Diseases at the Novo Nordisk Foundation, Professor Peter Lawætz Andersen. “Fundamentally, designing vaccines with a focus on generating immunity in the respiratory system is a relatively unexplored area of research with astounding potential,” he says. “We hope that NIVI’s work can help prepare us for the next pandemic or even help consign airborne epidemics to history.” Watch this film to find out more about why NIVI is needed and how it will work: Watch a conversation about NIVI between Novo Nordisk Foundation CEO Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, the Foundation’s head of Infectious Diseases Peter Lawætz Andersen, and head of the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen, Charlotte Bonefeld: Read more about NIVI here.

The conversation included topics such as how viruses make people sick, how vaccines work, vaccine safety, and how to stay safe when there are lots of viruses circulating. Corbett-Helaire and Graham previously worked together at the National Institute of Health’s Vaccine Research Center, where they conducted groundbreaking research that led to the development of COVID vaccines. Corbett is now an assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Graham is senior advisor for global health equity and professor of medicine and microbiology, biochemistry, and immunology at Morehouse School of Medicine. Corbett-Helaire and Graham spent much of the hour talking about RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which can be particularly dangerous to babies and young children and to older people. Graham explained that babies are susceptible because their immune systems are just beginning to form, and older people are susceptible because their immune systems are waning. That’s why it’s important for these groups to get the new RSV vaccine, he said. Corbett-Helaire noted that an older person who gets the RSV vaccine is about 85% less likely to get a severe RSV infection. “That is whopping,” she said. “It is an absolutely astonishing vaccine.” Graham said that there are two ways to protect babies from RSV—either by giving a pregnant woman the RSV vaccine, so that she develops antibodies that get passed to her baby through the placenta, or by giving the baby an injectable monoclonal antibody that can provide protection for five to six months. Graham also talked about how to tell if a baby may have RSV. “All babies have a drippy nose half their life,” he said. “But if a baby starts breathing very fast, and if you look at their chest and they take a breath, and the places in between their ribs are pulled in, that’s a sign that the baby is really struggling. That is when you probably need to go see a physician and get some help.” While the ideal time to get vaccinated for RSV, COVID, or flu is in September or October, Corbett-Helaire noted that “the season for these viruses sometimes lasts well into March. So if you want to be protected, especially against severe disease, you should go get your vaccines as soon as possible.” Graham talked about how the RSV vaccine was developed, with the help of technology that enabled scientists to see atomic-level detail of how the virus was structured. And he described the lengthy process required to ensure the vaccine’s safety, including randomized trials involving thousands of people around the world. Corbett-Helaire took questions from listeners. One asked what high school or undergraduate students could do to become vaccine scientists in the future. Corbett-Helaire urged young people to seek out opportunities to learn about the field, noting that there are summer programs at Harvard Chan School and Morehouse and internships at the NIH. Graham added, “I really hope to see more young people looking at [the field of] biology and what it has to offer, because if we can make people healthier, everything would be better for everyone.” Learn more Vaccinologist Kizzmekia Corbett-Helaire on COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and more (Harvard Chan School news) Kizzmekia Corbett is just getting started (Harvard Public Health) Share this:FacebookTwitterLinkedInReddit Newsletters Get the latest Harvard Chan School news delivered to your inbox.

With flu season underway in Connecticut, cases of the virus — as well as COVID-19 and RSV — are on the rise, with each expected to peak at different points over the next several weeks. Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist at Hartford HealthCare, said RSV may peak soon. He expects flu cases to tick up in the coming weeks. “Like last year, we’re seeing RSV first. And RSV is certainly going up, [but] it may have peaked in numbers; may actually be on its way down,” Wu said. “And right on the heels of that is influenza. I expect influenza cases to really start rising after RSV starts dropping, and that will probably continue through December and peak toward the end of the month, maybe mid-January, and then start dropping.” A swell in COVID cases will come later, Wu said. He expects those to peak in January. With cases rising, public health professionals are urging preventative measures including vaccinations and staying home when sick.

Leave this field empty if you're human: Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani said masking “doesn’t hurt” and can be protective, but “with the case and disease burden we have right now, it’s not where any sort of requirement would be necessary.” Here’s a look at this year’s COVID-19, RSV and flu trends in Connecticut. COVID-19 Wastewater data shows a rise in COVID-19 since Thanksgiving — but not to the extent of last year’s sharp increase, said Jordan Peccia, professor of environmental engineering at Yale who leads wastewater testing there. The data, which Peccia said has become a key indicator of outbreaks, shows COVID-19 in New Haven is currently slightly less prevalent than it was in fall 2022 and is at levels roughly equal to February and March 2023 — and far below December 2022 levels.

But we haven’t seen that yet this year.” More than 2,700 people have been hospitalized for COVID-19 in Connecticut since Oct. 1, and between Oct. 1 and Dec. 15, 172 have died, according to Connecticut Department of Public Health data. As of Dec. 14, 741 people in Connecticut have died from COVID in 2023, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data — a number much lower than last year, when the state saw 2,580 deaths. At Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, COVID cases have stayed relatively flat this fall. The facility reported 17 COVID hospitalizations in September, 19 in October and 18 in November. Dr. Ian Michelow, head of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Connecticut Children’s, said the facility has seen COVID cases in children start to rise over the last few months, but not to an overwhelming extent. “What I’m guessing is [the COVID case rate] will go up, but not necessarily to the same extent as last year and the year before, because a lot of people have now been infected and developed natural immunity,” Michelow said. Flu Flu cases have been ticking up in Connecticut since early November, and experts say they’re expected to peak by late December or mid-January before beginning to drop. Since Oct. 1, more than 100 people in Connecticut have been hospitalized for the flu, and five have died, according to DPH data. Last year, Connecticut hit 102 flu-related hospitalizations by late November. Juthani said at the time that last year's flu season came earlier than those of the previous four years. At Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, flu cases have risen slightly. The facility recorded three flu-related hospitalizations in September, four in October and six in November. RSV Hospitalizations for Respiratory Syncytial Virus have increased more rapidly than those for the flu among children. Connecticut Children’s recorded 10 in September, 61 in October and 158 in November. But Michelow said despite the increase, RSV cases haven’t climbed as high as last year. “It doesn’t seem to be as bad as last year. In October of last year, we saw a huge surge of RSV. That was a dominant virus, and it trailed off toward December. ... This year it’s been a slower start,” he said. “RSV certainly increased during November, a little bit later than last year. And now what we’re seeing is it has reached a fairly high peak — not as high as last year. And I believe, from what I’m hearing our emergency department, it’s starting to plateau.” A new RSV vaccine recently became available, but experts say it’s too early to tell whether the shot has helped lower case rates.

(CBC)Social SharingAlberta Children's Hospital is facing an influx of kids sick with respiratory viruses so it's adding capacity in an effort to meet demand."The emergency departments are quite full, very busy," said Dr. Stephen Freedman, an ER physician at the hospital.As case counts in the province spike, he's seeing a lot of children with influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). There are some cases of COVID-19, too, he said."Does it take away from other resources and capacity to do other things? For sure it does. Is it straining our ability to provide care to all the children as efficiently and as expeditiously as we want? For sure," said Freedman, who is also a professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at the University of Calgary."But is it the same as last year? Is it as overwhelming as last year? I would say no, not at this point in time."Care was delayed, staff were redeployed and surgeries were postponed when Alberta's pediatric hospitals were slammed by an unprecedented wave of very sick children during last year's respiratory virus season.In response to this fall's surge, Alberta Health Services (AHS) has added six surge beds to the hospital, bringing the total to 162."This year is similar to prior years, but given the preparedness of the teams with the experience of last year's increase in respiratory cases, the volumes are being managed, and pressures are not as significant as this time last year," an AHS spokesperson said in an email. Hospital surge beds added as pressure grows in Alberta's intensive care units Alberta hospitals already in 'disaster' mode as virus season picks up, doctors warn "AHS is working hard to ensure we can continue to provide care to anyone who needs it."The health authority said no surgeries have been delayed at Alberta Children's hospital, and other departments, such as outpatient clinics, have not been impacted.Earlier this year, the provincial government dedicated $12 million in its budget to increase capacity at children's hospitals and help address seasonal spikes. The funding provided 10 surge beds and six pediatric intensive care beds as well as 61 permanent front-line staff positions at Alberta Children's Hospital.Dr. Stephen Freedman is a professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at the University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine. He says emergency departments are full but the situation isn't as overwhelming as last year. (Submitted by Dr. Stephen Freedman)Influenza, RSVAccording to Freedman, children are showing up in the emergency room with cough, runny nose and fever. There can be vomiting and diarrhea, and some kids have trouble breathing.The main culprits currently are influenza and RSV."I don't think the severity of illness is any different than we have seen in prior years, even those years prior to the pandemic," said Freedman."We definitely historically have always seen some children get quite unwell from influenza. Some require hospitalization."RSV, he noted, mostly affects very young children."They tend to develop difficulty breathing, sometimes low oxygen levels and often requiring hospitalization for oxygen therapy and supportive care until they can get over the illness."While they are seeing some cases of COVID-19, Freedman noted those children need to be admitted to hospital less often.According to the province's respiratory dashboard, 218 Alberta kids and teens have been hospitalized and 22 have been admitted to ICU due to influenza so far this season.The data for RSV is not available.COVID-19 has led to 194 hospitalizations and 19 intensive care admissions since the end of August for those 19 and under.Dr. Cora Constantinescu, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, says influenza does a lot of damage to the airways. (Submitted by Cora Constantinescu)Serious complicationsDr. Cora Constantinescu, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Alberta Children's Hospital, wants parents to understand influenza can lead to serious complications."The flu takes out so much of your own innate immune responses and barriers to other bacterial infections, and that's how kids end up in hospital with tubes inside their lungs," she said."Influenza does a lot of damage to the airways. It also takes down the immune system. So those two things combined allow the bacteria that we harbour in our noses and our pharynx to take over," said Constantinescu.When that happens, bacteria can get into the lungs (causing pneumonia), the blood (causing sepsis) and the brain (causing meningitis).Significant number of kids in hospital as respiratory illnesses rise'They're all back': B.C. medical experts warn of seasonal illness 'tridemic'Constantinescu is watching case counts closely and she's worried the respiratory virus season has yet to peak."I suspect that even come January we're not going to be out of this red zone of respiratory virus hospital admissions," she said.While the school break will provide some relief from transmission, she said, indoor gatherings will likely be a hot spot. It's not too late to get vaccinated, she said."We do have influenza and COVID vaccines and they're all available to children as well.… That's one big part of prevention," she said."It's the unimmunized children who end up in hospital, who end up with these severe infections."ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

That's why significant numbers of children are getting sick at the moment because they're not likely to have any form of natural immunity to the organism."Queensland Chief Health Officer John Gerrard urged elderly people to stay up-to-date with their vaccinations. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)Dr Gerrard suggested the rise in gatherings of family, friends, and work colleagues ahead of Christmas, and an influx of travellers from interstate and overseas, may have also contributed to the unexpected spike in respiratory illness during the holiday season."I am concerned that at Christmas time we will see spread to the elderly," he said."If you are sick, try and avoid elderly and vulnerable relatives and friends. "Even if you've just got a mild cold or sore throat [or] cough, please avoid close contact."'Still enjoy your Christmas'Dr Gerrard stressed he did not want to be seen as the Christmas Grinch.

The number of people with prescriptions forgoing flu vaccination is indicative of the need to simplify procedures, enhancing the role of pharmacies in the drive to ramp up Poland’s immunisation performance, according to experts. Vaccinations in pharmacies are conducted in many countries across Europe. Facilitating access to vaccines brings numerous benefits to the healthcare system and contributes to reducing overall treatment costs. In Poland, pharmacies began administering vaccines in 2021 with the Sars-CoV-2 shots. Pharmacists have vaccinated approximately 5% of the population against COVID-19 so far. However, starting from July 1, 2023, the option of vaccinating against COVID-19 in pharmacies was removed, following the lifting of the “state of epidemic” or epidemic threat in Poland. Access to vaccination against COVID-19 for individuals aged 18 and above in pharmacies was only reinstated on December 1, even though pharmacists were authorised to perform vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal disease from November 1, 2023. For individuals aged 65 and above, a single-dose regimen is fully reimbursed by the National Health Fund (NFZ). For individuals aged 18 to 64, vaccinations against the flu are subject to a 50% reimbursement, while pneumococcal vaccinations are administered at the full cost. Additionally, people in this age group also have to consider that the pharmacist may also charge them for the cost of the vaccination service. Poland's vaccine problems However, despite the accessibility of vaccination services at pharmacies, the system appears to be plagued by inefficiencies, resulting in a concerning number of individuals foregoing the influenza vaccine. In the previous flu vaccination season, only approximately 5.5% of the population in Poland opted for the jab. For seniors, the rate was only 23%. This is significantly low, as the World Health Organisation recommends a vaccination rate of at least 75% among seniors. Predictions suggest that the statistics will not get any better this year. One of the main issues appears to be the lengthy patient journey from the decision to get vaccinated to the actual administration of the vaccine. "In the case of flu vaccinations, the patient must first obtain a prescription and then proceed to the pharmacy to purchase the vaccine," Prof. Adam Antczak, chairman of the Scientific Council of the Nationwide Program for Combating Infectious Diseases (OPZG), explained to Euractiv. Although a pharmacist can also issue a prescription, such a vaccination always comes with a 100% cost. Pharmacists are not authorised to provide discounted prescriptions. The complex regulations and additional costs lead to many individuals ultimately opting out of vaccination. According to data presented by OPZG, in the time between a prescription for flu vaccination is issued to the actual jab at the pharmacy, up to 130,000 people, or over 8% of all individuals who received a prescription from a doctor, decide to forgo the vaccination. “One way to improve this situation could be the introduction of reimbursable pharmaceutical prescriptions. This would allow patients to receive a prescription without the need to visit a doctor, significantly enhancing convenience and access to vaccinations," Prof. Antczak told Euractiv. But it is not only vaccine beneficiaries who have problems. In Poland, for pharmacists to administer vaccinations in pharmacies, many organisational requirements must be met, posing a significant burden in terms of time and cost. Pharmacists note that during the pandemic, procedures were much simpler and faster. “It is worth considering simplifying procedures and providing support for pharmacists to encourage the opening of vaccination points in pharmacies,” said Prof. Antczak. Pharmacy vaccinations across Europe Data reveals that, as of 2020, vaccinations in pharmacies were available in 13 European countries. For instance, in France, where the average flu vaccination rate is 52-55%, pharmacists receive proper training and then can provide any vaccination from France's 'vaccination calendar' to individuals over the age of 11, with a few exceptions. In Poland, pharmacy vaccinations are restricted to individuals aged 18 and above, with children and adolescents under 18 only eligible for vaccination in primary healthcare facilities. However, experts anticipate that the accessibility of vaccinations in pharmacies for younger age groups is just a matter of time. In addition to influenza vaccination, several other vaccines are available in pharmacies in many European countries. "In the United Kingdom, pharmacists administer vaccines against 16 different diseases, while in France against 12,” Prof. Antczak said. A shift towards pharmacy vaccination Pharmacies are the most easily accessible places where patients can be quickly and safely vaccinated, benefiting the population at large. Another important aspect supporting the expansion of vaccinations in pharmacies is the fact that they attract individuals who have never been vaccinated before. For example, 23% of those vaccinated against the flu in the local pharmacy received the vaccine for the first time, and interestingly, 83% of them belonged to the high-risk group for severe illness, according to a report by PSI (Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland).

They show that, in addition to ordering AHS to remove references to specific vaccines, the government instructed the health authority to limit information on vaccine benefits and efficacy.In one e-mail dated Sept. 28, Chris Bourdeau, communications director for the ministry, asks AHS officials to remove the government’s logo from campaign posters and replace “both influenza and covid with just ‘fall immunizations.’” Then, on Oct. 3, he wrote: “The desire is to not indicate the types of vaccines available, just that they are.”Alberta Premier Danielle Smith won the leadership of the United Conservative Party last year largely because of her fierce opposition to Alberta’s pandemic public-health restrictions. She has voiced skepticism of vaccines, promoted alternative treatments, and repeatedly blamed AHS for failures in the health system.Since taking office in October, 2022, she has frequently reiterated her opposition to public health measures, such as vaccine passports, and has vowed to update the Alberta Bill of Rights to protect the unvaccinated. Her government fired and replaced AHS’s board, and is now in the process of dismantling the organization into smaller units.The province’s current vaccination rate against influenza, at 22 per cent, is the lowest in 12 years. The uptake for the latest COVID-19 vaccines in the province is 14.3 per cent – on par with the national average. Public health experts have said these paltry numbers are partly to blame for the fact that Alberta’s hospital wards and emergency department waiting rooms are now overflowing with patients. The Globe and Mail reported last week that some doctors have said the situation is worse than it was during the height of the pandemic.Charlotte Taillon, press secretary to Alberta Health Minister Adriana LaGrange, said in a statement that AHS and the government collaborate on many initiatives to ensure “consistency of content,” and to limit confusion among Albertans. She said nearly $516,000 has been spent on this year’s seasonal immunization campaign to date.“Alberta’s government is committed to ensuring Albertans have access to what they need to make decisions that benefit their ability to live a healthy life, including access to vaccines,” she said.Kerry Williamson, a spokesperson for AHS, said in a statement that this year’s campaign “used similar content and messaging” to that used in last year’s campaign.The annual vaccination push usually includes advertisements on the radio, billboards, television, social media and newspapers. In previous years, campaign posters have been plastered on the sides of city buses, and on screens at NHL games. Last year, a text message from the provincial government encouraged residents to get the influenza vaccine. In 2018, one public advertisement read: “Influenza: Could be one less thing your child brings home this winter. Influenza is serious. Immunization works. Protect your family.”This year, the campaign is far less obvious.The Globe requested copies of the advertisements currently in circulation, but neither AHS nor the ministry provided them. There are no advertisements for the immunization campaign running on the official Alberta government Facebook page, according to Facebook’s advertising database. AHS is running advertisements that do not include the Alberta government logo. They say “get immunized,” and make no mention of COVID-19 or influenza.The internal documents obtained by The Globe show that two officials from AHS – Kristin Klein, lead medical officer of health for communicable disease control, and Shannon Shimek, executive director of communications – separately, in mid-September, alerted the government of “increasing pressure” on public health teams, front-line workers and Health Link 811, the province’s health advice hotline, to provide information about fall immunizations.They asked for a clear timeline for sharing information with the public. But government officials told them multiple times to hold off.“Specifically, do we need to wait for a public announcement to be able to [communicate] about the fall immunization program with stakeholders and the public? If so, we really need that to happen ASAP because we have not said anything about the XBB program in particular,” Dr. Klein said in a Sept. 14 e-mail, referencing the latest iteration of the COVID-19 vaccine. “We would be WAY behind the 8 ball if this waited until just before the public launch.”Celine O’Brien, executive director of health and wellness for the ministry, responded: “Communication to the public can go after there is a public announcement which continues to be TBD.”On Sept. 20, Wanda Aubee, an assistant deputy minister, warned in an e-mail that “cases are increasing” in the province. “A program co-administering influenza and COVID-19 XBB [vaccines] is the most efficient and effective approach for all of us to achieve the public health outcomes,” she wrote.The government announced in a news release on Sept. 28 that Albertans would be able to book seasonal immunizations starting Oct. 10. It made no mention of the new generation of COVID-19 vaccines.Ms. LaGrange and Mark Joffe, the provincial chief medical officer of health, were quoted in the release saying people can protect themselves, others and the health system by getting immunized. Albertans were told to speak with their primary care providers for guidance.But the documents show that the final news release underwent significant revisions before being shared publicly. Those revisions included the removal of details about vaccine eligibility, immunization locations by age group and the types of vaccines being offered and their efficacy against different strains of COVID-19 and influenza. Two lines that encouraged Albertans to book vaccination appointments were also deleted.It is unclear why the changes were made.Shannon MacDonald, a professor at the University of Alberta’s school of public health, said ambiguity in immunization campaigns can be problematic, because it might leave people questioning whether getting vaccinated is the right choice. She said successful campaigns are crafted so that people “see themselves in the message.”She added that it must also be made clear that vaccines are easy to access.Jia Hu, a public health physician and professor at the University of Calgary, said governments need to convey a consistent, strong message in favour of vaccination. “You ideally want your leaders, your health care workers all recommending vaccines unequivocally,” he said.In September, Ms. Smith deflected questions about whether she would get the COVID-19 shot this year. She told media that she is in good health and that vaccination is a personal and private choice – an answer echoed by Ms. LaGrange.Please enable JavaScript to view this content.Report an editorial errorReport a technical issueEditorial code of conductRelated storiesAn alarming number of my friends have COVID-19.

Are any new illnesses impacting children this year? Most families know, and certainly all doctors know that there is more respiratory disease in children in the winter. This is because there are more respiratory viruses that circulate in the winter. This year, the biggest troublemakers are the commonly known respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza (flu). How can people protect their families? Families should do what they’ve always done. When people are not feeling well they should not go to work or school, wash their hands as hand hygiene is important to slow the spread of infection, and everyone over the age of six months should get a flu shot. For those who are are worried about COVID-19 it is recommended to get that booster as well. Getting these vaccines is something that everyone can do to protect themselves against severe disease. The Hamilton Public Health website provides locations in which the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine are available. Do children need medical care for a cold or the flu? Most viral illnesses have no specific treatment and can be managed at home. So, when a child is sick try to keep them as comfortable as possible. Ensure they’re drinking enough liquids. A fever can be treated with antipyretics such as acetaminophen or Ibuprofen. At what point is medical attention needed? A child should be taken to the emergency department if they’re having difficulty breathing or not getting enough fluids. Parents and caregivers can tell if a child is not drinking enough, if they notice that they’re not peeing frequently. And, if a child has a fever for more than five days then they should be taken to their family doctor. Does cold weather make you sick? No, being cold does not give someone a viral illness. While there are a lot of good reasons to wear a jacket in the winter, that in and of itself will not predispose someone to developing a respiratory infection.

(Shafkat Anowar / Staff Photographer)Respiratory virus season has brought a wave of influenza and COVID cases in North Texas just as families and friends start gathering for holiday celebrations.COVID-19 hospitalizations have crept from fewer than 300 patients in early November to 533 patients on Tuesday, according to Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council data. Positive flu tests in Dallas County have also been steadily increasing, going from a 2.9% positivity rate for the week ending Nov. 11 to a 9.6% positivity rate for the week ending Dec. 9.Advertisement“With the holidays approaching and people being quite mobile, we might want to take extra precautions to help prevent any further spread of COVID-19,” said Steve Love, president and CEO of the DFW Hospital Council. “Many people are testing positive at home for COVID-19 but thankfully are not requiring hospitalization.”AdvertisementD-FW Public Health AlertsGet the latest public health updates.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyCOVID hospitalizations are still far below the more than 4,000 seen at the height of the omicron surge in January 2022. Current numbers are more in line with last year: North Texas hospitals recorded 765 COVID patients on Dec. 30, 2022.Several COVID strains are circulating in Texas, but subvariants HV.1 and JN.1 have taken the lead, representing 27.3% of cases each as of Dec. 9, according to Department of State Health Services data. The World Health Organization recently declared JN.1 a “variant of interest” because of its rapid spread in multiple parts of the world.AdvertisementConversely to COVID and the flu, RSV appears to be on the decline after weeks of climbing cases that filled nearly every pediatric bed in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Systemwide respiratory syncytial virus cases at Children’s Health fell from 493 in the week beginning Nov. 26 to 296 in the week beginning Dec. 10.RSV can be life-threatening for infants and older adults, causing the lungs’ small airways to inflame or plug with mucus. A local 8-month-old was hospitalized for five days after contracting RSV, COVID, adenovirus and rhinovirus at the same time.AdvertisementAfter years of early and unpredictable cold and flu seasons that were interrupted by COVID-19, this year’s trajectory appears to be normalizing, said Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of infectious diseases at Children’s Health.Advertisement“It’s starting to look like more of a typical year than all the craziness we saw during the pandemic,” said Kahn, who is also a professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center.When the flu will peak is an entirely different question. The flu is harder to predict because multiple strains of the virus circulate at once. Influenza A and Influenza B are both present in positive test data from Dallas County.“If you look historically, we’ve seen flu peaks in December, we’ve seen them in January, we’ve seen them in February,” Kahn said. “Sometimes there are multiple peaks.”AdvertisementExperts are urging patients to practice good health hygiene — regular hand washing and social distancing, when appropriate — as they gather to celebrate the holidays. It’s also not too late to get vaccinated against the circulating viruses.Federal regulators OK’d new RSV protections, including vaccines for adults over 60 and pregnant women and a monoclonal antibody shot for infants. Anyone 6 months or older is eligible for the flu vaccine, while anyone 6 months or older who hasn’t received a COVID-19 vaccine in the last two months can get an updated Pfizer or Moderna booster.Related StoriesView MoreBoil water notice in effect for Alvord in Wise CountyRichardson boil water notice lifted after no contamination concern found in testRichardson schools to open Friday, but when will city boil water notice end?Connect with needs and opportunities from Get immediate access to organizations and people in the DFW area that need your help or can provide help during the Coronavirus crisis.

As the coronavirus and other pathogens spread and settle in the Indian weather conditions, it is important to maintain constant vigil over the situation till the district level, the health ministry said.The ministry has asked states to increase the number of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, tests and send samples that are positive for genome sequencing to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium laboratories to detect new variants of the virus.The number of active Covid-19 cases in India as of Monday was 1,828, NDTV reported.Kerala, where the JN.1 variant has been detected, has reported one death. However, Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium chief Dr NK Arora told NDTV that the patient’s death was caused by multiple underlying health conditions, not just the coronavirus subvariant.States have been advised to put in place public health measures to minimise the spread of the disease, the Centre said on Monday.State governments have also been advised to adhere to the operational guidelines issued in June 2022 as part of the revised surveillance strategy to curb the spread of Covid-19.After the detection of the new variant, the Karnataka government on Monday made wearing of masks mandatory for persons aged 60 and above, those having comorbidities and showing symptoms of cough, phlegm and fever, NDTV reported.Karnataka Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said that testing has been increased among those who show symptoms of Covid-19. Surveillance in districts bordering Kerala has also been increased, he said.Rao added that no restrictions have been implemented on movement and gathering, and the Karnataka government will decide the course of action based on the situation.

Besides COVID-19 and rhinovirus, the number of people who have flu is also increasing. We are also seeing more and more people with pneumonia. Some of these cases are caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Do you have respiratory symptoms? Follow the recommendations to minimise the spread of these viruses and bacteria. This also helps to protect people who are more at risk if they get a respiratory infection. The severity of a respiratory infection can range from mild cold symptoms to serious pneumonia. Some people may become seriously ill from a respiratory infection. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can be dangerous to very young children. Viruses like the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and influenza (flu) cause an additional risk for older people and for people who have chronic illnesses or severely impaired immunity. However, people without underlying chronic illness or impaired immunity also end up with long-term symptoms from COVID-19. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and pneumococcus are examples of bacteria that can cause severe respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. What to do if you have respiratory symptoms If you develop symptoms that could indicate a respiratory infection, follow the recommendations below. By doing so, you can help prevent respiratory viruses and bacteria from spreading. And you will also protect people who are more at risk if they get a respiratory infection. Are you ill? Then stay home. If you are not ill, but do have symptoms, then work from home if you can. Consult your employer if necessary. Cough and sneeze into your elbow. Keep your distance from others. Avoid contact with people who could become seriously ill from a respiratory infection. Impossible to avoid contact (for example because you provide informal care)? Wear a face mask that covers the mouth and nose. Good hygiene helps to limit the spread of infections and can help keep you from getting infected. Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water, and ventilate indoor spaces. Latest figures Besides COVID-19, the number of people who have flu is also increasing. Last week, the number of people with flu-like symptoms rose above the threshold for a flu epidemic for the first time this season. In the Netherlands, the normal threshold for declaring a flu epidemic is if more than 56 in 100,000 people visit their GP with flu-like symptoms for two consecutive weeks, and various sources show that more influenza virus has been detected. The number of people with pneumonia is also increasing, especially in the age groups of 5–14 and 15–24 years. RIVM monitors the development and spread of respiratory infections and publishes a weekly update on the latest figures on the website.

Trends of the week: COVID-19: increase in the number of cases of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): slight increase in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: sharp rise in the number of cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 11 to 17 December 2023 (week 50), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased to 790 cases, compared to 658 cases the previous week (+20%). The positivity rate rose to 30% compared with 28% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater has increased. [1] The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the BA.2.86 variant (44%) followed by the XBB.1.9 variant (30%). [2] Influenza For the week of 11 to 17 December 2023 (week 50), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 245 cases compared to 138 cases in the previous week, presenting an increase of 77%. This data largely overlaps with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 11 to 17 December 2023 (week 50), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories rose to 152 cases, compared with 134 the previous week, presenting an increase of 13%.

Jasmyne Tillery-Kite was just nine years old when she died from complications of the flu after it weakened her heart. 2Jasmyne Tillery-Kite passed away just days after falling ill with the flu when the virus affected her heartCredit: noebrooks obituaries2The nine-year-old was diagnosed with influenza myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle brought on by the fluNow her family is hoping to raise awareness of its severity in children, as Jasmyne's dad urges other parents to "protect" their kids. The youngster, of Wilson, North Carolina, began feeling unwell on December 9 and was diagnosed with the flu just a few days later, Jasmyne's aunt Tessa Grimstead shared in a GoFundMe posted a few days before the little girl's death. After that, her condition deteriorated quickly as she began to fall in and out of consciousness and ended up being rushed to hospital by ambulance. There, medics discovered that the flu virus has made its way to Jasmyne's heart. She was diagnosed with influenza myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle brought on by the flu.Jasmyne was airlifted to UNC Children's Hospital early on December 14 and ended up going into cardiac arrest later that night.Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood, interrupting flow to the brain and other vital organs. Jasmyne was placed on life support and tragically passed away three days later on December 17.

"We plan to keep her name uplifted by bringing more awareness [about the] flu."The dad then pleaded with other parents and families: "Love your babies, protect them when they get sick and be aware." Children have lower immunityInfluenza myocarditis is rare and difficult to diagnose, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). It weakens the heart, preventing the body from getting enough blood and can also cause blood clots to form in the heart, triggering a heart attack. Heart complications are the second most common cause of deaths related to the flu, the AHA says, adding that viruses cause up to 70 per cent of myocarditis cases. Many of us do not take the flu seriously and do not understand the severity of the virusJeromeJasmyne's dadThe British Heart Foundation said myocaridits can cause: Chest pain or discomfort, or a feeling of tightness in the chestShortness of breath when you're resting or active, or in certain positions such as lying downUnusual tirednessPalpitations, which feels like your heart is fluttering, racing, or pounding An irregular heartbeatFeeling light-headed or faintingFlu-like symptoms such as high temperature, headaches, body aches, joint pain, or sore throat Rarely, swelling in hands, legs, ankles or feet "Many of us do not take the flu seriously and do not understand the severity of the virus," Jerome said in a separate Facebook post. "It is not just the flu. We just wanted to bring awareness of this side of the flu."ECU Health chief paediatrician Matthew Ledoux told WITN that flu can be particularly dangerous for kids. "Their immune systems are pretty young and they haven't been exposed to most of those things," he said, referring to illnesses like flu, Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus infections (RSV). These bugs all cause cold-like symptoms initially - but parents should seek medical help for their tots if their breathing becomes abnormal or they seem more lethargic, the paediatrician added. He outlined a few precautions families can take at this time of year to avoid getting ill.

The children's flu vaccine is offered on the NHS every year in autumn or early winter, but your child can get it later.It's recommended for kids aged two or three years, children in school (reception to Year 11) and any child from the age of six months with a long-term health condition.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been nine acute respiratory incidents caused by the flu that same week.

Based on the latest Disease Surveillance Report of the DOH, there were 193,148 influenza or flu-like cases from Jan. 1 to Nov. 25. The number is 50 percent higher than the 128,386 ILI cases reported during the same period last year. The top three regions that recorded cases of influenza-like illness are Davao region with 27,411 cases; Northern Mindanao with 24,357, and Central Visayas with 23,470. Meanwhile, the regions that recorded the highest increase in cases when compared to last year are Zamboanga peninsula with a 295 percent increase from 2,304 cases to 9,107, National Capital Region with a 116 percent increase from 5,359 cases to 11,570, and Cordillera Administrative Region with a 98 percent increase from 4,682 cases to 9,256. The data from the DOH’s Epidemiology Bureau also showed a decrease in deaths caused by ILI from 485 (0.38 percent case fatality rate or CFR) in 2022 to 271 this year – a CFR of 0.14 percent. The regions with the most number of deaths are Davao with 103, Central Visayas with 45 and Caraga with 34. ILI is defined as a medical diagnosis of possible influenza or other illness causing a set of common symptoms, which include fever, shivering, chills, dry cough, loss of appetite, body aches and nausea, sneezing typically in connection with a sudden onset of illness. COVID-19 symptoms DOH advised those experiencing COVID-19 symptoms to undergo antigen tests and not RT-PCR. “Reminders to everyone if you get symptoms, we recommend the antigen testing as we no longer recommend the RT-PCR because that’s too complicated,” said Health Secretary Ted Herbosa in a recent televised interview. He noted, “My recommendation is to isolate for about five days and probably have a rapid antigen test days later and if positive, continue to wear a mask even beyond five days even if you have required intermingling with other people.” The DOH chief stressed “continue to wear face masks because you can still have the virus even after 10 days.” RT-PCR is considered the current gold standard to confirm a SARS-CoV-2 infection while antigen rapid test for COVID-19 allows for quick detection and thus meant fast triaging of infected patients requiring isolation. Herbosa said previous recommendations during the time of the pandemic, like wearing a face mask if immunocompromised and staying at home if positive for COVID-19, still stand. The health official said people should be concerned, not only with COVID-19, but all other respiratory illnesses. “There are respiratory illnesses like influenza and other influenza-like illnesses. There is the common cold, many people are testing and they turn out negative – turns out to be some other viral condition that causes the colds,” he added. Earlier, the DOH said that COVID-19 cases are not a cause for concern anymore, especially for fully vaccinated individuals. Herbosa advised the public, especially members of the vulnerable sector, to employ protective measures. He said it is best to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or other influenza-like illnesses. “Our reminder is to employ hygienic practices. Cough etiquette, cover your mouth and nose, wash hands regularly, choose outdoor parties, and, for those with comorbidities, wear your mask always,” added Herbosa.

Residents are encouraged to receive vaccinations, specifically the flu shot, in a timely manner, while adhering to seminal hygiene practices. Dr Mahir Khalil Ibrahim Jallo, Clinical Professor and Senior Consultant of Internal Medicine at Thumbay University Hospital said, “December marks the season of travel and festivities, with individuals undertaking various journeys such as the holy pilgrimage to Mecca, holiday visits for Christmas, and a notable influx of tourists in UAE too. Against these factors, there has indeed been a noticeable rise in patients seeking medical attention for flu-related complaints.” Dr Mahir Khalil Ibrahim Jallo Success rate of vaccines Medics explain both adults and children are presenting symptoms such as high-grade fever reaching up to 40°C, headache, myalgia (muscle aches and pain), and nasal congestion. “In response to this, crucial preventive measures like vaccinations are recommended. The influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, and Haemophilus influenza vaccine are meant for individuals of all ages, including adults, the elderly, and children,” added Jallo.

But in unvaccinated patients, the disease can be severe with high fever lasting for 7-8 days. Patients experience severe bodypain, nose block, cough, throat pain, loose stools, extreme lethargy and poor appetite,” said Dr Shyam Rajamohan, Specialist Internal Medicine with Prime Hospital. Dr Shyam Rajamohan Medicines and basic first aid kit during travel Doctors emphasise that young children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic diseases are more vulnerable to severe complications from influenza. Dr Sherin Hussain, Specialist Internal Medicine, Medeor Hospital, Abu Dhabi said, “Vaccination is a highly recommended preventive measure for individuals aged 3 and older, as it not only protects the individual but also contributes to community immunity, reducing the overall spread of the virus.” Dr Sherin Hussain They also explain viral infections like flu tend to circulate more frequently with the fluctuation in temperature or when people are exposed to a new or crowded environment as viruses spread easily. “Pack essential medications and a basic first aid kit. Keep important documents, including medical records and prescriptions, easily accessible. Finally, don't forget to check travel advisories and health guidelines for your destination,” she added. Influenza A and B may aggravate allergic symptoms Dr Sai Srinivas Bhagavatula, Specialist Pediatrics and Neonatology, Aster Hospital Qusais points out parents should be advised to follow hygienic practices and advise their children to do the same. Dr Sai Srinivas Bhagavatula “It’s crucial to avoid overcrowded areas and look for danger signs like “high fever, breathing difficulties and excessive tiredness.” “Viral infections seem to have increased exponentially this season, notably we are seeing a rise in cases of Influenza A and B.” He said these viral infections have a tendency to aggravate allergic symptoms in children with pre-existing conditions like asthma. “Therefore, wear a mask especially in crowded or enclosed spaces like airports or public transportation, as this practice can help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses,” he added.
