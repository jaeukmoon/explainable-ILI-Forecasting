1. A Phase 1 clinical trial of a potential universal flu vaccine, called BPL-1357, has begun at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center.
2. The trial aims to test the safety of the vaccine and its ability to prompt immune responses in healthy adult volunteers.
3. The vaccine candidate, BPL-1357, was developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
4. BPL-1357 is a whole-virus vaccine made up of four strains of non-infectious, chemically inactivated avian flu virus.
5. Pre-clinical studies with mice and ferrets have shown promising results, with the vaccinated animals surviving exposure to different influenza virus strains.
6. The Phase 1 trial will enroll up to 100 people aged 18 to 55 years.
7. Volunteers will be randomized into three groups, receiving either the vaccine or placebo via intramuscular or intranasal administration.
8. The trial will evaluate the safety and immune response of BPL-1357 in comparison to placebo.
9. The development of a universal flu vaccine is a pressing global health priority, as it could provide long-lasting protection against a wide range of influenza viruses.
10. The trial at NIH is part of ongoing efforts to develop more effective and widely protective flu vaccines.
