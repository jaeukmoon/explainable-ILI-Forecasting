Conventional DIPs (cDIPs) contain a deletion in the genome and can only replicate upon co-infection with infectious standard virus (STV), during which they suppress STV replication. We previously discovered a new type of IAV DIP “OP7” that entails genomic point mutations and displays higher antiviral efficacy than cDIPs. To avoid safety concerns for the medical use of OP7 preparations, we developed a production system that does not depend on infectious IAV. We reconstituted a mixture of DIPs consisting of cDIPs and OP7 chimera DIPs, in which both harbor a deletion in their genome. To complement the defect, the deleted viral protein is expressed by the suspension cell line used for production in shake flasks. Here, DIP preparations harvested are not contaminated with infectious virions, and the fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs depended on the multiplicity of infection. Intranasal administration of OP7 chimera DIP material was well tolerated in mice. A rescue from an otherwise lethal IAV infection and no signs of disease upon OP7 chimera DIP co-infection demonstrated the remarkable antiviral efficacy. The clinical development of this new class of broad-spectrum antiviral may contribute to pandemic preparedness.

Infections cause annual epidemics, which lead to excessive morbidity and mortality1. When novel strains emerge, IAV infections may result in a severe pandemic, which is considered an imminent threat. For instance, more than 40 million deaths were reported during the “Spanish flu” in 19182. Annual prophylactic vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent seasonal influenza infection3. Yet, the selection of strains as well as the manufacturing and release of seasonal vaccines requires several months. Thus, small-molecule drug antivirals are also used, for instance, to treat acute infections1. However, circulating human IAV strains have acquired resistance against many current antivirals3. Therefore, new broadly-acting antiviral treatment options should be considered not only to complement annual vaccination schemes but also to act as a first line of defense for pandemic preparedness.Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are regarded as a promising new class of antivirals4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. In particular, DIPs resulted in a high tolerability and antiviral efficacy in animal studies5,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25, and were therefore proposed as prophylactic and therapeutic antivirals16,25,26,27. IAV DIPs typically contain a large internal deletion in one of the eight genomic viral RNA (vRNA) segments4,10,16,22,25,26,28,29,30. The missing genomic information results in the expression of a truncated viral protein31. Therefore, DIPs are defective in virus replication and cannot propagate in mammalian cells. In a co-infection with an infectious standard virus (STV), however, the missing gene function (i.e., the full-length (FL) protein) is provided, and DIPs can propagate. Interestingly, this results in a strong interference with STV replication. With respect to this antiviral effect, it is suggested that the short defective interfering (DI) vRNAs replicate faster and accumulate to higher levels than the FL vRNAs. Thereby, cellular and viral resources are depleted, which suppresses infectious virus replication32,33,34. DIP co-infections also result in a strong induction of the interferon (IFN) system35,36,37,38, and it was shown that this stimulation of the innate immunity also contributes to their antiviral effect25,26,35,37. As a consequence, IAV DIPs display a broad-spectrum antiviral activity that is not only directed against a wide range of IAV strains16,21,25,39,40, but even against unrelated viruses, including SARS-CoV-237,38,41,42.Previously, we developed a cell culture-based production process18,43 for a well-known DIP called “DI244” that harbors a deletion in segment 1 (Seg 1)25,26. DI244 is unable to express the viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2, encoded from Seg 1) and can be propagated in genetically engineered PB2-expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension (MDCK-PB2(sus)) cells18,43,44. In addition, using a modified reverse genetics workflow for IAV that is specific for DIP rescue, clonal DI244 without STVs could be reconstituted for production44. Therefore, considering the use of DIPs as an antiviral, the absence of infectious STVs is expected to alleviate potential safety and regulatory concerns.We previously discovered a new type of IAV DIP, called “OP7” that contains multiple point substitutions on segment 7 (Seg 7) vRNA instead of a large internal deletion39. OP7 showed a higher antiviral activity compared to Seg 1 conventional DIPs (cDIPs) including DI244 as shown in in vitro and in vivo experiments18,19,37. As the source of the defect in virus replication of OP7 is yet unknown, designing a cell line that could complement the defect of OP7 was not feasible, so far. Instead, we recently established a cell culture-based production process for OP7 in the presence of infectious STVs to complement the unknown defect19. However, infectious STVs had to be UV-inactivated, which also reduced the antiviral activity of OP7. Moreover, even after UV treatment, the risk of contamination with residual STVs should raise safety concerns concerning medical application.In the present study, we devised a genetically engineered cell culture-based production system for OP7, which does not require the addition of any infectious STV. Trials in mice suggest that the produced OP7 preparations can be used as a safe and potent antiviral, and further steps towards clinical development seem promising.ResultsReconstitution of OP7 chimera DIPs without infectious STVsPreviously, OP7 was produced in cell culture in the presence of infectious STVs19. To obtain an OP7 virus without infectious STVs (STV-free), we modified a plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the reconstitution of Seg 1-derived cDIPs based on the IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) as described previously44. As Seg 1 cDIPs contain a large internal deletion in Seg 1 and are unable to express the viral PB2 protein, the STV-free reconstitution of clonal Seg 1 cDIPs requires PB2-expressing cells (Fig. 1A–C). Here, a co-culture of adherent PB2-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T-PB2(adh)) and MDCK-PB2(adh) cells (Fig. 1B) were co-transfected with eight plasmids encoding for the deleted Seg 1 and the remaining seven wild-type (WT) segments (Fig. 1A). After reconstitution, such Seg 1 cDIPs (Fig. 1C) could be propagated in cell culture using PB2-expressing cells, as shown previously18,43,45.Figure 1Plasmid-based reconstitution of OP7 chimera DIPs free of infectious STVs. Rescue of Seg 1 conventional DIPs (cDIPs). The reverse genetics system comprises (A) eight plasmids that encode for a deleted Seg 1 vRNA and Seg 2–8 wild type (WT) vRNAs. (B) Co-transfection of a co-culture of PB2-expressing HEK-293T-PB2(adh) (high transfection efficiency) and MDCK-PB2(adh) (high virus titers) cells results in reconstitution of (C) clonal Seg 1 cDIP free of infectious standard viruses (STV). Rescue of OP7 chimera DIPs: addition of a (D) ninth plasmid that encodes for the mutated Seg 7-OP7 vRNA results in the reconstitution of a mixture of DIPs including (E) OP7 chimera DIPs and (C) Seg 1 cDIPs. This mixture of viruses can be propagated in MDCK-PB2(sus) cells (Fig. 2). Image was created with BioRender.com.Full size imageTo reconstitute OP7 chimera DIPs without infectious STVs, we added a ninth plasmid encoding for the mutated Seg 7 of OP7 (Seg 7-OP7) (Fig. 1D) for transfection. This resulted in the rescue of a population of two types of DIPs: (i) Seg 1 cDIPs (Fig. 1C) and (ii) OP7 chimera DIPs (Fig. 1E). Accordingly, the Seg 1 cDIPs contained a truncated Seg 1 vRNA and seven WT vRNAs (Fig. 1C) and OP7 chimera DIPs contained Seg 7-OP7 vRNA, a truncated Seg 1 vRNA, and the remaining six WT vRNAs (Fig. 1E). Owing to a deletion in Seg 1 (encoding for PB2), both DIPs could be propagated in MDCK-PB2(sus) cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, it has to be assumed that the OP7 chimera DIPs (Fig. 1E) are defective in virus replication in PB2-expressing cells, as they contain the mutated and defective Seg 7-OP7 vRNA. Accordingly, for propagation, OP7 chimera DIPs require complementation with Seg 1 cDIPs (Fig. 1C) as they provide the functional Seg 7-WT vRNA (Seg 7-WT). Moreover, as both DIPs (Fig. 1C,E) are replication deficient in non-PB2 expressing cells, we eliminate the need for post-production UV inactivation due to the lack of infectious STVs. Note that the deleted Seg 1 sequence used in the present study was previously identified by us (“Seg 1 gain”), where corresponding DIPs showed a superior in vitro interfering efficacy compared to the well-known DI24445. A seed virus stock was generated from the reconstituted OP7 chimera DIP material by serial passaging in MDCK-PB2(adh) followed by MDCK-PB2(sus) cells. This seed virus was used for subsequent cell culture-based production (Fig. 2). The absence of infectious STVs in the produced OP7 chimera DIP material was evaluated by two serial passages in adherent WT MDCK (MDCK(adh)) cells (innocuity assay). Both passages showed no virus titer, thus confirming no infectious STV replication (data not shown).Figure 2Cell culture-based production of OP7 chimera DIP enriched material in shake flasks. Genetically engineered MDCK-PB2(sus) cells cultivated in 125 mL shake flasks (50 mL working volume), were infected at multiplicity of infections (MOIs) ranging from 1E-2 to 1E-5 after a complete medium exchange.

(D) Fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs (calculated based on extracellular M1-OP7 and M1-WT viral protein concentrations, quantified by Mass spectrometry (MS). Total virus concentration was calculated from the protein concentration of nucleoprotein (NP), encoded by Seg 5. The optimal harvest time points (MOI 1E-2: 25 hpi, 1E-3: 32 hpi, 1E-4: 40 hpi, 1E-5: 48 hpi) were analyzed for C and D. The figure depicts the results of one experiment.Full size imageIn summary, we reconstituted OP7 chimera DIPs in a mixture with Seg 1 cDIPs without the addition of any infectious STVs. Seg 1 cDIPs can complement the defect of the OP7 chimera DIPs in PB2-expressing MDCK cells, allowing for cell culture-based production.Cell culture-based production of OP7 chimera DIP preparation in shake flasks shows a strong dependence on the multiplicity of infectionAs indicated above, OP7 chimera DIPs are defective in virus replication in MDCK-PB2(sus) cells and propagation requires co-infection with Seg 1 cDIPs. Previously, in a similar production system, we produced OP7 in the presence of infectious STVs in WT MDCK(sus) cells. As expected for virus production, total virus yields were multiplicity of infection (MOI) dependent19. High MOI conditions increased the likelihood of co-infection of STVs and OP7, resulting in preferential production of OP7 that suppressed STV propagation and thus, total virus yields. In contrast, in a low MOI scenario, more single hit infections occurred. Therefore, STV growth occurred predominantly and the propagation-incompetent OP7 was out-diluted, resulting in higher total virus titers with a concomitant lower fraction of OP719. We expected that the DIP mixture containing OP7 chimera DIPs and Seg 1 cDIPs would show the same MOI dependency in PB2-expressing cells. Thus, to optimize total virus yields and the fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs within the mixture, we performed infections in shake flasks using MDCK-PB2(sus) cells at different MOIs ranging from 1E-2 to 1E-5 (Fig. 2).After infection at 2.1 × 106 cells/mL, cells continued to grow (Fig. 2A). The viable cell concentration (VCC) post infection at an MOI of 1E-2 peaked fastest (3.0 × 106 cells/mL, 18 hpi) before there was a decrease in VCC. With decreasing MOIs, the maximum VCC increased and cell death started later. As expected, the hemagglutinin (HA) titer (indicating total virus yield) reached lower values at higher MOIs relative to lower MOIs (Fig. 2B), likely due to the inhibition caused by the increasing accumulation of OP7 chimera DIPs towards higher MOIs. This is in line with greater fractions of OP7 chimera DIPs at higher MOIs (Fig. 2C,D). For instance, we found a fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs of 94.4% (MOI 1E-2) and 24.2% (MOI 1E-5), calculated based on the extracellular vRNA concentration of Seg 7-OP7 and Seg 7 of the WT virus quantified by reverse transcription real time PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 2C). In addition, quantification of IAV proteins by a new mass spectrometry (MS) method developed in our group46 showed similar fractions of 90.2% (MOI 1E-2) and 19.0% (MOI 1E-5). Here the fraction was calculated based on the concentration of the extracellular matrix protein 1 (M1, encoded on Seg 7) of OP7 (M1-OP7) and of the WT virus (M1-WT) (Fig. 2D). Further, the total virus concentration (as indicated by the extracellular Seg 5 vRNA concentration (Fig. 2C) and calculated from the nucleoprotein (NP) concentration (Fig. 2D)) showed higher values for lower MOIs in line with HA titers (Fig. 2B). Previously, biological activity of IAV particles decreased over time as seen by a drop in the infectious virus titers towards late process times47, which is important for selecting the optimal harvest time point (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, for DIP harvesting, we selected the time point at which the HA titer almost plateaued to ensure maximum virus release and biological activity of the DIPs (MOI 1E-2: 25 hpi, MOI 1E-3: 32 hpi, MOI 1E-4: 40 hpi, MOI 1E-5: 48 hpi). Furthermore, harvesting was performed no later than the onset of cell death (Fig. 2A) to avoid excessive levels of cell debris and host cell DNA in the supernatant that would otherwise interfere with the subsequent downstream purification process. Further, final viral harvests were DIP depleted as we did not observe a strong accumulation of other DI vRNAs in Seg 2–8 as suggested by results from RT-PCR (Fig. 3).Figure 3Purity of produced OP7 chimera DIP material with respect to contaminating DIPs.

Upper thicker band of the ladder: 3000 bp, middle thicker band: 1000 bp, lower thicker band: 500 bp. Cropped gels are shown; original gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1.Full size imageTaken together, our results demonstrate that the MOI has a strong effect on OP7 chimera DIPs production. At high MOI, high fractions of OP7 chimera DIPs were present along with low total virus titers suggesting that OP7 chimera DIPs impeded virus propagation. On the other hand, higher total virus titers, but lower fractions of OP7 chimera DIPs were found at lower MOIs. Infections at intermediate MOIs of 1E-3 and 1E-4 appear to be a good compromise for achieving high OP7 chimera DIP fractions and high virus titers.The MOI used for production affects the in vitro interfering efficacyTo identify the optimal MOI yielding OP7 chimera DIP material showing the highest in vitro interfering efficacy per product volume an in vitro interference assay (Fig. 4) was carried out. In brief, WT MDCK(adh) cells were either infected with STVs only at a MOI of 10 (negative control, NC) or co-infected with 125 μL (fixed volume) of DIP material produced at different MOIs (Fig. 2).Figure 4In vitro interference assay with OP7 chimera DIP enriched material produced at different MOIs. MDCK(adh) cells were infected with STVs alone at a MOI of 10 (NC) or co-infected with 125 μL of indicated DIP material produced at different MOIs in shake flasks (Fig. 2).

Interference assay was performed in three independent experiments, corresponding samples were quantified in a single measurement. Error bars indicate the standard deviation (SD). Samples of the optimal harvest time points (Fig. 2) were analyzed.Full size imageOur results indicated the strongest interfering efficacy for the OP7 chimera DIP material produced at a MOI of 1E-3 and 1E-4. This was shown by a suppression of the infectious virus release by more than two orders of magnitude (quantified by the plaque assay), which was significantly more than the decrease of only a factor of two, observed for the material produced at a MOI of 1E-2 (p < 0.0001, One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey´s multiple comparison test), and significantly different to the reduction of one log for the material produced at a MOI of 1E-5 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A). For the total virus release, as expressed by the HA titer (Fig. 4A) and extracellular Seg 5 vRNA concentration (Fig. 4B), this trend was less pronounced. Further, co-infections with highly interfering DIP material, produced at a MOI of 1E-3 and 1E-4, resulted in a pronounced OP7 phenotype, i.e. an overproportional extracellular Seg 7-OP7 vRNA concentration in comparison to other gene segments19,39, indicating the preferential replication of Seg 7-OP7 vRNA during virus propagation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, an overproportional M1-OP7 concentration relative to M1-WT was found in progeny virions (Fig. 4C).In summary, the interfering efficacy of OP7 chimera DIP preparations strongly depended on the MOI for production with intermediate MOIs of 1E-3 and 1E-4 representing the optimum.High in vivo tolerability and antiviral efficacy of OP7 chimera DIP materialTo test the tolerability and antiviral efficacy of produced OP7 chimera DIP enriched material in a mouse infection model, DIP material produced in shake flasks and purified by steric exclusion chromatography (SXC)18,19,48,49 was used. The material was produced at MOI 1E-4 (8.96 × 109 virions/mL, calculated based on Seg 5 vRNA concentrations; OP7 chimera DIP fraction of 60.07%, calculated based on Seg 7-OP7 and Seg 7-WT vRNA concentrations). As a negative control, an OP7 chimera DIP preparation that was inactivated with UV light for 24 min was utilized, which typically does not show an interfering efficacy in vitro18,19.First, to test for the tolerability of the OP7 chimera DIP preparations, we administered 20 μL of active OP7 chimera DIPs (diluted to 1:2 and 1:20, corresponding to 8.96 × 107 and 8.96 × 106 virions per mouse, respectively) intranasally to the animals (Fig. 5A–C). Similar to PBS treatment, OP7 chimera enriched DIP treatment was well-tolerated, as indicated by the absence of weight loss (Fig. 5A) and clinical scores (Fig. 5B). Moreover, serum albumin levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of PBS and OP7 chimera DIP-treated mice were comparable, indicating that OP7 chimera DIP administration did not compromise lung integrity (Fig. 5C), which is otherwise typically observed in influenza-infected mice50,51,52. This was further confirmed by histopathological examination of the lungs. For mice treated with PBS (Fig. 6A), only minimal interstitial pneumonia located near the hilus and affecting less than 5% of the lung tissue was observed; a finding that can be typically attributed to intranasal application of liquid to the lungs. Mice treated with OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2 and 1:20 dilution) showed a minimal increase in inflammatory infiltration with rare lymphocytes detectable in the interstitium and few macrophages and neutrophils in the alveoli (Fig. 6A,B middle and right column) affecting only small parts of the lung tissue at the hilus, too. Yet, no histopathological changes that appear to be clinically relevant were observed, which is in line with the presentation of the clinical scores (Fig. 5B). Together, these data demonstrate that intranasal administration of OP7 chimera DIPs alone is well-tolerated.Figure 5In vivo tolerability and antiviral efficacy of OP7 chimera DIP preparations in a mouse infection model. (A–C) 20 μL of active OP7 chimera DIP material diluted to 1:2 (8.96 × 107 virions/mouse) or 1:20 (8.96 × 106 virions/mouse), or 20 μL PBS was intranasally administered to 12–24 weeks old female D2(B6).A2G-Mx1r mice (n = 5).

The differences between the mean body weight of mice co-treated with 1:2 (mixed-effects model and Tukey correction for multiple comparison, p < 0.0001) or 1:20 OP7 chimera DIPs (p < 0.05) were significant relative to co-treatment with PBS.

The differences between the survival of mice co-treated with 1:2 (log-rank test for two groups, p < 0.0001) or 1:20 OP7 chimera DIPs (p < 0.0001) were significant relative to co-treatment with PBS.

All lungs appear almost unchanged with only minimal interstitial pneumonia located near the hilus (arrows, for detail see image in the bottom row). (B) Mice were co-treated by administering 20 µL volume containing a lethal dose of 1000 FFU of STV (strain PR8) with either active OP7, diluted to 1:2 (6.5 × 108 virions/mouse) or 1:20 (6.5 × 107 virions/mouse).

Arrowheads: alveolar histiocytosis; encircled: neutrophils; arrows: pneumocyte type II hyperplasia; double arrows: perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration; b: blood vessel.Full size imageNext, we treated mice with a lethal dose of 1000 focus-forming units (FFU) of IAV STV (strain PR8) together with either active OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2 and 1:20), inactive OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2) or PBS (1:2) in a total volume of 20 μL. As expected, severe body weight loss and 100% IAV-induced mortality was observed in PBS co-treated mice (Fig. 5D,F). Further, similar to PBS co-treatment, mice co-treated with inactive OP7 chimera DIPs showed the same high infection-induced morbidity (Fig. 5D,E) and mortality (Fig. 5F), indicating the absence of protective efficacy by UV inactivated DIPs. In strong contrast, no body weight loss was observed when active OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2 diluted) were co-administered, while a higher dilution (1:20) resulted in a modest loss of body weight (approx. 16%). Importantly, all mice co-applied with active OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2 and 1:20) survived the otherwise lethal STV infection (Fig. 5F). Intriguingly, co-administration of active OP7 chimera DIPs (1:2) together with a lethal STV dose completely prevented the development of clinical signs (Fig. 5E) related for influenza infection compared to PBS treatment only (Fig. 5B). Even co-administration of active OP7 chimera DIPs diluted to 1:20 together with a lethal dose of STV was highly effective in preventing a severe course of influenza disease (Fig. 5E). In line with these findings, histopathological analysis revealed only a low-grade pneumonia characterized by mild perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, pneumocyte type II hyperplasia and alveolar histiocytosis of mice co-administered with a lethal dose of STVs and OP7 chimera DIPs at a dilution of 1:2 (Fig. 6B middle column). In comparison, a lethal dose of STV of strain PR8 typically resulted in hyper-inflammatory immune responses in infected lungs53. Even the co-application of the low (1:20) dose OP7 chimera DIPs was sufficient to protect the animals from a lethal outcome of pneumonia (Fig. 6B right column). Histopathologically, similar qualitative changes were identified in the animals of this group, but the lesion extent was significantly greater with additional onset of interstitial fibrosis and, in isolated cases, low-grade, florid suppurative inflammation.Taken together, intranasal application of only the OP7 chimera DIP material is very well-tolerated in mice. Furthermore, the co-administration of OP7 chimera DIPs mediated full protection against an otherwise lethal IAV STV infection. These data demonstrate the safety and remarkable antiviral efficacy of the produced OP7 chimera DIPs in vivo.DiscussionPrevious studies of our group showed that the MOI used for cell culture-based production of DIPs affects total virus yields18,19,54,55 and interfering efficacy18,19. Likewise, in the present work, we found the highest interfering efficacy for material produced at intermediate MOIs of 1E-3 and 1E-4 (Fig. 2). Here, a balanced trade-off between the fraction of OP7 chimera DIPs and total virus yields in the produced material appears to be decisive for the optimal interfering efficacy observed in vitro.In this study, we also evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of OP7 chimera DIP preparations harvested from shake flasks using a mouse model. Most laboratory mouse strains lack the Mx1 gene, which is an important IFN-induced restriction factor against IAV infections in mice and in humans. Therefore, we used a mouse model expressing a functional Mx1 gene, called D2(B6).A2G-Mx1r53. Accordingly, this model better represents the immune response in humans to IAV infections. Intranasal administration of high doses of only OP7 chimera DIP enriched preparations did neither result in disease, nor in clinically relevant histopathological changes in mice lungs, indicating a high tolerability after OP7 chimera DIP treatment (Fig. 5A,B,C and Fig. 6A). These results (and those of other groups5,16,20,21,22,23,24,25,40) clearly suggest that common concerns regarding adverse effects (e.g., cytokine storm, lung damage) due to DIP administration in animals can be abandoned and that DIPs, as defective, non-replicating viral particles might also be suitable for safe clinical applications in humans. Moreover, co-infection with a lethal dose of STV together with OP7 chimera DIPs resulted in 100% survival of the mice (Fig. 5F), and these animals did not even show signs of clinical disease (Fig. 5E). A similarly high antiviral activity (against lethal STV infection) was found for DIPs derived from IAV and from other viral species in different animal models5,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,40. Earlier investigations on the use of DIPs as prophylactic antiviral agents have shown promising results26,27. Here, mice were intranasally pre-treated with DI244 (a well-characterized Seg 1 cDIP) seven days before infection with a lethal dose of IAV, and the DIP pre-administration continued to provide protection25. Also, it was proposed to use DIPs as a therapeutic treatment due to its early onset of antiviral activity. Again, DI244 administered one or two days after lethal IAV challenge rendered full or partial protection, respectively25.In light of imminent pandemic threats, new broadly-acting antivirals that are readily available at low costs are required. IAV DIPs typically suppress a wide range of IAV strains including contemporary human epidemic, pandemic and even highly pathogenic avian IAV as demonstrated in vitro and in mouse and ferret experiments16,21,25,39,40. Surprisingly, IAV DIPs can even suppress unrelated virus replication. This unspecific protection is mediated by the ability of DIPs to stimulate innate immunity and to establish a so-called antiviral state. For instance, mice were rescued from a lethal dose of influenza B virus and pneumonia virus of mice by DIP co-administration38,41. In addition, we demonstrated a pronounced antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-237 and against respiratory syncytial, yellow fever and Zika virus replication in vitro42. Such broad protective immunity against many different unrelated viruses was also observed for dengue and poliovirus DIPs24,56. This suggests that DIPs could be used as broadly-acting antiviral agents to treat viral infections as a fast countermeasure to protect people at risk and restrict virus spreading, e.g., in the case of a pandemic.In future studies, a scalable cell culture-based production and purification process for OP7 chimera enriched DIPs should be established to achieve even higher titers and improve the purity of OP7 chimera DIP preparations. To leverage the antiviral potential of OP7 chimera DIPs, e.g. for use as an intranasal droplet spray26,27, the establishment of a good manufacturing practice (GMP) production process would then be the base for toxicology and safety studies, clinical trials and later on to market approval.Materials and methodsCells and virusesMDCK(adh) cells (obtained from ECACC, #84121903) and MDCK-PB2(adh) cells (expressing IAV PB2, generated by retroviral transduction, as described previously44) were maintained in Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #221000093) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Merck, #F7524) and 1% peptone (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #211709). Puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A1113803) was added to a concentration of 1.5 µg/mL for MDCK-PB2(adh) cells. HEK-293T-PB2(adh) cells (expressing IAV PB2, generated previously44) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/mL penicillin and 10,000 µg/mL streptomycin, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #15140122) and puromycin at a concentration of 1 µg/mL. All adherent cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.MDCK-PB2(sus) cells (expressing IAV PB2, previously generated by retroviral transduction18,44) were grown in chemically defined Xeno™ medium (Shanghai BioEngine Sci-Tech), supplemented with 8 mM glutamine and 0.5 μg/mL puromycin. Cultivation of the suspension cells was performed in shake flasks (125 mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask with vent cap, Corning, #1356244) in 50 mL working volume in an orbital shaker (Multitron Pro, Infors HT; 50 mm shaking orbit) at 185 rpm, 37 °C and 5% CO2. To quantify VCC, viability and diameter of cell, Vi-cell™ XR (Beckman Coulter, #731050) was used. IAV strain PR8 (provided by Robert Koch institute, #3138) was used for the interference assay. MOIs were based on the TCID50 titer for STV57 (interference assay) or the plaque assay (OP7 chimera DIP material production).Rescue of OP7 chimera DIPThe generation of OP7 chimera DIPs was based on a previously established plasmid-based reverse genetics system for the rescue of PR8-derived Seg 1 cDIPs44. Here, to complement the missing PB2 protein (deleted in Seg 1 cDIPs), a co-culture of HEK-293T-PB2(adh) cells and MDCK-PB2(adh) cells were used for plasmid transfections. For rescue of OP7 chimera DIPs, a pHW-based plasmid58 harboring the sequence of Seg 7-OP7 (GenBank accession number: MH085234) was newly generated and kindly provided by Stefan Pöhlmann and Michael Winkler (German Primate Center, Goettingen, Germany). 50 ng of this plasmid was co-transfected with 500 ng of a pHW-based plasmid harboring the deleted Seg 1 sequence of a previously described cDIP (“Seg 1 gain”45) and 1 µg of the remaining plasmids for Seg 2–6 and 8 (pHW192-pHW196 and pHW19858, respectively) via the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method. After reconstitution, OP7 chimera DIP material was amplified in MDCK-PB2(adh) cells and later used to infect MDCK-PB2(sus) cells for seed virus production.OP7 chimera DIP material production in shake flasksProduction of OP7 chimera DIP preparations in shake flasks using MDCK-PB2(sus) cells was conducted with complete medium exchange prior to infection as described previously18,43. In brief, cells in exponential growth phase were centrifuged (300×g, 5 min, room temperature) and resuspended in fresh medium (without puromycin) containing trypsin (final activity 20 U/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #27250-018) at 2.0 × 106 cells/mL. Cells were infected at different MOIs ranging from 1E-2 to 1E-5 at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At indicated time points, samples were centrifuged (3000×g, 4 °C, 10 min) and supernatants were stored at -80 °C until further analysis. RNA of progeny virions was extracted from supernatants using the NucleoSpin RNA virus kit (Macherey–Nagel, #740956) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -80 °C until PCR-based analysis.OP7 chimera DIP material for mouse infection studies was produced in shake flasks at a MOI of 1E-4. Harvested DIP material was clarified (3000×g, 10 min and 4 °C) and sucrose (Merck, #84097) was added at a final concentration of 4%. Next, the material was purified and concentrated by SXC as previously described18,19,48. Part of the purified, concentrated and sterile filtered DIP material was UV inactivated for 24 min. Active (no UV inactivation), inactive (UV inactivated) DIP material and PBS spiked with sucrose (4% final concentration) were stored at − 80 °C until further use.Virus quantificationInfectious virus titers were quantified using the plaque assay as previously described18,19,39 using MDCK(adh) cells (interfering assay) or MDCK-PB2(adh) cells (determination of OP7 chimera DIP containing seed virus titer). Infectious virus titers were expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Furthermore, total virus concentrations were quantified using the HA assay as previously described59.Segment-specific RT-PCRTo detect contaminating DI vRNAs in Seg 2-Seg 8 in progeny virions, purified extracellular RNA was subjected to segment-specific PCR as described previously39,54. In brief, RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a universal “Uni12” primer60 that binds to all eight genome segments. The resulting cDNA samples were used to amplify each genomic segment individually using segment-specific primers. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.RT-qPCRIn order to quantify the vRNAs purified from progeny virions, we used a previously described RT-qPCR method that enables polarity- and gene-specific quantification of individual vRNAs19,39,54. For this, a methodology involving tagged primers was employed61. Primers used for quantification of the vRNA of Seg 5 are listed in39,54, for Seg 7-OP7 in19, and for Seg 7-WT, new primers were designed for the present study (for reverse transcription, Seg 7-WT tagRT for: 5ʹ-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAGCGTCTCGCTATTGCCGCAAA-3ʹ and for qPCR, Seg 7-WT realtime rev: 5ʹ-CCTTTCAGTCCGTATTTAAAGC-3ʹ). In order to allow for absolute quantification, RNA reference standards were used. vRNA concentrations were calculated based on calibration curves.Interference assayThe produced OP7 chimera DIP material was tested for the interfering efficacy in vitro according to a previously established protocol19,39. Here, we assessed the inhibition of STV propagation upon co-infection with OP7 chimera DIP preparations. After infection, supernatants were analyzed for infectious and total virus titers using the plaque and HA assay, respectively. RT-qPCR and MS were used for quantification of vRNA and viral protein, respectively, of the progeny virions.Quantification of IAV proteinsMS analysis was used for absolute quantification of M1-WT, M1-OP7 and NP according to a method described previously46. For this, we used isotopically labelled peptides of synthetic origin of corresponding proteins that were added as an internal standard before tryptic digestion of the samples for absolute quantification (AQUA). For M1-OP7, a peptide containing one mutation, which is not present in the M1-WT (EITFYGAK) was used. For quantification of M1-WT, two peptides exclusive for M1-WT (LEDVFAGK, QMVTTTNPLIR) were used. In brief, supernatant samples containing DIPs were heat inactivated (3 min, 80 °C) for further processing. Next, total protein concentration was determined using a Pierce® BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23227) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sample preparation for MS analysis was performed by using filter-aided sample preparation as described previously46,62. After drying of the eluted peptides, 80 μL of mobile phase A (LC–MS-grade water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 20 µL (= 2 pmol of each peptide) of peptide standard mix containing isotopically labelled peptides of synthetic origin for M1-WT, M1-OP7 and NP were added to each sample. Subsequently, MS analysis was carried out as described before46. Raw files from Bruker timsTOF Pro were analysed by using Skyline (vs. 19.1)63. Absolute protein copy numbers and virus concentrations were calculated as described previously46.Mouse infection experimentsD2(B6).A2G-Mx1r mice were generated by backcrossing DBA/2JRj mice for 10 generations onto congenic B6.A2G-Mx1r mice as described previously53. Mice were bred and maintained in individually ventilated cages in a specific pathogen-free environment as per relevant guidelines and regulations (animal facility, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Braunschweig Germany); food and water were provided ad libitum. Female, age-matched (12–24 weeks) D2(B6).A2G-Mx1r mice that harbor a functional MX dynamin-like GTPase 1 (Mx1) resistance gene were randomly allocated into experimental groups. Following intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine, mice were intranasally administered with 20 µL of active OP7 chimera DIPs or PBS at indicated concentrations to test for the tolerability. Moreover, antiviral efficacy was studied by inoculation with a lethal dose of 1000 FFU of IAV STV strain PR8 and co-treatment with active OP7 chimera DIP enriched preparations at indicated concentrations, inactive OP7 chimera DIP enriched preparations or PBS in a total volume of 20 μL. Determination of the FFU titer was conducted as described elsewhere64. Following administration, health status (body weight, appearance of fur, posture, activity) of mice was monitored at least once per day. In case humane endpoint criteria were reached, animals were humanely euthanized (via isoflurane inhalation and subsequent exsanguination) and the infection was recorded as lethal (AVMA guidelines were adhered). BAL samples were harvested as described previously65. Serum albumin concentrations in BAL fluids were measured by ELISA (Fortis Life Sciences, #E90-134).Histopathological analysisComplete lungs of the mice were routinely fixed in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections with 5 µm thickness were cut, dewaxed, and stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E). Histopathological evaluation was performed in a blinded manner by a veterinary pathologist certified by the European College of Veterinary Pathologists.Statistical analysisAll the statistical analysis and graph generation were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software.Approval for animal experimentsAnimals were maintained and treated as per ARRIVE guidelines. All in vivo experiments were conducted after review and approval of the study protocol by institutional (Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research) and regional ethical bodies (Niedersaechsisches Landesamt fuer Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, LAVES 33.19-42502-04-18/2922).

Back to Healio Key takeaways: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a reduced volume of cases for several respiratory viruses. Asthma, COPD and respiratory tract infection hospitalizations and ED visits also went down during this period. Incidence rates for several respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, declined during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to study results published in Thorax. Further, fewer hospitalizations and ED visits related to asthma, COPD and respiratory tract infections took place during this period, according to researchers. Data were derived from Ho T, et al. Thorax. 2023;doi:10.1136horax-2022-219957. “This study confirmed associations between the COVID-19 pandemic, non-COVID-19 respiratory virus prevalence and health care utilization in a large population in Canada,” Terence Ho, MB, MSc, FRCPC, assistant professor of medicine at McMaster University, and colleagues wrote. “Closely examining health care utilization revealed a new, shared peak for asthma, COPD and respiratory tract infection, which is associated with the re-emergence of rhino/enterovirus.” In a population-based retrospective study, Ho and colleagues evaluated how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the frequency of respiratory viruses unrelated to COVID-19 and usage of health care for asthma, COPD and respiratory tract infections in Ontario, Canada. To compare trends before and during the pandemic, researchers assessed weekly respiratory virus tests, ED visits and hospital admissions from 2015 to 2021. Researchers plotted the percent positivity and observed vs. expected number of positive viral cases, and they estimated changes in these data as well as in hospitalization and ED visits through Poisson and binomial logistic regression models. During the first year of the pandemic, incidence of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and other coronaviruses dropped by more than 90% vs. before the pandemic. Notably, the reduction in adenovirus and rhino/enterovirus cases was not as large as the above viruses, with a 77% (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.1-0.53) decline in adenovirus and a 48% (IRR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.18-1.54) decline in rhino/enterovirus during vs. before COVID-19 became widespread. Researchers also observed declines in ED visits and hospitalization for all three assessed respiratory conditions during the pandemic. The largest drop in these events between the two periods was found for respiratory tract infections, with an 85% decrease in both ED visits (IRR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.1-0.22) and hospitalizations (IRR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.24) when COVID-19 became widespread. For asthma-related ED visits, the incidence rate ratio was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.37-0.48), signaling a 57% reduction when COVID-19 was prevalent. For hospitalizations pertaining to asthma, this rate was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.33-0.46), signaling a 61% reduction. Similarly, ED visits and hospital admissions linked to COPD dropped by 63% (IRR =0.37; 95% CI 0.3-0.45) and 45% (IRR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.48-0.62) during vs. before the pandemic. Notably, children aged 0 to 15 years had larger declines than adults aged 16 years and older in asthma-related ED visits (IRR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.19-0.33 vs. IRR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.46-0.57) and hospitalizations (IRR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17- 0.36 vs. 0.56; 95% CI, 0.5-0.61) and respiratory tract infection-related ED visits (IRR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05-0.15 vs. IRR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.15-0.27) and hospitalizations (IRR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05-0.17 vs. IRR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.32-0.45). Researchers observed a rise in hospitalizations and ED visits for respiratory tract infections, asthma and COPD during October of the pandemic, which corresponds to the peak of rhino/enterovirus. “This is the first study to demonstrate that during the pandemic, increased rhino/enterovirus prevalence, likely related to alleviation of public health measures, may have contributed to a ‘rebound’ of health care utilization due to asthma, COPD and respiratory tract infection,” Ho and colleagues wrote. “Going forward, non-COVID-19 respiratory virus patterns may be altered and lead to atypical peaks in respiratory-related health care utilization, which could have implications on the timing of vaccine administration, development of novel vaccines, hospital bed planning and public health policy.” Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Ho T, et al.

But 'tis also peak respiratory virus season1, with viruses like the flu and COVID-19 making the rounds at holiday parties and gatherings everywhere. To further complicate matters, symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu present very similarly: fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, and body aches2. These similarities in symptoms can make it difficult for people to differentiate between the viruses and for healthcare professionals to diagnose without testing3. Testing remains an essential diagnostic tool; an earlier diagnosis can lead to earlier care or treatment if you are sick4,5,6. It can also help prevent you from unintentionally spreading illness to family and friends7,8. We at Pfizer know that sometimes you may not want to or be able to rush to the doctor for testing when you are not feeling your best. We’re now expanding your testing options with the availability of a test that can be taken in the convenience of your home. Now available for purchase, Pfizer’s 2-in-1 at-home test enables families to initially test and get results for COVID-19 or the flu viruses (Flu A or Flu B) without the need to wait in line, head to a doctor’s office, or sit around a crowded waiting room. The test can also be taken on the go, whether you are headed on vacation or to stay with family for the holidays. Once you have your test results in hand, you can discuss next steps with your doctor and get a quick start on a care plan.With this test, people can quickly receive important health information with a single swab. “Our main goal with this single test for COVID-19 and Flu (A/B) is to meet patients where they are, by helping facilitate convenient access to testing. Our at-home test can now be purchased in Amazon’s store,” said Meaghan Jones, Vice President and Diagnostics Business Lead at Pfizer. “Bringing our COVID-19 and Flu (A/B) test to the hands of people across the country marks an exciting foray for Pfizer into the diagnostics space and complements our growing respiratory and infectious disease portfolio and pipeline.” At Pfizer, we believe in comprehensive solutions to help tackle peak respiratory health season head-on, and our toolbox continues to expand. In addition to vaccinations and treatments, Pfizer now has a diagnostic test that can put important health information directly in your hands. References1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 27 November 2023 Influenza A(H1N2)v is similar to flu viruses currently circulating in pigs in the UK. This is the first detection of this strain of flu in a human in the UK. As is usual early in emerging infection events, UKHSA is working closely with partners to determine the characteristics of the pathogen and assess the risk to human health. The case was detected as part of routine national flu surveillance undertaken by UKHSA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). The individual was tested by their GP after experiencing respiratory symptoms. Influenza A(H1N2)v virus was detected by UKHSA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and characterised using genome sequencing. The individual concerned experienced a mild illness and has fully recovered. The source of their infection has not yet been ascertained and remains under investigation. Close contacts of the case are being followed up by UKHSA and partner organisations. Any contacts will be offered testing as necessary and advised on any necessary further care if they have symptoms or test positive. People with any respiratory symptoms should continue to follow the existing guidance; avoid contact with other people while symptoms persist, particularly if the people they are coming into contact with are elderly or have existing medical conditions. UKHSA is monitoring the situation closely and is taking steps to increase surveillance within existing programmes involving GP surgeries and hospitals in parts of North Yorkshire. To assist in the detection of cases and assessment of transmission, those people who are contacted and asked to test are encouraged to do so. Meera Chand, Incident Director at UKHSA, said: It is thanks to routine flu surveillance and genome sequencing that we have been able to detect this virus. This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs. We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread. In accordance with established protocols, investigations are underway to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases. Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans – which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important. Through our animal and human surveillance systems we work together to protect everyone. In this case we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation. Pig keepers must also report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately. Background on influenza viruses Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a ‘variant influenza virus’. H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. There have been a total of 50 human cases of influenza A(H1N2)v reported globally since 2005; none of them related genetically to this strain. Influenza A(H1N2)v has not previously been detected in humans in the UK. Human infections with swine influenza viruses occur sporadically. Based on early information, the infection detected in the UK is a distinct clade (1b.1.1), which is different from recent human cases of influenza A(H1N2) elsewhere in the world but is similar to viruses in UK swine. In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by an influenza virus (influenza A H1N1(pdm09)) commonly referred to as ‘swine flu’. That virus contained genetic material from viruses that were circulating in pigs, birds and humans in the 1990s and 2000s. Influenza A H1N1(pdm09) is now circulating in humans seasonally and is no longer referred to as swine flu. It is distinct from the viruses currently circulating in pigs.

COVID and flu cases are on the rise. Here's how to spot the difference.Janet Loehrke USA TODAYAs the weather has turned cooler, COVID-19 and flu cases have increased, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health care experts advise getting vaccinated – possibly with both shots at the same time.Early influenza cases suggest the flu virus is returning to a seasonal rhythm. Whether COVID-19 will be a seasonal virus that spreads mostly during the cold and flu season is still up for debate among scientists.As the season for respiratory viruses intensifies and fewer people take precautions, the U.S. could see an increase in illnesses after Thanksgiving and into the holidays.Hospitalizations from COVID-19 are risingIn the U.S., there were 18,119 new COVID-19 hospital admissions during the week ending Nov. 18, a 9.7% increase from the week before, according to the CDC.During that same time, hospitalizations related to COVID-19 jumped in a dozen states, and 15 others reported moderate increases. Unable to view our graphics? Click here to see them. Influenza increases graduallyMost areas of the U.S. are seeing a rise in seasonal influenza activity. South-central parts of the country, the Southeast, the mountain states and the West Coast regions are leading the way.According to CDC estimates, this flu season has already resulted in 1.2 million illnesses, 12,000 hospital admissions and 740 deaths. “We’re off to the races,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.Traditionally, the winter flu season ramps up in December or January. But it took off in October last year and has made a November entrance this year. Tracking during flu season relies in part on reports of people with flu-like symptoms who go to doctors offices or hospitals. Many people with the flu are not tested, so their infections aren’t lab-confirmed. COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses can sometimes muddy the picture.Alicia Budd, who leads the CDC’s flu surveillance team, said several indicators are showing “continued increases” in flu cases.COVID-19 versus the flu: Know the symptomsBecause of the overlapping symptoms between influenza and COVID-19, physicians and health experts are urging that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated for the flu this year. One infection can make you more susceptible to others by weakening your immune system.The flu and COVID-19 share several common symptoms. Here's a look at how to differentiate the two viruses: Six healthy habits to stay safe this seasonGet the COVID-19 and flu vaccines.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, not your hands, when sneezing or coughing.If you're feeling symptoms developing, don't go to work or school. This will prevent spreading the illness to others.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you touch something that is contaminated with germs, it can easily spread disease.Clean and disinfect your home frequently, especially surfaces that are touched often, such as doorknobs or countertops.Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Scrub for 20 seconds to remove harmful germs.CONTRIBUTING The Associated PressSOURCE Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and USA TODAY research Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Doctor Warns About Flu Danger After His Daughter, 16, Dies IE 11 is not supported.

PawlowskiAs a pediatrician, Dr. Cesar Termulo, 53, treats many children sick with the flu during the winter season. When his 16-year-old daughter, Teresa “Reese” Termulo, came down with the flu in early January 2020, it seemed like a typical case, but he was shattered when she died within a day of being diagnosed after developing complications. As flu cases rise, Termulo, who practices at Parkland Health in Dallas, Texas, urges people to get the flu vaccine and warns parents to be vigilant for symptoms. He shares his story with TODAY.com.Dr. Cesar Termulo with his daughter, Teresa, who was also known as Reese. She died from flu complications at 16.Cortesía doctor Cesar TermuloWhen people think the flu is a harmless runny nose, they’re wrong. It can cause death.My daughter, Reese, had absolutely zero health issues. She had no chronic illnesses. She was completely healthy. She was on her high school dance team and in the top 10% of her high school class. We had already started visiting colleges. She told me she was planning on becoming a physician as well.Reese was an active, healthy teen who didn't have any health problems, her family says.Courtesy Dr. Cesar TermuloThe morning after she was diagnosed with the flu, I said “Reese, you’re going to get better.” Those were the last words that I ever told her.Her symptoms started in the morning of January 9, 2020. She had a fever and a cough at school, so as soon as the school called, we brought her into my office and she tested positive for the flu. We started her on oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, an antiviral medication.She felt a little bit tired so she went home to rest. But she was still doing her homework, chatting with friends, doing Snapchat and all those things that a regular teenager does. The next morning, I asked her, “Reese, how are you feeling?” and she said her chest hurt. She had this pain under her ribs, which is muscle pain from coughing a lot.I knew you can die from the flu, and usually it’s caused from a superimposed bacterial pneumonia after getting influenza. The first thing as a pediatrician and a father that I’m going to do is to check her lungs, and her lungs were completely clear. I didn’t hear any signs of pneumonia. No things like wheezing or decreased breath sounds. She wasn’t breathing fast. She didn’t have symptoms that would tip me off that death was imminent.Reese was planning to follow in her father's footsteps and become a doctor.Cortesía doctor Cesar TermuloReese stayed home from school that day and my wife was taking care of her. They prayed the rosary. My wife wanted to read her something and the first thing that came up on her phone was this Bible verse talking about how all the time we have on Earth is a treasure. Later that morning, Reese went back to bed and my wife went down to make her some soup. When she came back up, Reese had stopped breathing.My wife tried to administer CPR and called 911, then me. I rushed home and when I arrived, the EMS workers were loading Reese into the ambulance. One of them said, “We can’t get her heart rate on her.”In the emergency room, they knew that I was a doctor so eventually I was able to see them working on her. It was horrific and I knew she didn’t look alive anymore. She was pronounced dead at the hospital.After an autopsy, the official cause of death was that Reese had the flu and superimposed strep A pneumonia that was found in her lungs. When we did a test for strep the day before, it was negative. But the group A strep spread into her blood and was even found in her brain. She had pneumonia that caused sepsis and overwhelmed her system. That caused her heart to stop.You can get the flu and if you happen to get a superimposed pneumonia, it can be sudden death. My daughter died within a day of being diagnosed with the flu.Many people asked whether it was COVID, but there hadn’t been any cases yet of COVID in the U.S. then and COVID cannot kill a child that quickly. People think the flu is a runny nose, a cough or a fever, but it’s more than that. Flu can be pneumonia. In kids, flu can cause febrile seizures. In kids with asthma, it can cause asthma attacks. It can even cause encephalopathy and death.Reese got the flu vaccine in December 2019, but the vaccine that year did not cover influenza B/Victoria, which is the strain of flu that fatally killed her."She's not forever gone. I will eventually see her again," Reese's father says. "My faith is what's allowing me to carry on and to be resilient."Cortesía doctor Cesar TermuloI still urge people to get the flu shot even though it didn’t work for my daughter. The analogy I make is: Would you drive 80 miles per hour without wearing a seatbelt? It’s illogical even though seat belts don’t always save you from death. In the same way, it’s illogical to not take the flu shot. It’s not 100% effective, but if it can reduce the chance of death if you do happen to get this superimposed pneumonia, you should take it. As soon as you have a high fever during flu season, just do the flu test. It’s easy to do. If it’s the flu, you need to start Tamiflu within the first two days. That’s when it’s going to be most effective. One thing I realized as a doctor is that even though I did everything you’re supposed to do, I can’t control death. I’m still recovering after Reese’s passing. Every moment we have is precious. Our life is temporary — it could be taken at any moment.Dr. Cesar TermuloDr. Cesar Termulo is a pediatrician and associate medical director at Parkland Health in Dallas, Texas.A. PawlowskiA.

Dec. 1, 2023 – Northern Nevada Public Health (NNPH), formerly Washoe County Health District, is reporting the first influenza-associated death in Washoe County for the current flu season: A female in her 70s with underlying health conditions. This is the first flu-associated death since January of 2023. Flu and respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus (RSV) cases have been increasing steadily since Oct. 1, 2023, in Washoe County and nationwide. 27 influenza-associated hospitalizations have been reported among Washoe County residents since Oct. 1, 2023. As of last week, there have been a total of 192 RSV cases reported in Washoe County, with most being under the age of 18. Those considered to be at a higher risk of serious complications from respiratory disease include young children, older adults, pregnant women and anyone with a chronic health condition. Healthy people can experience severe complications as well. People are advised to get the flu vaccine if they have not already, stay home from work or school if sick, and wash your hands with warm water and soap frequently. “The way it’s trending, we expect to see increases in both influenza and RSV throughout 2023,” said Kevin Dick, District Health Officer in Washoe County. “With the winter season upon us, there are more group gatherings and more time spent inside with less ventilation, which increases the chances of disease transmission. If you haven’t received a flu or COVID-19 vaccine yet, now is a great time. And for those in sensitive groups like those aged 60 years and older, people who are pregnant, and infants, check with your doctor about the new RSV vaccine.” See the NNPH flu surveillance page Vaccines are available If you have insurance, www.vaccines.gov is a popular website to use to schedule both flu and COVID-19 vaccines that are free or low cost. For those uninsured or underinsured, NNPH can help with immunizations. For the new RSV vaccine, call local pharmacies or your medical provider to check for availability. The CDC recommends the vaccine for people aged 60 or older, people who are 32-36 weeks’ pregnant entering RSV season in October, infants aged 8 months and younger born during or entering their first RSV season, and infants and children aged 8-19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season. Learn more from the CDC. Flu basics The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs. People 65 years and older, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at higher risk of serious flu complications. Learn more from the CDC. Symptoms include: Fever/feeling feverish or chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. According to the CDC, the virus is most easily spread from person to person when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk to another in close proximity. The person with flu is contagious approximately one day before symptoms appear and up to 5-7 days after. Learn more about how the virus spreads. RSV basics Per the CDC, RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious. People infected with RSV usually show symptoms within 4-6 days after infection. According to the CDC, symptoms of RSV infection usually include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Coughing Sneezing Fever Wheezing Per the CDC, these symptoms usually appear in stages and not all at once. In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties. Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday. Please note the Washoe County Health District changed its name to Northern Nevada Public Health on Aug. 31, 2023. More information is here. Northern Nevada Public Health (NNPH) is nationally accredited by the Public Health Accreditation Board and has jurisdiction over all public health matters in Reno, Sparks, and Washoe County through the policy-making District Board of Health. NNPH consists of five divisions: Administrative Health Services, Air Quality Management, Community and Clinical Health Services, Environmental Health Services and Epidemiology & Public Health Preparedness.

Home December Wellness Spotlight December Wellness Spotlight December 1, 2023 Cold and Flu Season Has Arrived! Influenza, also known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that is caused by many different strains of viruses. The period of time in which the influenza virus is most contagious is referred to as flu season. This period is generally during the colder months of the year. This Wellness Spotlight includes information on transmission of the flu, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Transmission and Risk Factors Seasonal influenza can spread quickly. When a person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing the viruses are dispersed within the air and can infect people who are nearby. This virus can also be spread on hands when touching contaminated surfaces. It can be spread anywhere, but specifically, busy places such as schools, offices, childcare facilities or nursing homes are more likely to breed flu outbreaks. Certain individuals are at an increased risk for developing severe flu illness. Some risk factors include: Adults age 65+ Young children Pregnant women Those with: Heart disease COPD Diabetes Weakened immune systems Liver disorders Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment Flu symptoms usually start within 2 days after being infected by someone who has the virus. Symptoms include: Fever Cough Sore throat Body aches Fatigue Runny nose According to the CDC, your respiratory illness might be influenza if you have a fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and/or fatigue. Those sick with the flu do not always get a fever and the flu can happen during any season. If you believe you have the flu, it is important to visit a doctor to receive the best care plan. Your healthcare professional may suggest a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing which is a range of tests that can determine if you have the influenza. If needed, your healthcare provider may prescribe an antiviral medication. People with mild symptoms should: Stay home to avoid getting others sick Drink plenty of fluids Rest Seek medical care if symptoms worsen Prevention Avoid close contact with those who are sick Keep your distance Stay away from others if you are sick yourself Get the flu vaccine The CDC notes that recent studies have shown that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by 40-60% Wash your hands Washing your hands often with soap and water will help protect you from germs If not soap and water is available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Sickness can occur if someone touches a contaminated surface, then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth Practice good health habits Disinfect frequently touched surfaces that are commonly used Get plenty of sleep Manage your stress Be physically active Drink plenty of fluids Eat healthy What is the difference between a cold and the flu?

Coping strategies that can help / Staying Healthy When will we see a "one-and-done" flu shot? Ask the doctor December 1, 2023 By Anthony L. Komaroff, MD, Editor in Chief, Harvard Health Letter; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing Q. Why can't we get just one flu shot that protects us for a lifetime? A. Many scientists are working to develop improved influenza (flu) vaccines. Our current vaccines are imperfect, but they still protect us. The flu is much more serious than the common cold: globally, 300,000 to 500,000 people die from the flu each year — most of them unvaccinated. In the worst flu pandemic, 50 million to 100 million people died. Our current, imperfect flu vaccines saved 40,000 lives in the United States alone between 2004 and 2014. Imperfect protection is much better than no protection. The perfect flu vaccine would protect against all different strains of the flu virus. A virus has a shape, with different parts. The parts of the virus that traditional vaccines attack are constantly changing, generating new strains. That's why a new flu shot is needed each year. Fortunately, scientists are finally having some success building vaccines that attack the parts of the virus that don't change — the "conserved" parts. A vaccine that targeted the conserved parts could theoretically protect against all strains of the flu virus, past and future. A perfect vaccine also would prevent any symptoms. Our current flu vaccines don't guarantee you won't get the flu, but they do lessen symptom severity and are quite good at preventing hospitalization and death. One reason they are only partially effective is that with current technologies it takes at least six months to manufacture the vaccine. That means scientists must decide each winter which strains of the virus will be circulating eight to 10 months later when the next flu season begins. Unfortunately, sometimes the virus fools us: the strains that are circulating in the winter are replaced by other strains before the next flu season arrives. Scientists are working on new types of vaccines that can be produced much more quickly, such as the extremely successful mRNA vaccines developed for COVID-19. Finally, a perfect flu shot also would offer protection for a lifetime. A special kind of mRNA vaccine is in development that would cause the body to keep attacking the virus for a long time, if not a lifetime. Although the COVID pandemic led to a greater investment in vaccines against the flu and other viruses, in my opinion the investment still is not great enough, given the potential return from investing in vaccines. For example, in the United States alone, by early 2023 COVID vaccines had prevented 19 million hospitalizations and over three million deaths, saving the economy $1.2 trillion. It cost only a small fraction of that to develop the vaccines. Will we ever see a perfect flu vaccine? Probably not in my lifetime or yours. But we almost surely will see improved, less imperfect, vaccines. And, to repeat myself, imperfect protection is very much better than no protection.

A deadly bird flu could change that By Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN 4 minute read Published 7:30 AM EST, Sat December 2, 2023 Link Copied! Turkey sandwiches could be pricer this spring. Transier Photography/iStockphoto/Getty Images/FILE New York CNN — Egg and turkey prices are down. But a deadly bird flu is still threatening poultry flocks, turkey in particular. So while breakfast is likely to stay cheap, get ready for more expensive turkey sandwiches. Last year, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) devastated chicken flocks, with egg-laying hens bearing the brunt. The virus was one reason for the massive spike in egg prices. But this year, the virus got off to a slow start, allowing egg supplies to bounce back. The current outbreak of HPAI hit the United States in February 2022, and ripped through poultry farms across the country. By the end of last year, about 60 million birds had been killed because of the virus. Today, the total tally is up to about 68 million, a sign that the disease has slowed, but not disappeared, in 2023. After a mostly virus-free start to the year, cases started ticking up in the fall. In the past month, Iowa farms have killed over 2.8 million birds this season due to the virus. Earlier in November, an Ohio egg farm slaughtered over 1.3 million birds because of the flu. This fall, apples are plentiful and cheap. Scott Olson/Getty Images October is prime apple season. Why did prices plunge? “Nationally, we are seeing an uptick, again, in some commercial premises across the US,” Dennis Summers, Ohio’s state veterinarian and chief of the state’s division of animal health, said in an interview with CNN. In the US, the deadly flu has been spreading as wild birds migrate south this fall. If they land and mingle with backyard flocks, or their droppings are dragged into chicken coops, the virus can be introduced to commercial operations, he explained. When that happens, the entire flock is eradicated to prevent the disease from spreading. The fall migratory season lasts until about the end of the year, said Summers. So what happens in the next month or so will help determine the trajectory of the virus this year, and how many more farms are affected. “We’re just hoping that we can hold on and get through this until [the flu] mutates to a non-pathogenic form,” Summers said. “And then we can go from there.” Egg supplies stay strong Even with millions of chickens culled at egg farms, there are plenty of eggs this year, said Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group that is dedicated to increasing US demand for eggs. “We’ve seen some small-scale outbreaks so far on a few egg farms,” she said. “Supply is strong, there’s plenty of eggs.” According to the USDA, egg production was up 4% in October compared to last year. Egg prices have dropped significantly this year. VIEW press/Corbis News/Getty Images/FILE As egg supplies bounced back, prices have fallen, declining about 22% in the 12 months through October, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So far, many of the egg farms where the virus was detected — and birds culled — have been focused on selling whites and yolks to food makers, rather than to grocery stores as shell eggs, noted Ryan Hojnowski, egg market analyst and reporter for Urner Barry, which publishes market information. With these factors in mind, prices are unlikely to skyrocket again. “It doesn’t seem like there’s a catalyst as of right now, this second, that is pointing toward a price action being anything what it was like last year,” said Hojnowski. Still, he said, it’s a “very fluid situation.” But when it comes to turkey, price hikes are on the horizon. Turkey takes a hit This year, turkey prices were low ahead of Thanksgiving — partially because turkey farmers expected an outbreak in the spring that didn’t really happen, boosting turkey supplies, explained Matt Busardo, poultry market reporter at Urner Barry. But the uptick of bird flu cases has hit turkey farms hard, and threatens to tighten supply in groceries this spring. “Just since October, there’s been two and a half million or so [turkey] losses,” Busardo noted. Most of those were “meat birds,” he said — headed to slaughter to be turned into deli meat, rather than sold as whole birds for roasting. “When spring rolls around and everyone wants to get their turkey clubs… that’s what this impacts the most,” he said. “What we’re seeing now shows that there’s going to be a tighter supply come spring.” Whole turkey prices fell ahead of Thanksgiving, but could rise in the deli aisle. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images In Minnesota, roughly 1.6 million birds have been killed in the last month, many of them turkeys. The state is especially vulnerable to bird flu because of its geographic properties, noted Ohio’s Summers. “There’s tons of lakes and ponds up there,” he said. “So those migratory birds will land.” If migrations slow — as they very well may, thanks to frigid weather — infections could also, lessening the impact on turkey supply and prices. In general this year, “bird losses … are quite small relative to last year’s impact,” said Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank. “However, timing is everything,” she said, noting that there could “be some spot shortages and/or pricing volatility given the potential for regional losses.” Busardo doesn’t expect turkey prices to surge as much as they did with eggs. In part that’s because unlike eggs, turkey isn’t a kitchen staple — meaning that higher prices could just lead people to skip that turkey sandwich after all.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: RSVpreF and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines can be safely coadministered to older adults. Immune responses for both vaccines met prespecified immunogenicity endpoints for noninferiority. When given together, Pfizer’s respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccine generated robust immune responses and were well tolerated among older adults when coadministered, data from a recent study showed. “RSV and influenza are both typically seasonal diseases, peaking during autumn and winter months. Coadministration of these two seasonal vaccines could reduce health care provider visits and facilitate delivery and uptake of these important vaccines to high-risk groups, such as older adults,” James Baber, MB, ChB, MPH, Pfizer’s senior director of vaccine clinical research, told Healio. Data from a recent study showed that Pfizer’s respiratory syncytial virus vaccine was safe to coadminister with a seasonal influenza vaccine, with both vaccines still generating robust immune responses in older adults. Image: Adobe Stock. “Therefore, we conducted this study in adults 65 years and older to assess the safety and immune responses of [Pfizer’s RSV vaccine] and an adjuvanted influenza vaccine given at the same time compared with administration of each vaccine alone,” Baber said. According to the study, patients in Australia were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive both Pfizer’s RSV vaccine (RSVpreF) and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), or just SIIIV or RSVpreF administered alone. The researchers assessed for safety and tolerability and collected data on reactogenicity and adverse events. In total, 1,399 patients were randomly assigned to receive vaccinations. Overall, the study showed that local reactions and systemic events were mostly mild or moderate in severity when RSVpreF was given either with SIIV or alone, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events being reported. According to the study, the most common local reaction was injection site pain, which was reported in 11.4% to 12.4% of patients after receiving RSVpreF, whereas the most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue, which was reported in 30% of participants who received RSVpreF and SIIV, 27.1% of patients who received placebo and SIIV, 19.1% of patients who received RSVpreF alone and 17.6% who received placebo alone. The study also showed that immune responses to both Pfizer’s RSV vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccine were noninferior when the vaccines were given at the same time compared with when the vaccines were given 1 month apart. Specifically, study data showed that geometric mean ratios among the two major cocirculating antigenic subgroups (RSV-A and RSV-B) were 0.86 for RSV-A and 0.85 for RSV-B neutralizing titers at 1 month after RSVpreF administration and 0.77 to 0.9 for strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition assay titers at 1 month after SIIV. According to the study, all comparisons achieved the prespecified 1.5-fold noninferiority margin. “Overall, these results are supportive that RSVpreF and influenza vaccine can be given at the same time in older adults to help protect against these two important respiratory pathogens in this vulnerable population.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Athan E, et al.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Influenza vaccination was associated with a 20% reduced risk for cardiovascular death.Researchers said providers should target patients with CVD for vaccination to mitigate risks. Perspective from Raj Khandwalla, MD Influenza vaccination was linked to significant decreased risks for major cardiovascular events and death, according to a study published in Scientific Reports.“Differing viewpoints exist regarding the impact of influenza vaccination on CVDs,” Fatemeh Omidi, MD, an assistant professor in the department of cardiology at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Iran, and colleagues wrote. “While certain observational investigations suggest a favorable correlation between influenza vaccination and the reduction in occurrences of cardiovascular incidents like acute [myocardial infarction (MI)], contrasting epidemiological studies propose the limited efficacy of influenza vaccines.” The researchers said an updated and comprehensive review on the association between influenza vaccination and CVD outcomes is “imperative.” So, they conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of five studies with 9,059 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either a standard intramuscular influenza vaccination (n = 4,529) or intramuscular placebo (n = 4,530).Overall, there were 517 cases of major cardiovascular events among patients who received influenza vaccination, compared with 621 cases among those who received placebo (RR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.55-0.91).The analysis also revealed a risk reduction for MI (RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97) and a 20% risk reduction for cardiovascular death events (RR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.98) among vaccinated patients.Such findings “underscore the potential impact of influenza vaccination in safeguarding against adverse cardiovascular outcomes among vulnerable patient populations,” the researchers wrote.They highlighted several possible mechanisms behind the findings. For example, influenza infections can weaken the immune system and make it susceptible to secondary infections, which “can exacerbate cardiovascular conditions,” Omidi and colleagues wrote. “Influenza vaccination's role in preventing these secondary infections may indirectly contribute to the reduction in CVDs,” they wrote.The researchers added that influenza infections likely cause systemic inflammation, which can contribute to the progression of CVDs and atherosclerosis.“By targeting patients with recent CVDs for influenza vaccination, health care providers have a potential opportunity to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular death in a cost-effective and widely available manner,” Omidi and colleagues wrote. “Influenza vaccination programs could be tailored to prioritize this high-risk group, thus potentially reducing the overall burden on health care systems and improving patient outcomes.”They concluded that further research is still needed “to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving this association and to explore the long-term impact of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular outcomes.” Perspective Back to Top Raj Khandwalla, MD This research builds upon the expanding body of scientific literature on the cardiovascular risk associated with the flu. This study presents an important meta-analysis that underscores the effectiveness of a simple intervention, an influenza vaccine, in reducing cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths and myocardial infarction. It’s important that primary care physicians educate their patients, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, that an influenza vaccine can prevent death and heart attacks.

UnsubscribeWhy does the flu vaccine have to be updated every year? — Those Nerdy Girls Search for: SUBSCRIBEDONATE Who We Are About Us Team Board Posts Videos In the News Shop Donate Who We Are About Us Team Board of Directors Posts Videos In the News New! Shop Donate November 26, 2023 Why does the flu vaccine have to be updated every year? Infectious Diseases Vaccines Amanda Simanek, PhD MPH Three reasons: 1. Influenza viruses mutate over time, 2. the virus strains circulating can vary year to year, and 3. our immunity wanes over time. That’s why the flu vaccine formula needs to be updated yearly, and we need to get a flu shot each season to be well-protected. Influenza viruses have proteins on their surface: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The flu vaccine triggers our body to make antibodies against these proteins. If we get infected with the influenza virus, those antibodies can attach to the proteins on the surface of the virus and neutralize it. Through a process known as “antigenic drift,” however, those surface proteins mutate over time. When this happens, antibodies generated by last year’s vaccine or infection become less effective against this year’s circulating influenza strains (levels of both also wane over time, making them less effective, even against similar strains). Luckily, each year, 144 influenza surveillance centers across 114 countries (!!!) monitor which flu strains are circulating and whether any new strains have emerged. The World Health Organization then selects which influenza virus strains to include in the next year’s flu vaccine (once a year for the flu season in the Northern hemisphere and once a year for the Southern hemisphere). They take into consideration which of the circulating virus strains are making people the most sick, the extent to which they are spreading, how similar they are to the influenza strains targeted by the vaccine from the previous year, and the potential to offer cross-protection against multiple strains. While there are four types of influenza viruses (A, B, C, and D), only influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal flu. Influenza A viruses are the only types to have caused global influenza pandemics. Influenza A virus is further classified into subtypes based on the combination of HA and NA proteins on the surface. This year, the flu vaccine is quadrivalent, meaning it is formulated to protect against 4 flu strains- an A(H1) virus, an A(H3) virus, a B/Yamagata lineage virus, and a B/Victoria lineage virus. Each year, depending on how well the vaccine matches the strains of influenza circulating, flu vaccines are 40-60% effective at preventing illness. But even if you do still get the flu, getting the updated seasonal flu vaccine will reduce the severity of your illness. Indeed, preliminary data from the Southern Hemisphere suggest that this year’s vaccine reduced the risk of influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52%. The CDC estimates that between 2010 and 2020, flu caused between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations each year, as well as 12,000–52,000 deaths. So reducing this risk matters. For those who don’t require hospitalization, the influenza virus can still knock you out for days with fever, cough, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, body aches, etc. Overall, reducing your risk of getting infected, developing severe disease, and getting hospitalized makes an updated flu shot well worth it. If you haven’t gotten a flu shot yet, do it!

What you need to knowBYErin PraterPigs in a rural area of China last year, where the H9N2 bird flu was reportedly infecting pigs and combining with swine flu. The A(H1N2)v swine flu has been detected in an individual in the U.K. for the first time, the region's Health Security Agency said Monday.CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty ImagesA new type of swine flu has been detected in a United Kingdom human for the first time, the region’s Health Security Agency announced Monday. Symptoms of influenza A(H1N2)v, clade 1b.1.1, were mild in the individual, who has fully recovered, health authorities said in a news release. Hundreds of documented cases of swine flu occur globally on an annual basis, each transmitted from a pig to a human, and typically no further. But authorities are unsure of how the U.K. patient became infected, leaving open the possibility that the virus is spreading in the community. And mild symptoms in one patient aren’t a guarantee of mild symptoms in others if they become infected, experts tell Fortune. The HSA is working to assess the risk to humans, searching for other possible cases, and increasing surveillance in health facilities in parts of North Yorkshire, as part of an ongoing investigation. “We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread,” Meer Chand, incident director at the HSA, said in a statement. In the meantime, it recommends that those with general symptoms of respiratory viruses like the following avoid contact with others, particularly those who are elderly or have medical conditions: continuous cough high temperature, fever, or chills changes in senses of taste and/or smell shortness of breath unexplained fatigue muscle aches and pains not due to exercise lack of appetite headache longer lasting/more severe than usual sore throat stuffy or runny nose diarrhea Apparent first human swine flu case of its exact kind The infection marks the first time the exact type of H1N2 virus has been detected in humans, though an incredibly similar strain has been detected in area pigs. There have been a total of 50 human cases of H1N2 reported globally since 2005. But none are genetically related to the clade, or subgroup, just detected in the U.K.: 1b.1.1. A single case of the new flu clade isn’t concerning to Rajiv Chowdhury, professor of global health at the Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work at Florida International University in Miami. What concerns him, however, is the possibility of cases going undetected outside of the the U.K., which has far better genomic surveillance capabilities than most other countries in the world. While it’s reassuring that the individual experienced only a mild course of illness, it doesn’t rule out the possibility of a more severe course in other humans, if they’re infected. Factors that can influence the severity of a disease course include age, other medical conditions, immunity status, and the amount of virus they were exposed to, Chowdhury told Fortune. And features of a virus can change with time, and as the number of reports potentially increases. Mortality rates during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 initially appeared higher in Mexico, but dropped with time as the number of cases grew, Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York School of Public Health, told Fortune. Dr. Michael Osterholm—director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP)—agreed with Chowdhury, telling Fortune that sporadic cases of swine flu are not unexpected. He pointed to the lack of report of human-to-human transmission so far as an encouraging sign. Hundreds of cases of swine flu occur in the U.S. each year, usually linked to agricultural fairs, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Fortune. An 18-year-old was infected with A(H1N2)v in Michigan in this summer after visiting an agricultural fair, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He recovered outside of the hospital and apparently did not infect any others. “Most of these viruses do not have the capacity to spread between humans,” Adalja said. “So it will be important to understand the transmission chain that led” to the human’s infection, including if that human had any exposure to pigs. If not, the case could signal community spread. ‘Isolated case or the tip of an iceberg?’ One difficult aspect of tracing flu spread is that symptoms can be unspecific, and asymptomatic carriers can spread the virus without ever knowing they’re sick, said Lee, who was embedded in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the country’s H1N1 pandemic response. “Whenever we see cases like this, the big question is always, is this an isolated case or the tip of an iceberg?” he said. Humans are occasionally infected with the swine flu by pigs, usually after exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Even more rarely, the virus transmits from an infected human to other humans, as was the case during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. The H1N1 flu virus was a combination of bird, swine, and human flus, and now circulates as a seasonal flu. The detection of any new variant of flu “warrants further investigation to assess the pandemic potential and to look for similar or related cases,” Nita Madhav, senior director of epidemiology and modeling at Boston-based biotech firm Ginkgo Bioworks, told Fortune. Monday’s report of a new H1N2 clade makes the case for heightened genomic surveillance worldwide, even after the COVID pandemic, she said. Chance of another pandemic soon ‘similar to flipping a coin’ Madhav is coauthor of a paper released this month by the Center for Global Development, which found a high probability of another pandemic on the scale of COVID in the next quarter-century—in particular, a respiratory pandemic like a flu or coronavirus. Regardless, her team expects such viruses to cause at least 2.5 million deaths annually. “Our simulations suggest that an event having the mortality level of COVID-19 should not be considered a ‘once in a century’ risk,” Madhav and colleagues wrote. “To the contrary, over the next 25 years, we estimate that a pandemic with magnitude similar to or worse than COVID-19 has a roughly 50% probability of occurrence, similar to flipping a coin.” Without adequate monitoring, humans may have no clue if a swine flu, bird flu, or other pathogen is regularly spilling over from animals to humans, and could be blindsided by the next pandemic, Madhav said. The data released so far on the new clade of swine flu is reassuring, Dr. Stuart Ray, vice chair of medicine for data integrity and analytics at Johns Hopkins’ Department of Medicine, told Fortune. “If this particular H1N2 variant spreads rapidly and causes more severe or widespread infections in people with the seasonal flu vaccine, that might drive additional public health measures,” he said. “For now, it’s wise to recognize the value of high-quality surveillance.”For you: The Well Adjusted newsletter: Sign up to get simple strategies to work smarter and live better, in your inbox three times a week.

(John Heil, via US Fish and Wildlife Service; public domain) Conservation All Vaxxed Up and Ready to Roost, Six Captive-Born Condors Fly Free But, faced with freedom, they take their sweet time about it. "We're on condor time," says one program manager. by Guananí Gómez-Van Cortright November 29, 2023 Share This: Condor number 1139 gawked at his enclosure’s open door, seemingly unsure what to make of it. He hesitated for several minutes. Then he stepped into the threshold, stretched out his nine-foot wingspan, and clumsily flapped a few feet down to the ground. “Sometimes they go right out, sometimes they don’t. We’re on condor time,” said Joe Burnett, condor program manager at the Ventana Wildlife Society, which operates the central California condor release site, nestled in the mountainous chaparral along the coast. On Tuesday, 1139 and five other juvenile California condors that received the avian influenza vaccine took their first flaps out of captivity from a release site at San Simeon on California’s Central Coast. This year’s rookies are the first birds in the U.S. to receive vaccines against the latest strain of avian influenza, which has devastated bird populations across the globe and killed at least 8,000 recorded wild birds across the country. Vaccinating captive-bred condors is the latest conservation effort in the decades-long quest to save the iconic endangered species from extinction. “In the 26 years I’ve been doing this, I really haven’t been more nervous than this year, because of the combination of lead poisoning and avian influenza,” said Kelly Sorenson, executive director at the Ventana Wildlife Society, a local raptor conservation nonprofit. An enormous amount of time and expense has gone into the captive condor breeding program. Above, young condors from egg through an awkward day 70 from the archives. (US Fish and Wildlife Service; public domain) Bird flu has hit these birds hard California condors nearly went extinct a few decades ago, but have been recovering with close medical supervision and captive breeding programs. While the overall California condor population has rebounded back to over 500 individuals total, they are split between captive birds and wild flocks in northern, central, southern and Baja California, as well as Arizona. However, lead poisoning from ammunition in carcasses that condors scavenge and other threats continue to thwart conservation efforts. Condors are social creatures, living in elaborate hierarchies and gathering in groups to roost, feast upon carcasses, and groom each other—which can contribute to spreading the avian influenza virus. (Olivia Beitelspacher via USFWS; public domain) Last spring, 21 condors in the Arizona flock—nearly one-fifth of it—died from avian influenza over three weeks. Condor conservationists feared another outbreak could be catastrophic. In the spring of 2023, the US Fish and Wildlife Service applied to the US Department of Agriculture for emergency approval of a vaccine that could offer condors some protection. “No birds have ever been allowed to be vaccinated in the United States before—poultry or otherwise—because there are a lot of trade implications for agriculture,” said Samantha Gibbs, lead veterinarian for the Wildlife Health Office at the US Fish and Wildlife Service. (Allowing avian influenza vaccinations in poultry could provoke bans on exports to other countries, mostly due to fears that vaccination could mask the presence of the disease.) “To my surprise, they said yes.” Male California condor #374 flies overhead. (US Fish and Wildlife Service; public domain) Vaccine trials for an endangered species? Tricky Pharmaceutical companies and the USDA develop vaccines for animal diseases like avian influenza behind the scenes, just in case they have to use them, according to Gibbs. The vaccine given to condors this year was made from a strain of avian influenza that ravaged the poultry industry in 2014–2015, and it was already in the USDA’s stockpile. But the company that developed the vaccine, Zoetis, designed it in case of demand for domestic and zoo birds, not wild or endangered species. To make sure this vaccine was as safe as possible for condors, US Fish and Wildlife Service scientists first tested it in black vultures, which are closely related (California condors are a kind of vulture). Then condor trials began. One group of condors received a single dose, while another group received two half doses three weeks apart. According to preliminary results from the trial, 60 percent of the condors given two separate doses made enough antibodies to be somewhat protected from dying from the virus, and 10 percent made enough antibodies to be fully protected. In normal vaccine trials that do not involve an endangered species, the vaccine recipients are infected on purpose afterwards to test how much it protects them from sickness and death. “For obvious reasons, we’re not going to do that with the condors,” said Gibbs. Without that ‘challenge trial’, the vaccine’s effectiveness will essentially be tested in the wild. Condor conservationists will have to wait and see whether any of the vaccinated condors become sick or die. As of the end of November, 16 vaccinated captive-bred condors have been released throughout California, with more on the way. The decision to vaccinate all the captive-bred condors before releasing them was based on the preliminary antibody level trial results; the full results of the trial are still pending publication. Vaccinating wild birds remains up in the air, since capturing condors multiple times to give them boosters at specific intervals would be a major logistical hurdle. “We’re working on vaccinating the birds that are in the zoos, and trying to get as many of the free-flying birds vaccinated as we can,” said Gibbs. “But vaccination is not a silver bullet.” While the preliminary results of the trial were promising enough to make trying it worth a shot, Gibbs remains skeptical of how much protection the vaccine will actually provide. The vaccine is unlikely to keep condors from becoming infected if they are exposed to the avian influenza virus, but—like the human coronavirus vaccines—might at least decrease the chances of dying from that infection. Long-term effects of the vaccine are still unknown, but it has shown no ill effects in the black vultures or condors that have participated so far. Into the wild they go. Don’t laugh In San Simeon, a welcoming committee of a couple of adult wild birds poked about down the grassy slope from the open pen, gathering to tear at a stillborn calf carcass that conservation crew members had dragged out to a strategic spot the night before. The carcass would lure the rookies out of their pen—and attract wild adults who could help them integrate into wild condor society. After watching condor 1139 feed on the carcass for a while, other rookies followed him out of the pen to join the group meal. Forty-five minutes later, only two condors remained perched inside, taking their sweet time. While these captive-bred condors had been acclimated to the local area and socialized with each other, they’d still have to learn how to roost and fly long distances. “It can be rather comical when they first go out,” said Kara Fadden, one of the Ventana Wildlife Society condor biologists who oversaw the San Simeon release. “They’ll land on the tiniest twig on a tree, thinking it will support their weight. It’s a steep learning curve.” It takes about a month for captive-bred condors to build their flight muscles and learn the basics of roosting and finding their own food. The crew will provide supplementary carcasses and keep tabs on the rookies with GPS and radio tracking. Once they’ve gained confidence and strength, this year’s central California rookies will be able to fly as many as 100 miles per day, likely roaming among the steep slopes of Big Sur and the rocky outcroppings of Pinnacles National Park. Other groups of captive-bred, vaccinated condors were released from southern and northern California sites earlier this month. More are slated to fly off from San Simeon on December 12, and another batch of rookies will be released into Arizona in early 2024. With antibodies from the vaccines in their bloodstream, researchers and conservationists hope they’ll have a better chance of surviving another avian influenza outbreak. “If it provides any level of protection at all, we should do it,” said Sorenson.

The virus’ global spread concerns experts By Taylor Nicioli, CNN 4 minute read Updated 8:36 PM EST, Fri December 1, 2023 Link Copied! An outbreak of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has impacted the James' flamingo species found in northwestern Argentina's Catamarca province.

CNN — Some 220 flamingos have been found dead in the province of Catamarca in northwestern Argentina due to an outbreak of avian influenza, otherwise known as bird flu, an official told local media. Bird flu is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that naturally spreads through wild aquatic birds, such as ducks, geese and swans, but can also infect other bird species, such as domestic poultry, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread in more than 80 countries since 2022, according to the World Health Organization, and experts have concerns amid its ongoing impact across continents. H5N1 is the predominant version causing problems in the Americas and Europe, and there are several subtypes of the virus reported as the disease continuously mutates, according to WHO. Around the globe, there have been reports of bird flu outbreaks flaring in various mammals such as seals and farmed mink, detection of H5N1 viruses in domestic cats and dogs, as well as a few cases reported in humans. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the virus, according to the New York State Wildlife Health Program. Risk of spread through bird migration The infected species — known as James’ flamingo (Phoenicoparrus jamesi), or the puna flamingo — is one of three types of flamingos found in northwestern Argentina. The birds pose a risk of spreading the disease to new areas during migration. Originally, the H5N1 strain spread from North America to South America through migratory birds in a span of three months, according to Dr. Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher of environmental science and technology at the University of Maryland who has studied the strain. It only takes one infected bird to pass on the virus to a whole flock in a matter of days, Harvey said, adding that flamingos are known to be highly gregarious, social animals that live in large flocks. Flamingos live in large flocks, so the highly contagious bird flu can spread rapidly from a single infected bird, said postdoctoral researcher Dr. Johanna Harvey of the University of Maryland. James' flamingos are shown in El Peñón, Argentina, and are not members of the affected flock. Richard McManus/Moment RF/Getty Images The H5N1 strain poses a low risk to humans — since December 2021, 11 cases of the strain have been reported in humans globally, according to the CDC. But experts are closely monitoring the lethal pathogen’s spread to other mammals, such as when more than 50 sea lions were found dead in August in Argentina due to infection of the virus. The avian flu outbreak has set back California condor recovery efforts by at least a decade, according to conservationists. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/FILE 21 critically endangered California condors have died from avian flu “My concerns are that it’s in a lot of birds, birds are clearly continuing to move it, and it’s not going away … and as these mortalities pile up, the impact on populations, and potentially even (entire) species, is really great,” Harvey said. “The true magnitude of loss here, I do not believe is well understood and has not been documented, because it’s a really hard thing to do.” In this latest outbreak, the provincial director of biodiversity for Catamarca, Anabella Ahumada, confirmed the cause of death of hundreds of flamingos to local media, following positive test results for H5N1 in 3 out of 6 samples taken from the dead birds by SENASA, Argentina’s National Food Safety and Quality Service. Park rangers detected the high rates of mortality in the birds near the bodies of water Laguna Grande and Laguna Diamante, Ahumada told local media outlet Catamarca 12. The province has been under epidemiological surveillance since the start of November, Catamarca 12 reported. The Argentine government has recommended that people do not come into contact with sick or deceased birds without adequate protection. More on the bird flu Across the United States, zoos have been moving their captive birds indoors as the rate of infection continues to rise. In 2022, the Pittsburgh Zoo, the Denver Zoo, the Maryland Zoo and other facilities moved their bird species indoors away from people and other wildlife. Last month, the Dallas Zoo moved its flamingos indoors, NBC 5 in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area reported. The virus has spread through saliva, mucus and feces from infected birds, according to the CDC. In mammals, some scavenging species have come in contact with the virus by eating infected bird carcasses, Harvey said. This picture shows a Falkland Skua. Kneonlight/iStockphoto/Getty Images Bird flu detected in Antarctic for the first time, British Antarctic Survey says “As far as people interacting with wild birds, there doesn’t seem to be a huge risk to them, because the number of human cases have remained low globally, so we’re not too worried about that,” said Dr. Krysten Schuler, an assistant research professor in the department of public and ecosystem health at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. “But the mutation potential and the wide distribution of this virus are the major risk factors.” James’ flamingo is listed as “near threatened” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, Schuler noted. The main threats to the bird include habitat loss caused by mining, as well as human disturbances due to recreational activities, according to IUCN. When the virus affects birds that are already struggling population-wise, it can have the potential to eliminate species, Schuler said. There is not much that can be done to stop the spread of the virus, but Schuler recommends that people report any unusual animal deaths without an obvious cause to their state wildlife agencies, so they can be notified of what areas the disease is spreading. “If there is any potential to do something about it, our best option is right at the beginning,” Schuler said.

RELATED COVERAGE WHO asks China for more information about rise in illnesses and pneumonia clusters No, Fauci didn’t say face masks were a ‘failure’ Combination COVID and flu test does not prove they are the same virus The ministry called on local authorities to open more fever clinics and promote vaccinations among children and the elderly as the country grapples with a wave of respiratory illnesses in its first full winter since the removal of COVID-19 restrictions.“Efforts should be made to increase the opening of relevant clinics and treatment areas, extend service hours and increase the supply of medicines,” said ministry spokesman Mi Feng. He advised people to wear masks and called on local authorities to focus on preventing the spread of illnesses in crowded places such as schools and nursing homes.The WHO earlier this week formally requested that China provide information about a potentially worrying spike in respiratory illnesses and clusters of pneumonia in children, as mentioned by several media reports and a global infectious disease monitoring service. The emergence of new flu strains or other viruses capable of triggering pandemics typically starts with undiagnosed clusters of respiratory illness. Both SARS and COVID-19 were first reported as unusual types of pneumonia.Chinese authorities earlier this month blamed the increase in respiratory diseases on the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Other countries also saw a jump in respiratory diseases such as RSV when pandemic restrictions ended. The WHO said Chinese health officials on Thursday provided the data it requested during a teleconference. Those showed an increase in hospital admissions of children due to diseases including bacterial infection, RSV, influenza and common cold viruses since October. Chinese officials maintained the spike in patients had not overloaded the country’s hospitals, according to the WHO.It is rare for the U.N. health agency to publicly ask for more detailed information from countries, as such requests are typically made internally. WHO said it requested further data from China via an international legal mechanism.According to internal accounts in China, the outbreaks have swamped some hospitals in northern China, including in Beijing, and health authorities have asked the public to take children with less severe symptoms to clinics and other facilities.WHO said that there was too little information at the moment to properly assess the risk of these reported cases of respiratory illness in children. Both Chinese authorities and WHO have been accused of a lack of transparency in their initial reports on the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.

The new case is the first to be detected in the UK and is unrelated genetically to the previous cases.Influenza A(H1N2)v is similar to flu viruses circulating in pigs in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency has formally notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the discovery.Based on early information, the infection detected in the UK is a distinct clade or form – 1b.1.1 – which is different from recent human cases of H1N2 elsewhere in the world.The person infected, who has not been identified, had a mild illness and has recovered. They were not hospitalised and were not known to have worked with pigs, the Guardian understands. How they came to be infected remains under investigation.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is carrying out contact tracing of close contacts to prevent further spread of the virus. It is not known at this stage how transmissible the strain is or if there could be other cases in the UK.Meera Chand, an incident director at UKHSA, said: “It is thanks to routine flu surveillance and genome sequencing that we have been able to detect this virus. This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs.“We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread. In accordance with established protocols, investigations are under way to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases.”Any contacts will be offered testing as necessary and advised on any necessary further care if they have symptoms or test positive. The UKHSA is also taking steps to increase surveillance within existing programmes involving GP surgeries and hospitals in parts of North Yorkshire. To assist in the detection of cases, people who are contacted and asked to test are being encouraged to do so.The chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: “We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans – which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important.“Through our animal and human surveillance systems we work together to protect everyone. In this case, we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation. Pig keepers must also report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately.”H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine flu A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans. In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by H1N1, commonly referred to as swine flu. This now circulates in humans seasonally.Explore more on these topicsSwine fluFluHealthInfectious diseasesMicrobiologynewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘Long flu’: study finds flu patients at higher risk of longer-term illness14 Dec 2023Respiratory infection clusters in China not caused by novel virus, says health ministry26 Nov 2023England to deny Covid and flu jabs to under-65s despite fears for NHS this winter8 Aug 2023Flu and pneumonia deaths a quarter higher than usual in England and Wales20 Jan 2023Universal flu vaccine may be available within two years, says scientist25 Nov 2022Flu season in England is worst for a decade, says health secretary9 Jan 2023Ambulance staff reportedly urged to conserve oxygen amid ‘twindemic’30 Dec 2022Flu continues to spread in England with number of hospital patients up 79%30 Dec 2022Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Diagnosis of pneumonia in children, along with other respiratory illnesses, increases every year in the fall and winter months. In the United States, CDC monitors increases in respiratory illness, including pneumonia, through multiple data sources. The weekly percent of emergency department visits with diagnosed pneumonia is largely consistent with previous years for children aged 0 to 4 years, with slight increases above typical levels for children aged 5 to 17 years, but still consistent with pre-pandemic years. These increases are likely caused by viruses and bacteria we expect to see during the respiratory illness season. There are many ways to protect yourself from serious illness this fall and winter, including effective immunizations that protect against viral and bacterial diseases that can lead to pneumonia. Summary What CDC knows CDC has been monitoring increases in respiratory illness recently reported around the world. What CDC is doing CDC uses multiple data sources to monitor for increases in respiratory illness. CDC is also collaborating with state and local public health departments to closely monitor pediatric pneumonia cases in the United States. Pediatric pneumonia update CDC has been monitoring increases in respiratory illness reported recently around the world, including in China and several European countries. CDC is working closely with international, state, and local public health partners to maintain strong situational awareness. In the United States, CDC uses multiple data sources to monitor for increases in respiratory illness, including pneumonia, which can be caused by many pathogens. One data source is the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), which monitors anonymized daily visit data from around 78% of emergency departments in the United States. The diagnosis of pneumonia in children, along with other respiratory illnesses, increases every year during the fall and winter months in the United States. As of November 25, 2023, NSSP data indicated that the weekly percent of emergency department visits with diagnosed pneumonia was 1.7% for children aged 0–1 years, 2.4% for children aged 2–4 years, and 1.5% for children aged 5–17 years. These rates are roughly in line with previous years for patients aged 0–1 year and 2–4 years nationally (Figure 1). National Weekly Percent of Emergency Department Visits for Pneumonia Among Patients Aged 0-17 Years] View LargerDownload Data through 11/25/2023; data as of 12/1/2023 Includes the following diagnosis codes: J09.X1 Influenza due to identified novel influenza A virus with pneumonia; J10.0 Influenza due to other identified influenza virus with pneumonia; J11.0 Influenza due to unidentified influenza virus with pneumonia; J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified; J13 Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae; J14 Pneumonia due to Hemophilus influenzae; J15 Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified; J16 Pneumonia due to other infectious organisms, not elsewhere classified; J17 Pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere; J18 Pneumonia, unspecified organism; J80 Acute respiratory distress syndrome; A48.1 Legionnaires’ disease; and J20.0 Acute bronchitis due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae The percent of emergency department visits diagnosed with pneumonia among patients aged 5–17 years is similar to pre-pandemic years, and it remains lower than that seen among younger children. CDC will continue to work with state and local health departments to monitor these rates closely. Based on laboratory findings, these increases in pediatric pneumonia do not appear to be caused by a new virus or other pathogen. Instead, these increases are likely caused by viruses and bacteria we expect to see during the respiratory illness season. CDC will continue to work with state and local officials to monitor the situation. Additional information about the current state of viral respiratory illness can be found at: Respiratory Illnesses Data Channel. Respiratory illness prevention As we progress into respiratory season, you can do more than ever to help prevent people from becoming severely ill from respiratory illness. This includes: Safe and effective immunizations - For the first time ever, immunizations are available for three major fall and winter viral respiratory diseases – flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which can cause pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccines are also available to prevent the most common type of bacterial pneumonia. Pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines are available to prevent another common bacterial respiratory infection that can lead to pneumonia. Widely available, effective treatments – Antiviral treatments are available for flu and COVID-19, and antibiotics are used to treat respiratory diseases caused by bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, pneumococcal disease, and whooping cough. These treatments can reduce risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Testing – Tests, some of which can be used at home, can quickly detect COVID-19 and flu. There are also tests for illnesses caused by bacteria, but a healthcare provider needs to perform these tests. Getting tested quickly is important, so there is no delay in treatment and other actions that can protect family, friends, and coworkers. Other ways to protect yourself – Other actions like masking, physical distancing, washing hands, and improving ventilation in the places where people live and work can provide additional layers of protection.

Respiratory infections seem to favor the colder months, even though you may be exposed to viruses and other pathogens throughout the year. While the common cold doesn’t require medical care itself, it can cause complications like ear infections or longer-lasting sinusitis, as well as triggering stronger asthma attacks. When ear, nose, and throat conditions rear their ugly heads this season, know that Campbell County Medical Group ENT Clinic is standing by, ready to serve you, getting you back to health during the long Wyoming winter. Common cold It’s typical for a healthy adult to have several common colds throughout the year. Caused by a wide variety of viruses, colds usually last for about a week to 10 days. While symptoms can be highly uncomfortable, it is unlikely you’ll become seriously ill because of a cold. However, a cold can cause complications in your sinuses and ears. People with nasal polyps or deviated septums could risk chronic sinusitis, a respiratory infection that can resemble a cold but never ends. Influenza Influenza, or the flu, is potentially more serious than a cold, but healthy people generally aren’t at risk. Complications associated with the flu can be serious and even life-threatening in rare cases. Along with similar sinus complications to the common cold, flu can lead to inflammatory conditions of the brain, heart, and muscles. Patients with heart disease may find their condition progressing or worsening because of the flu virus. Strep throat Viral respiratory infections can feature sore throats among their symptoms. Strep throat, however, results from a bacterial infection and doesn’t have respiratory symptoms. You may have strep throat if you experience a fast outbreak of sharp throat pain. Like cold and flu, strep throat can resolve itself in 7-10 days, but because throat pain is often severe and serious, complications like rheumatic fever or kidney inflammation are possible. Treatment with antibiotics can shorten the course of the disease as well as the length of time during which you can spread the illness to others. Pneumonia Resulting from viral, bacterial, or fungal infections, pneumonia is potentially the most serious common respiratory infection. It can be a complication of cold or flu, occurring when the air sacs in your lungs become inflamed. The infecting pathogen overwhelms the body’s immune system, and it can be serious when it occurs in very young children, those over 65, or people with weak immune systems or other medical problems. Even healthy adults may sometimes have trouble fighting off the infection. Symptoms resemble cold or flu, but they tend to last longer. In severe cases, fluid may begin to collect in the lungs. At Campbell County Medical Group ENT, we are equipped with the tools and skills to aid your every ear, nose and throat condition. Dr. Ryan Black and his team, Kyle Hunter, PA-C and Micayla Hinds, NP embody excellence every day through their attention to care and compassion for our patients.

December 2, 2023 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version A child is seen receiving an influenza vaccine in this file photo taken in Fukuoka's Higashi Ward. (Mainichi/Takeshi Noda) The Mainichi Shimbun answers some common questions readers may have about the influenza outbreak, which has arrived earlier than usual this year in Japan. Question: How is this year's seasonal influenza different from a usual year? Answer: An exceptional flu epidemic has continued since the week from Sept. 4 to 10, the first of the 2023-2024 flu season. In October, the number of patients rose to a level prompting local governments nationwide to issue warnings. According to the latest data, released by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on Nov. 24, the average number of flu patients reported per medical institution across the country between Nov. 13 and 19 was 21.66, the highest figure yet this season. Q: Is the outbreak likely to continue? A: Experts believe so. An influenza outbreak normally begins around December and ends in April or later the following year. The Type A flu virus often dominates the first half of the season, and Type B the second half. The majority of the strains detected so far this season have been Type A. Considering past trends, experts point out that more and more people will be infected with Type B from now on. Q: If a person gets infected with Type A, do they then become immune to Type B? A: Hiroki Ohashi, director of the Tama Family Clinic in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, says, "Even if you are infected with type A, there is still a risk of contracting Type B. Even those who have been infected once should get vaccinated." In addition, we also need to be mindful of COVID-19 outbreaks, which have repeatedly occurred during winter since 2020. Ohashi points out three possibilities: an outbreak of Type B flu, the coronavirus, or both simultaneously. Q: How can we prevent infections? A: By continuing basic measures such as handwashing, wearing masks and avoiding close contact, crowds and closed spaces. If you don't feel well, don't go to work or school. Be sure to ventilate your room regularly, even during the winter.

Influenza A(H1) viruses are found in pigs in most regions of the world, according to the World Health Organization. When these viruses are found in humans, they’re called variant influenza viruses, and the most common ones that infect humans are H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These viruses are often transmitted to people who come in contact with pigs via agricultural fairs, work, or through pigs they own. People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces, then touching their mouth or nose. There have been no known cases of people contracting the virus from eating properly handled pork. Though most cases of swine flu don’t spread person-to-person, there have been documented cases of person-to-person transmission. The 2009 H1N1 (or swine flu) pandemic began in the U.S. and quickly spread around the world. People caught the virus by breathing in contaminated droplets in the air. Globally, there were at least 150,000 deaths, and people 65 years and older made up 80% of those deaths. In the U.S., there were almost 70 million cases, around 274,000 hospitalizations and about 12,500 deaths between April 2009, and April 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On Monday, the U.K. Health Security Agency announced it had detected a single confirmed human case of influenza A(H1N2)v as part of routine national flu surveillance.Officials racing to track contacts, say individual had a mild illnessCBC News · Posted: Nov 27, 2023 2:13 PM EST | Last Updated: November 28, 2023The U.K. Health Security Agency has detected a single confirmed human case of influenza A(H1N2)v, one that is 'distinct' but similar to viruses currently circulating in pigs. (Phil Noble/Reuters)Social SharingOfficials are racing to track the contacts of the United Kingdom's first human case of a "distinct" form of swine flu.On Monday, the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced it had detected a single confirmed human case of influenza A(H1N2)v as part of routine national flu surveillance.There have been dozens of human cases of that strain reported globally since 2005, but none of them are genetically related to the recently identified case, officials said."Based on early information, the infection detected in the U.K. is a distinct clade (1b.1.1), which is different from recent human cases of influenza A(H1N2) elsewhere in the world but is similar to viruses in U.K. swine," reads the UKHSA's statement.Officials said the individual  experienced a mild illness and fully recovered, but the source of their infection isn't yet known.Case of variant influenza virus normally found in pigs identified in Manitoba"We are working rapidly to trace close contacts and reduce any potential spread," Meera Chand, the UKHSA's incident director, said in a statement. "In accordance with established protocols, investigations are underway to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases."That includes increased surveillance in surgeries and hospitals in North Yorkshire, a region of northern England.Different form of swine flu sparked 2009 pandemicH1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine influenza A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments, UKHSA officials said in their statement.A total of 50 human cases of influenza A(H1N2)v, the broader strain identified in the U.K. case, have been reported in various countries, including Canada.Manitoba's Department of Agriculture and Resource Development reported one human case of variant H1N2 in the province to the Public Health Agency of Canada in late 2021, and said it appeared to be an isolated instance, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission.Rare swine flu variant found in Manitoba2 Manitobans infected with rare swine flu variantsThe year before, Manitoba reported cases of variant influenza viruses found in two unrelated individuals in different communities. One was a case of human influenza A(H1N2)v and one was a case of human influenza A(H1N1)v, along with an unrelated case of H3N2 variant influenza.In 2009, however, a different strain sparked a pandemic. That H1N1 influenza A virus contained genetic material from viruses that were circulating in pigs, birds and humans in the 1990s and 2000s, and it exploded globally, becoming known as "swine flu."H1N1 is now circulating in humans seasonally and is distinct from the virus strains currently circulating in pigs.With files from ReutersCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

"In accordance with established protocols, investigations are under way to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases."The new Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the individual was identified through a "thorough and extensive" screening and monitoring programme run by UKHSA."It's good that this case has been spotted - please trust the UKHSA to do their job and to monitor carefully," she said.People with flu-like symptoms are advised to avoid contact with others, particularly those who are elderly or vulnerable, with other health conditions.Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: "We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans - which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important." She said pig-owners must report any signs of swine flu in their herds to their local vet.Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said A(H1N2) did not cause any more severe disease than other commonly circulating types of influenza. Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, said it was "very unlikely" that the single case represented "anything more than has been seen in the past", adding that the mild infection was "also in keeping with previous experience".

Advertisement View all journals Search Log in nature collection Collection Next-generation vaccines for infectious diseases Submission status Open Submission deadline 01 December 2024 Next-generation vaccines are considered a promising approach to combating future disease outbreaks. Recent advancements in vaccine technologies have sped up the development of efficacious vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic and are being tested for other pathogens. However, there remain many challenges for next-generation vaccines, which should target conserved epitopes, induce durable protection, and inhibit transmission of the disease-causing agent. This cross-journal Collection welcomes submissions that propose technological advancements in vaccine/antigen design, target combinations, delivery systems for any pathogen groups, as well as adjunctive therapies. We encourage preclinical and clinical studies that evaluate vaccine safety and efficacy, including studies that test delivery routes, timing, and booster doses as part of the immunisation strategy. Moreover, epidemiological studies assessing or modeling coverage and effectiveness, with the aim to provide insight for further research, and guidance for policymakers, licensure, and regulatory framework will be considered. This Collection is regularly updated with new content, selected by our editorial teams. Authors should refer to the aims and scope of Nature Communications, npj Vaccines, Communications Medicine, and Scientific Reports to determine the most appropriate journal for their manuscript.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Flu What You Shouldn’t Do When You Have the Flu By Kristina Herndon, RN Updated on November 28, 2023 Medically reviewed by Rochelle Collins, DO Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Close There are some things you just can’t avoid, like getting the flu. It’s even possible to have the flu even if vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that vaccine protection varies from season to season, and also based on the age and health of the person receiving it, as well as the match between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation. The good news is for both the vaccinated and unvaccinated who may get the flu, there are things you can do to make the seasonal sickness and symptoms less cumbersome. 1 Don’t Expose Yourself to People in Flu High-Risk Groups Dave and Les Jacobs / Getty Images The flu can make even the healthiest among us feel miserable. For some people, it can also be life-threatening. While healthy people can die from the flu, most flu deaths occur in high-risk groups with compromised immune systems, including adults over the age of 65, children under age two, pregnant and postpartum women, and people with other chronic medical conditions. Since you can be contagious with the flu from the day before symptoms start until five to seven days after you get sick, it’s important to be aware of who you come into contact with. 2 Don’t Go to the Hospital With the Flu Unless You Really Need To Most people who go to the hospital with flu symptoms don’t need to be there. If your symptoms aren’t life-threatening and don’t need immediate treatment, you shouldn’t go to the emergency department. Each flu season, emergency departments get overcrowded because people head straight there when they think they might have the flu. Many people could get the same treatment (which would be faster and cheaper) from their primary healthcare provider or even an urgent care clinic. And most people don’t need medical treatment at all when they have the flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are times when a trip to the hospital with the flu is warranted. If you or your child are experiencing difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, or sudden dizziness, you should seek immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, many people who go to the emergency department with flu symptoms don’t fall into these categories. 3 Don’t Assume You Know When You Should See a Healthcare Provider for the Flu Not everyone needs to seek medical treatment when they have the flu, but there are times when you should. If you aren’t having an emergency and don’t need to go to the hospital, you may still need to see your healthcare provider. Knowing what to watch for in yourself and your child when you have flu symptoms is important. 4 Don’t Ask Your Healthcare Provider for Antibiotics for the Flu Antibiotics treat bacteria, not viruses. Because the flu is caused by a virus, antibiotics are useless against it. Although many people believe their favorite antibiotic will cure any illness they have, that just isn’t the case. If you have been diagnosed with the flu, don’t push your healthcare provider to prescribe an antibiotic. If your symptoms and health warrant it, there are antiviral medications that can shorten the duration ​of your flu symptoms. There are four antiviral medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat influenza, including Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir). They don’t work quite like antibiotics do (meaning you won’t necessarily feel better within 48 hours like you usually do with antibiotics) but they can reduce the severity of the illness and help you get better faster, even if by a day. These medications are most often prescribed for people in flu high-risk groups. 5 Don’t Try to Continue Your Daily Activities With the Flu With few exceptions, you need to stay home when you have the flu. Not allowing yourself time to rest will increase the amount of time that it takes you to recover. You risk exposing other people to the virus (though this can even happen before you have symptoms). And of course, most people who attempt to work when they are sick are not very productive. So if you have the flu, stay home. Your coworkers will thank you. 6 Don’t Diagnose Yourself With the Flu If You Have a Stomach Virus The flu is a respiratory illness. Occasionally some people (usually children) may experience vomiting and diarrhea with the flu, but the primary symptoms are fever, body aches, headache, cough, and exhaustion. If you have an illness causing a lot of vomiting and diarrhea, this could be gastroenteritis, which is sometimes called the “stomach flu,” but it’s not caused by the influenza virus. 7 Don’t Believe Everything You Read on the Internet About the Flu Scroll through your Facebook timeline, Twitter feed or just do a Google search and you will find all sorts of miracle cures and treatments for your flu symptoms. People share these articles and posts with little concern about whether or not they are accurate. If a friend shared it, it must be true, right?! Of course, that isn’t true. Anyone can post anything on the internet. Unfortunately, many of these claims can be not only inaccurate but also dangerous. 10 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

This comes after cases have been identified in Taylor and Trempealeau Counties in the past two weeks. Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) said they and the USDA are working with animal health officials on a joint incident response.News 18 asked where the commercial flock is and what type of birds were affected but have not received those details yet. Officials said in a press release "the affected premises will not move poultry products, and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease."Officials added that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk, and that properly handling and cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills the virus.Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are highly contagious and often fatal to poultry.The Barron County case comes two weeks after DATCP announced the first case of bird flu of 2023 was identified in a Taylor County backyard flock of domestic geese. Last week DATCP said the virus was found in a Trempealeau County commercial flock.Earlier in November, a million chickens were killed in Minnesota to limit the spread of the virus. As recently as Thursday the Des Moines Register reported bird flu cases were found in western Iowa.In 2022 there was a major uptick in bird flu cases in the U.S., resulting in DATCP issuing a statewide order prohibiting movement of poultry at live events. When the virus was detected in Barron County last April, more than 46,000 turkeys were killed at the Jennie-O turkey farm. Have a story idea?

Among the various subtypes, the H9N2 avian influenza virus has gained attention due to its ability to infect a wide range of bird species and occasional transmission to humans. Currently, the spread of clusters of respiratory illness in children in northern China, has drawn more attention to H9N2 influenza virus. It is important to know the causes, symptoms, and preventive measures associated with H9N2.2/6​What causes it?​H9N2 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It primarily affects birds, with a high prevalence in poultry such as chickens and turkeys. The virus can undergo genetic reassortment, leading to the emergence of new strains. The transmission of H9N2 occurs through direct contact with infected birds, their respiratory secretions, or contaminated environments. The virus can persist in water and on surfaces, contributing to its spread within and between flocks. A human case of H9N2 virus infection in October 2023 in China was reported to WHO3/6​What are the symptoms?​In poultry, H9N2 infections can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on various factors such as the bird species, age, and the presence of other pathogens. Common symptoms in birds include respiratory distress, reduced egg production, and a drop in feed consumption. In humans, symptoms are similar to those of other influenza viruses and may include fever, cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. 4/6​How to prevent the transmission of the virus?​Implementing strict biosecurity measures is essential to prevent the introduction and spread of H9N2 in poultry farms. This includes controlling access to farms, regular disinfection of facilities, and ensuring that personnel and equipment are free from contamination. Regular surveillance of poultry populations is crucial for early detection of H9N2 infections. Monitoring bird health, conducting routine testing, and promptly reporting any unusual illness can help prevent the spread of the virus.5/6​Strict hygiene practice is important​Practicing good hygiene is essential in both commercial and backyard poultry settings. This includes proper waste disposal, regular cleaning and disinfection of equipment and facilities, and the use of protective clothing by farm workers. Educating poultry farmers, workers, and the general public about the risks associated with H9N2 is important for prevention. Awareness campaigns can help disseminate information on proper hygiene practices, the importance of early detection, and the potential consequences of the virus. To avoid spreading to humans, those in contact with the infected animals should clean their hands regularly and disinfect their clothes and belongings if they are in direct contact with the birds. 6/6​"India is prepared for any kind of exigency that may emerge from the current situation"​"Union Health Ministry is closely monitoring the reported outbreak of H9N2 cases and clusters of respiratory illness in children in northern China. There is low risk to India from both the avian influenza case reported from China as well as the clusters of respiratory illness," as per an official statement made on November 24. The overall risk assessment by WHO indicates a low probability of human to human spread and low case fatality rate among human cases of H9N2 reported to WHO so far. ​China pneumonia outbreak in kids: Is it treatable?​FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 seeds that are used as spicesFoodFrom Bold to Elegant: Rakul Preet Singh’s Style EvolutionindiaTaapsee Pannu redefines style with her stunning outfitsindia8 golden rules of a happy marriageindiaStunning pictures of Sai PallaviindiaAvneet Kaur’s perfect statement winter looksindia​10 unique things only Penguins can doindia8 signs your children are driving you into social isolationindiaMalavika Mohanan captures hearts with her breathtaking photos​india Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Alice accuses Vivian for suggesting to use 'Women’s Card'BB18: Chum asks Karan about his struggles in the gameExcl- Nyrraa on BB18: Why Eisha, Alice weren't confronted?BB18: Vivian and Kashish clash over coffeeBB18: Rajat's controversial fights in the showBB18: Nouran slams trolls over rumours of Vivian consuming 'gutka'BB18's Hema had to sell her earrings to cover expensesBB18: Vivian orders Rajat to keep an eye on housematesArfeen refuses to shake hands with Avinash as he leaves BB18123 Photostories 5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf waterExclusive- Nyrraa M Banerjii reacts to Weekend Ka Vaar episode: Why Eisha Singh and Alice Kaushik weren't confronted for the kind of things they spoke​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​How tall are Trump family members​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from school​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the worldFrom Shoaib Ibrahim calling Bigg Boss no more a personality show to Divyanka Tripathi admitting it is not her cup of tea: Celebs who have refused to do the show'Bigg Boss18': From his intense brawl with Avinash Mishra to arguments with Vivian Dsena; Rajat Dalal's controversial fights in the show8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich123lifestyle videosShalini Passi has shaved her head four times!Shalini Passi has shaved her head four times!03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

This latest death brings the total number of people killed by the virus in Cambodia since 2003 to 41, with 62 cases of Avian Influenza A infection in humans reported there over the same period.A Cambodia CDC official conducts an Avian Influenza A (H5N1) education campaign for residents in Preah Kampong Thom commune, Kampot Cambodia CDCThe most recent victim is a woman aged between 20 and 25, from Preah Kampong Thom commune in Kampot’s Tek Chhou district, who first developed a fever, cough, and shortness of breath on November 19, and was treated at home for several days. On November 23, she sought treatment at the provincial referral hospital.Samples collected at the hospital were transported to the National Institute of Public Health for testing where they were subsequently confirmed as influenza A (H5N1) by RT-qPCR assays at the National Laboratory at the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and reconfirmed by Institute Pasteur du Cambodge.The woman’s condition rapidly deteriorated, and she was transferred to the intensive care ward of the National Pediatric Hospital in Phnom Penh, where she succumbed to the virus on November 26.Child is Cambodia’s sixth Avian Influenza A (H5N1) case for 2023Cambodia’s CDC team reacted quickly to reports of an Avian Influenza A (H5N1) outbreak in Kampot dispatching a large team to conduct active surveillance and education Cambodia CDCAs a result of active surveillance in response to the first reported case, a female child aged less than five was detected exhibiting a fever, cough and a rash.The child was transported to hospital on November 25 for testing, with samples returning positive for influenza A (H5N1) by RT-qPCR assay in a process identical to the first case.The young girl is currently receiving treatment in an isolation room in the respiratory ward of the hospital.An epidemiological investigation found both cases had exposure to backyard birds which were reported to be sick and/ or dead, over the past month. No epidemiological linkage of these cases has yet been confirmed, other than that they both lived in the same village.The Cambodia Ministry of Health (MOH) has launched an investigation into the source of the infection, tracing potential contacts, and is conducting laboratory tests of poultry samples from the surrounding area.As a result of active surveillance in response to the first reported case of Avian Influenza A (H5N1), a female child aged less than five was detected exhibiting a fever, cough and a rash Cambodia CDCThe ministry has also reiterated the importance of preventive measures, such as avoiding contact with sick or dead poultry, practicing good hand hygiene, and cooking poultry thoroughly.Laboratory investigation shows the viruses, as indicated by phylogenetic analysis, fall within the H5 clade 2.3.2.1c with close similarity to the viruses that have been circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013-2014. The sequences cluster most closely with the viruses from the two human cases reported in October 2023.The recent death underscores the persistent threat posed by influenza A (H5N1), a highly contagious virus that can jump from animals to humans. While the virus does not easily transmit from person to person, close contact with infected birds or their contaminated environments remains the primary mode of human transmission.More than have of Influenza A (H5N1) cases result in deathAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 882 human cases of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) reported globally between 2003 and November 27, 2023 with 461 deaths, or a case fatality rate (CFR) of 52.26 per cent. Cambodia’s official figures reveal a CFR of 57 per cent.Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza (H5N1), swine influenza (H1N1), or other types of animal influenza viruses.A public education poster and advertisement warning people of the dangers of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) and advising them not to handle poultry Cambodia CDCAvian, swine, and other animal influenza virus infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to more severe diseases and can be fatal. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported.There has also been several detections of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus in asymptomatic persons, but who had exposure to infected birds in the days before a sample was collected.In Cambodia, poultry farming is widespread, particularly in rural areas, making it challenging to eliminate the virus reservoir.The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is working to strengthen surveillance and control measures in poultry populations to reduce the risk of human exposure.Cambodia CDC staff take a pathology sample for testing for Avian Influenza A (H5N1) from a resident of Preah Kampong Thom commune, Kampot Cambodia CDCMeanwhile people with concerns over their own health, that of others, or wishing to report sick or dead birds can use the country’s 115 hotline to contact the MOH directly.Launched in 2016 as a collaboration between InSTEDD iLab Southeast Asia, Cambodia MOH’s Communicable Disease Control Department (CDC), and Skoll Global Threats Fund, the 115 hotline allows the public and healthcare workers in Cambodia to access information and submit disease reports for free by dialing 1-1-5 from any phone.In early 2017, the 115 hotline received around 35,000 total calls from the public, allowing Cambodian CDC to rapidly respond to, contain, and eradicate an outbreak of a deadly strain of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) in Svay Rieng province.

Closely monitoring outbreak of H9N2, clusters of respiratory illness in children in China, says Health MinistryThe November-December period is the usual season when flu and respiratory illnesses, such as H1N1, shows a spike in Kerala, especially among children, and hence the general alert against H1N1 has been renewed, the Director of Health Services said here.The spike in respiratory illnesses and clusters of pneumonia reported among children in northern China since mid-October has set the alarm bells ringing in the rest of the world, even though China has clarified that the surge in respiratory infections is due to flu and other known pathogens.Catch-up phenomenonExperts have linked the surge in respiratory infections in China to the ‘catch-up” phenomenon or the concept of “immunity debt” in children. After three years of stringent pandemic restrictions due to its ‘zero Covid policy”, it was only late last year – much later than rest of the world – that China suddenly lifted all restrictions. So the cohort of children who were not exposed to any of the seasonal viruses these last three years and are “immune-naive” are now falling ill due to the seasonal pathogens currently in circulation.“Some experts have questioned the concept of “immunity debt”. However, what China is going through now is something all nations experienced at different points of time since last year, when schools reopened after Covid. In November 2021, when Kerala withdrew all mandatory non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), we also experienced this surge in seasonal infections in children. From January 2022, we have had a spate of infections in children – hand, foot and mouth disease, influenza and respiratory synctical virus (RSV), adenoviruses and also the more serious influenza-associated encephalitis in children. So the theory that China is going through the catch-up phenomenon is very much plausible,” points out R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Govt Medical College hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.Seasonal surgeIn October last year, the State had issued an alert on the rise in respiratory infections in children because of “immunity debt”. It also had to formulate guidelines to manage influenza-associated encephalitis in children, which had claimed a few lives too. Health officials said that H1N1 cases were being reported in the State throughout the year and with the beginning of the cooler weather and intermittent rains, seasonal surge in influenza cases should be expected. There is no situation that warrants any concern at present, though districts have been put on alert on the China situation, they said.

Here’s how to tell which is which.‘Tis the season for sharing … cold germs, flu viruses, stomach bugs and more. Cold weather months capture that magical time when your kid brings home a plethora of germs from school or daycare, while your sneezy coworker insists on coming in for a meeting instead of staying home.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyThis winter season could be another doozy, as numerous respiratory viruses like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surge alongside the flu and COVID-19 (what medical experts have dubbed “flurona”). Can you dodge all these infections? And if you get sick, how long should you expect to be sidelined before you return to regularly scheduled programming?Family physician Matthew Goldman, MD, explains how to stay safe this winter season, along with how to handle 10 of the most common winter illnesses.Why you might get sick this winter“Illnesses are more common in the winter because contaminated respiratory droplets travel more easily in dry air when an ill person coughs or sneezes,” explains Dr. Goldman. “Plus, people tend to gather indoors when it’s cold outside (and for the holidays), making it easier for germs to spread from person to person.”We also know that when you catch an illness, symptoms don’t always pop up right away. It could take up to a few days or a week for symptoms of a winter illness to appear depending on which virus you catch or germs you come into contact with and the strength of your immune system. Even though you might not feel sick, you’re still infected during this early incubation period — and you’re likely contagious and able to pass your infection on to others.Advertisement“You’re usually most contagious two to three days after you’re infected, but you can infect others for two weeks or longer while recovering from an illness,” reinforces Dr. Goldman.How to stop the spread of common winter illnessesIf you or your child are sick with any illness, you can avoid spreading viruses to others by following these steps:Cough and sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not your hands.Disinfect high-touch areas like countertops, doorknobs and remotes.Don’t share utensils, cups, food, toothbrushes, clothing, towels or other personal items.Stay home until symptoms improve and you’re no longer contagious.Wash your hands often with warm water and soap and use hand sanitizers intermittently.Wear a mask in public and consider wearing a mask at home around family members to protect other people, particularly those who are immunocompromised.10 common winter illnessesSo, what’s circulating right now? And what should you know if you get sick? Dr. Goldman breaks down the top 10 winter illnesses you can catch during respiratory season:1. Common cold (rhinovirus)With more than 200 different cold viruses (rhinoviruses) in circulation, it’s no wonder that most adults catch colds two or three times a year. Kids — with their germy hands, phlegmy coughs and (lack of) sneeze-covering skills — get sick even more frequently.Cold viruses linger, and you can pass the virus to others for up to two weeks. You and your child are contagious during the symptom-free incubation period. But you’re most likely to infect others when cold symptoms are at their worst — usually around day three of feeling lousy.“For relief from a cold, staying hydrated is key. Drinking warm liquids like tea can be soothing for a sore throat and congestion, and small changes can make a big difference when you have a cold,” says Dr. Goldman. “Consider using a humidifier in your room to add moisture to the air to help loosen congestion or gargle with warm salt water to relieve a sore throat.”2. Flu (influenza)Flu season runs from October to May, but it’s possible to get sick with an influenza virus any time of the year. The flu sickens millions in the U.S. every year and could lead to potential hospitalization or death. The flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and your family from this highly contagious virus. Each year, a new vaccine is rolled out to protect you against current variants of the flu.By the time you start showing flu symptoms, you’ve probably already given the virus to at least one other person. That’s because you’re contagious before you know you’re sick. The flu is contagious for a week or longer after you first have symptoms.Advertisement3. COVID-19COVID-19 spreads easily and peaks during respiratory season just like the flu and RSV. Because of this, we now have an annual updated COVID-19 vaccine that functions just like the annual flu vaccine: It protects you and your loved ones from the most dangerous circulating variants of COVID-19.While you can still get COVID-19 even after you’ve been vaccinated, you’re likely to experience less severe symptoms and you’re less at risk of hospitalization.If you get infected with COVID-19, you’re more likely to infect others with the virus one to two days before symptoms appear and two to three days after you start feeling unwell. How long you’re contagious can also depend on the severity of your illness. If you have:Mild or no symptoms (asymptomatic): You’re contagious for about five days.Moderate to severe symptoms: You may be contagious for up to 20 days.“Once your symptoms have significantly improved or resolved, and it’s been at least five days since the onset of symptoms, you can generally be around others,” says Dr. Goldman.“However, it’s prudent to wear a mask in public spaces or when close to vulnerable individuals for at least 10 days, to minimize the risk of transmitting the infection. If you’re symptom-free and it’s been more than 10 days since your symptoms first appeared, it’s typically safe to resume normal activities without a mask.”Advertisement4. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)In adults and children who are otherwise healthy, RSV typically causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold. But this respiratory infection can cause potentially life-threatening bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants, adults who are older and people with weakened immune systems.Every year, RSV infections in children lead to 58,000 to 85,000 hospitalizations, and now, we’re seeing around 177,000 adults 60 and older be hospitalized with this virus, too. To help protect these populations, we’re now rolling out an RSV vaccine for children and older adults.If you or your child get infected with RSV, you can be contagious for a couple of days before symptoms appear and up to eight days afterward. But infants who are infected and people with weak immune systems may be contagious for up to four weeks, even when they no longer have symptoms.5. Chest cold (bronchitis)The viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19 can all lead to bronchitis if they’re left untreated or if their symptoms are severe enough. Also known as a chest cold, bronchitis causes the airways to your lungs to swell and fill with mucus. The most common symptom is a chronic cough that lasts three weeks or longer. Bronchitis isn’t contagious. But the cold, flu or other virus that led to bronchitis is, so you still need to take precautions to prevent infecting others.Advertisement6. PneumoniaBacteria — as well as the viruses that cause COVID-19 and RSV — can cause pneumonia. Both viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious, but not everyone who’s exposed gets sick.Children younger than 2, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems should get the pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine to prevent severe complications. These populations specifically are at increased risk for severe symptoms, and even death, as a result of pneumonia.If you have viral pneumonia, you’re contagious until your fever breaks and when you’re fever-free for several days.If you have bacterial pneumonia, you’re contagious until you’ve taken at least two days of antibiotics and no longer have a fever.7. Pink eye (conjunctivitis)Bacteria, as well as viruses that cause colds and COVID-19, can cause pink eye. This eye infection swells your blood vessels in the tissues (conjunctiva) that line your eyelids and outer eye. Your swollen blood vessels make the white part of your infected eye look pink.You can spread viral pink eye very easily during the incubation period and while you have symptoms. Bacterial pink eye is contagious until you’ve taken antibiotics for at least 24 hours — or until the symptoms go away. For this reason, it’s important that if you have pink eye you avoid touching your face, your eyes and other surfaces as much as possible before washing your hands.8. Sinus infection (sinusitis)Colds and seasonal allergies can cause sinus infections. Also known as acute sinusitis, this infection occurs when your sinuses, which make mucus, fill with fluids. Bacteria sometimes grow in this mucus, causing bacterial sinusitis. A bacterial sinus infection isn’t contagious, but you can spread the cold that caused the sinus infection to others.“To alleviate the discomfort of sinus pressure from an infection, I recommend regular saline nasal irrigation. This simple technique helps clear nasal passages, reduce congestion, and ease pressure. It’s a safe and effective way to lessen the symptoms and promote sinus drainage,” advises Dr. Goldman.“Applying a warm, moist cloth over your sinuses several times a day can also be beneficial. The warmth helps open the nasal passages, reduces the pressure, and provides relief from pain.”9. Strep throatColds and other viruses tend to cause sore throats. But it’s highly contagious group A streptococcus (strep) bacteria that causes strep throat.This bacterial infection inflames the throat and tonsils, making it painful to swallow. You or your child may also have a fever and swollen lymph nodes. Left untreated, some children with strep throat will develop a bumpy red rash known as scarlet fever. If you or your child get strep throat, you’re contagious until the fever is gone and you’ve taken antibiotics for at least 12 hours.10. Stomach bug (norovirus)Norovirus is a stomach bug that causes diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps. Some people call it a “stomach flu”— but a flu strain doesn’t actually cause this illness. Still, noroviruses (there are many types) are highly contagious and difficult to kill. Noroviruses can linger for weeks on surfaces like countertops and doorknobs, too.You’re most contagious when you’re throwing up, experiencing diarrhea or in the few days after symptoms ease. Unfortunately, you can infect others for two weeks or longer, even when you feel better.When to see a provider about common winter illnessesDepending on the illness, you or your child may need treatments like antibiotics or antivirals. If any of the following symptoms occur, you should make an appointment with a healthcare provider:Any fever in infants younger than 3 months or a fever between 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37.22 degrees Celsius) and 100.4 F (38 C) in a child older than 3 months.High fever above 102 F (38.88 C) in an adult that lasts more than four days.Difficulty breathing, wheezing or chest pain.Extreme fatigue or lethargy.Signs of dehydration like dark-colored urine, confusion, dizziness or a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) in infants.With some preventive measures (vaccinate!), plenty of soap and water, and lots of common sense (don’t be the sneezy colleague!), we can all work together to weather the sick season better.Learn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryCommon ColdOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionHealth LibraryCommon ColdOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionAdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 7, 2024/Primary CareHow To Prevent ChafingIrritation from skin rubbing against skin or clothes can affect your whole body, but powders, creams and even the right underwear can help protect youOctober 30, 2024/Primary CareHow To Get Rid of Fruit Flies for GoodMake your home a no-fly zone by cleaning your drains, refrigerating your produce and DIYing a fruit fly trapOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 15, 2024/Skin Care & BeautyBiotin Side Effects: What’s the Risk?Taking supplements with biotin can cause inaccurate lab test resultsOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

Among more than 9,000 study participants, the flu shot was linked to a lower risk of ‘major cardiovascular events’ By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published November 28, 2023 6:50pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dr. Marc Siegel encourages Americans to get flu shot Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel previews the upcoming flu season and reacts to Dr. Fauci deflecting blame for pandemic school closures. People who get the flu vaccine may have improved heart health, according to a recent study published in Scientific Reports. Researchers from the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran, concluded that patients who received flu vaccinations had a 26% reduced risk of having a heart attack and were 33% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease.This finding is based on a review of five randomized controlled trials that focused on myocardial disease and influenza vaccines. CHILDHOOD PNEUMONIA SURGE REPORTED IN NETHERLANDS AMID OUTBREAK IN CHINA The patients who participated in the studies had all been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease previously and were 61 years old, on average. Out of the total of 9,059 patients, 4,529 of them received the flu vaccine, while 4,530 received a placebo shot. People who get the flu vaccine may have improved heart health, according to a recent study published in Scientific Reports. (iStock)After a nine-month period, 621 of the people who received the placebo shot experienced "major cardiovascular events," compared to 517 of the patients who received the flu vaccine. Those outcomes included myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death and stroke.WHEN MEASURING HEART ATTACK RISK, ONE IMPORTANT RED FLAG IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, DOCTORS SAY "Revealing a compelling insight into the potential benefits of influenza vaccination, our comprehensive meta-analysis, based on the latest randomized controlled trial data, demonstrates a significant interaction between influenza vaccination and the reduction of major cardiovascular events," wrote the researchers of the study. "Notably, patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced a remarkable risk reduction of over 20% in cardiovascular death." Patients who received flu vaccinations had a 26% reduced risk of having a heart attack and were 33% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As for why influenza vaccines seem to reduce the risk, the researchers noted that the shot could prevent inflammation and secondary infections, while also stabilizing plaque amounts in the heart.The vaccine could also help stimulate the immune system, which the study authors noted is essential for cardiovascular health. SHOULD YOU GET THE COVID AND FLU VACCINES AT THE SAME TIME?Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, called the study "important" and said it "builds on what we already knew."He was not involved in the research. Heart disease is the primary cause of death among U.S. adults, killing one person every 33 seconds, according to the CDC. (iStock) "It is not surprising that flu shots would decrease the risk of heart attacks," Siegel told Fox News Digital. "The flu is one of the great enablers," he went on. "It adds stress and inflammation to the body and decreases the overall immune response, all of which can lead to acute cardiac events."The flu "adds stress and inflammation to the body and decreases the overall immune response." The researchers called for further research to "elucidate the precise mechanisms driving this association and to explore the long-term impact of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular outcomes."

Read our privacy policyThe first flu strain H1N2 – commonly known as swine flu – has been detected in a human based in the UK, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has announced.According to the UKHSA, influenza A(H1N2)v is similar to flu viruses currently circulating in pigs in the UK. It is not yet known how transmissible it is. But since 2005, there have been 50 human cases reported globally.It was through a routine national flu surveillance conducted by the Royal College of General Practitioners and UKHSA, that a person who attended a GP appointment in Yorkshire, due to respiratory symptoms, was identified. The source of the infection remains unknown and under investigation.But what is swine flu? Should you be worried, and what symptoms should you be looking out for?What is swine flu?Dr Bruno Silvester Lopes, lecturer in microbiology at Teesside University, said: “Swine flu is a respiratory illness in pigs and birds that is mainly caused by type A influenza viral strains H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2.“Some of these strains can occasionally infect humans. In the 2009 swine flu pandemic, researchers observed that strains in humans were similar to those seen in pigs – which is how swine flu derives its common name. It would be more appropriate to call it the ‘influenza A(H1N1) virus’.“It is important to note that recent cases of swine flu in the North Yorkshire GP surgery differ from human cases of the flu in the past, and it is similar to viruses observed in UK pigs.”What are the myths and misconceptions around the disease?Lopes first explains that swine flu in humans is not caused by pigs. “People may also think it is a deadly disease, but it is treatable and has a death rate of only 1%,” he said.“We must also remember that flu can target anyone – not just people who are sick or have a weakened immune system. Equally, those who maintain a healthy lifestyle can also catch this flu.”Many also have the misconception that being exposed to cold weather can give them the flu, Lopes added. Swine flu outbreaks occur mainly during late autumn or winter, but they can occur anytime during the year, no matter the weather.“Swine flu is not a foodborne disease, as it spreads from droplets in the air and contact with surfaces.”What are the symptoms and how can it be treated?“We need to be mindful of symptoms such as fever, dry cough, headache, dizziness, sneezing, sore throat, chills, exhaustion, and runny nose. In rare cases, reports of vomiting, diarrhoea, and neurological issues have also been observed,” Lopes said.“You don’t always need antivirals to treat the flu. Simply taking bed rest and drinking lots of water may be enough to relieve the symptoms. If medications are prescribed, they must be taken within 24-48 hrs from the onset of symptoms and must be reserved for people with serious conditions.”How can we protect ourselves?To protect each other, Lopes advises people be aware that risk of transmission goes up if you spend a lot of time with others in a closed environment with close proximity.“You should also avoid going to work or school if you have flu-like symptoms,” he said.“Whenever you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth with a tissue and place any used tissues in a garbage disposal. If you don’t have any tissues on hand, cover your mouth and nose with your hand or a bent arm.“Regularly wash your face and hands, and practise good hygiene. You should also make sure everything you touch is clean, sanitise any surfaces, and observe any medical advice given by your doctor.”Is there a vaccine?The seasonal flu vaccines don’t protect against swine flu, but there is a specific one for certain groups, like children and pregnant women.Lopes said there are common myths include that the flu jab uses a large needle, that it’s not safe, and it has a lot of side effects. However, this is not the case.“The needle used is only a few millimetres long, so there is no need to worry. You might experience mild side effects, and vaccines are there to help prevent the illness,” he said. “Vaccines are designed for all groups, including pregnant women, so there is nothing to worry about. For those worried about religious beliefs, the jab doesn’t contain any pork products.“The influenza vaccine does not contain the live virus so you can’t catch the flu from it. Vaccination is effective but may not have 100% efficacy. It can depend on various factors like the age and health of a person.”Should people be worried about it?Lopes said: “There is no need to worry at this stage, but if you are worried then it is best to follow the UKHSA guidelines and avoid any contact with people experiencing the symptoms in order to limit the spread of disease.”More aboutPA ReadySwine fluPigsSymptomsYorkshireRoyal College of General PractitionersJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1What are the symptoms of swine flu and how can I protect myself?What are the symptoms of swine flu and how can I protect myself?Swine flu in humans is not caused by pigsGetty Images✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

By Dylan Donnelly, news reporter Sunday 26 November 2023 18:13, UK Image: A child gets intravenous dripping at a hospital in Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province Why you can trust Sky News China has said its outbreak of a respiratory illness stems from the flu and other known pathogens - while questions about its origins rise.A spokesperson from China's National Health Commission said clusters of respiratory infections across the country are caused by an overlap of common viruses. They cited the influenza virus, rhinoviruses, the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, the adenovirus as well as bacteria such as mycoplasma pneumoniae as the culprits.In response, the ministry called for more fever clinics and vaccinations for children and the elderly.Ministry spokesman Mi Feng also said: "Efforts should be made to increase the opening of relevant clinics and treatment areas, extend service hours and increase the supply of medicines." The statements come after a Beijing children's hospital earlier told state media CCTV that at least 7,000 patients were being admitted daily to the institution, exceeding capacity.And last week, the largest paediatric hospital in nearby Tianjin reportedly received more than 13,000 children at its outpatient and emergency departments.

There are a number of pathogens which are reported to be causing the outbreak of respiratory illness in China. Published on the 28 Nov 2023 by C Raina MacIntyre, Ashley Quigley, Haley Stone, Rebecca Dawson Several causes for this surge have been identified, which gives us confidence we are not dealing with a novel virus. Photo: Unsplash / Zhou Xuan. Reports of a surge in pneumonia-like illness primarily affecting children in northern China have captured our attention. The last time we heard about a mysterious respiratory outbreak leading to overcrowding in hospitals was the beginning of the COVID pandemic, so it’s not entirely surprising this has caused some alarm. On November 22 the World Health Organization requested information from China about this surge. Chinese health authorities have since said the outbreak is due to a number of respiratory pathogens. So what are the pathogens possibly causing this uptick in respiratory illness? And do we need to be concerned that any have pandemic potential? Let’s take a look. Mycoplasma One is a bacteria, Mycoplasma, which has been causing outbreaks of respiratory illness in China since June this year. Mycoplasma is usually treated in the community with antibiotics and hospitalisation is not common. It can lead to a phenomenon called “walking pneumonia”, which is when the chest x-ray looks much worse than the patient appears. In Taiwan, however, reports have suggested there’s a high level of antibiotic resistance to Mycoplasma, which may explain why it’s causing more hospital admissions. Influenza Influenza fell to very low levels during the first two years of the COVID pandemic due to masks, physical distancing and other measures. But once things began to return to “normal”, flu infections have tended to bounce back. Influenza is most severe in children under age five and the elderly, so may be contributing to hospitalisations among children. RSV and adenovirus Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can also be severe in children, and like influenza, all but disappeared during the first two years of the pandemic. But it’s now circulating widely. Adenovirus, which can cause a range of syndromes including gastroenteritis and a flu-like illness, has also been reported as contributing to the current outbreak in China. There are reports of children vomiting and pictures of children receiving IV fluids, presumably for dehydration as a result of gastroenteritis. The role of COVID SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, can also cause pneumonia, but less so in children. Early in the pandemic, we knew SARS-CoV-2 could show pneumonia on a chest scan in asymptomatic children, so COVID too can cause “walking pneumonia” in kids. SARS-CoV-2 causes more deaths in children than influenza, so likely is contributing to the overcrowding seen in hospitals. Some research suggests SARS-CoV-2 may also result in immune dysfunction after the infection, which may explain the unexpected rise of other infections, including streptococcal infections and Mycoplasma, since the pandemic. Co-infections People can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and other bacteria or viruses at the same time, which may also explain the severity of the current epidemic. One study showed co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycoplasma is very common and results in more serious complications. Could it be a new pandemic? The below figure shows reports of outbreaks of unspecified influenza-like illness and pneumonia, together with known causes influenza A and B, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, pertussis (whooping cough), adenovirus and Mycoplasma. It confirms an increase in respiratory illnesses this year in China compared to the same time last year. In contrast, the same comparison for the world shows a decrease this year compared to last year, which tells us China is indeed experiencing more respiratory illness than expected. If no known cause for this surge had been identified, that would give us greater cause for concern. But several have been identified, which gives us confidence we are not dealing with a novel virus. The virus we are most worried about with pandemic potential is avian influenza, which may mutate to become easily transmissible in humans. China has been an epicentre of avian flu in the past, but the spread of H5N1 has shifted to the Americas, Europe and Africa. Still, this year, China has reported multiple human cases of various avian flu strains, including H3N8, H5N1, H5N6 and H9N2. With large and continual outbreaks in birds and mammals, there is a greater likelihood of mutations and mixing of bird and human influenza genetic material, which could lead to a new pandemic influenza virus. The threat of new viruses is increasing, and pandemic potential is greatest for viruses spread by the respiratory route and which are severe enough to cause pneumonia. There is no indication that the current situation in China is a new pandemic, but we should always identify and pay attention to undiagnosed pneumonia clusters. Early warning systems give us the best chance of preventing the next pandemic.

(Zoom)Social SharingRespiratory virus season is here and one Manitoba doctor says it's only going to get worse. Children's Hospital of Winnipeg emergency department medical director Dr. Karen Gripp said as the season changes respiratory virus numbers will continue to rise in the next couple of months."Winter is coming, we expect this pretty much every winter, but the numbers are increasing," said Gripp. "Even just this past week we've jumped quite a bit in terms of the visits to children's emergencies and mostly they are respiratory viruses, influenza, RSV, COVID, as well as a number of other viruses common to children." Gripp said the vaccination rate among against influenza is only at 10 per cent for children in the province. "There are a lot of children, including the younger children, who could be protected against influenza, which would make a difference in their health and the health of others," she said. Gripp also said the children's emergency department is seeing an increase in patients and that many of those patients are coming in for influenza-like illnesses. The department is also seeing an increase in the number of patients coming in with respiratory symptoms who probably don't need emergency care. She said while it's putting a strain on the children's emergency department, the hospital will still prioritize those who come in with respiratory symptoms. Gripp also said there are other options like seeing a family doctor or visiting a walk-in clinic. She emphasized that while there will be long waits, the children's hospital only has so many resources and they have to give them "to the sickest patients." But if children are among those who are needing care urgently, they'll be taken care of, she said. "We know that parents are worried, they're supposed to be worried, that's part of our job as parents," said Gripp. "But definitely we're seeing more patients who probably don't need us, but parents are concerned things are just getting worse every day." Gripp also said parents know their children best, but should always keep a stock of Tylenol or Advil and be prepared to stay home from work if they're sick. She said parents should also keep their children out of school and daycare when they're sick so they can feel better and not infect those around them. She also encouraged people of all age ranges to get vaccinated "The most vital message is to empower parents to take care of their child, to know what to do at home, to know when to be worried and when not to be worried," she said.With files from Arturo ChangCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Outreach clinics set up in Winnipeg to get flu, COVID-19 shots to vulnerable populations Manitoba urges people to get 2 shots as it launches flu and COVID-19 vaccination campaign Alberta's fall COVID-19 surge has arrived and hospitals are feeling it Pneumonia uptick part of decision to reintroduce mask mandate in N.L., disease specialist says Mask mandate returning to N.L. health facilities as respiratory illnesses spikeFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

A mysterious pneumonia outbreak in China has led to a massive spike in hospital admissions in the country. According to the state-owned China National Radio, the Beijing children’s hospital is seeing an average of 7,000 patients per day, which has overwhelmed the healthcare system in the country. According to reports, the infection that's mostly affecting children is causing lung inflammation and high fever in the affected individuals but other respiratory symptoms like cough are missing. Experts say the surge in cases of this 'undiagnosed pneumonia' could be due to a phenomenon called 'immunity debt' after lifting of lockdown restrictions in the peak season of respiratory illnesses. Experts suspect this mystery influenza-like illness found in Beijing and Liaoning Province of China could be due to pre-existing viruses like RSV, bacteria or atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma etc. (Also read | Winter raises pneumonia risk; protect your lungs with these lifestyle changes) China has reported an outbreak of mysterious influenza-like illness mostly among children recently. Children are presenting with high-grade fever without any other symptoms and further radiological investigations have revealed lung lesions. (Freepik) "China has reported an outbreak of mysterious influenza-like illness mostly among children recently. Children are presenting with high-grade fever without any other symptoms and further radiological investigations have revealed lung lesions. Some patients have been hospitalised for further management. There are numerous viruses such as Adenovirus, influenza virus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, RSV and Covid virus which can cause such symptoms. Important thing to be noted is that all viral infections do not necessarily cause the full spectrum of symptoms which we associate with common flu. Common symptoms of any viral infection are fever, with or without chills. There may be associated running nose, cough, SOB, vomiting and loose motions but it is not always necessary for additional symptoms to be there, says Dr Tushar Tayal, Consultant-- Internal Medicine at CK Birla Hospital Gurugram. "Recently, there has been a rise in pneumonia cases among children, particularly in certain areas of northern China, prompting concerns reminiscent of the events in November and December 2019. However, there is some relief as per a report from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Chinese government has clarified that these cases are attributed to known pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, including the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, some COVID cases, and some mycoplasma cases. Given that the incidence of pneumonia typically increases during winter, it is hoped that this surge is seasonal. According to the WHO report, the Chinese government has identified the causes of these pneumonia cases, ruling out the presence of any new viruses or bacteria. Consequently, there is no immediate risk of the situation spreading globally or reaching India. While there is a sense of reassurance, it is important to remain cautious," says Dr Sushila Kataria, Senior Director, Internal Medicine, Medanta, Gurugram. "According to WHO, in their November 13 press meeting, China's National Health Commission officials reported alarmingly large number of cases of respiratory diseases in the country. These infections are likely due to respiratory illnesses like influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection which typically affects younger children), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). This surge in childhood infections is being linked to co-incidence between lifting of lockdown restrictions and the start of winter, when such respiratory infections are more prevalent. On 21 November, media and ProMED (part of the International Society for Infectious Diseases) reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China. It is unclear if these cases are associated with the overall increase in respiratory infections previously reported by Chinese authorities, or separate events. Since mid-October, northern China has reported an increase in influenza-like illness compared to the same period in the previous three years, says Dr. Gurmeet Singh Chabbra, Director-Pulmonary, Marengo Asia Hospitals Faridabad. What are the symptoms of this mysterious pneumonia?"Pneumonia is a lung infection affecting one or both lungs leading to the filling of air sacs (alveoli) with fluid or pus caused by bacteria, viruses like RSV- respiratory syncytial virus, Adenovirus, Influenza, Rhinovirus, COVID and bacteria like Mycoplasma pneumonia. It is diagnosed based on symptoms like cough, breathing difficulty, fever additive symptoms like loose stool and vomiting in children and chest X-ray. Recently, there has been an upsurge of influenza-like illness cases in children from Beijing and Liaoning Province of China, named 'mysterious pneumonia', because definite cause is still under investigation. It could be any of the pre-existing viruses like RSV, bacteria or atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma etc. This 'mysterious pneumonia' presents with high-grade fever and abnormal chest radiograph with no or minimal cough," says Dr Dhirendra Pratap Singh, Consultant, PICU, Amrita Hospital, Faridabad. "RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) and mycoplasma pneumonia are thought to be the causes of this illness. They're usually called atypical pneumonia. Symptoms of this type of pneumonia are not as strong and include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, a cough that doesn't produce much phlegm, a sore throat, and a runny nose. This is why it's sometimes called 'walking pneumonia.' In contrast, regular bacterial pneumonia can make a person very sick with high temperatures, low blood pressure, and trouble breathing. The reason for this difference is that the germs causing these types of pneumonia are different. To prevent the quick spread of any infection, it's important to keep hands clean, avoid public transport and crowded places if you have symptoms, and get prompt medical attention for early diagnosis and the right antibiotics for a speedy recovery," says Dr Rupkatha Sen, Chief Intensivist, SRV Hospitals - Chembur. "The symptoms associated with this pneumonia include fever; however, notably, there is an absence of cough or breathlessness. This divergence from typical respiratory infections adds to the mystery surrounding the illness. The healthcare authorities are diligently investigating these cases, aiming to identify the responsible pathogen and establish effective management strategies. As the situation unfolds, continuous monitoring and research efforts are essential to comprehend the nature of this pneumonia and implement appropriate public health measures," says Dr Rajesh Chawla, Senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital Why classic symptoms of pneumonia may be missing in China outbreak?All symptoms of classical pneumonia may not manifest in every child depending upon age, co-existing comorbidity and cause of infection, says Singh. "This pneumonia outbreak can be attributed to 'immunity debt'- after lifting off of China’s lengthy lockdown in this peak season of respiratory illness which has drastically reduced immunity to respiratory bugs that is usually achieved by exposure. China reported a surge of Mycoplasma pneumonia or 'walking pneumonia', which, although usually presents itself as harmless, can also lead to challenges in respiration in some patients. It’s treated with macrolide antibiotics although macrolide resistance is increasing due to unnecessary misuse during any cold cough episode by the general population. It’s too early to comment on whether undiagnosed pneumonia is a new pandemic or an upsurge of existing infection until more information is available," says Dr Singh. "Possibly, withdrawal of restrictions after a prolonged period of lock down, exposed the Chinese population to number of respiratory infections. Having not been exposed to such respiratory infections since long, probably caused waning of their immunity to cope up with these infections, though some infections like mycoplasma pneumoniae and antigenically variable corona viruses themselves do not give prolonged immunity. Though lack of symptoms like cough is being reported, children are suffering from high fever and lung inflammation. Usually, such winter related infections have symptoms like sore throat, nasal discharge, sneezing, body ache, headache, chills with fever, cough which is usually dry, breathlessness, wheeze, confusion etc," says Dr Chhabra. "The absence of a cough or other classic respiratory symptoms in this pneumonia, despite the presence of fever in children, raises intriguing questions about the nature of the causative organism. It's important to note that fever is a symptom commonly associated with various infections, and different bacteria or viruses may manifest with distinct sets of symptoms. The possibility that the responsible organism for this pneumonia may not induce cough is not entirely unusual. Infections can present in diverse ways, and it's not uncommon for individuals to experience infections without displaying certain expected symptoms, such as coughing. This emphasizes the importance of considering a broad range of clinical presentations when investigating infectious diseases," says Dr Chawla. Preventive measuresDr Chhabra advises that as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission of such diseases, which spread from person to person by infected respiratory droplets during close contact, it is advisable to follow measures like keeping distance from people who are ill, staying home when ill, getting tested and medical care as needed, wearing masks as appropriate, ensuring good ventilation, regular hand-washing and getting vaccinated. "Like any communicable disease, personal protective measures will help limit the spread of this too- wearing masks, frequent hand washing, social distancing and staying at home when ill. It is advised to get the recommended vaccination, get tested for the disease and ensure medical care, and good ventilation. Another recommendation would be to not take antibiotics without paediatric consultation," says Dr Singh. "Preventive measures for the pneumonia spreading in China include adhering to crucial practices such as avoiding unnecessary travel, prioritizing personal hygiene, and maintaining a clean environment. Stressing the significance of frequent handwashing and practicing respiratory hygiene is paramount in minimizing the risk of infection. It's noteworthy that these preventive measures, including vaccination against influenza, play a pivotal role in controlling the spread of respiratory illnesses. Although the situation may not be as prevalent in India, being proactive in adopting these measures remains essential for safeguarding public health," says Dr Chawla. Should India worry about this mystery pneumonia spread?"In our own country, there may be an increase in influenza cases during the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, it is advisable to prioritize influenza vaccination and consistently practice cough etiquette to mitigate potential risks. Vigilance remains crucial despite the current understanding of the situation," says Dr Kataria. "We can assume that the etiological agent causing infection in Chinese children is a virus or some atypical bacteria, and proper research will be needed to find out the culprit organism so that it can be contained and effective strategies implemented. It is too early to say whether the current infection can become a pandemic or not and whether or not this infection will spread to India. WHO is already involved and is looking into the matter and has asked the Chinese govt to look into the matter. What is most important is to keep following personal protection in the form of 3 ply masks, frequent hand sanitization and social distancing," says Dr Tayal. "As of now, there isn't enough information right now to say that pneumonia outbreak in the northern China can escalate and spread to India. Though we've witnessed this pneumonia spreading in subgroups, we need to remember that this is the winter of the Northern Hemisphere. We have always witnessed increase in the number of cases during winter across the world. When it comes to winter cases, we need to find out what is causing this, and Is there really an actual reason behind the increase in numbers or not. Just reporting for flu cases or pneumonia cases is very common during winter. We really don't know if it's a mysterious pneumonia or regular. We need to have more concrete information before we go ahead and classify it as one, and as of yet there's no objective evidence," says Dr Rahul Pandit, Chairperson of the Critical Care Department at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai. "This is the first winter of China after lifting up of lockdown restrictions. They are now experiencing a sudden rise in cases of pneumonia which is primarily affecting clusters of children, leading to significant absenteeism in schools. At this point, there is no identified novel virus as the cause, making it premature to speculate about potential additional risks of infection spread that could lead to a pandemic-like situation," says Dr Sen.

Due to high temperatures in the Vegas valley, dog owners are having to wait till later in the evening or early in the morning to walk their dogs. By Emma Brocato Friday, Dec. 1, 2023 | 2 a.m. A highly contagious respiratory illness spreading among dogs across the county is causing concern with veterinarians and pet providers in Southern Nevada, who stress information is still limited on the infections and are advising residents to keep their dogs away from other canines. Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, eye discharge and fever, according to the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine. Most cases haven’t been severe, but infected dogs are lethargic and have intermittent loss of appetite. It could prove to be fatal, veterinarians say. The American Veterinary Medical Association said this week the disease has been reported in 14 states, including California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Nevada wasn’t included on the list — officially. But Chad Bower, the medical director at Legacy Animal Hospital in Henderson, saw four dogs with respiratory illness symptoms last week. And he worries this is just the beginning. “Our big concern is with all the holiday boarding and doggy daycare stuff,” Bower says. “That’s where the stuff is getting spread.” Bower says this widespread phenomenon of illness includes dogs with “a cough that doesn’t respond to medicine very well,” as well as a rising number of pneumonia cases in dogs. Bower says his theory is that it’s most likely not a brand-new disease but more likely several diseases circulating. He stresses the research on the respiratory ailment is still in progress. He is concerned that if canine influenza is the culprit, a previously unvaccinated dog that is just now receiving the primary vaccine series for canine influenza wouldn’t be fully protected until about six weeks later. “So canine influenza is fairly new. So dogs have no natural immunity to it at all, that’s the problem,” Bowers says. “So a dog that’s not vaccinated, if they come in contact with it, most likely it’s going to catch it.” But even if a dog became sick, “the vast majority of dogs that get infectious respiratory tract disease have uneventful recoveries. That’s as true now as it was a year or 10 years ago,” Scott Weese, a professor at University of Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College, wrote in a blog post. If your dog’s symptoms are severe, not improving or the pet has a risk factor, he said to take the dog to the vet. Bower recommends avoiding boarding facilities, doggy day cares and dog parks, since this is where “dog-to-dog contact” and “nose-to-nose” contact occur. “So right now, the key is don’t put your dog around other dogs,” Bower said. “You know, just (use) simple common sense, just like you would with your children.” Still, some dog owners have no other option but to board their pets — especially during December when holiday travel is prevalent. Family Paw, which provides grooming, boarding and daycare services in Henderson, is employing its usual sanitary precautions to a greater extent, such as disinfecting surfaces more often, general manager Ashley Miranda said. “We also don’t let any dogs in without their shot records,” she said. Family Paw requires their dog clients to be vaccinated against Bordetella (kennel cough), canine influenza, distemper-parvo and rabies. Puppies younger than 6 months old aren’t allowed. Miranda, too, recommends avoiding visits to the park with your dogs, since they might encounter unvaccinated dogs and could contract airborne illnesses. “I personally wouldn’t take my dog to the park right now,” Miranda said. “Maybe if you have a neighbor with a friendly dog, make like a playdate on your own without, you know, possibly exposing your dog to potential illnesses, especially if it’s airborne, you never know.” In addition to avoiding other dogs, veterinarians stress making sure your pet is up-to-date on vaccines, especially for kennel cough. The Nevada Department of Agriculture, which manages animal industries, echoed the advice from pet-care providers. In a statement the department said, “We recommend practicing good health safety practices with animals, keeping them up on their vaccines and taking them to a vet if they show any kinds of signs of illness.” Most Popular 1 Family’s advocacy helped get amendment to Nevada Constitution over finish line 2 Housing, entertainment, tax structure position Vegas to become a major player in tech world 3 Reconciliation underway between Jon Gruden, Bucs owners 4 Cybersecurity program at UNLV new but already among nation's best 5 Observe Veterans Day by standing up for those who defended our freedoms Scene on the Sun Nightlife: Gatsby’s Cocktail Lounge provides a nonstop party Dining: Barry’s Downtown Prime now serves a Thanksgiving feast Guide: Events listing Featured Galleries VGK vs Carolina Hurricanes UNLV Rebels Fall to Memphis Tigers 80-74 Rosen Declares Victory More photos » AP Headlines Loading Content...

Here is what you need to know.What is the virus?The virus is called influenza A(H1N2)v. It is similar to a strain of flu circulating in pigs in the UK. What do we know about the first case?A person in North Yorkshire visited their GP with breathing problems.They were diagnosed with the illness as part of routine national flu surveillance.It is not known how they caught the virus, and they are not known to have worked with pigs. Advertisement They had a mild illness and have now fully recovered.Close contacts of the case are being followed up by UKHSA and will be offered testing and treatment if they test positive.Have there been cases in other parts of the world?Yes and no.There have been 50 human cases of A(H1N2)v reported globally since 2005.However, none of them have been this exact strain.The UKHSA said this is a "distinct clade" which is different to the other human cases reported around the world, but similar to viruses in UK pigs.An 18-year-old in the US was diagnosed with A(H1N2)v in August after being in contact with pigs at an agricultural fair.No other cases were reported after that incident, and there was no human-to-human transmission.Is this swine flu? Bird flu? Both?This virus is not the same as H1N1, which caused the 2009 swine flu pandemic.H1N1 contained genetic material from viruses that were circulating in pigs, birds and humans in the 1990s and 2000s.It is no longer referred to as swine flu, and now circulates seasonally in humans. It is different from the viruses currently circulating in pigs.A(H1N2)v is a subtype of the influenza A virus. Influenza A viruses circulate in seven different species, including humans, birds and pigs, but normally stay within their species.Animal influenza viruses are distinct from human influenza viruses and do not easily transmit to and among humans, according to the World Health Organisation.A(H1N2)v is not linked to birds. The current dominant bird flu strain is H5N1 - of particular concern is the fact it has spread to mammals.Read more from Sky News:What is RSV?

The tragedy began during a global shortage of pharmaceutical grade propylene glycol (PG), leading a soap ingredient supplier to sell industrial grade ethylene glycol (EG) as PG. The fake PG was repackaged with a logo from a major supplier and sold to a distributor who provided it to Afi Farma's drug ingredient supplier. The contaminated syrup contained up to 99% EG, far exceeding the safety limit.Pope cancels Saturday activities because of mild flu - VaticanPope Francis cancels morning and private audiences due to mild flu; next public appearance is on Sunday for his weekly Angelus message; also scheduled to attend COP28 climate conference in Dubai from Dec. 1-3, with a day of bilateral meetings with world leaders.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksArvind Kejriwal Resignation LiveOne Nation, One ElectionPM Narendra Modi BirthdayRyan Wesley RouthKolkata Murder Hearing LiveHarvest Moon Lunar EclipseNorth Carolina RainfallTOP TRENDINGPutinPapua New GuineaMonday Night RawShimla Mosque ProtestsGK for StudentsSuper Bowl HalftimeKolkata Rape CaseVince McMahonHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesElon MuskTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteUPS vs NPS Calculator: Is A Switch From National Pension Scheme to Unified Pension Scheme Really A No-Brainer?

For example, Public Health Ontario’s latest flu surveillance report said the rate was 2.8 per cent as of Nov. 25 in that province.But Ontario and other provinces will soon catch up and those rates will increase, McGeer said. 1:58 Cold, flu, or COVID?

Story continues below advertisement “At the rate we’re going, there will be more people hospitalized with COVID and more people dying from COVID this year than last year,” McGeer said, noting that a low uptake of the new COVID XBB-variant vaccine is worrisome.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 1, 2023.Canadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

But people need to pay for the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for people aged 60.3 types of vaccines are available under provincial health systemAndrew Lam · CBC News · Posted: Dec 02, 2023 5:00 AM EST | Last Updated: December 2, 2023As people get older, they are at increased risk of respiratory infections said public health physician Dr. Ryan Sommers. (Hannah Beier/Reuters)Social SharingThis respiratory illness season, there are three publicly funded vaccines available to people aged 65 and older seeking greater protection: the high-dose influenza, COVID-19 and pneumococcal vaccines.After being primarily offered to people in licensed long-term care facilities, this is the first year people 65 or older can receive the high-dose flu vaccine for free. Dr. Ryan Sommers, a public health physician with Nova Scotia Health, said it's recommended that people in that age range receive the high-dose shot because it usually induces a better immune response. "As people get older, their immune system doesn't respond as well to vaccines," he said.Meanwhile, the pneumococcal vaccine protects against a type of bacteria that can cause lung infections — predominantly pneumonia — and can lead to hospitalization.Virus activity rises in Nova Scotia as vaccine appointments fill upPrimary care services coming to more Nova Scotia pharmaciesPeople can obtain flu vaccines from pharmacists and family doctors, while the COVID-19 vaccine is primarily accessed through pharmacies. Sommers said there is a new trial this year where a small number of family physician offices are beginning to offer COVID-19 shots. The pneumococcal shot can be administered by pharmacists, said Beverley Zwicker, CEO and registrar of the Nova Scotia College of Pharmacists. She said other than some travel vaccines which require extra certification "all vaccines are available for pharmacists to prescribe and to administer."Nova Scotians can also obtain the pneumococcal vaccine from family physicians and the province's primary care pharmacy clinics which opened in 2023, according to Sommers.He said all three of the publicly funded shots can be safely received together. People with a Nova Scotia health card can book COVID-19 and flu shot pharmacy appointments online. Those without health cards can still book and receive those shots for free by calling 1-833-797-7772.RSV vaccine not publicly funded in N.S.In August, Health Canada approved the first respiratory syncytial virus vaccine for people 60 and over. RSV is a common and contagious virus which can cause pneumonia for people with more vulnerable immune systems.However, Sommers said the shot is currently only available privately in the province, meaning people have to pay out-of-pocket or through their private health insurance. That's because the National Advisory Committee on Immunization — a national advisory committee that provides guidance on the use of vaccines in Canada — has yet to issue its recommendations. Health Canada approves 1st RSV vaccine for people 60 and older"We're waiting for that statement to determine if this will be added to the publicly funded list of vaccines," Sommers said. He recommends people seeking the RSV shot and other respiratory illness vaccines to speak with a doctor about the timing of the shot. In Ontario, which has begun rolling out a publicly funded RSV vaccine program, it is recommended that individuals receive their RSV shot 14 days before or after other vaccines.Zwicker said the new RSV vaccine is a "prescription-only" vaccine which pharmacists in the province can prescribe and administer.MORE TOP STORIES First PersonBeing forced to leave my home in Africville was hard.

Monday 27 November 2023 17:38, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:22 A new strain of swine flu has been found in a human in North Yorkshire for the first time Why you can trust Sky News A new strain of swine flu - similar to a flu virus currently circulating in pigs - has been detected in a human in the UK for the first time.The person was diagnosed with the infection - influenza A(H1N2)v - as part of routine national flu surveillance after visiting their GP in North Yorkshire with breathing problems, it is understood. The person involved is not known to have worked with pigs and has fully recovered.The source of the infection is still unknown and under investigation.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it is monitoring the situation closely and is taking steps to increase surveillance within existing programmes involving GP surgeries and hospitals. There have been a total of 50 human cases of influenza A(H1N2)v reported globally since 2005; but none of them are related genetically to this strain.H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are major subtypes of swine flu A viruses in pigs and occasionally infect humans.Based on early information, the UKHSA said the strain detected in the UK differs from recent human cases of H1N2 elsewhere in the world, but is similar to viruses in UK pigs. New swine flu strain found in British person: What we know A person in North Yorkshire has been diagnosed with a strain of flu similar to a virus circulating in pigs. As this is the first time the virus has been detected in humans in the UK - there are a number of questions the public will want the answers to. Is this swine flu? Bird flu? Both? Have there been cases in other parts of the world? What do we know about the first case? Find out all the answers here Meera Chand, incident director at UKHSA, said: "This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK, though it is very similar to viruses that have been detected in pigs." Advertisement Chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: "We know that some diseases of animals can be transferred to humans, which is why high standards of animal health, welfare and biosecurity are so important."Through our animal and human surveillance systems we work together to protect everyone."In this case we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation." Swine flue discovery doesn't mean we are on the edge of a pandemic - but scientists will want to understand more Thomas Moore Science correspondent @SkyNewsThomas Every time a virus jumps from animals into humans there is a shudder of alarm. So-called zoonotic diseases have resulted in pandemics in the past, most recently of course COVID. That's why the UK Health Security Agency is trying to work out how someone in Yorkshire has been infected with a strain of flu so similar to a virus circulating in pigs in the UK. We don't know much about the individual. But we do know they only had mild symptoms and fully recovered. And they didn’t work with pigs. That's the puzzle. Does it mean that the virus is circulating in people, undetected until now? Health authorities are tracing contacts of the infected person and are trying to identify the source. Flu normally crosses the species barrier by infecting people in close contact with animals. That's why people who work with chickens are checked for bird flu, which is caused by another strain of the virus. But even if there is a human case of an animal virus that's usually the end of the story. The virus isn't passed on because it's not well enough adapted to human cells to spread from person to person. Officially, there is no evidence of human transmission of the new swine flu virus. But it's hard to see an alternative explanation at the moment. That doesn't mean we are on the verge of a new pandemic. The strain could disappear as quickly as it emerged. But scientists will want to understand more about the virus to gauge how transmissible it is - and also to be sure it's not more of a risk to people who are vulnerable, either because of age or underlying health conditions. Pig-keepers have been urged to report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately.It is not known at this stage how transmissible the strain is or if there could be other cases in the UK.It is also too early to say if the strain could have pandemic potential.The UKHSA has notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) of the latest case.

Avian influenza is primarily a disease which affects birds and the risk to public health is very low. However, avian Influenza spreads rapidly between wild birds and commercial flocks. Northumberland County Council’s public protection team is working closely with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) North East and the Animal and Plant Health Agency to limit the risk of the disease spreading. A 3km protection zone and 10 km surveillance zone have been declared around the premises. Officers from the council’s public protection team are knocking on resident’s doors and farming premises within the protection zone to make them aware of the situation and identify any ‘backyard’ flocks that may need heightened protection. General advice to all bird keepers in this area is to undertake extra biosecurity measures to help limit the spread of the disease and keep flocks safe. This includes regularly cleaning and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles when entering or exiting sites and limiting access to non-essential workers or visitors. The team have also put signage in place around the main roads in and out of the protection zone to warn “Avian Flu Control Measure Protection Zone Ahead”. The purpose of these signs is to ensure that anyone coming into the area is made aware that Avian Influenza has been declared. This means that movement of poultry, captive birds and eggs can only take place with a licence from DEFRA. Councillor Gordon Stewart, cabinet member for Looking after our Communities said: “Trading Standards are working closely with APHA to ensure that the required control measures are in place for dealing with this incident of bird flu in the Milfield area. Foot patrols are underway to identify other captive birds and poultry in the vicinity with a view to helping keepers to protect them from the spread of the disease. “Bird keepers should ensure that they maintain good biosecurity on their premises and remain alert for any signs of disease. Where bird flu is suspected, is should be reported immediately and moving birds off your premises, even to seek veterinary assistance, should be avoided.” Gill O’Neil, Executive Director of Public Health at Northumberland County Council added: “I can reassure the public that this is a disease which affects birds, and the UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that the risk to human health is very low. It’s important to follow guidance about contact with wild birds. Please remember not to touch sick or dead birds and to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after contact with any other animal”. If you keep captive birds such as poultry, including as pets, and you suspect avian influenza you must report this to DEFRA on 0300 0200301. Any member of the public that comes across a dead or visibly sick wild birds are also advised not to touch them or pick them up and report the sighting to DEFRA on 03459 335577 (select option 7). Providing good location information for a dead or diseased bird is particularly important and location apps such as 'what3words', references can be very helpful.

Join the CLA Home CLA South West News Avian Influenza (bird flu) found in Devon Written by Sarah Wells-Gaston. First published on 30 Nov 2023. Following the latest confirmed case of avian influenza, members are reminded of their responsibilities. 🔗 Copy link to this section Avian influenza has become an annual issue UK poultry keepers have had to contend with in recent years. The current strain of avian influenza is highly pathogenic, highly contagious and is often fatal in birds.This has been particularly evident during the winter months, where a spike in cases has correlated with migrations of disease-carrying birds wintering in the UK, and cooler temperatures which enable the disease to thrive.Most recently in the South West, Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was confirmed in commercial poultry on 29 November 2023 at a premises near Cranbrook, East Devon. A 3km protection zone and a 10km surveillance zone have been declared around the premises.Any members who find themselves in a bird flu control zone must follow the rules for that zone and check if you need a licence to move poultry, poultry by-products, eggs, material or mammals.To protect the health and welfare of birds and limit the spread of the disease, good biosecurity is vital, and having a robust biosecurity policy is also now a mandatory requirement being made by insurers. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has produced guidance on how to spot and report avian influenza in poultry and other captive birds as well as guidance on how to prevent it and stop it spreading.As we enter the winter months, members keeping poultry should be vigilant, keeping a close eye on their birds for signs of disease, which include lethargy, unresponsiveness and a sudden and rapid increase in the number of birds found dead. Members should report signs of the disease to the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. Failure to do so is an offence.To ensure you are kept up with developments, we strongly recommend that all poultry keeping members subscribe to the Animal and Plant Health Agency email alerts.The spread of avian influenza is also having an impact on the game shooting community and British Game Assurance have produced a helpful Q and A.Keepers of more than 50 birds are also reminded that they are required to register their flocks, whether they’re of a single species or a combination of different ones. Non-compliance of registering could result in a fine up to £5,000. Registrations of flocks below this threshold is also advised.

The government agency in charge of protecting public health - the UKHSA - has now shared the full timeline of how events unfolded. It begins on Thursday 9 November, with a trip to see a GP.But the person seeking help will have caught it days before that.It takes about one to four days for symptoms to emerge. The patient went to their doctor complaining of "typical" flu symptoms, meaning they were probably feeling exhausted, with a temperature, cough and sore throat. How did they get it?It is still a mystery how they caught it - they have since confirmed that they do not work with pigs or keep any as pets.During the visit, the GP did a swab test. These are not routine in every surgery - only some practices do them and they are to help the UKHSA monitor population health rather than to diagnose individual patients. The results help experts keep checks on what diseases are circulating and how well vaccines are doing against them. That sample was sent off and processed in the usual way, which takes about two weeks. So, it was on the evening of Thursday 23 November - a fortnight after the GP visit - that experts in a UKHSA lab discovered it was a new virus.What is it?Officials are calling it influenza A(H1N2)v rather than swine flu.It is a type of flu - like the winter illness many people get vaccinated against - but it is a bit different. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Viruses can jump between speciesIt is almost identical to one circulating in pigs in the UK at the moment, rather than the type humans normally get. Pigs can sometimes spread flu viruses to people, but that is rare. It is usually the other way round.The UKHSA's chief scientific officer, Prof Isabel Oliver, told the media earlier this week: "We do know that occasionally we identify viruses like this one that are present in pigs, so often referred to as swine flu viruses. Occasionally there are cases detected in humans."There has been one similar but not identical human "swine flu" case in the US this year, external, and about 50 cases reported globally since 2005. Could it take off in a big way in humans now? According to experts, although it could take off in humans, this is unlikely. They are keeping a close watch to see what risk, if any, this latest case may pose to the wider population.This first and - so far - only UK case was a mild one, although the person's symptoms were nasty enough for them to seek medical help.They have since made a full recovery, but that fact alone does not really tell us anything about the transmission potential of the virus or the risk to vulnerable groups, says Dr Andrew Catchpole, a virus expert who works for a research organisation called hVIVO. "Details on the age and the overall health status of the infected person have not been released, so we do not know if this was an otherwise healthy individual whom we would expect to recover from flu without intervention," he said.As soon as UKHSA got the test results back, it contacted the individual concerned and their close contacts. Fortunately, the person had not been out at any big events, so did not have a vast number of contacts to trace.These contacts were advised that they could potentially be infectious and should self-isolate pending a negative test result, the UKHSA told BBC News.However, there is no sign yet that the virus has or will spread easily between people. Typically viruses acquired from pigs do not spread easily from person to person. But the UKHSA says it will continue to investigate. Dr Will Welfare, UKHSA Incident Director, said: "This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK. As soon as we get such a result, we immediately start work with partners to learn everything we can about it. Our investigation is continuing at pace and we will publish further information in due course."It's thanks to our routine surveillance and genome sequencing that we have been able to detect this virus, putting us in a stronger position to understand its characteristics and reduce any potential spread."Virus expert Dr Andrew Catchpole says pigs are a common source of newly emerging flu strains, because they can catch flu viruses from humans and birds which then mix and make new versions. Generally, however, these are not able to replicate and transmit efficiently in people.Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says it is right to be cautious: "Although these events usually result in viruses that struggle to transmit in their new hosts, there is always a danger that they can. These events need to be carefully investigated."Could it cause a pandemic?Prof Isabel Oliver said that while there may have been some limited spread between people, that is entirely different to a big outbreak. "So far this is the only confirmed case. We are working to understand how this person acquired the infection... We have not identified a source of infection but our investigations continue," she said.In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by an influenza virus commonly referred to as "swine flu". That was a different virus called influenza A H1N1(pdm09). It contained genetic material from viruses that were circulating in pigs, birds and humans in the 1990s and 2000s.It is no longer called swine flu and is now one of the many different flu viruses which circulate in people each year. The current annual flu shots that are offered on the NHS protect against it. The vaccines are not expected to provide much protection against the new virus that has just been found. New vaccines can be made though, if they are ever needed.

Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email James Baxter had 192,000 birds culled at his farm in January, following a positive AI test. For the first time, he has told his story publicly. Scottish egg producer, James Baxter, set out the bleak reality of dealing with an AI infection to farmers attending Europe’s largest free range egg show in November. Baxter, who farms near Stranraer on the west coast, and is also the chairman of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association (BFREPA), spoke publicly for the first time about losing almost 200,000 hens in 12 houses to a mandatory cull following a positive test in January. He was one of the keynote speakers at BFREPA Live 23, held on 15 November at the Telford International Centre. Baxter’s talk covered his experience of avian influenza, from losing an entire flock, to how he sees his business recovering, as well as the lessons learnt. His story began in January, when Baxter and his wife had enjoyed three days away from the farm, leaving their three sons Andrew, Jonathan and David back home in charge. On his way home, Baxter’s son Andrew phoned to say there was an issue with the hens in house seven. The hens were 20 weeks old and in full lay. 79 hens were dead, and they were showing “strange lethargic behaviour” and there were eggs scattered around the shed. “Many times, we had asked ourselves how we would know,” said Baxter. He called the vet, and reported the hens had no energy and were not eating or drinking. “I was on my way home and thinking the worst.” Colin, his stockman, reported there had been an unusual smell in the house the previous day, which Baxter said might have been an early warning sign. “There was absolutely no doubt something was wrong.” At this stage, he also decided to call in the services of Livetec, which produced a detailed plan in the event AI was confirmed. On the advice of Livetec, Baxter cancelled two feed lorries and an egg collection lorry that were both on their way. They never arrived on farm, and Baxter said that one decision saved the farm and Noble Foods a lot of money. The vet assessed the hens. Lots of them were quivering and had their eyes closed. They also had red colouration on their legs. The vet was 90% sure it was AI. “It was time to call APHA,” said Baxter. “APHA said they would be on farm at 9am the next day.” That evening Baxter’s wife Margaret collated all information in the contingency plan. It contained every little detail about how a cull would be managed, down to the location of temporary toilets and where people would park. “The kitchen table was piled with stuff,” said Baxter. “The wheels were starting to turn.” The phone kept ringing, but several calls stuck out. Graham Atkinson and Sarah Dean, both of Noble Foods, phoned to ask what could they do. “These calls were very important, because we were starting to feel the pressure,” said Baxter. Livetec also played an important role. “They guided us through and kept our men busy and involved,” says Baxter. “There is nobody better on farm than the people who work there.” Mid-morning the next day, three people from APHA arrived. Baxter and his team were warned there would be substantial paperwork and it might mean samples that could confirm the presence of AI would not be taken until the following day. However, thanks to the contingency plan put together by Livetec, they already knew where everything would go. “One hour later, the vet was ready to take the samples.” This was valuable, because speed is important for the welfare of the hens and also for the valuation of the hens still alive, which determine how much compensation is received. Addressing producers in the audience, Baxter reflected on the speed with which everything on his farm had been upended, thanks to suspicion of AI. “Your whole life changes,” he said. “APHA takes over.” Samples were collected from dead and dying birds, and a courier took them. off to Weybridge. “We waited for the inevitable results,” said Baxter. Baxter said Mark Williams of the BEIC, told everybody at last year’s BFREPA conference that you must behave at all times as if the virus is already on your farm and you need to keep it out of the shed. “That is policy we used.” He described the biosecurity protocols on the farm. There are three levels of biosecurity before anybody can access the hens. The first is a foot dip. After that there is a step over barrier where clothes are changed. Then in order to access the hens there is a further step over barrier. Together with the APHA staff, Baxter said he tried to work out how house seven could be vulnerable. He observed pigeons sitting on the chimney of house seven and none of the other houses. “That house is covered in solar panels and they only wanted to sit on that roof,” he said. A few days before, the farm had had two inches of snow. “This would have landed on chimney lid and then melted and dripped viral soup via the fan onto the hens two metres under the chimney,” said Baxter. “We 100% believe that’s how AI got onto our farm.” Three days in from the initial call to the vet, Baxter still had to manage a farm where 11 other sheds were still producing eggs flat out. So, the packing continued, while mortality in house seven continued to rise. Baxter said at this point, on day three, the hens in house seven had gone almost completely silent. The APHA vet arrived and organised licences for movements and health checked other 11 sheds, which were completely fine. “We did the final count ready for culling if we had AI. At 4.20pm the phone rang, and confirmed AI. All 12 sheds were to be culled.” “We had a lot of calls from farming people, which was really appreciated,” said Baxter. “We also made the front page of local paper,” which he noted, was not appreciated in the same way. “We were not getting a lot of sleep now.” The following day, security men turned up, wearing full camo kit, including stab vests. “We were the most secure farm in area.” Baxter said he didn’t really appreciate the value of having a security crew at the farm’s entrance points, until a group of ramblers turned up insisting they had the right to walk through the farm. They were promptly turned away. On day four at 2pm the culling began. A company from the Netherlands called Vaneck arrived with lorry loads of carbon dioxide. They began gassing the birds. Fortunately, the farm’s sheds were new and airtight. “We shut the chimney vents as tight we we could. For a site our size, the process was very quick,” said Baxter. “Within six minutes, 90% of the hens were dead,” and within 30 minutes, the process was complete. “The hens were not stressed by it and it was very efficient and easy,” he said. The following day, carcase pickers arrived, and 1.5 million eggs went to go with the hens for rendering. Two doctors also arrived on the site, in order to assess the staff, none of whom were unwell. After that, the cleaning began. All the sheds underwent primary cleaning and disinfection, and all the fibre trays were disposed of. “Anything we could not pressure wash or disinfect had to be burned,” he said. Inside of a fortnight, everything had changed on the farm. “We had gone from flat-out to nothing. And all we had was two pieces of paperwork and an IOU from the government. I told staff to have a week off so we could come to terms with what had happened.” After everything was done that could be done, the last people to leave were the security men. On day 20, the Scottish government paid compensation for all the culled hens into Baxter’s bank account. The farm must be empty of poultry for a year, meaning Baxter can restock on 8 February 2024. He said he has been using the time to upgrade lighting and lay new concrete. Looking back, he said the shock of becoming an IP was “overwhelming”, but having contingency planning in place had lessened the burden, both practically and for everybody’s mental wellbeing. “All the practical decisions were made in peacetime,” he said. It meant everyone could move quickly, which was important for the hens’ welfare and for compensation purposes. “Dead hens don’t get compensated for”. Today, new pullets are in rear, ready for February. “Millions of pigeon spikes” are being installed on the shed roofs and an automatic vehicle disinfection system is being put in. “We are doing the best we can,” he concluded.

Debbie James 29 November 2023 https://www.fwi.co.uk More in BroilersHealth and welfareLayersOther poultryPoultry Why avian flu vaccine rollout would cost £1.5k/shed a month Debbie James 28 November 2023 >More in BroilersHealth and welfareLayersOther poultryPoultry © Tim Scrivener Vaccinating UK poultry flocks for avian influenza has been described as “cost prohibitive” because an EU surveillance requirement for swabbing and testing would set producers back £1,000-£1,500/month for every shed housing immunised birds. The true cost of vaccination was revealed for the first time at the British Free Range Egg Producers Association’s (BFREPA) 2023 National Free Range Show in Telford. See also: Livestock disease insurance – what to look for in policies Although the cost of the vaccine itself and its administration are unlikely to be high, the EU has set a high bar for its trading partners on testing flocks to ensure there are no “silent” infections circulating in vaccinated flocks. Gordon Hickman, head of exotic disease control at Defra, says surveillance is the “real killer” in relation to the cost benefit of vaccination. “If we follow the requirements the EU has set out for intra- and third-country trading, it is very, very prohibitive in terms of cost,” he says. Surveillance requirements It would demand monthly visits from a vet to take 60 samples from every shed because each is classed as a separate epidemiological unit; these samples would be tested at a government-approved laboratory. In addition, producers would have to have their first five or 10 dead birds tested weekly, for the lifetime of the vaccinated flock. “In your longer-lived production situations, that is every week from the point that you vaccinate,” Gordon explains. Although Defra supports vaccination “provided it is properly managed, properly administered, we have a good surveillance strategy and our trading partners agree that it is the right thing to do”, he says the department is not yet able to recommend it. It is likely that producers would pick up the tab for vaccination unless the virus became a threat to human health. Although 91% of eggs produced in the UK supply the domestic market, the UK has important overseas markets for the sale of primary breeder chicks, hatching eggs and meat and egg products. This means the needs of trading partners would have to be met before a significant vaccine programme could be rolled out. If that does happen, vaccines are likely to be given to day-old chicks in the hatchery. Two doses may be needed in long-lived birds such as layers, ducks and turkeys, with the second dose given at transfer. Vaccine suitability The biggest challenge with developing a vaccine for avian influenza is that the virus is constantly mutating. This means vaccines developed now may not be effective against future strains. This could cause problems in multi-age sites, because birds may not be vaccinated for the most current strain. However, vet Ian Lowery, a partner of Crowshall Veterinary Services and consultant vet to the British Egg Industry Council, says some vaccines being used by other countries are proving effective. “There is no perfect vaccine, no vaccine that ticks all those boxes for us, but there are vaccines that we can work with, [and] relatively quickly if we need to.” How the cost would be shared within the industry would also need to be addressed. “If a layer farm vaccinated, some significant benefit would be realised by the broiler or duck farm down the road, but that is quite hard to rationalise. “How do we cost-share that between the various sectors that may not choose to vaccinate, but will fundamentally benefit on the back of it?” There is also a risk that if the government sanctions vaccination, insurers are likely to demand that their policyholders vaccinate. Producer verdict A poll of poultry producers at the conference reflected current opinion on vaccination. Before producers were advised of the cost and other considerations, a show of hands confirmed about 90% would consider vaccinating their own flocks; when they were later polled, not a single producer appeared to support it. Case study A Scottish egg producer whose entire flock of 192,000 layers was culled after birds tested positive for avian flu recommends that every farm should have a disease contingency plan. James Baxter, who farms with his wife, Margaret, and sons, Andrew, Jonathan and David, near Stranraer, says their professionally designed plan was vital in securing an early payout from the Scottish government’s compensation scheme. “It is an invaluable resource in a time of crisis,” James says. “It makes you think about disease during ‘peacetime’, when your head is clear. “It makes business sense; it keeps you up to date with current practice too.” Source of infection The Baxters have 12 sheds on their farm and believe the infection was introduced by pigeons roosting on the chimney of one shed topped with solar panels. It had snowed seven days before the first cases appeared, creating a “viral soup” around the chimney when the snow melted. “We believe that’s how avian flu got into our farm,” says James. The disease was detected in only one of the sheds, where a mortality rate of 3.3% was experienced, but it required every bird on the farm to be culled. “In just two weeks, we went from flat out to nothing. All we had was two pieces of paperwork and an IOU from the Scottish government,’’ he says. At day 20, the business received full compensation from the Scottish government. Contingency plan He advises other producers to have contingency planning in place. “For us, it meant we got sound advice on day one on how this situation would progress, so we knew what was coming.” He diverted egg collection lorries and a 54t feed delivery. “We would have had 28 pallets of eggs if the collection lorries had come, only for them to be destroyed, whereas we were compensated for them through our insurance scheme, probably saving us £30,000.” It also speeded up the paperwork trail, which advanced the valuation process by a day. “You don’t get compensated for dead hens, but by moving the valuation forward more quickly, I would say that we saved 4,000-5,000 hens that we would not have been valued on.” Insurance James admits that the shock of becoming an infected premises was overwhelming. “Planning is essential for your mental wellbeing and the eventual recovery of your business,” he suggests. He also urges producers to notify their insurer every time there is a change in the egg price. “If the egg price goes up, get straight onto your insurance company if you are insured for loss of income. “There is a vague mention of price trends in insurance policies like mine, but there is a lot of wriggle room in that, and insurance companies do like a bit of wiggle room. That probably cost me £500,000.” He accepted a settlement offer from his insurer after 240 days. The Baxters will be back in production on 8 February 2024, having opted to not restock for 12 months. In the meantime, they are fitting spikes onto shed roofs to deter pigeons and other birds from future perching.

The case of influenzaA(H1N2)v virus was detected as part of routine national flu surveillance undertaken by UKHSA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). The individual was tested by their GP after experiencing respiratory symptoms. The patient experienced a mild illness and has fully recovered although the source of their infection has not yet been confirmed and is still under investigation. British Veterinary Association President Anna Judson said: "Reports that the new AH1N2v swine flu strain has been found in a person in the UK are concerning, but this is so far an isolated case with mild symptoms and the patient has made a full recovery. However, this shows that zoonotic diseases, which can transfer from animals to people, do pose a threat to human health and so vigilance and good biosecurity is key. It highlights the crucial role of disease surveillance and the importance of state veterinary services in protecting both animal and human populations from emerging diseases. Farmers and frontline vets also play a vital role in the early detection of diseases and effective disease monitoring.” More information can be found here - Swine influenza: how to spot the disease Share: Most read news New British Veterinary Association President calls for animal welfare alongside client choice to be at the heart of CMA recommendations 26 Sep 2024 Latest on Bluetongue: New vaccine guidance for vets 18 Sep 2024 More on News Contact our media office (for press enquiries only) 020 7908 6340 (phone line open 9-5pm Monday-Friday) 07503 190 247 (Out of hours) [email protected] Want to join BVA?

The district reported a total of 107 H1N1 cases between January 1 and November 28, as per the official data.The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) registered 10 deaths â five men and five women, all in their 60s â said officials from the health department.Rest of the deceased belong to other districts or other states. The deceased too were above 40 years of age and immunocompromised.Civic officials said this year the H1N1 impact has been mild. Over 325 swine flu cases were recorded last year. The civic body has procured over 500 doses of flu vaccine for immunizing high-risk groups such as healthcare workers, pregnant women, and elderly persons with comorbidities.Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, expert committee member on Indian guidelines on influenza vaccination, said influenza has two peaks â one in monsoon and one in winter â in India. He warned of a rise in the number of cases in the coming day. âDecember and January are likely to see more cases of respiratory distress,â he said.Dr Swarnakar added that people must be made aware of vaccination. âSwine flu or any influenza basically affects elderly people or patients having comorbidities. It can be easily prevented. Influenza vaccination is regarded as the most important intervention that can prevent the development of influenza illness and its complications. Every year, the strain changes as the flu virus is known to mutate. The new vaccines come around July-September. Before winter, people must get vaccinated for swine flu,â Dr Swarnakar said.Officials said the disease can be easily managed if patients report early. âBut it gets aggravated if there is a delay. It starts with a cold and cough, itchy throat, and body ache. These symptoms must not be taken lightly by comorbid people,â officials said.We also published the following articles recentlyFollow Covid protocol, says health official amidst new influenza strainGoa has not received guidelines from the health ministry regarding the virus cocktail in China. However, the state advises people to avoid self-medicating and instead follow regular Covid protocols. State epidemiologist Dr Prashant Suryavanshi emphasizes the importance of reporting to a health center or hospital as soon as possible in case of fever or illness. He also highlights the significance of early diagnosis and assessment by a doctor. Additionally, Suryavanshi recommends regular handwashing, mask-wearing in crowded places, and following universal precautions for any viral disease, not just Covid-19.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 things that make Areca Palm the perfect indoor plantLifestyleSoaked moong dal benefits: 10 benefits for eating this energy powerhouse for breakfastLifestyleHow to make South Indian stye Paneer Dosa at homeFoodThe 8 perfect steps to grow âDhaniyaâ in the kitchen gardenLifestyle10 baby girl names that sound royalLifestyle15 Indian states and their famous state animalstravel10 delicious Indian dishes that can be made with raw bananaFoodHow to make protein-rich Lahori Paneer KormaFood8 fruits and veggies that can help get rid of eye glassesLifestyle10 green vegetables that have highest protein contentLifestyle Next123 Photostories 5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationshipsFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by Govindaâ10 most educated countries of the worldâThe Great Indian Kapil Show 2:From high-end car collection to net worth, lavish apartment, farmhouse and more: Luxurious life of Kapil SharmaAnimal Park, Dhoom 4, Ramayana: 5 upcoming blockbuster movies of Ranbir KapoorWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom their moving-in together plans to Krishna Mukherjee hinting at the Bigg Boss couple'swedding next year;

It is not known at this stage how transmissible the new strain, named H1N2, is, or if there could be other cases in the UK, scientists said.

"In accordance with established protocols, investigations are underway to learn how the individual acquired the infection and to assess whether there are any further associated cases.”Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer, added: "In this case we are providing specialist veterinary and scientific knowledge to support the UKHSA investigation."Pig keepers must also report any suspicion of swine flu in their herds to their local vet immediately."In 2009, there was a pandemic in humans caused by flu strain H1N1, commonly referred to as swine flu. The H1N1 strain was first detected in April of that year in North Amercia but quickly spread across the US and worldwide.By the time the WHO declared it a pandemic in June 2009, it had spread to 74 countries and territories.It killed 457 people in the UK. But it now circulates in humans seasonally, is included in the flu jab, and is not referred to as 'swine flu'.The WHO declared the pandemic was over in August 2010.Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: “It’s very unlikely the single case of H1N2 swine flu reported today represents anything more than has been seen in the past.“And although a single case may not be representative, the fact the individual concerned had a mild infection that resolved without hospitalisation is also in keeping with previous experience.“We should remember that surveillance programmes can discover infections that might never have been noticed based on case numbers or severity, so a level of reasoned tolerance has to be applied. Not every new agent is a threat.”READ MORE SUN STORIESFLIGHT TRAGEDY Ryanair passenger dies on flight to Manchester as 'chaos' erupts on planeWHAT A FINISH!

These can occasionally infect people usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. "No cases of variant influenza A (H1N2)v have been notified in Ireland," a HSE spokesman said. They also issued advice for anyone who might be at risk. “People in close, regular contact with pigs, poultry or water fowl should maintain awareness of influenza symptoms and stay at home if they have symptoms consistent with flu,” he said.“They should avoid contact with persons in risk groups for influenza and contact their GP if their symptoms worsen or if they are in an at-risk group for flu.” What's your view on this issue? You can tell us here The usual respiratory precautions are advised in terms of covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands with soap or alcohol-based hand gels.“Vaccination remains the best protection against influenza and is recommended for people who have close contact with pigs, poultry and water fowl,” he said.In England, the UK Health Security Agency said the first detection of this strain of flu in a human was made during a routine national flu surveillance.The person, living in North Yorkshire, had been tested by their GP and this sample underwent genome sequencing.

It probably looked extremely cool, but nobody looked up, because I’d been coughing for days and everyone was sick of me. Several hours later someone asked if I was okay. “Yeah, fine!” I croaked.I don’t get ill a lot, so every time it happens I am both caught off-guard and absolutely livid. How dare my throat – normally so smooth and problem-free when I use it for useful things like talking over films and tutting at litter – turn into this raw, painful organ, both rough and metallic, like steel velcro? Damned man flu.Man flu – a subject as difficult to avoid as the condition itself – is in the news again, as another expert claims to have proof that men do feel the symptoms of colds more. How To Stay Healthy, by nutritionist and This Morning regular Jenna Hope, says that it’s all down to differences in hormone ratios in men and women.While both have the three sex hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone, women’s higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone boost their immunity, while men’s higher levels of testosterone suppress theirs. This means that in a heteronormative couple who contract the same wintery virus, the man is likely to experience worse headaches and congestion.(It’s worth pointing out, before any dudes start feeling too hard done by, that this super-primed immune system comes at a cost: autoimmune disorders are much more common in women.)As a man, there’s something quite appealing about the idea that you don’t feel rubbish because you’re weak, you feel rubbish because you’re simply so manly. “Man flu” sounds so much more badass and dramatic than the less exciting-sounding condition “a bit of a cold”. You only feel that way because you’re so full of testosterone? Cool! Read NextLifestyleHow I saved my health after 20 years burned out by workRead MoreBut there’s surely more to this. It may be true that men’s physiology makes them more vulnerable to the symptoms of a virus. But most women spend decades putting up with periods, feeling like crap for at least a few days every month, so a seasonal virus might arguably need to be a bit more hardcore to really make a noticeable impact. Having never been pregnant, my parameters for “feeling a bit off today” are extremely different to the parameters of people who have. Masculinity and certain difficult-to-shift ideas about what being a man involves certainly play a part as well. The most indoorsy, unlumberjackesque of men can still sometimes feel like unless they are actively on fire or their intestines have completely fallen out, they need to just get on with it. Anything beyond gritted teeth and stoically pressing on could look weak or make you a burden on others. This can lead men, on the occasions that they are stopped by illness, to maybe inject a teeny-weeny bit of exaggeration and hyperbole into proceedings to justify having a break. I’m never going to cancel plans because I feel a bit poorly. I’ll make it clear, if I’m ill, that I can literally see the outline of the Grim Reaper in the corner of the room, and think some of my major organs have already liquified. I have a friend who affects a gravelly voice whenever he has any kind of health problem or physical ailment, just to make it abundantly clear to everyone around him that he’s feeling under the weather. Even if it isn’t a condition that could plausibly affect his voice, he still does it to elicit sympathy. He might be telling you he dropped a chair on his foot, but he’ll use the voice Batman would use if he said he was getting divorced, just so everyone really gets it.Whatever the science says about man flu, perhaps the ongoing battle of who feels illness symptoms more does us all greater harm than good. Instead of focusing on a gendered oneuppersonship (yeah? thanks) about whether men or women have it worse during flu season, are we better off just trying to help one another out?Winter sucks, being ill sucks. If someone feels rough, they don’t need an in-depth conversation about hormones, they need a cup of tea and a box of tissues.

Dahil sa mostly nga po severe ang pneumonia nila, hindi po sila basta-basta rin makapasok sa loob ng ospital dahil ang ICU po ay puno din," said Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokesperson.(The problem is of course when intubated, the treatment takes a long time. Because their pneumonia is mostly severe, they can't just enter the hospital because the ICU is also full.)Del Rosario said the symptoms of pneumonia include difficulty in breathing, chest pain, and persistent fever.There are infants and elderly patients confined in the hospital."Ang nababawasan naman po ng kama o opportunity, ay 'yung mga may cancer, na-stroke, inatake sa puso, dialysis. E 'yung pneumonia sana, ang aming pakiusap sa mga LGU hospitals, sila na po ang umako, para po mapagbigyan natin 'yung talagang mga makaka-avail po ng specialty services ng PGH," he added. (The ones who are losing beds or opportunities are those who have cancer, stroke, heart attack, dialysis. But pneumonia, our request to the LGU hospitals, to take it upon themselves, so that we can accommodate them. So we give way to those who can really avail of PGH's specialty services.) In the first three months of 2023, there were 41,497 cases of pneumonia recorded in the country while more than 201,798 cases were recorded in 2022.These are various types of infectious diseases caused by different viruses or bacteria with the following symptoms: sore throat, colds, headache, muscle pain, chills, malaise, vomiting, and diarrhea.Del Rosario said it would be a big help if both children and adults would get the pneumococcal vaccine, which is a defense against the most common source of pneumonia - Streptococcus pneumonia.Influenza-like illnessThe health department also observed an increase in influenza-like illnesses (ILI) as we enter the ber-months.The recorded cases from January to October 13 this year is 45% higher compared to those recorded in the same period last year. Although the increase in cases has slowed down by November, taking precautions such as wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated is advised.Immunity gapAccording to Dr. Rontgene Solante, an infectious disease specialist, apart from the change in weather, the increase in respiratory illnesses is possibly caused by the so-called immunity gap."Ang immunity gap is a global phenomenon 'yan, because after the pandemic, yung mga vaccine-preventable diseases, kasama na diyan 'yung influenza, pneumonia, measles. Talagang bumababa ang vaccination coverage doon sa mga vulnerable population, including children," he said. (The immunity gap is a global phenomenon, because after the pandemic, the vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza, pneumonia, measles. The vaccination coverage is actually decreasing among vulnerable populations, including children.) — Sherylin Untalan/BAP, GMA Integrated News Tags: pneumonia, Philippine General Hospital, PGH, influenza-like illness, immunity gap More Videos Most Popular LOADING CONTENT LOAD MORE ARTICLES RETRY LOADING ◀ All Rights Reserved 2024 © GMA Network Inc.

The public health body says this remains stable and within the expected range for this time of year. There are also high rates of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (RSV) virus in children, which causes cold-like symptoms including coughing, sneezing, runny nose and sometimes fever. Other viruses circulating include rhinovirus and Covid. There were 134 surveillance samples from patients collected by GPs and community pharmacies in the most recent week. Of the 134 samples, 28 tested positive for rhinovirus, 14 for RSV, eight for mycoplasma, seven for SARS-CoV2, six for enterovirus, five for hMPV, two for adenovirus, one for bocavirus, one for influenza A(H3), one for influenza B.. People across the UK have been experiencing a "brutal" cold that feels like a flu and can last for weeks.

Many have taken to social media to share their symptoms and experiences. One person took to Reddit and wrote: "Just coming off the back end of a brutal cold that's lasted about three weeks, during which my sinuses have been almost completely closed, relaxing only for brief periods while also producing mucus at an alarming rate." They added: "Emerging from my bed this morning, I could breathe through my nose again. I could smell things. It still feels like somebody poured Ready Brek into the back of my face, but it's finally over and life is beautiful again." Another one replied with: "Currently on day 5 of it. Feel absolutely lousy. So much mucus it's ridiculous. Already feeling anxious about having to call in sick again tomorrow but I refuse to go back to work until I'm well enough. Won't get thanked for going in and certainly won't get thanked by colleagues if I spread this around. Just hoping I'm all clear for Christmas. Get well soon everyone." Others took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to talk about their illness. One posted: "It’s getting harder to get out of bed but needs must. Still got the dreaded lurgy so not feeling 100%.” Another added: “How it started vs how it is going. I had my combined Covid/ flu vaccine yesterday and already had a touch of the lurgy. Now I have full blown girl flu and feel dreadful." According to the NHS, such colds include symptoms such as a cough, where you may bring up mucus (also known as phelgm), sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, a sore throat, headaches, muscle aches, breathlessness, a tight chest or wheezing, high temperature and feeling generally unwell. Here's everything you need to know to help you if you're currently experiencing a cold: What can help me treat it? A pharmacist can suggest treatments to help relieve your symptoms, such as decongestants and nasal sprays. The NHS says people can also buy cough medicines and throat lozenges, "although there’s little evidence to show they help" they've added. What's the advice on the things I can do for myself? The NHS recommends that you: get plenty of rest drink lots of water to loosen any mucus and make it easier to cough up drink a hot lemon and honey drink to help soothe a cough (not suitable for babies under 1 year old) gargle with warm salty water if you have a sore throat (children should not try this) raise your head up while sleeping using extra pillows to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus use painkillers to bring down a fever and help ease a sore throat, headaches and muscle pain What are the things that I shouldn't do? Whatever you do, you must not: do not let children breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water as there’s a risk of scalding do not give aspirin to children under 16 do not smoke – it can make your symptoms worse Join the WalesOnline WhatsApp community WalesOnline has launched a new breaking news and top stories WhatsApp community.
