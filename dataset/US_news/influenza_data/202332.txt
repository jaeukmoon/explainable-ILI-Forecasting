Their induction via peptide vaccination is not trivial, because peptides are weakly immunogenic. One strategy to overcome this is by vaccination with chemically enhanced altered peptide ligands (CPLs), which have improved MHC-binding and immunogenicity. It remains unknown how peptide-modification affects the resulting immune response. We studied the effect of CPLs derived from the influenza M158–66 epitope (GILGFVFTL) on the T-cell response. In HLA-A2*0201 transgenic mice, CPL-vaccination led to higher T-cell frequencies, but only a small percentage of the induced T cells recognized the GILG-wildtype (WT) peptide. CPL-vaccination resulted in a lower richness of the GILG-WT-specific T-cell repertoire and no improved protection against IAV-infection compared to GILG-WT peptide-vaccination. One CPL even appeared to enhance pathology after IAV-challenge. CPL-vaccination thus induces T cells not targeting the original peptide, which may lead to potential unwanted side effects.

Traditional influenza vaccines induce humoral immune responses against the highly variable viral surface proteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)1, which are relatively narrow and therefore mainly strain-specific. Via mutations in these surface proteins (antigenic drift), IAV can escape previously induced immunity. In contrast to humoral immune responses, cellular immune responses are often directed against more conserved parts of the virus. Cellular immunity may therefore provide cross-protection against seasonal drifting strains and against newly emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potential. This is corroborated by the observation that individuals with pre-existing IAV-specific T-cell immunity have an immunological advantage resulting in (partial) protection upon encounter with a new IAV infection2,3,4. Therefore, induction of cellular responses against the more conserved parts of the virus is of great interest for the design of new, broadly-reactive vaccines against IAV.One way to induce cellular responses is via peptide vaccination. Peptides alone, however, tend to be weak immunogens. To overcome this, different approaches to induce robust T-cell responses by peptide-based vaccination have been tested, including i) vaccination with long synthetic peptides to simultaneously activate CD8+ and CD4 + T-cells5, ii) the use of strong adjuvants or immune stimulants, as seen in peptide-conjugate vaccines6, and iii) optimization of the drug delivery system6. Previously, we conducted a study with chemically enhanced altered peptide ligands (CPLs) to induce IAV-specific T-cell responses7. By changing the residues of a peptide at or near the anchor into non-proteogenic amino acids, the binding affinity of the peptide to the MHC molecule can be increased, thereby prolonging the presentation of vaccine peptides on the cell surface. A prerequisite for the success of this approach is that most T cells induced by CPL-vaccination should be able to recognize the wildtype (WT) viral peptide. We hypothesized that prolonged presentation would lead to enhanced T-cell immunogenicity and a broader T-cell response, both at the clonal level (i.e. more T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity) and in terms of cross-reactivity against naturally occurring viral mutants, since T cells would have more time to recognize the peptide, allowing more clones to react. Furthermore, the incorporation of non-proteogenic amino acids may make CPLs resistant to proteolytic degradation. We indeed observed that several CPLs had enhanced MHC-binding affinity compared to natural IAV-peptides, and that vaccination of mice with CPLs induced a higher IFNγ-response against the WT peptide compared to vaccination with the WT peptide7.In the current study, we investigated additional features of the T-cell response after vaccination with CPLs, including the frequencies of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells, and their IFNγ-expression, cross-recognition and TCR repertoire diversity. We focused on the response against the IAV-specific matrix protein 158–66 (M158–66) GILGFVFTL (GILG) epitope, which is highly immuno-dominant in humans with HLA-A28. The GILG epitope is highly conserved between different IAV strains, emphasizing the advantage of inducing a robust response against this epitope9. We selected four different CPLs of the GILG epitope, all with enhanced binding affinity to the HLA-A2 molecule, but resulting in different T-cell responses after vaccination compared to vaccination with the WT peptide7. We evaluated the characteristics of the different responses that were induced in vivo, in a transgenic mouse model expressing a hybrid class I MHC gene, containing the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domain of the human HLA-A2.1 gene. We found that CPL-vaccination induced higher T-cell frequencies than vaccination with the WT peptide. The majority of the induced T cells, however, did not recognize the WT peptide, and are therefore considered non-relevant. Furthermore, vaccination with CPLs led to a more skewed T-cell repertoire against the WT peptide. Most importantly, we found that CPL-vaccination did not provide better protection against IAV-challenge than vaccination with the WT peptide. Vaccination with one of the CPLs even tended to cause enhanced pathology after IAV-challenge. These findings show that modified-peptide vaccine strategies may induce a substantial amount of non-relevant, and possibly even detrimental, T cells. Such strategies should thus be monitored carefully when used to protect against infectious diseases.ResultsChemically altered peptidesIn an earlier study, IAV-specific peptides were chemically altered near or at the MHC-anchor residues using non-proteogenic amino acids7. The chemical alterations were rationally designed based on available crystal structures of peptide-HLA-A2 complexes and on side chain similarities. This way the binding to HLA-A2 was enhanced, which in some cases resulted in a higher IFNγ-response upon CPL compared to WT-peptide vaccination in mice. In the current study, we selected four modifications (MOD1, MOD2, MOD3 and MOD4, see Table 1) of the GILGFVFTL peptide to acquire a deeper understanding of the effect of these modifications on the T-cell response after vaccination. These CPLs were selected based on their enhanced MHC-binding scores compared to the WT peptide (Table 1) and subsequent different outcomes in their enhancement of the IFNγ-response7.Table 1 Overview of peptide modifications and corresponding binding affinity to MHC.Full size tableDose-response experiment MOD1First we performed an extended dose-finding study with a broader range of peptide concentrations and more animals, to select a dose for further immunological analysis of the T-cell responses induced by the CPLs. To this end, we selected the WT peptide and one CPL (MOD1) that previously showed an improved response7. We prime-boosted HLA-A2 transgenic mice with either 10, 30, 90 or 270 nmol of the WT or MOD1 peptide, with an interval of 21 days between prime and boost (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Dose-response determination with WT and MOD1 peptide vaccination.a Study layout depicting the prime-boost strategy. Mice were primed at day 0 by vaccination with either WT peptide or MOD1 peptide in a dose range of 10–30–90–270 nmol and received the same treatment 21 days later (n = 4 per treatment). The experiment was controlled by a mock vaccination (day 0 and day 21) and an influenza virus infection (day 21 only). Lymphocytes were isolated from spleen and blood 10 days post booster (dpd) vaccination. b, c Cellular responses were measured by IFNγ-ELISpot after vaccination. 4 × 105 cells per condition were stimulated with (b) WT peptide or (c) MOD1 peptide. The horizontal dotted line depicts the upper limit of detection (500 spots). d, e WT-specific CD8 + T-cell frequencies were measured by dextramer staining in (d) spleen and (e) blood of mice vaccinated with WT or MOD1 peptide. In (b–e) results of individual mice are shown (points) with the group median (line). Mice vaccinated with WT peptide are depicted in black, whereas mice vaccinated with MOD1 peptide are depicted in dark blue. Differences between groups were tested for significance by one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test. Only significant p-values or p-values depicting a trend are depicted in the graphs. Study layout was created using BioRender.com.Full size imageTen days post booster vaccination, we observed that the IFNγ-response of splenocytes induced by MOD1-vaccination already reached its maximum at 30 nmol in an ELISpot assay after ex vivo restimulation with WT peptide (Fig. 1b, controls are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a). At higher doses, the response started to plateau. There was no significant difference in the response induced by WT-vaccination or MOD1-vaccination for any of the doses. Ex vivo stimulations with MOD1 peptide induced a very high response in MOD1-vaccinated mice and a lower response in mice vaccinated with WT peptide (Fig. 1c, controls are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a).When we analyzed the peptide-specific T-cell frequencies by staining with WT-loaded HLA-A2 dextramers, we observed a clear subset of WT-specific T cells in both WT and MOD1-vaccinated mice, in both spleen and blood (Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1c). Splenocytes isolated from mock-vaccinated mice and IAV-infected mice served as staining controls (Supplementary fig. 1b, c). Comparable to what we observed in the IFNγ-ELISpot assay, the highest response of the WT-specific T-cell frequencies was already reached at a vaccination dose of 30 nmol. Based on these results, we selected 30 nmol as the dose for an in-depth mechanistic analysis of the four selected CPLs.Dissecting the T-cell response induced by the different CPLsTo compare the magnitude of the T-cell responses induced by the different peptide modifications and the WT peptide, we prime-boosted mice with 30 nmol of WT or one of the four CPLs (n = 8 per treatment) (Table 1, Fig. 2a). Ten days after boosting, restimulation of splenocytes with the GILG-WT peptide in an IFNγ-ELISpot assay showed that responses of CPL-vaccinated mice were comparable to those of mice vaccinated with WT (Fig. 2b). When stimulating the splenocytes with the peptide that was used for the vaccination, the IFNγ-response to MOD4 was significantly higher than the response to the WT peptide (Fig. 2c). The responses to the other CLPs were not significantly different from the response to WT, although MOD3 showed a trend to a higher response after homologous stimulation. The response after vaccination with the WT-peptide or CPLs was much lower compared to the response after virus infection (Fig. 2b, c). Although based on the results of our previous study we expected vaccination with all four CPLs to induce a higher IFNγ-response to the WT peptide than vaccination with the WT peptide itself7, the current dataset (which has a higher power), shows that in fact vaccination with none of the modified peptides induces a significantly increased IFNγ-response to the WT peptide.Fig. 2: Vaccination with modified peptides induces non-relevant T-cell responses.a Study layout depicting the prime-boost strategy used to compare WT peptide vaccination with CPL vaccination (MOD1–4). Mice were primed with 30 nmol peptide vaccine (either WT or one of four CPLs) and were boosted 21 days later. 10 days post booster (dpd) mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were isolated. b, c Cellular responses were measured by IFNγ-ELISpot assay after restimulation of 4 × 105 splenocytes with (b) WT peptide or (c) homologous restimulation (WT peptide or MOD1–4).

Differences between groups were tested for significance by one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test. Only significant p-values or p-values (MOD vs WT) depicting a trend are depicted in the graphs. Study layout was created using BioRender.com.Full size imageNext, we wondered if CPLs would also be able to boost a response induced by a previous influenza infection as this more reflects the human situation. To mimic this scenario, we stimulated splenocytes of mice infected with IAV with one of the four CPLs. The ELISpot results show that all four CPLs result in activation of an infection-induced response (Supplementary Fig. 2) indicating that the CPLs potentially boost memory response induced by a previous influenza infection.To distinguish between T cells that recognize the WT peptide or only the CPLs, we combined a CPL- and WT peptide loaded dextramer staining to distinguish between CD8 + T cells recognizing only the WT peptide (WT + ), only the CPL (MOD + ) or both (Double Positive, DP + ) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3A). WT-vaccinated mice, had a population of WT + T cells, as well as a DP + T-cell population, recognizing both the WT peptide and the CPL (Fig. 2d, e). Mice vaccinated with CPLs had both MOD+ and DP + T-cell populations.To investigate whether CPL-vaccination in general resulted in a higher T-cell response, we compared the total dextramer response (sum of WT + , DP+ and MOD + ) induced by the different vaccinations. Vaccination with MOD1, 2 and 4 did not induce higher total T-cell frequencies compared to vaccination with WT peptide (Fig. 2e). The total dextramer+ T-cell response induced by MOD3-vaccination was significantly higher than the response induced by WT-vaccination (p = 0.0499, Supplementary Fig. 3B). In line with the IFNγ-responses, T-cell frequencies measured by dextramer staining were significantly lower after peptide vaccination than after virus infection, both in terms of the WT-specific response and the total dextramer+ T-cell response (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Importantly, for all four CPL vaccinations, we observed that the induced T-cell response consisted of a relatively larger fraction of T cells that only recognized the specific CPL, both in spleen (Fig. 2e) and in the blood (Supplementary Fig. 3B). T cells recognizing only the CPLs and not the WT peptide are unlikely to contribute to T-cell protection upon IAV infection and are thus presumably non-relevant. To determine to which extent CPLs induced useful T cells, we calculated the ratio between the frequency of T cells recognizing both the WT peptide and the CPL (DP + ) and the frequency of T cells recognizing only the CPL (MOD + ). Although there was a large variation within groups, the amount of T cells recognizing the WT peptide was between 2 to 5 times smaller than the amount of T cells recognizing the CPL (Fig. 2f). Thus, although vaccination with some of the CPLs resulted in a higher IFNγ-response to the CPL and higher T-cell frequencies compared to WT-vaccination, the responses induced by CPLs consisted to a large extent of non-relevant T cells.Recognition of naturally occurring peptide variantsAlthough the WT peptide is known to be relatively conserved, natural variants do occur. We wondered if CPL-vaccination could enhance the recognition of these natural variants when compared to vaccination with WT. We selected four different naturally occurring peptide variants for ex vivo restimulation, namely GILGFVYTL, GILGLVFTL, GMLGFVFTL and GILGFIFTL, based on the highest frequency of occurrence10. T cells induced by vaccination with WT showed a comparable IFNγ-response against two other natural variants, GMLGFVFTL and GILGFIFTL, whereas GILGFVYTL and GILGLVFTL were recognized poorly (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 4). T cells induced by vaccination with any of the four CPLs also recognized GILGFVYTL and GILGLVFTL relatively poorly. On the other hand, MOD3-vaccination resulted in higher responses against GMLGFVFT (p = 0.0350) compared to WT-vaccination, whereas vaccination with MOD4 resulted in higher responses against GILGFIFTL after restimulation (p = 0.0499) in comparison with WT-vaccination (Supplementary fFg. 4). This suggests that some CPLs may enhance the recognition of naturally occurring GILGFVFTL viral variants.Effect of peptide modification on the TCR repertoire of WT-specific T cellsWe hypothesized that vaccination with CPLs would lead to a broader TCR repertoire diversity of WT-specific T cells, as extended peptide presentation allows for recognition by more T-cell clones. To investigate this, we sorted T cells recognizing the WT peptide and used Vβ sequencing to determine the WT specific TCR repertoire. The diversity of the TCR repertoire was calculated using the Simpson Diversity Index11. We observed relatively large within-group variation in the TCR diversity of the WT-specific T-cell pool, and no significant differences between mice vaccinated with WT peptide or with any of the four CPLs. However, the diversity of the TCR repertoire induced by MOD2 and MOD4-vaccination were both significantly lower compared to the TCR diversity induced by IAV infection (Fig. 3a). This was due to the presence of clonal expansions in MOD2 and MOD4-vaccinated mice, as the top five T-cell clones in these mice covered a significantly larger fraction of the induced T-cell pool than in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 3b). This difference was confirmed by a significantly lower TCR richness in MOD2 and MOD4 vaccinated mice when compared to WT-vaccinated mice and mice infected with IAV (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The diversity of the WT-specific repertoire induced by WT-vaccination was very similar to the repertoire after natural infection, despite the large difference in WT specific T-cell frequencies. The similarity was reflected in a comparable TCR repertoire diversity, evenness and richness (Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 6A).Fig. 3: GILG-WT specific T-cell repertoire analyses after peptide vaccination.a Simpson’s diversity index of the WT-specific TCR repertoire after WT or CPL vaccination and influenza virus infection. b Skewing of the WT-specific TCR repertoire was calculated by the contribution of the top 5 largest clones per sample in percentages. c Overview of the number of shared sequences between mice vaccinated with WT or one of the four CPLs.

Mice vaccinated with WT peptide are depicted in black and mice vaccinated with CPL are indicated by the following colors: MOD1 – dark blue, MOD2 – green, MOD3 – orange, MOD4 – light blue. Mice infected with influenza a virus are shown as grey colored closed circles. Differences between responses to WT and CPLs are tested using Mann-Whitney U test. P-values are only shown when there was a significant difference between WT and a MOD vaccination.Full size imageIt has previously been shown that modifications in peptides can alter the 3D structure of peptide-MHC complexes, leading to the binding of different T-cell receptors12. Therefore, we investigated the overlap in sequences and characteristics of the TCR repertoires induced by WT and CPL-vaccination. There was not much overlap in TCR sequences between WT-vaccinated and CPL-vaccinated mice (Fig. 3c). Although at first sight this seems to suggest that CPL-vaccination induces a completely different TCR repertoire, in fact also the number of shared sequences between different WT-vaccinated mice (4 shared sequences) and between WT-vaccinated and IAV-infected mice (13, Fig. 3d) was low. Vaccination with MOD3 led to the highest number of shared TCR sequences with WT-vaccination (Fig. 3c).Focusing on other characteristics of the TCR repertoire, like V and J usage and CDR3 length of the sequences, showed a skewing towards the usage of Vβ13–1 in the TCR repertoire of WT-vaccinated and IAV-infected mice. This bias seemed even more pronounced in mice vaccinated with MOD2, MOD3 and MOD4 (Fig. 3e), although these shifts were not significant. Within the Vβ13–1+ sequences, we observed skewing towards the use of the Jβ segments 2–7, 2–1 and 1–1 for all peptide vaccinations, as well as after IAV infection (Fig. 3f). It has previously been proposed that TCRs with a relatively long CDR3 region are more flexible and thereby more cross-reactive than TCRs with short CDR3 regions13. The TCR repertoire after WT-vaccination showed a bias towards a CDR3 length of 9 or 10 amino acids, while the WT-specific repertoires induced by CPLs showed a more prominent skewing towards one length (8 amino acids for MOD1 and MOD2, 10 amino acids for MOD3 and 9 amino acids for MOD4, Supplementary Fig. 5B). Although MOD3 and MOD4 both induced higher IFNγ responses against some of the naturally occurring GILG variants than WT-vaccination (Fig. 2g), this was thus not associated with longer CDR3 regions of the responding T cells.T-cell response prior to and after IAV-challenge in peptide-vaccinated miceWe next investigated the protective capacity of CPL-induced immunity in the early memory phase. We focused on MOD1 and MOD2-vaccination, as they were suggested to improve the T-cell response most strongly in our previous study7. For this purpose, we vaccinated mice with either WT, MOD1 or MOD2 peptide following the same prime-boost schedule as described earlier (Fig. 1) and subsequently challenged mice with the IAV PR8 strain, which contains the WT GILGFVFTL epitope, at day 54 (i.e., 33 dpb) (Fig. 4a). Half of the mice were sacrificed prior to IAV-challenge (day 51, 30 dpb) to study the early memory response present at the time of challenge. The other half of the mice were sacrificed 5 days post infection (dpi), i.e. at day 59, to analyze the immune response and the level of protection against IAV-challenge (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: Memory response induced by peptide vaccination.a Study layout depicting the prime-boost strategy and subsequent IAV-challenge to compare the protective effect of WT vaccination with MOD1 or MOD2 vaccination. Mice were primed at day 0 with peptide vaccination (30 nmol) and received the same treatment 21 days later. At day 51 (30 days post booster (dpb)) half of the mice were sacrificed to study the memory T-cell responses. The other half received an IAV-challenge (PR8, 1 × 103 TCID50) at day 54 (33 dpb) and were sacrificed 5 days post infection (dpi, day 59). b, c Cellular responses were measured by IFNγ-ELISpot after stimulation of 4 × 105 splenocytes with (b) WT peptide or (c) homologous restimulation with MOD1 or MOD2.

Mice vaccinated with WT peptide are depicted in black. Mice vaccinated with CPL are indicated by the following colors: MOD1 – dark blue, MOD2 – green. Vertical dotted lines depict the timing of the IAV-challenge. Differences between groups were tested for significance by one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test. P-values are only shown when there was a significant difference between WT and a MOD vaccination. Study layout was created using BioRender.com.Full size imageFor all three peptide vaccinations, a clear contraction of the T-cell response was observed between day 31 and day 51 post booster vaccination, as measured by IFNγ-ELISpot after WT and homologous stimulation (Fig. 4b, c). The contraction of the response was similar for mice vaccinated with WT, MOD1 or MOD2. Dextramer staining showed that also after contraction of the response, a large fraction of the T cells induced by vaccination with CPLs only recognized the modified peptide (Fig. 4d).For all three peptide vaccinations, the IFNγ-response against WT was higher post IAV-challenge (day 59) than before challenge (day 51, Fig. 4b). This was also observed after homologous restimulation of T cells from CPL-vaccinated mice (Fig. 4c). The IFNγ-response in mock-vaccinated mice also increased after IAV-challenge (Supplementary Fig. 6B), but remained significantly lower than in WT and CPL-vaccinated mice, suggesting that the response in the vaccinated mice was a true memory response (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Next we calculated the ratio of T cells recognizing both peptides (DP + ) and cells recognizing only the modified peptide (MOD + ) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 6A). Remarkably, the percentage of T cells recognizing the WT peptide seemed to increase after infection, however this was not significant (p = 0.0734, Fig. 4d). Unexpectedly, the fraction of T cells recognizing only the modified peptide increased after IAV-challenge of mice vaccinated with MOD1. This pattern was not observed in mice vaccinated with MOD2; in the latter mice, the ratio DP + /MOD+ cells remained close to one before and after IAV challenge.Clinical disease and pathology after IAV-challengeTo assess whether peptide vaccination contributed to lower disease severity after IAV-challenge, i.e. whether it was associated with protection, we assessed clinical disease, pathology and virus replication after IAV-challenge in peptide-vaccinated mice. Mice vaccinated with WT or MOD1 showed a comparable relative weight loss after infection, which seemed a bit less than in mock-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5a). This might hint at some protection induced by WT and MOD1-vaccination, whereas the positive control mice, previously immunized with a virus infection, were completely protected. In contrast, MOD2-vaccinated mice showed the same relative weight loss as mock-vaccinated mice. An increase in relative lung weight (RLW, the ratio of the lung weight at termination to body weight at the day of challenge) resulting from edema and infiltrating leukocytes, is known to be a marker of disease in influenza infection14. Mice vaccinated with WT or MOD1 showed a comparable RLW at 5 dpi (Fig. 5b). The RLW in mice vaccinated with MOD2 and mock-vaccinated mice was significantly higher than in mice vaccinated with WT peptide. Surprisingly, the RLW of MOD2 mice appeared higher than mock-vaccinated mice although this was not significant. Virus titers were also significantly higher in the lungs of mice vaccinated with MOD2 than in mice vaccinated with WT peptide (p = 0.0003, Fig. 5c) and again appeared higher than in mock-vaccinated mice, but the difference was not significant. Although mice vaccinated with MOD1 showed a comparable relative weight loss and RLW as mice vaccinated with WT (Fig. 5b), a significantly higher virus titer was observed in the lungs of MOD1-vaccinated mice (p = 0.0399). Virus titers were absent and the RLW was not increased in the positive control. Together this suggests that vaccination with the CPLs investigated does not lead to better protection than vaccination with WT peptide and may even induce enhanced disease.Fig. 5: Clinical disease and pathology after IAV-challenge in peptide-vaccinated mice.Mice challenged with PR8 were sacrificed 5 days post infection (dpi) to determine pathology. a Weight loss in percentage after influenza infection at day 54.

P-values are only shown when there was a significant difference between WT and a MOD vaccination.Full size imageNext we assessed whether peptide vaccination could protect against lung pathology at the microscopic level. IAV Infection resulted in a mild to strong (peri) bronchitis, slight to mild (peri) bronchiolitis, slight to mild vasculitis and alveolitis in mice vaccinated with WT, MOD1, MOD2 or mock (Illustrated in Fig. 5d, e), however with different scores per treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7). All mice were scored based on the pathology in different parts of the lungs, e.g. bronchi, bronchioli, blood vessels, interstitium and alveoli (Fig. 5d). We found no significant differences between the different peptide vaccinations or mock-vaccination, in the percentage of affected tissue in the lungs (Fig. 5f). However, the end score (summarizing all the pathology scores) showed a significantly higher score (comparable to mock-vaccination) for the mice vaccinated with MOD2 compared to mice vaccinated with WT or MOD1 (Fig. 5g). This was primarily due to increased damage and inflammation in the bronchioli, two parameters very characteristic for influenza induced-lung pathology (Supplementary Fig 7). These parameters were even significantly higher in MOD2-vaccinated mice than in mock-vaccinated mice, which support the previous observed trends of an increased RLW and virus replication in MOD2 compared to mock-vaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). Surprisingly, WT and MOD1-vaccination did not lead to a significantly decreased pathology in the lungs compared to mock-vaccinated mice, although some parameters were reduced (i.e. alveolitis in WT peptide mice) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Together these data suggest that peptide vaccination -whether with CPLs or with WT peptide- does not lead to significantly enhanced protection against IAV infection. Mice vaccinated with MOD2 even showed increased pathology in the bronchioli after viral challenge compared to mock-vaccinated mice.DiscussionWe investigated how vaccination with CPLs of the immunodominant conserved influenza GILG epitope influences the induced antigen-specific T-cell response in comparison to vaccination with the WT peptide. Although all four CPLs we used were previously shown to have increased binding affinity to the HLA-A2 complex7, we here show that vaccination with none of these CPLs leads to a larger T-cell response to the WT peptide. In fact, the majority of the induced T cells in CPL-vaccinated mice only recognized the CPL and not the WT peptide. Nevertheless, some of the CPLs showed enhanced recognition of naturally occurring viral GILGFVFTL variants. Furthermore, the T-cell repertoire directed against the WT peptide showed larger clonal expansions of only a few clones when induced by MOD2 or MOD4-vaccination compared to WT-vaccination. CPL vaccination showed a comparable contraction of the T-cell response in the memory phase as WT-vaccination, and did not lead to improved protection against IAV infection when compared to WT-vaccination. Vaccination with one of the CPLs even seemed to result in enhanced disease after IAV infection. Thus, CPLs induced a large number of “non-relevant” T cells, which failed to recognize the WT peptide, which might play a role in the enhanced pathology observed after IAV-challenge.In this study, we chose to vaccinate with MHC-binding enhanced versions of the immuno-dominant GILGFVFTL peptide. This peptide seemed an ideal vaccine candidate as the GILG peptide is very conserved between IAV strains, most likely because mutations in the peptide lead to functional constraints for the virus15. The fact that almost all HLA-A2+ individuals have T cells specific for this peptide suggests the importance of this peptide in the CD8 + T-cell response against IAV infection. Also in HLA-A2 transgenic mice, the response against GILG was found to be dominant16. Here, we nevertheless found that vaccination with CPLs of GILG provided minor to no improvement in the cellular response against the GILG WT peptide. An explanation could be that it is harder to improve an already immunodominant response than a subdominant response. On the other hand, the responses induced by all peptide vaccinations were nowhere near the magnitude of the response induced by viral infection, suggesting that there should still be room for improvement. Nevertheless, we found that vaccination with WT and MOD1 provided better protection against IAV-challenge than mock-vaccination, based on weight loss and the relative lung weight. Thus, our data suggest that vaccination with a single peptide (WT or MOD1) could already lead to some level of protection. On the other hand, we also observed a significant increase in damage and inflammation of the bronchioli in MOD2-vaccinated mice compared to mock-vaccinated mice. These aberrations are typical for an influenza infection and their enhancement supports the increased trend in the relative lung weight, which is a non-biased measurement of cellular infiltration and edema formation. Altogether, this indicates that vaccination with CPLs can also lead to enhanced pathology after infection and that this aspects should be carefully considered when peptide vaccine strategies are further pursued.It could be that vaccination with CPLs of subdominant peptides is in fact a more promising path. In line with this, we previously observed that the IFNγ-responses against the subdominant FMYSDFHFI and NMLSTVLGV peptides were improved more significantly by the introduction of non-proteogenic modifications than the response to GILG7. However, as the T-cell responses induced by WT FMYSDFHFI and WT NMLSTVLGV vaccination were low or non-detectable, modifications of these peptides were less suited for in depth immunological analysis, for which comparisons between WT and CPL induced T-cell responses are required. It would nevertheless be interesting to investigate the potential effect of vaccination with a combination of CPLs, targeting different peptides of the virus, as this may lead to a broader T-cell response17, more comparable to the response induced by virus infection. If these different peptides would also be presented on different HLA-types, a broader part of the population could be protected than only the HLA-A2+ individuals.All CPLs that were investigated were modified at, or close to, the anchor residues of the GILGFVFTL peptide, which are important for binding to the MHC molecule (P1 or P2), with the underlying idea that the exposed part of the peptide that is recognized by the T-cell receptor would be left intact. We therefore expected that most T cells induced by CPL-vaccination would still be able to recognize the WT peptide. This was not the case, however. Based on dextramer staining we found that for all four CPLs, the majority of the induced T cells recognized only the modified peptide and not the WT peptide. We speculate that this may be due to a different positioning of the peptide in the HLA complex, resulting in a distinct presentation of the central part of the peptide. This phenomenon has indeed been shown for other peptides, for which one substitution at an anchor residue dramatically altered the conformation of the peptide-MHC complex12 or the conformation of the TCR contact sides18. It remains to be investigated whether the induction of a large fraction of non-relevant T cells is characteristic for the GILG peptide or whether it also occurs when modifying other influenza epitopes. It has been suggested that the GILG peptide is a featureless “plain vanilla” peptide, meaning that it lacks prominent side chains pointing towards the T-cell receptor when presented by HLA-A219,20. Therefore, there may be fewer ways to bind the peptide and thus only a few TCRs may be sufficiently suited to bind the peptide-MHC complex. This may lead to a highly conserved and skewed T-cell repertoire recognizing this peptide-MHC complex in humans21,22,23. Therefore it could be possible that modifying the GILG peptide has even greater effects, as it may disrupt the “plain vanilla” binding, resulting in the possibility of more different TCRs to recognize the peptide-MHC complex, compared to peptides that are already presented in a different way.All four CPLs investigated here induced a large fraction of non-relevant T cells that did not recognize the WT epitope. It would be interesting to further investigate the consequences of the induction of these non-relevant T cells and to study whether they play a role in the observed increased lung pathology in mice vaccinated with MOD2. It has recently been suggested that chemical modification directly alters the immunogenicity of a peptide and could thereby lead to the activation of potentially autoreactive T cells via molecular mimicry of endogenous ligands24. Whether this also played a role in the increased lung pathology observed in MOD2-vaccinated mice remains to be investigated.To understand if a single amino acid substitution leading to enhanced HLA binding can influence the T cells recognizing the peptide, we also performed T-cell repertoire analyses. If anything, our data suggest that the enhanced MHC binding affinity of the tested CPLs led to more skewing of the repertoire towards Vβ13–1, and not to a broader repertoire as we hypothesized. Although one approach to enhance protection could be the selection of a superior T-cell clone25, this may not be preferable in the protection against IAV. It is generally thought that a broader TCR repertoire is preferable in protection against mutating viruses, as it increases the chance that T cells are present that can also recognize escape variants of the WT peptide, as has been observed for several other viral infections26,27,28. In this light, the increased skewing of the T-cell repertoire against the WT peptide that we observed after vaccination with some of the CPLs may not be preferable.The highly skewed and public GILG WT-specific TCR repertoire in humans mostly consists of TCRs expressing TRBV19, TRAV27 and an RS motif in the CDR3β region21,29. In our mouse model, we also observed a strong skewing in the Vβ sequences, however towards TRBV13–1 (homologous to human TRBV10) and not towards TRBV19. We did not observe a dominant motif in the CDR3 regions of the TRBV13–1 + T-cell sequences. The mouse-model we used consists of a transgenic HLA-A2 molecule of which the alpha-3-domain is mouse-specific. This transgenic HLA-A2 molecule could play a role in the differences observed, as also the contact points of the MHC-molecule may play an important role in the TRBV19 skewing observed in humans.After the IAV-challenge, we expected to see a shift towards the recognition of the WT peptide. Very much to our surprise, in mice vaccinated with MOD1, the fraction of T cells recognizing the WT peptide (useful T cells) decreased. As we only measured these frequencies in the spleen, it is tempting to speculate that in mice vaccinated with MOD1, the T cells that specifically recognized the WT peptide were present at the site of infection. This would be in line with the lower pathology observed in the MOD1-vaccinated mice. Further research on the presence of antigen-specific T cells in the lung would be needed to clarify this.As influenza A virus infection remains a worldwide health threat, the development of new vaccination strategies is essential. There is a clear need for a more universal vaccine inducing protection against the ever-changing seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza viruses. A strategy that efficiently induces a cellular response against conserved epitopes holds great promise. Although peptide-based vaccinations have the potential to fill this gap, we show that the strategy to enhance MHC-binding by chemically altering the peptides to improve the immune response also has its limitations. More research is needed into different aspects of peptide vaccination in the battle against infections, including defining the right target-peptide, determining the effect on the diversity of the induced TCR repertoire and monitoring the induction of non-relevant T cells as an off-target immune response with possible unwanted side effects.MethodsEthical statementThe study was approved by the Animal Welfare Body of Poonawalla Science Park, Animal Research Center (Bilthoven, The Netherlands) under permit number AVD3260020173890 of the Dutch Central Committee for Animal experiments. All procedures were carried out in accordance with EU legislation. Mice were inspected daily and were provided food and water ad libitum. Mice were housed by subgroup in filtertop Macrolon III cages and accommodated with cage enrichment (Igloo’s and nestlets). If mice would have reached any of the humane endpoints prior to scheduled termination they would have been euthanized. Endpoints were defined as: >20% weight loss, pumping breath, inactive, feeling cold, bulging. None of the mice reached a humane end point during the study, however two animals did not wake up after they were anesthetized during virus infection and one animal was found dead in the cage, likely due to narcosis. When the experimental end point was reached, mice were anesthetized (isoflurane/oxygen) and bled by orbital puncture. Mice were anesthetized during influenza challenges by isoflurane in O2 to minimize suffering.Study designHLA-A2 transgenic female mice, B6.Cg-Immp2I-Tg (HLA-A/H2-D)2Enge/J (Jackson Laboratory, USA) arrived at the Animal Research Centre (Bilthoven, the Netherlands) at least 2 weeks before commencement of the study for acclimatization. Mice were aged between 5 and 10 weeks at day of arrival. The animals were semi-randomly distributed; older mice were used first and younger mice were used in the later experiments.For the dose finding experiment mice were vaccinated with different doses (10 nm – 30 nm – 90 nm – 270 nm) of the WT or MOD1 peptide (Table 1). Each treatment group consisted of four animals, while both the negative (mock vaccination) and the positive (virus challenge) control group consisted of 8 animals. For practical reasons the experiment was divided into four sub experiments, in which 1 mouse from the peptide vaccination group was vaccinated or sacrificed and 2 mice from the negative and positive control group. Mice were housed together based on sub experiment and based on the peptide with which they were vaccinated (WT or MOD1) with 1 mock-vaccinated mouse in every cage to reduce cage effects. The mice infected with IAV were housed separately from the vaccinated mice. On day 0, groups were vaccinated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left groin fold. On day 21, mice received the booster vaccination s.c. in the right groin fold. Ten days after the booster vaccination, mice were sacrificed.For the experiment comparing vaccination with MOD1, MOD2 MOD3 and MOD4, each treatment group consisted of 8 animals, which were either vaccinated with a peptide or infected with influenza virus (PR8 strain, 1 × 103 TCID50 in 50 µl i.n.). The control group consisted of 4 animals and received a mock-vaccination consisting of DMSO. Peptide vaccinations consisted of the WT peptide or one of the 4 CPLs (MOD1, MOD2 MOD3 or MOD4, Table 1). Mice were vaccinated s.c. on day 0, in the left groin fold. At day 21, the mice received their booster vaccination, s.c. in the right groin fold, while the positive control group received a virus infection i.n. with 50 µl PR8 virus (1 × 103 TCID50). For the first part of the experiment, 8 mice per peptide vaccination were euthanized 10 days after the booster vaccination (day 31), as well as 8 mice after the IAV infection, and 4 mice of the mock group. For practical reasons, the experiment was divided into two parallel groups (A and B) with a time difference of 1 week, with 4 mice (treatment group and virus infection) or 2 mice (mock vaccination) per subgroup.We continued the experiment with MOD1 and MOD2 of the CPLs, to investigate early memory formation and protection against challenge. For this part, extra subgroups of mice were made in the groups receiving vaccination with the WT, MOD1 or MOD2 peptide (total of 16 mice per vaccination type). These mice received their vaccination or challenge at the same time as the mice described above, however, per vaccination, 8 of the 16 mice were sacrificed at day 51 (30 days after the booster vaccination); while the other 8 mice received a virus challenge i.n. with 50 ul PR8 (1×103 TCID50) at day 54 and were sacrificed at day 58 (5 days after the virus challenge). Both section moments were controlled by a mock vaccination (2 mice at day 51 and 8 mice after the virus challenge), and mice immunized by infection with IAV (8 mice at both day 51 and day 58).Sample collectionOf every mouse, spleen, heparin blood and serum were collected. Measurements on spleen and blood were performed at the day of withdrawal, serum was stored at −20 °C. Spleens were homogenized and passed through 70 um filters (BD biosciences), washed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and 100 U/ml penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamate. Erythrocytes were lysed using ACK-buffer (NH4Cl 0.15 M, KHCO3 0.01 M, Na2EDTA 0.1 mM). At day 59, besides the collection of the spleen, heparin blood and serum, also the lungs were collected. The right part of the lung was collected in formalin and used for histopathology, the left part of the lung was collected in Lysing Matrix A tubes and stored at −80 °C for virus titer analyses.Peptide vaccinationPeptides were adjuvanted with Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA) (1/1 (V/V)) and CpG (50 µg/mouse) and supplemented with PBS. The mixture was vortexed for 1 h. Mice were vaccinated with the indicated peptides at their respective doses in a volume of 100 µl. Before use, the freeze-dried peptides were dissolved in DMSO, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Mock vaccination consisted of DMSO and adjuvants.CPLs were designed and synthesized at the Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Centre, by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis using Syro I and Syro II synthesizers30. Amino acids were purchased from Chiralix, NovaBiochem, Chem-Impex or Creo Salus. Resins were purchased pre-loaded with proteogenic amino acids (Nova Biochem) or loaded with non-proteogenic amino acids. Typically, 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin corresponding to a loading of 0.3 mmol (Nova Biochem) was swollen in dichloromethane (DCM, Biosolve); 0.15 mmol of amino acid and 0.51 mmol di-isopropylethylamine (DIPEA, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and the mixture was shaken for 10 minutes. Another 0.99 mmol DIPEA in DCM was added and the mixture was shaken for one hour. The reaction was quenched by addition of methanol. Peptides were synthesized on a large scale (25–50 μmol) and purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Waters). Masses of all peptides were analyzed by LCMS (Waters) to confirm correct synthesis. For this study, we selected four non-proteogenic peptides, namely [am-phg]ILGFVFTL (d-α-methyl-phenylglycine, MOD1), [3-PYRA]ILGFVFTL (3’-pyridyl-alanine, MOD2), G[NLE]LGFVFT (norleucine L, MOD3) [SOME]ILGFVFTL (O-methyl-L-serine, MOD4), based on their MHC-binding affinity and induced T-cell response7. Note that L-amino acids are denoted in uppercase characters and D-amino acids in lowercase characters. WT (M158–66) and natural variant peptides were synthesized at DGpeptides (China), with a purity of >99%. The WT peptide is homologous to the M1 protein of the Influenza PR8 virus.VirusInfluenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8; NIBSC code 16/108) virus was obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, Hertfortshire, UK). Influenza viruses were grown on MDCK cells in MEM medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 40 µg/ml gentamicin, 0.01 M Tricine and 2 µg/ml TPCK treated trypsin (all from Sigma-Aldrich). At > 90% cytopathic effect (CPE), the suspension was collected and spun down (4000 x g for 10 minutes) to remove cell debris. Supernatant was collected, aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C.ELISpot assayPre-coated mouse IFNγ-ELISpot (ALP) plates (Mabtech) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Splenocytes were stimulated with 0.1 nmol/well WT or modified peptide in ELISpot plates at 37 °C. Controls consisted of medium and PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Per well, 400.000 cells were added. After 24 h, the plates were developed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Plates were dried for 1 night, after which they were analysed using the ImmunoSpot® S6 CORE (CTL, Cleveland, OH). Maximum count was set at 500 spots per well.FlowcytometryApproximately 2 million splenocytes and lysed whole blood cells were stained using the commercial A*0201/ GILG dextramer PE. In the same reaction, samples were also stained with an APC-labeled dextramer, loaded with a modified peptide, corresponding to the CPL vaccination. Surface staining was performed for 30 min at 4 °C with the following antibodies and dilutions: CD3(17A2)-FITC (cat. Nr. 555274, 1:100), CD8a(53–6.7)-PerCP/Cy5.5 (cat. Nr. 551162, 1:100), Fixable Viability Stain 780 (cat. Nr. 565388, 1:2000), CD127(SB/199)-BV421 (cat. Nr. 562959, 1:100), CD62L(MEL-14)-BV786 (cat. Nr. 564109, 1:400), CD44(IM7)-PE/Cy7 (cat. Nr. 560569, 1:800), KLRG1(2F1)-PE/CF594 (cat. Nr. 565393, 1:100), CD4(GK1.5)-BUV395 (cat. Nr. 563790, 1:200) (All BD Biosciences). Data acquisition was performed on an LSRFortessa X-20 and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10.6.2 (BD) software. We did not detect any dextramer staining on CD4 + T cells.Isolation of WT-specific T cells for TCR repertoire analysisCD8 + T cells were isolated from PBMCs using a negative selection microbeads kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. CD8 + T cells were subsequently labeled at room temperature for 20 min with the A*0201/GILG dextramer (PE, Immudex) and corresponding dextramers manufactured with the modified peptides (APC, Immudex). Subsequently, surface staining was performed using the following mAbs: CD3(17A2)-FITC (cat. Nr. 555274, diluted 1:100), CD4(GK1.5)-BV510 (cat. Nr. 743155, diluted 1:800), CD8(53–6.7)-BV786 (cat. Nr. 563332, diluted 1:400) (All BD Biosciences). CD3 + CD4 − CD8+dextramer+ cells were then sorted using a FACS Melody (BD) directly into RNAlater (Ambion Inc. Applied Biosystems) and stored at −80 °C for subsequent TCRβ clonotype analysis.Preparing TCRβ cDNA libraries for sequencingmRNA was isolated with the RNA microkit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated mRNA was used in the 5’ RACE-based SMARTer Mouse TCR α/β profiling kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc.) to perform sequencing of TCRs, following the manufacturer’s protocol using only the TCRβ-specific primers. Cleanup was performed with AMPURE XP clean-up beads (BD). PCR products were sequenced via Illumina MiSeq paired-end 2 × 300 nucleotide (nt) sequencing.TCRβ clonotype analysisDemultiplexed samples were first merged using tool Paired-End reAd mergeR (PEAR)31. flow by aligning the sequences to reference TRBV and TRBJ genes. Clonotypes were defined by their CDR3 amino acid sequence. TCR sequences were only accepted when they consisted of at least 100 sequencing reads, to clean the data from possible errors and contamination. Different cut-offs were tested to make sure the choice of the exact cut-off did not influence our qualitative results. TCR diversity was calculated using the previously described Simpson’s diversity index (Venturi et al. 2007). This index ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 representing minimal diversity and 1 representing maximal diversity.PathologyPathology scoring of the lung was performed as previously described in ref. 14. In brief, after fixation the right half of the lung was embedded in paraffin and sliced into 5 µm thick sections. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were examined microscopically at 5x, 10x and 20x magnification. Pathological scoring distinguished between ‘damage’, ‘peri-inflammation’ and ‘intra-lymphocyte filtrate’. Damage related parameters included hypertrophy, hyperplasia, flattened or pseudo squamous epithelia, necrosis and denudation of bronchi(oli) epithelium, hyperemia of septa and alveolar emphysema and haemorrhages. Inflammation related parameters included (peri)bronchi(oli)tis, interstitial infiltrate, alveolitis and (peri)vasculitis characterized by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells and macrophages. Intra-lymphocytic infiltration-related parameters included lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, and plasma cells. Pathological findings were scored on a scale of 0 (no aberrations) to 5 (severe damage) of which the median was taken as the ‘end score’ for the damage, peri-inflammation or intra-lymphocyte filtrate for different components (e.g. bronchi, bronchiole, blood vessels, interstitium, alveoli) per mouse. Per mouse, at least 8 microscopic fields were scored. An end score was used to summarize the total pathology of the lung. The percentage affected lung tissue was estimated at 20x magnification. Microscopic slides were randomized and scored blindly.Virus titer analysisVirus titer analysis was performed on tissue of the left half of the lung. For analyses, tissue stored in Lysing Matrix A tubes was thawed and 500 μl of Minimal Essential Media (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 250 ug/ml gentamicin and TPCK-trypsin was added to each tube. The samples were then dissociated using FastPrep (MP Biomedicals). Samples were spun down for 10 min at 4000 x g and 250 μl of the supernatant was serially diluted and tested in 6-plo on MDCK cells. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was cored after 5 days of culturing and TCID50 values were calculated using the Reed & Muench method32,33.Statistical analysisDifferences between the groups were assessed by first using a One-Way ANOVA (or a Kruskal-Wallis, when data was non-parametric). If the One-Way ANOVA was significant, a (post hoc) Mann-Whitney U tests was performed to compare the groups. For all analyses, p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.3 and SPSS statistics 22 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Outlines of 2 studies using ferret model to investigate interspecies transmission of swine influenza A viruses and human seasonal vaccine-mediated protection. A) Study 1 investigated the transmission ability of the A/Pavia/65/2016 (H1avN1) isolate in the ferret model of human infection. In 2 replicates, ferrets (n = 2) were intranasally inoculated and then cohoused with ferrets in direct contact (n = 2) and another group of ferrets (n = 2) separated by a perforated double divider to enable airborne exposure to respiratory droplets. B) Study 2 assessed airborne respiratory droplet transmission of 2 viruses from pigs to ferrets. In separate rooms, 2 groups of pigs (n = 5) were inoculated with either A/Pavia/65/2016 H1avN1 or A/swine/England/1353/2009 (H1pdmN1) virus and cohoused with naive (n = 5) and human seasonal 2016–17 influenza vaccine prime-boost–vaccinated ferrets (n = 5).

Despite WHO’s guidance on maintaining influenza surveillance and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 through national “Influenza Like Illness (ILI)” and “Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI)” sentinel surveillance systems, joint national and international surveillance reviews have demonstrated the low uptake of this guidance in the region. Various reviews have also indicated multi-faceted challenges to laboratory diagnosis of both influenza and SARS-CoV for surveillance at the country level. These challenges have affected virus sharing with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and molecular characterization of circulating influenza and SARS-CoV 2 viruses. Based on the lessons learned in the Covid-19 pandemic, globally attempts are underway to expand the GISRS to expanded GISRS (eGISRS) with a view to addressing detection of preparedness for and response to multiple respiratory pathogens of epidemic and pandemic potential. However, countries in Asia-Pacific have their own challenges with Influenza surveillance that will be further multiplied with addition of more respiratory pathogens for surveillance.In this context, to understand and find collective solutions to key issues related to strengthening influenza preparedness with specific focus on integrated surveillance (of influenza, SARS CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses of pandemic potential), laboratory diagnosis for public health surveillance and expansion of GISRS , WHO’s regional offices for South-East Asia (SEARO) and Western Pacific(WPRO ) conducted the 16th Bi-Regional meeting of Influenza surveillance and national influenza Centres (NICs) in Bangladesh from 1st to 3rd August. The meeting was inaugurated by Prof. Dr. Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam, Director General of Health services of the government of Bangladesh, Dr Bardan Rana, the WHO representative for Bangladesh and Dr Babatunde Olowokure, the Regional Emergency Director of the WHO’s Western Pacific Regional Office. Dr Bardan Rana represented the Regional Director for WHO’s Southeast Asia Region and delivered the opening remarks on behalf of her. The hybrid meeting was attended by 126 participants (55 face to face and 71 online). These included participants from (1) Member States in South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions (2) WHO Collaborating centres ( United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory -Australia, The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID)-Japan, Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA), ( 3)”One health” partners from The World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO ) (4) partners such as US CDC, AFRIMS, Hong Kong university, Pasteur institute -Cambodia among other multiple stakeholders The meeting consisted of 7 technical sessions. The technical sessions were as follows Influenza surveillance: situation, progress, gaps, and challengesRole of public health laboratories in Surveillance:Expansion of GISRS (GISRS to eGISRS)End to end integrated surveillance of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 by leveraging national ILI/SARI sentinel surveillance systems.

Older adults urged to get influenza vaccines in early autumn By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published August 09, 2023 / Updated September 22, 2023 invincible_bulldog / Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Fall is synonymous with the start of flu season, and experts are beginning to prepare for what could be another bad year. Tracking influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere usually “allows some degree of predictability” for what we can expect in the U.S., explains Gregory Poland, M.D., professor of medicine and director of the Vaccine Research Group at Mayo Clinic. And Australia — though not as bad as last year — is coming off a bit of a rough flu season, with an earlier-than-usual spike in illness, according to the country’s July surveillance report. That doesn’t necessarily mean we will see the same, Poland says. There’s a lot of variability with the virus, and global health officials say it’s still too soon to predict the severity of the season in the Northern Hemisphere. “But even a normal flu year is still something to worry about,” says Michael A. Ben-Aderet, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Cedars Sinai, pointing to the tens of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations that occur in the U.S. each year. ﻿﻿﻿ It’s estimated that the U.S. saw as many as 650,000 hospitalizations and as many as 58,000 deaths due to flu during the 2022-2023 season. And with a swell of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, experts are taking the opportunity to remind people of some measures that can minimize illness and lower the likelihood that we experience another “tripledemic,” since “we’ll probably see, at some point, all three viruses circulating at the same time,” Ben-Aderet says, referring to influenza, COVID-19 and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Flu shot can help blunt the burden One way to avoid a bad flu year is to get the flu shot, which lowers your risk of getting infected or severely sick from an influenza infection. The problem, Poland says, is that “we’re seeing a general but measurable decline in people’s acceptance of vaccines overall.” And that trend could affect flu activity and severity this fall and winter. Flu vaccination is especially important for older adults, who are at higher risk of complications from the virus. (It’s estimated that 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths and 50 to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older.) In fact, older adults need what’s known as a high-dose flu shot, which packs extra protection. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT How well flu vaccination works can depend on how well the vaccines are matched with the circulating strains, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The composition of the vaccine is updated each year, based on what versions of the virus experts expect will be the most common. (This year’s vaccines will contain an updated influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 component.) Poland says if the same strains that circulated in the Southern Hemisphere are what we see in the U.S., we should have “good coverage.” The vaccines are similar, and a new CDC study found that the vaccine used in the Southern Hemisphere reduced influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52 percent during their flu season. When should you get the flu shot? The timing of things can also play a role in the outcome of our flu season. Activity spiked early last year and tapered off into winter. “The cases were very front-loaded in the year,” Ben-Aderet says. That’s a good reason not to push your flu shot off to later in the fall or winter, experts say, though late is still better than never. You also don’t want to get it too early and see your immunity wane before flu activity peaks. “Even a normal flu year is still something to worry about.” ​—Michael A. Ben-Aderet, M.D. Both Poland and Ben-Aderet say sometime in September or October is ideal for the vaccine. The CDC recommends the same time frame. “Remember that after you get the flu vaccine, it takes about two weeks before you develop the peak level of antibodies and are protected,” Poland says. While you’re getting your flu shot, check to see if you’re due for a COVID-19 booster, since like with flu, older adults are among those at higher risk for a bad case of the disease. Vaccine manufacturers are updating the COVID shots so that they more closely match the strains of the virus that are currently circulating, and health officials expect them to be ready early in the fall. The CDC hasn’t made any official recommendations on who will need them or when, but those will likely be coming soon. Adults 60 and older are also eligible for an RSV vaccine this fall, which is new to the lineup. Two versions were approved this summer and are expected in pharmacies and clinics by early fall. (Many already have them in stock.) “Get a vaccine for these three diseases where you’re eligible,” Poland says. And “be cognizant of how these viruses spread,” he adds. According to CDC data, flu activity was “unusually low” during the height of the pandemic when people were washing their hands often, wearing masks around others and staying away from sick people, Poland says. %{postComment}% Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.

Download PDF Copy By Hugo Francisco de SouzaReviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc.Aug 9 2023 In a recent study published in Vaccines, researchers review the effectiveness of seasonal vaccinations against influenza, in which almost 50% of vaccinations were found to prevent disease successfully. A match between influenza strains present in vaccines and strains in local circulation was identified as the most important factor in vaccine efficacy. Study: Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in Persons Aged 15–64 Years: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Image Credit: Numstocker / Shutterstock.com Influenza and tests of vaccine effectiveness Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate globally. Influenza is a highly infectious disease, with World Health Organization (WHO) global estimates of up to one billion cases each year, 650,000 of whom succumb to the illness. Influenza infections peak between November to April in the Northern Hemisphere and June to October in the Southern Hemisphere. This seasonal infection pattern has prompted many nations to invest in seasonal flu vaccination campaigns. Influenza viruses mutate at an extremely fast rate, with multiple strains simultaneously in circulation and more discovered annually. Mismatches between strains used in vaccine production and those in circulation may significantly affect vaccine effectiveness (VE), thus making measures of location-specific vaccine performance imperative. A large body of literature exists on the VE of seasonal influenza vaccines (SIVs), predominantly comprising observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RTCs). RCTs use a metric called vaccine efficacy (VER) to measure vaccine performance. Given the controlled test environment wherein RCTs are conducted, VERs are accurate snapshot performance measures. However, these studies are expensive, time-consuming, and rarely repeated after the introduction of SIVs, thus making them unideal in the real-time assessment of SIV effectiveness. Clinical annual monitoring of SIV performance is predominantly conducted using the test-negative design (TND) approach, wherein individuals with infection are considered cases, and those without infection are treated as controls. Individuals reporting influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) are laboratory tested for the disease and categorized as influenza-positive individuals or controls. The specificity and sensitivity of influenza diagnostic tools, combined with easily accessible patient vaccination data, allow TNDs to be more useful than RCTs for real-time vaccine performance evaluation. RCTs and TNDs are used in different contexts. RCTs are the gold standard for licensing of use and TNDs are the main tool for monitoring the annual effectiveness of the SIVs.” Unlike RCTs, TNDs use VE, which hitherto has not been scaled to VER. Thus, results observed from these different sampling designs have not been compared and the relationship between VE and VER has yet to be established. About the study The aim of the present study was to evaluate vaccine performance in RCTs and TNDs using VE as a standard measure. To this end, the researchers performed a systematic review of available literature on the topic, as well as a meta-analysis of the data derived from studies that met their inclusion criteria.

All participants in TND studies were required to have been vaccinated at least 14 days before ILI symptoms, and influenza in all cases was confirmed using laboratory methods. Researchers first used a search strategy to query two online databases, Cochrane’s library and MEDLINE through PubMed. Publications were processed through multiple rounds of title, abstract and full-text screening, which culminated in 73 publications for the analysis. Studies employing live attenuated (LAIV), trivalent inactivated (TIV), or tetravalent inactivated (QIV) vaccines were considered for the analysis. Noncommercial and monovalent vaccines were excluded due to their limited use, especially in seasonal vaccine campaigns. Studies with low heterogeneity scores were analyzed using fixed effects models, while those with high scores were processed through mixed effect models. Data from RCTs and TNDs were normalized using a restricted estimation maximum likelihood (ML) methodology, followed by logistic regression. This allowed for presenting RCT and TND data as pooled results expressed as both VER and VE. Study findings Of the 2,993 publications that matched the researchers’ search strategy, only 123 studies from 73 publications were used in the final review and meta-analysis. Of these, nine studies were RCTs and 114 were TNDs. The analysis dataset was globally encompassing, with representation from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. RCT analyses revealed VER between -2% to 70% for sample sizes ranging from 85 to 7,515 in the nine included studies. The most commonly used vaccine was TIV, with QIV and LAIV used in one study each. Between-study heterogeneity was low, with six studies showing matches between vaccine strains and those in local circulation. TND results revealed sample sizes between 62 and 59,150, with TIV the most used vaccine, followed by QIV in 59 and 19 studies, respectively. VE in these studies ranged from -2% to 70%; however, unlike in RCT studies, between-study heterogeneity was very high. VE/VER normalization revealed that RCT studies overestimated VE by 10% more than matched TND studies. Nevertheless, this result was not significant, which suggests that TND is a viable and cost-effective alternative to RCT in SIV performance evaluation. Due to the low number of available RCTs, pooled estimates for RCT studies could not be calculated. However, the analyses highlight that the match between strains used in vaccine development and those in local circulation is the most crucial factor for determining vaccine performance. Performance improvements of almost 25% were noted between matched vaccine-circulating strain pairs when compared to unmatched pairings. TIV vaccines performed better than QIV, despite the higher number of strains included in the latter. This was a surprising result as VE should increase with the number of strains included in the vaccine, although this was already observed in previous work on children. Our understanding is that a match between the strains included in the vaccine and those that are predominantly circulating is the most influential factor. Hence, it is not relevant to have a high number of strains in a vaccine if they do not match the strains the vaccine aims to prevent.” LAIV vaccines were associated with extremely low effectiveness values, irrespective of the study methodology. However, these results are not generalizable, as LAIV vaccines were only documented in three of the 123 studies analyzed. Conclusions In the present study, researchers evaluated vaccine performance in preventing seasonal influenza infection using data from RCTs and TNDs, with VE as a normalization between these otherwise incomparable approaches. While RCTs had VE values that were 10% higher as compared to TND studies, these results are insignificant, thus highlighting the substitution of TNDs as a cost-effective real-time performance monitoring alternative to RCTs. TIVs were the most commonly used commercial vaccine, with better efficacy than QIVs and LAIVs. Pooled results could not be obtained for RCTs due to the lack of available studies; however, the current study identified vaccine strain matching with strains in local circulation as the most critical factor in VE, as this improved vaccine performance by up to 25% over unmatched pairs. This finding supports the WHO decision to establish influenza surveillance and monitoring systems to identify local strains for future vaccine development. Journal reference: Martins, J.

Eggo1 & …Mark Jit1 Show authors BMC Medicine volume 21, Article number: 301 (2023) Cite this article 1036 Accesses 7 Altmetric Metrics details The Original Article was published on 27 July 2023 A Research article to this article was published on 22 March 2023 AbstractWe recently published an article in BMC Medicine looking at the potential health and economic impact of paediatric vaccination using next-generation influenza vaccines in Kenya: a modelling study. In their commentary on our article, Lafond et al. highlight the potential importance of the wider benefits of vaccination on cost-effectiveness. Whilst we agree with many points raised in the commentary, we think it raises further interesting discussion points, specifically around model complexity, model assumptions and data availability. These points are both relevant to this manuscript but have wider implications for vaccine cost-effectiveness studies. Peer Review reports CommentaryWe thank Lafond et al. for their commentary on our cost-effectiveness analysis of next-generation influenza vaccines [1]. Lafond et al. raise some important points, highlighting the conservative nature of our estimates of the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Our study was limited by the data available, and we therefore agree we could not include some wider benefits that would potentially increase the economic impacts of both current and next-generation influenza vaccines.Lafond et al.’s commentary raises some further discussion points, firstly, the complex and important role of assumptions in the modelling work. For example, they discuss that vaccine effectiveness assumptions made may not capture the full benefits, as we do not consider the disease-modifying effects of vaccination but instead assume that vaccine immunity is sterilising (i.e. vaccinees are either fully protected against infection or not protected at all). Whilst this may result in underestimating benefits if vaccines are also highly effective against disease, it may also result in an overestimate of the benefits, because sterilising immunity in the model gives both direct protection of the individual and indirect protection to others—you cannot transmit influenza if you do not get infected. If the vaccine is instead only disease-modifying, transmission will still occur, potentially increasing the number of cases while decreasing the chance of severe disease. This demonstrates that changing assumptions has complex effects, and in our analysis, we aimed for an appropriate balance whilst acknowledging the limitations of such assumptions.The second area of discussion raised is the inclusion of broader benefits of vaccination, such as the impact on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Lafond et al. rightly highlight the importance of these benefits, and that in some circumstances it can be viable to quantify them. For our study however, local information needed for this, for example on age-specific antimicrobial prescribing for influenza, was not available. AMR rates vary enormously by location, both nationally and sub-nationally [2] and therefore using information from further afield in our Kenya analysis could be inappropriate. As Lafond et al. note, even wider impacts such as health equity could also have been included, but are beyond the scope of this (and many other) cost-effectiveness studies.We agree with Lafond et al. that it is important to raise awareness of the wider benefits of influenza vaccines that may underpin their full economic value [3, 4] and, where they cannot be easily quantified, to weigh them qualitatively in any decision. Finally, we note that the inclusion of such additional benefits of influenza vaccination would reinforce our main conclusion that next-generation vaccines could be a cost-effective intervention in Kenya.

These variants are produced through replication errors of the viral genome by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Seasonal epidemics of influenza are also known to occur because of new variants of influenza A virus (IAV), which are generated by the introduction of mutations by viral RdRp with low fidelity. Variants with different antigenicities appear because of mutations in envelope glycoproteins. In this study, we calculated and compared the mutation rates in genome replication of IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Average mutation rates per passage were 9.01 × 10–5 and 3.76 × 10–6 substitutions/site for IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 23.9-fold lower than that of IAV because of the proofreading activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex. Our data could be useful in establishing effective countermeasures against COVID-19.

Many variants of SARS-CoV-2 have appeared since its first isolation, causing a continuous pandemic in the world.Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes annual seasonal epidemics and pandemics. Seasonal influenza is caused by new variants with antigenicities different from those of the previous epidemic strain, which emerged by the accumulation of mutations introduced through replication errors of the viral genome by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), so called “antigenic drift”.Both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV are enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of approximately 29.8 kilobases, which is annotated to encode 14 ORFs (Open Reading Frames) and 27 proteins1, whereas IAV is a negative-stranded RNA virus, with eight segmented genomes of approximately 13.6 kilobases, which encode at least 10 viral proteins2. The RdRp of most RNA viruses, including IAV, has few proofreading abilities, and its fidelity in genome replication is low. Therefore, the mutation rates of RNA viruses are generally much higher than those of DNA viruses.However, RdRp complexes of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, are reported to have proofreading activity owing to 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity of the viral protein, nsp14, in their genome replication3,4. SARS-CoV-2 also has nsp14 with proofreading activity5.Influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are viral surface glycoproteins and the main determinants of viral antigenicity, which are recognized by the host immune system. Influenza and COVID-19 epidemics and pandemics are caused by variants with antigenicities different from those of previous epidemic or pandemic strains through the introduction of mutations into these viral surface glycoproteins. Therefore, investigating the mutation rates of the HA and NA genes of IAV and S gene of SARS-CoV-2 is very important for understanding the appearance of new epidemic variants and establishing appropriate countermeasures against these viral diseases.The extended duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to give rise to variants of the virus with new characteristics in terms of pathogenicity, antigenicity, and tropism, making this infectious disease difficult to control.Here, we determined the in vitro mutation rates of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of any immune pressure and analysed the characteristics of the mutations introduced into the IAV HA/NA and SARS-CoV-2 S genes.ResultsCalu-3 cells are susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infectionFirst, we examined the growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. Calu-3 cells, an adenocarcinoma cell line derived from human lung epithelial cells and susceptible to both viruses6,7,8,9, were used for this analysis, as the tested viruses are RNA viruses that cause acute respiratory diseases. Calu-3 cells were inoculated with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The titres of the progeny viruses were measured using a plaque assay. Both viruses showed similar growth kinetics and reached a plateau at 24–36 h post infection (hpi) (Fig. 1). The virus production yields of IAV at 24 hpi and SARS-CoV-2 at 36 hpi were 1.1 × 106 and 6.5 × 107 pfu/mL, respectively.Figure 1Similar growth kinetics between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells were infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times, and virus titres were measured by plaque assay. The bar plot represents the mean ± SD. hpi hours post infection.Full size imageMutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro is much lower than that of IAVTo calculate the mutation rates in the genome replication of IAV and SARS-CoV-2, each virus was serially passaged every 48 h in Calu-3 cells. After 15 serial passages, culture supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant after centrifugation and used for genetic analysis. For each virus, three independent lines of passages (P15-A, B, and C) were used.The HA [1769 nucleotides (nt)] and NA (1451 nt) genes for IAV and S gene (3838 nt) for SARS-CoV-2, which encode viral surface glycoproteins, were selected for gene sequence determination. Based on the RNA samples, after 15 passages of SARS-CoV-2 (SP15-A, -B and -C) and IAV (IP15-A, -B and -C), the HA and NA genes for IAV and S genes for SARS-CoV-2 were amplified by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and then cloned into the plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of 20 clones were determined for each RNA sample. The positions of the mutations introduced until passage 15 and the number of clones with the mutation are shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4.Figure 2Mutations detected in IAV HA gene after 15 serial passages in Calu-3 cells.

The mutations were highly frequent between 650 and 730 nt in HA (Fig. 2). The mutation at 1482 bp was also dominant in IP15-A and B. In contrast, there were no common mutations among the three passage lines in the coding region of NA (Fig. 3). The only mutation site found in all three passage lines was the C to G mutation at nucleotide position 1430 within the untranslated region. The number of mutation sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene was 13, which was much lower than that in the IAV HA and NA genes (Fig. 4). No common mutations were observed among the three passage lines of SARS-CoV-2.The 20 clones of IAV passage lines (IP15-A, -B, and -C) contained 76, 50, and 41 mutations in HA, and 31, 25, and 38 mutations in NA, respectively, whereas those of SARS-CoV-2 (SP15-A, -B, and -C) showed 3, 6, and 4 mutations in the S gene, respectively. The mutation rates were calculated based on this information and the data are summarized in Table 1. The average of mutation rates (mutations per nucleotide) of three passage lines after 15 passages were 1.35 × 10–3 (± 4.07 × 10–4) substitutions/site for IAV and 5.65 × 10–5 (± 1.63 × 10–5) for SARS-CoV-2. The average mutation rates per passage were 9.01 × 10–5 (± 2.71 × 10–5) substitutions/site/passage for IAV and 3.76 × 10–6 (± 1.09 × 10–6) for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 23.9-fold lower than that of IAV (Fig. 5).Table 1 Mutation rate of each viral gene after 15 serial passages and per passage. After 15 serial passages, the number of substitutions, including indels, was counted in each of the 20 clones of the three different passage lines of IAV (IP15) and SARS-CoV-2 (SP15). The average of each passage line was calculated and the substitution numbers were compared. Values represent mean ± SD. p < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney-U test).Full size tableFigure 5Number of mutations including deletions and insertions per 105 nucleotides/passage. The average number of mutations after 15 serial passages of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 are shown. The vertical axis represents the number of mutations per 105 nucleotides per passage.

The bar plot represents the mean ± SD. ****p < 0.0001 (Mann–Whitney-U test).Full size imageFrequencies of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations differ between IAV and SARS-CoV-2Next, we calculated the frequencies (mutation rates) of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the coding regions and insertions/deletions (indels) in each viral gene. The results are presented in Table 2. The average frequencies of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations were 1.21 × 10–3 (± 7.78 × 10–5) and 4.02 × 10–4 (± 5.97 × 10–4) substitutions/site for IAV HA, 5.32 × 10–4 (± 1.63 × 10–4) and 5.08 × 10–4 (± 1.08 × 10–4) for IAV NA, and 1.31 × 10–5 (± 0.00) and 1.31 × 10–5 (± 1.31 × 10–5) for SARS-CoV-2 S, respectively. The ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS) in HA, NA, and S genes were 3.0, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, suggesting a strong positive selection for HA.Table 2 Mutation rate of each viral gene that occurred as non-synonymous mutations, synonymous mutations, and insertions/deletions. The number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions was counted in the coding region: HA: 33–1733 nt; NA: 14–1423 nt; S: 17–3822 nt. Values represent mean ± SD. p < 0.01 (Mann–Whitney-U test).Full size tableIn IAV HA, non-synonymous mutations were concentrated in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 2). The non-synonymous mutations A672G (amino acid position: T214A) and A709G/A709C (amino acid position: K226R/K226T) were observed in many clones, suggesting that these amino acid substitutions are involved in the acquisition of growth advantage in Calu-3 cells. In the SARS-CoV-2 S gene, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were scattered in the gene (Fig. 4).Mutations are mostly transitions in the SARS-CoV-2 S geneWe further analysed the mutations introduced into the HA, NA, and S genes for transition and transversion mutations. The total numbers of transitions and transversions were 133 and 121 in the IAV HA and NA genes and eight and one in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene, respectively (Fig. 6). Thus, the frequencies of transition and transversion were similar in IAV, whereas most mutations in SARS-CoV-2 were transitions.Figure 6Nucleotide substitution in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 after 15 serial passages. Nucleotide substitutions were counted in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 after 15 serial passages. IP15 and SP15 indicate 15 serial passage lines of IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Colours indicate the type of substitutions: blue, transition; white, transversion.Full size imageIndels frequencies are similar between IAV and SARS-CoV-2The frequencies of indels in IAV HA and NA genes were 2.94 × 10–5 (± 2.94 × 10–5) and 7.09 × 10–5 (± 9.38 × 10–5) substitutions/site, respectively, and the average frequency for both genes was 4.82 × 10–5 (± 4.25 × 10–5) substitutions/site (Table 2). In contrast, that of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene was 1.75 × 10–5 (± 1.52 × 10–5) substitutions/site. There was no significant difference in the frequency of indels between IAV and SARS-CoV-2.DiscussionIn this study, we showed that the mutation rate of IAV was 9.01 × 10–5 substitutions/site/passage (that is, 4.51 × 10–5 substitutions/site/lifecycle with an IAV lifecycle of 24 h), whereas a previous study reported that those in the NS genes of two IAV strains, A/Aichi/1/87 (H1N1) and A/Aichi/12/92 (H3N2), in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were 1.8 × 10–5 and 0.8 × 10–5 substitutions/site/lifecycle10. The differences in the mutation rates may be due to differences in virus strains, viral genes, and cells, which were used for analyses. In the present study, we used the pandemic IAV strain A/Hyogo/YS/2011 (H1N1pdm09) and Calu-3 cells and analysed HA and NA genes.Our results revealed that the fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication was 23.9-fold higher than that of IAV. This higher fidelity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex is thought to be mainly due to the proofreading activity of the 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity of the viral protein, nsp145. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the frequencies of indels between IAV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 does not have a special mechanism to prevent insertion and deletion in its genome replication and the process works as well as that in IAV.In the human population, the evolutionary rates of IAV HA and NA genes were reported to be 4.84 × 10–3 and 3.87 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year, respectively11, whereas that of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene was previously reported to be 0.81–1.08 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year12,13, indicating an approximately 4.93-fold higher evolutionary rate of IAV than that of SARS-CoV-2. The annual number of cases of COVID-19 has been reported to be 85 million in 2020, 200 million in 2021, and 315 million for nine months in 202214, whereas that of seasonal influenza before the COVID-19 pandemic has been estimated to be 350 million to one billion per year15. Considering that the number of cases of seasonal influenza is greater than that of COVID-19 and that the fidelity of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication is much higher than that of IAV, the difference in the evolutionary rates between SARS-CoV-2 and IAV seems to be much less than expected according to the results of the present study. A longer infection period and higher replication numbers of SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals may result in a higher evolutionary rate in humans than in vitro.The ratio of non-synonymous/synonymous mutations (dN/dS) was 1.0 in IAV NA and SARS-CoV-2 S genes, whereas that of IAV HA gene was 3.0. This strongly suggests the positive selection for HA during serial passaging in Calu-3 cells. Most non-synonymous mutations in HA were observed in the RBDs (Fig. 2). Non-synonymous mutations A672G (amino acid position: T214A) and A709G/A709C (amino acid position: K226R/K226T) were observed in many clones. Among RBDs, the amino acid residues 200–241 have been reported to affect the binding affinity and specificity to the host cellular receptors16,17,18,19. Therefore, amino acid substitutions at positions 214 and 226 are likely to be involved in the acquisition of the growth advantage of IAV in Calu-3 cells.This positive selection of the HA gene may affect the calculation of the mutation rate of the HA gene. Therefore, we further compared the frequencies of synonymous mutations, which have no effect on protein function. The frequencies of synonymous mutations in the HA and NA genes after 15 passages were 4.02 × 10–4 and 5.08 × 10–4 substitutions/site, respectively, and they were not significantly different (Table 2). In contrast, that of the SARS-CoV-2 S gene was 1.31 × 10–5 substitutions/site and was 30.7- or 38.8-fold lower than that of HA or NA, respectively. This indicates that the mutation rate of the S gene was significantly lower than that of the HA and NA genes, even with the bias of positive selection for the HA gene being considered.We observed that most mutations in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 after 15 passages were transitions. This may be a feature of the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, as it is consistent with a previous report that the major mutational type found in the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 strains identified worldwide was transitions20.Taken together, we revealed that the in vitro mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much lower than that of IAV because of the proof-reading activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex. This suggests that the reduction in the number of infected cases prevents the appearance of new variants with different antigenicities, increased infectivity, or higher pathogenicity, and would be important to terminate the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsCellsVeroE6 cells stably expressing human TMPRSS2 (Vero/TMPRSS2 cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Shutoku Matsuyama (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan)21. The cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank in Japan (JCRB no. JCRB1819). Vero/TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Fujifilm Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Viruses and virus titrationInfluenza A virus (IAV) A/Hyogo/YS/2011 (H1N1pdm09) and SARS-CoV-2 JPN/NGS/SC-1/2020 (GISAID Accession ID: EPI_ISL_481254) were used. To isolate a single clone of each virus strain, a single plaque isolation was performed three times in MDCK cells for IAV and twice in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells for SARS-CoV-2.IAV or SARS-CoV-2 clones isolated from a single plaque were propagated in MDCK cells in MEM containing 1 × Vitamin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.1% BSA (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.00075% Trypsin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or Vero/TMPRSS2 cells in DMEM containing 1% FBS22.Plaque assays for IAV were performed as previously described23,24. For SARS-CoV-2, a plaque assay was performed with monolayer cultures of Vero/TMPRSS2 cells on a 12-well plate. After virus adsorption, cells were over-layered with 1 × MEM containing 0.7% agarose, 1.5% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 days. The cells were fixed with ethanol: acetic acid (5:1) for 2 h at 24 °C and then stained with an amido-black solution. For both viruses, a single plaque isolation was performed before fixation.All experiments using IAV or SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level (BSL)-2 or BSL-3 laboratory at Nagasaki University.Analyses of growth kinetics of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cellsCalu-3 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates. After 24 h, cells were infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times after infection, and the titres of progeny viruses were measured by plaque assay.Serial blind passages of the virusesCalu-3 cells (1.6 × 106 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 and then incubated for 48 h. After incubation, the culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged (10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min) to sediment cell debris. The supernatants were diluted 10 times with DMEM and then inoculated into freshly prepared Calu-3 cells in 6-well plates. This process was repeated 15 times. Serial viral passages were independently performed in three lines for each virus.Viral RNA extraction and RT-PCRViral RNA was extracted from the supernatants after each passage using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The IAV HA and NA genes and SARS-CoV-2 S gene were amplified by RT-PCR using the PrimeScript II High Fidelity One Step RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Primers used to amplify each viral gene are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Sequence determinationEach viral gene amplified by RT-PCR was ligated to the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Takara Bio). The transformants were plated on LB plates containing ampicillin. After incubation for 18 h, 20 colonies were picked and the nucleotide sequences of the HA, NA, or S genes in each clone were determined using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 1.Quantification and statistical analysisAll graphs are plotted as mean ± standard deviation. The data were analysed using Graph Pad Prism version 9.4.1 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t-test, as indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. In all figures, ∗ denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.

Good Question: How do you know if your dog needs the canine flu vaccine? 02:17 ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Canine influenza cases appear to be slowing in Minnesota, according to animal health experts.There were over 100 confirmed cases of the disease across 10 counties starting in April. But there's only been one case confirmed since mid-July, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health says.As cases decline, the animal health board says it should be safe to take dogs back to the park."Be smart and be safe and you should definitely feel comfortable taking your pup out to play with other dogs," said senior veterinarian in charge of companion animals, Dr. Veronica Bartsch.

By Barbara Alden Wilson Updated on August 9, 2023 Medically reviewed by Natalie D. Muth, M.D. Close Paul Bradbury/Getty Images It's no fun when your child comes down with a cold or the flu. No one wants their kid to feel crummy, wake multiple times through the night, or miss school. So it's not surprising that many myths circulate about how parents can help their kids avoid or treat cold or flu viruses. There are some research-backed strategies to reduce your child's risk of getting sick and help them feel better faster. But there are just as many misconceptions. For example, can you get sick from being exposed to cold weather? (No, exposure to germs makes you sick.) Can you eat ice cream when you have a cold, or will it make cold symptoms worse? (Yes you can eat ice cream, and no, it won't make you feel word.) With experts' help, we set the record straight about 12 common cold and flu myths and share proven ways to help you and your family stay healthy all year long. 01 of 12 Myth: You Can Catch a Cold From Being Cold Most people know that only a cold virus causes a cold. But many believe that going outside not properly dressed (or with wet hair) on a cold day will worsen the symptoms of a cold virus. This is untrue. "I think this comes from people noticing that more people get sick during the colder months, and that is true," says Susan Coffin, MD, medical director of infection prevention and control at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The real reason people get sicker in the winter? Proximity. People generally spend more time indoors and come in closer contact with people who are coughing and sneezing. So viruses tend to "make the rounds" and strike more people during the winter. You may also notice that your child's nose is runny when they are playing outside in the winter. That may be because cold, dry air can irritate the nasal lining, not because they have caught a virus. How To Protect Newborns in Cold Weather 02 of 12 Myth: If You Don't Have a Fever, You're Not Contagious Colds are highly contagious, whether you have a fever or not. Symptoms like a cough or runny nose might be present without an elevated temperature. And sometimes a fever shows up later in an illness, but the virus can spread before the thermometer registers it. Colds are most contagious two to four days into an illness, but people can continue spreading the virus up to two weeks after symptoms began. Adults and older children with colds generally have a low fever or no fever. Young children, though, often run a fever during a cold. The flu is contagious too, fever or no fever. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most healthy adults may be able to infect others from one day prior to showing symptoms and for five to seven days after that. Some young children with weakened immune systems may be contagious for longer than a week. The Do's and Don'ts of Fighting a Fever 03 of 12 Myth: Staying Away From Sick People Is the Only Way to Stay Well Staying away from sick people is one way to avoid getting sick, but it's not foolproof. After all, people can be contagious without showing any symptoms (see Myth #2). Experts point to the flu vaccine as the best preventive measure against the flu. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the CDC on vaccine issues, recommends that all people age 6 months and older receive an annual flu vaccination. Unfortunately, no vaccines help protect against colds. But washing hands regularly will help you and your kids avoid both colds as well as the flu. 04 of 12 Myth: The Flu Vaccine Causes the Flu Flu vaccines do not cause the flu. The viruses in flu shots have been killed (or "inactivated," as the pros say), which means they won't cause infection, according to the CDC. Getting a flu shot may cause mild symptoms that may feel a little like the flu, though. "Most often, people misattribute the achy side effect that can sometimes follow the flu shot with the onset of the flu itself," says Dr. Coffin. Unlike the flu shot, the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) does contain live viruses. The viruses are weakened, though, and don't cause the flu either. Mild reactions from the nasal spray flu vaccine may include a runny nose, sore throat, and headache. These side effects are mild and clear up quickly, especially compared to the symptoms of the flu. 05 of 12 Myth: Getting Vaccinated Every Year Isn't Necessary The protection you received against the flu one year won't help you the next. For one thing, the primary flu strains that circulate change from year to year. That's why the flu vaccine is tweaked annually. Second, the protection you get from a flu vaccine declines over time, explains Dr. Coffin. Even if the flu vaccine you received the year before is a match for the virus strain you're exposed to, your body isn't likely to "remember" how to fend it off many months later. 06 of 12 Myth: If You Don't Get a Flu Shot by January, It's Too Late Get your annual flu vaccine is helpful whenever you get it. "It's never too late," says Dr. Coffin. Flu season often peaks in February but can extend all the way into May. Because no one can accurately predict when the flu wanes in any given year, as long as a vaccine is available, you should get it for you and your children. Your state or local health department has a list of locations in your area where the vaccine is still available. That said, the earlier in flu season you get the vaccine, the better. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises that kids get their vaccines by Halloween. How the Pandemic May Still Affect Delivery Room Rules 07 of 12 Myth: If You Hate Shots, You Can Just Get the Nasal Spray Instead The nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) is recommended for use in healthy people ages 2 to 49 who are not pregnant. But the CDC does not recommend FluMist for certain people, including: Children or teens receiving aspirinChildren younger than 5 years old with a history of recurrent wheezing or asthmaPeople at high risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease, such as asthma or reactive airways diseasePeople with medical conditions such as diabetes or kidney failurePeople with illnesses that weaken the immune system, or who take medications that can weaken the immune systemPeople who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs or who are allergic to any of the nasal spray vaccine componentsPregnant people Bottom line: Consult a doctor before deciding which vaccine is best for you or your children. 08 of 12 Myth: If You Get the Flu, You'll Be Immune After That There are many different strains of flu that circulate every year. While you may build up immunity against one strain for a few months after being infected, you are still vulnerable to catching other strains. It's possible to get the flu twice in one year. Not only that, but having one type of flu does not provide protection against colds, COVID-19, or a virus that causes pneumonia, says Dr. Coffin. 09 of 12 Myth: Your Cold Could Turn Into the Flu The flu and the common cold are caused by different viruses, so a cold can't "morph" into the flu. Because the two types of illnesses have similar symptoms, however, it can be challenging to tell the difference between these illnesses based on symptoms alone. Generally, a bout of the flu feels worse than a cold, with more intense symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and a dry cough. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose but less likely to develop serious complications pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalization. Kids who are younger than 5, have asthma or other chronic health disorders, or have a weakened immune system themselves or in their family are all at high risk for flu complications and should get tested for the virus. Doctors can swab their nose or throat and detect whether they have the flu within minutes. Flu Symptoms in Babies and When to Call the Doctor 10 of 12 Myth: The Flu Isn't That Serious It's true that most people who get the flu will have a mild case and won't need medical care. Usually, they'll fully recover in less than two weeks. But make no mistake: The CDC warns that complications from the flu can be deadly. In fact, the CDC estimates that between 12,000 and 52,000 people die each year from the flu and up to 710,000 are hospitalized. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections are examples of flu-related complications. The flu can also make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the flu. People at high risk for flu complications include children under 5, pregnant people, and people with chronic illnesses. 11 of 12 Myth: Flu Meds Will Clear Up Your Cold Too Antiviral drugs like Tamiflu work only against flu viruses. They won't reduce symptoms from the common cold, COVID-19, or any other flu-like illnesses. If you or your child has the flu, talk to a doctor about whether antiviral drugs are appropriate. The CDC recommends Tamiflu for patients who are under 2 or older than 65, who have certain chronic medical conditions, or who have severe flu symptoms. 12 of 12 Myth: You Should Avoid Dairy When You're Sick Phlegm is the thick, sticky mucus that drips down the back of the throat when a person has a cold. Eating dairy products like milk and ice cream might make mucus feel thicker, but it won't increase phlegm production. "Drinking milk may make phlegm thicker and more irritating to the throat than it would normally be, but it doesn't cause the body to make more phlegm," says James Steckelberg, MD, professor of medicine at Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minnesota. In fact, Dr. Steckelberg says that cold sufferers may benefit from consuming dairy products—such as cream-based soups, ice cream, pudding, or milk—since these can be soothing on sore throats and provide calories people otherwise might not get while feeling lousy. So, if the only thing your kid wants to eat when they're sick is ice cream, go ahead and let them! 5 Foods to Help Kids Fight Colds and the Flu Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Influenza A, RSV and norovirus are circulating on the Peninsula. Courtesy Tima Miroshnichenko/Pexels.com.COVID-19 may be getting the lion’s share of media attention in the past few weeks as concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the illness, are increasing in wastewater, but three other viruses that can cause serious illness have also been on the rise in the past six weeks, according to an analysis of local wastewater samples. The wastewater is analyzed by Stanford’s Sewer Coronavirus Alert Network (SCAN) to identify parts of viruses’ genetic code that are shed in human waste and measure their concentrations. The data helps public health authorities track the prevalence of certain diseases in the population. Influenza type A, norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are again showing increased activity, and depending on where one lives on the Peninsula, one of these nasty bugs could be the cause of fever, chills, aching, cough, diarrhea and vomiting. Though the viruses were at their peaks in winter and early spring, awareness that these viruses continue to be present and active is important given that people are gathering for the summer, traveling and more often than not aren’t wearing masks. Influenza A, for example, is commonly thought of as a winter disease, yet in some areas is on the rise.

Norovirus is trending upwards in southern San Mateo County, while cases of influenza appear to be highest in Palo Alto. Here’s a rough breakdown of the state of the top viruses in local watersheds: Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant: Influenza type A, RSV and norovirus Influenza A is at its highest concentration since April, according to wastewater samples taken from the Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant. It bottomed out between July 18 and July 30, and has now risen to four times the amount that was found on July 16. RSV, another respiratory illness that can cause prolonged coughing and fever, particularly in children and older adults, had a spike that began on July 24 after bottoming out between July 19 and July 23. After a peak on Aug. 3, concentrations are declining again, according to the wastewater data. Norovirus, which is highly infectious, can cause severe gastrointestinal illness and is particularly dangerous for elderly people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has remained active throughout the spring and summer, never getting to zero. After the latest rise detected on July 25, the concentration dropped by Aug. 7 to about one third of that, with a slight uptick starting to show again. Silicon Valley Clean Water: Norovirus dominates At the treatment plant in Redwood City, norovirus concentrations for southern San Mateo County are again rising after a previous wave around mid-July. The virus reached its lowest level in six months on July 26, but since then has steadily risen three times higher as of Aug. 8. RSV has had multiple spikes in the sewershed starting June 28. The concentrations rose rapidly, then plummeted, then rose and plummeted again four different times through July and early August. The last increase on Aug. 2 was the highest in the last three months. The good news is that, as of Aug. 8, it had dropped to zero. City of Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant: Influenza is on the rise Concentrations of influenza virus in the wastewater have continued to tick up in the last six weeks, according to the sampling, with a series of waves in the last three months. RSV and norovirus, while showing increased concentrations in late July and early August, appear to be slowly trending downward. San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility: Norovirus holds steady While influenza and RSV numbers have declined sharply since late July, norovirus concentrations continue to hold relatively steady, showing the virus is still active in the community. CODIGA (Stanford): A blip on the graph With the Stanford population at its lowest during the summer, the university’s wastewater surveillance shows no detection of influenza and RSV, with only negligible amounts of norovirus. Mpox virus makes a brief return. Although it made headlines earlier in spring, Mpox, which has been spread through close sexual contact between gay men, hasn’t been detected in wastewater for months, until recently. Still, its appearance was brief. In Palo Alto wastewater, it was present in July 21 samples in moderate concentrations; also in late July, it was present in high concentrations in Sunnyvale’s sewage.

It’s interesting that Influenza A has risen so much in Palo Alto. By the way, mpox isn’t just spread through gay sex. Women have also gotten mpox. When a person has symptoms of mpox, be careful to wear gloves while handling their clothes, sheets, and eating utensils. Thank you.

Undercooked ground beef and chicken are primary culprits as are leafy greens (i.e. Romaine lettuce) and mayonaise-based offerings. Kitchen and foodserver hygiene are outside factors that also come into play if one is dining at a restaurant. Where I am originally from (Kenya) food poisoning is relatively rare because most of the population has developed an immunity to these various forms of food poisoning and the same can be said for inhabitants of Mexico. In America, not enough people have gotten deathly ill from tainted food products to create a natural immunity. Log in to Reply Leave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.

By Reuters Reuters Founded in 1851, Reuters is a news agency owned by Thomson Reuters. With 200 locations worldwide and 2,500 journalists, Reuters is one of the largest news agencies in the world. Reuters has remained true to the Trust Principles of independence, integrity, and freedom from bias, working relentlessly to bring news from the source and from every corner of the world. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on August 11, 2023 Close WINDHOEK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Namibia has suspended imports of live poultry, birds, and poultry products from Denmark and the Netherlands following the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the two European countries. European countries have borne the brunt of avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, in recent years which has led to the culling of millions of birds in the past two years, affecting the supply of poultry meat and eggs. The suspension will affect poultry products packaged in Denmark on or after June 28 and poultry products from the Netherlands packaged on or after July 11, Namibia's veterinary services directorate said in a statement dated Aug. 2, which was released on Friday. Consignments of affected poultry products will be sent back to their country of origin or destroyed at the importer's cost, it said, adding cooked poultry meat products for commercial purposes may still be imported under a veterinary permit. The southern African nation consumes an estimated 2,500 tons of chicken every month, relying on imports mainly from neighbouring South Africa, to meet demand.

Updated: 4:59 PM EDT Aug 10, 2023 FIVE ON YOUR HEALTH TONIGHT, AN URGENT EFFORT TO GET MORE AMERICANS VACCINATED B FOR HALLOWEEN. HERE TO EXPLAIN IS DR. RICK MALLEY, AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AT BOSTON CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL. NICE TO SEE YOU. DR. HEY, DR. MALLEY, IT’S GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. THE CDC SAYS IT’S FOCUSING ON AT LEAST THREE RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES THIS FALL. AND OF COURSE, IT INCLUDES COVID 19 INFLUENZA AND RSV. IF IF I COULD ASK YOU IF THERE IS ONE, WHICH ONE DO YOU WORRY MOST ABOUT FOR KIDS? I MEAN, IN GENERAL, FOR KIDS, BOTH RSV AND INFLUENZA CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS. RSV IS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND ALSO FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE EITHER CARDIAC OR LUNG DISEASE. RSV CAN BE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS. SO THOSE WOULD BE THE TWO THAT WE WOULD FOCUS ON THE MOST, ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE, AS WE KNOW, COVID CAN SOMETIMES BE DANGEROUS IN CHILDREN AS WELL. SO HEALTH OFFICIALS IN SOME STATES, DR., ARE SAYING THAT THEY PLAN TO PROMOTE A NEW STRATEGY AND IT’S CALLED FLU BEFORE. BU WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU KNOW, I THINK IT’S A VERY CUTE AND CLEVER WAY TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT HALLOWEEN IS A PRETTY GOOD TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR LOVED ONES AND YOURSELVES ARE ALL VACCINATED AGAINST MANY OF THESE RESPIRATORY VIRUSES BECAUSE IT’S AROUND NOVEMBER THAT WE START SEEING AN UPTICK IN MOST OF THOSE VIRUSES. AND WE EXPECT THAT THE SAME WILL BE TRUE THIS YEAR. DO I GET IT? FLU BEFORE BU RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE SAID IT. I DIDN’T SAY IT RIGHT. AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE VACCINES AVAILABLE TO PROTECT MANY CHILDREN FROM COVID AND FLU AND RSV WHEN HERE WE ARE. WHERE ARE WE? WE’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST. WHEN SHOULD PARENTS START THINKING ABOUT THAT OUT? WELL, YOU KNOW, SO IT’S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THERE’S THERE’S REALLY THREE DIFFERENT ISSUES. ONE OF THEM IS THE FLU VACCINE, WHICH I THINK MANY PARENTS HAVE KNOWN THAT THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD RECEIVE THE FLU VACCINE AS LONG AS THEY’RE OLDER THAN SIX MONTHS OF AGE. AND THERE’S NO CONTRAINDICATIONS. AND THAT REALLY SHOULD BE DONE PROBABLY BEFORE HALLOWEEN. THE COVID VACCINE, WE’RE SORT OF WAITING TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SORT OF UPDATE VERSIONS THAT WILL BE COMING OUT. PROBABLY THIS FALL. AND I THINK YOUR VIEWERS SHOULD STAY TUNED FOR MORE INFORMATION FROM THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND THEN FOR RSV, THIS IS A VERY RECENT DEVELOPMENT. IT’S IT’S ACTUALLY A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY APPROVED AND THAT WE ARE ALL VERY EXCITED TO SEE IMPLEMENTED AND THAT IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT THE CDC IS RECOMMENDING FOR ANY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT MONTHS, BECAUSE THAT’S REALLY THE PEAK PERIOD IN LIFE WHERE RSV IN CHILDHOOD CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

NL – Article speedbump Captcha Email * Sign up for free Explore The symptoms came on without warning. “We had dipped out of the dissecting room at St Thomas’s for a mid-morning break and strolled along the Embankment to Lambeth Bridge,” wrote microbiologist T. H. Pennington of a particular day in medical school. “Going there I felt fine. Coming back was terrible because of fever and aching limbs.” Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Ed Susman, a newspaper delivery boy in upstate New York, was hit even more suddenly: “I distinctly recall feeling very warm in one of the tenement houses where I had a number of customers. I walked out on the back porch, and I literally felt as if I had been hit by a moving wall. My knees buckled and I fell back against the wall of the building. I truly do not remember how I finished the route.”A mysterious new respiratory virus was on the move out of China, cutting through a global population with virtually no immunity. But the year wasn’t 2020—it was 1957, 63 years earlier. Before the global H2N2 influenza pandemic wound down, it would kill 116,000 people in the United States (the equivalent of about 232,000 today) and as many as 4 million people around the world.Millions dead is a catastrophe by any measure. Yet this pandemic has almost entirely vanished from cultural memory. Will anybody in 2083, 63 years later, have heard of COVID-19? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The story begins with eerie familiarity: the discovery of a novel respiratory virus in China in February 1957. The Chinese government failed to promptly alert the international community of their discovery, and the new influenza strain quickly stormed its way across Asia. It wasn’t until April, when Hong Kong, then a British colony, experienced a 250,000-case epidemic that global media began to take notice. In April and May, the virus arrived at U.S. military bases in Korea and Japan. Outbreaks began stateside by June, first at military camps in Rhode Island, then California. From there, the virus unfurled across the continent. Ed Susman’s experience was not unusual. The H2N2 flu frequently began with suddenly “wobbly legs and a chill followed by prostration”; sore throat; fever between 102 and 104 degrees; head, chest and backache; and a dry cough—all followed by severe fatigue. A mysterious new respiratory virus was on the move out of China. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Susman eventually recovered, remembering little other than mostly sleeping through the ordeal. In fact, most patients recovered within four to five days, though some experienced relapse, sometimes worse than before. When the virus killed, it did so in grisly fashion. Most who died experienced extreme difficulty breathing, skin discoloration from low blood oxygenation, bloody coughing, and bacterial infections that overwhelmed their battered respiratory systems.Death generally came in less than a week. In fact, two-thirds of those who died succumbed within 48 hours of hospital admission. (At the time, intensive care units and antivirals did not exist, and ventilators were fairly primitive.) One in five didn’t even make it to the hospital in time for what limited help was on offer. Like the 1918 flu before it, young people were uniquely susceptible to catching this virus. Some older adults might have had immunity from the 1889-90 flu pandemic, which could have been caused by a similar strain. But this resistance to infection was outweighed by H2N2’s deadliness for that age cohort—for those over 65, it was almost 20 times as high. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . During the summer of 1957, superspreader events among young people at barracks, camps, and conventions saw infection rates of 30 to 89 percent. Within a few weeks of schools opening early for the year in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, some 60,000 people caught the virus. BACK OF THE CLASS: The H2N2 influenza pandemic, which killed upward of 4 million people around the world, seemed to rapidly fade from cultural memory. But in 1957, it swept through populations with vigor, often sickening vast swaths of young people at a time (pictured above: a nearly empty classroom in Sweden that year, with the one healthy pupil present). Will COVID also be a flash in the pan in our collective memory? Credit: Scanpix / Wikimedia Commons.In general, few of these initial outbreaks resulted in recorded deaths. This, in combination with the crudity of data reporting at the time, obscured the true effect H2N2 would have on the population, particularly the older and more at-risk. Further public events were approved, and the tone was set for the coming response. This would prove a fatal mistake. Young people soon returned home from their summer gatherings, spreading H2N2 across the country. When schools opened nationwide in the fall, infection rates ranged from 40 to 60 percent. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Community spread was well under way in the American West by mid-September, with the East Coast getting hit in mid-October. The fall wave was so massive that almost two-thirds of students fell ill. During New York’s fall peak in early October, 29 percent of school attendees were absent at once. In Manhattan, it was 43 percent.The government did relatively little to mitigate the spread. Schools typically remained open. Large gatherings were, by and large, permitted. Stay-at-home orders were nonexistent. “No efforts were made to quarantine individuals or groups,” wrote one epidemiologist, “and a deliberate decision was made not to cancel or postpone large meetings.” This wasn’t for lack of insight. Stringent, sometimes restrictive public health measures were a feature of the 1918 pandemic as well as more recent polio outbreaks. Americans had witnessed contact tracing, limitations on public meetings and indoor spaces, mask mandates, and even citywide lockdowns. But virtually none of these tools were enlisted to slow H2N2. This was in part because it was believed such efforts were “futile” given how quickly and easily the virus was spreading. And also because work on an effective vaccine was underway by spring 1957—and completed by that summer. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Upon seeing reports about H2N2 in Hong Kong, Maurice Hilleman, soon-to-be head of the U.S. vaccine campaign, recalled exclaiming, “My God … This is the pandemic. It’s here!” Within days of receiving samples of the virus, his lab was able to identify the novel H2N2. By May 12, the U.S. Public Health Service was providing vaccine manufacturers with virus cultures. And a vaccine estimated to be between 53 and 60 percent effective was in testing by June. Military recruits began to receive the vaccine in July, and the first doses were administered to the U.S. public in August. About 30 to 40 million doses were ultimately administered in the U.S.Still, for many it was too little, too late.This deadly experience seems to have vanished, even beyond the footnotes of collective memory.People at the time were aware of the pandemic—hearing about its spread, symptoms, precautions, and possible social impacts on the radio, on television, and in the newspaper. According to a September 1957 Gallup poll, 92 percent of U.S. adults knew of H2N2. More than three-quarters knew of the vaccine, and almost two-thirds planned to get it. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . One possible explanation for the collective amnesia is its historical context. In recent times before COVID, infectious disease typically didn’t pose much threat in the U.S. In 2014, for example, infectious disease caused about 34 deaths per 100,000 people—about the same amount as chronic lower respiratory diseases like asthma. The 1950s were different. In that decade, the rate was roughly twice as high, with illnesses like polio still killing thousands each year. And, in living memory, rates of infectious disease death had been astronomical—about 200 per 100,000 people in 1940, 300 in 1930, and almost 1,000 during the 1918 pandemic. This familiarity with infectious disease death suggests that, though the public may have been initially alarmed at the appearance of a new flu strain, it quickly became clear H2N2 was not a return to 1918, lowering the sustained concern.That was reflected in news coverage, says Catherine Carstairs, a medical and health historian at the University of Guelph in Canada, who recently worked on a broad study of media of the time. “There were reports when H2N2 originated and arrived,” she says. “But by the New Year there was basically nothing.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The fall wave was so massive that almost two-thirds of students fell ill. Another element to the pandemic’s omission from history is that, unlike the 1918 flu, which disproportionately killed young people, H2N2’s age curve matched typical patterns of influenza death, which, like COVID, more frequently fells the elderly and infirm. “As a society, we seem to care a lot less when it’s older people who pass,” Carstairs says. “Compare H2N2 to the historical attention and panic around polio, which mostly impacted children. We tend to mourn much more extensively the loss of people whom we feel it’s ‘not their time.’”There’s also something almost ordinary about the nature of influenza. It’s not exotic. The symptoms are familiar, not sensational as with Ebola or smallpox. All of us inevitably catch it in some form, and almost all recover. “Novelty tends to stick in people’s minds,” says George Dehner, an environmental historian and author of Influenza: A Century of Science and Public Health Response. Dehner likens it to how people in the 19th century were more alarmed by cholera than tuberculosis, even though tuberculosis had a higher death toll. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Instead of death or illness, it turns out, much of what people remember about pandemics is the disruption to everyday life: the lockdowns, the mask mandates, the social distancing. In 1957-58, there wasn’t much of that. Perhaps this bodes well for our ability to remember and learn from COVID. Although not necessarily. “It’s a function of human memory that we compartmentalize and shove away unpleasant times,” Dehner says. And, if past is prologue, it will take a herculean effort to keep the tragedies of COVID in the minds of the public and policymakers to prepare and respond effectively when the next pandemic comes—which it inevitably will.

A hawk found in Treptow-Köpenick and a peregrine falcon in Steglitz-Zehlendorf are affected, the Senate Department for Consumer Protection announced on Friday. The findings have reportedly been confirmed by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health. Already evidence of the virus subtype H5N1 in BerlinThis year, the virus subtype H5N1 has already been detected in a swan and three seagulls in Berlin. At the end of last year, the Berlin Zoo had to close for weeks after an avian influenza detection in a water bird. The highly contagious H5N1 subtype is a particular problem for large farms and fattening farms, where culling - the precautionary killing of animals - is carried out. Nationwide, the FLI last reported about 150 cases in wild birds for the month of June. Appeal to citizens: Report dead birdsThe Berlin authority called on citizens to report findings of dead waterfowl, ravens or birds of prey to the competent veterinary and food inspectorate of the district. Then an investigation could be initiated. "Under no circumstances" should one touch sick or dead animals. Feathers should also not be collected. People who keep poultry should now especially protect their animals from contact with wild birds, it said. Feed, litter and drinking troughs should be inaccessible to wild birds. Seagulls particularly affected this yearDue to bird migration, avian influenza was rampant in this country for a long time, especially in the cold season. In 2021, there were cases for the first time in the summer, especially in northern Europe. In 2022, there was a real summer wave. Experts assume that the pathogen is now present in European wild bird populations all year round. This year, it is again affecting seabird colonies in particular, especially gulls.

Major pharmacy chains have begun rolling out flu and RSV vaccine appointments and say they'll offer the updated Covid-19 boosters when they're available. Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle/AP/FILE CNN — State and local health officials across the United States are bracing for a rise in respiratory illnesses this fall, and they are making plans to urge everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated against Covid-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus once those shots become available. “We are very, very concerned about the upcoming pan-respiratory season,” Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said in a briefing Wednesday. exp pfizer covid vaccine updated church 080202ASEG1 cnni world _00001826.png video Pfizer expects updated Covid-19 vaccines to be approved by end of August Local health departments will work with their state and federal counterparts to encourage eligible people to get their flu shots, updated Covid-19 boosters and RSV vaccines, says Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “The focus for the fall will be clear and integrated messaging, especially for people who are most at risk, because we’re talking about a unique new normal of coexisting respiratory viruses,” she said. “There’s conscientious thought being given to how to communicate this. It’s really about public health and keeping everybody safe during a season when respiratory diseases happen.” On a national scale, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also is preparing for the threat of respiratory illnesses this fall. “Protecting against respiratory diseases this fall is a central focus for CDC. Efforts will include preparing Americans for what to expect, helping them understand the risk for illness in their communities, and providing information on how they can protect themselves,” spokesperson Kathleen Conley said in an email. “CDC will use every lever at its disposal to help people understand how they can protect themselves and their families from serious illness, including staying up to date on their vaccinations.” Getting vaccinated before Halloween Some major US pharmacy chains have begun rolling out flu and RSV vaccine appointments, and an updated Covid-19 booster shot could be ready by the latter part of September. Close up Doctor making a vaccination in the shoulder of patient boy or child person, coronavirus,covid-19 vaccine disease preparing for human clinical trials vaccination shot, Injection on Arm tong2530/Adobe Stock Vaccines for flu and RSV now available ahead of fall virus season Health officials recommend that adults 60 and older get vaccinated against RSV as soon as their doctors advise doing so, and everyone older than 6 months is urged to get their flu shots, preferably by Halloween — an approach called “flu before boo.” As for the new Covid-19 booster, health officials are waiting for the US Food and Drug Administration to officially approve it and then for the CDC to make recommendations on it. But they plan to recommend Covid-19 boosters before Halloween as well. “I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think of Covid-flu before boo,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said during Wednesday’s briefing. “For many people, we really want to make this easy and simple.” She added that the flu shot and the updated Covid-19 vaccine, when it’s available, may be given at the same time for people who might want to have a single appointment. “There is not a single vaccine that is going to be 100%. But having said that, the efficacy of these vaccines is so high in preventing some of our worst outcomes that that is the main thing we want to drive home,” Juthani said. “And that is going to make a difference in the overall health of a person who receives them.” Where to get vaccinated this fall Pharmacies and doctor’s offices will continue to offer flu, Covid-19 and RSV vaccines this fall, but some states are also considering organizing vaccination events.

Text copy space Евгения Матвеец/Moment RF/Getty Images CDC approves RSV vaccines for older adults, expects availability this fall “One of the other lessons that we learned from Covid is that you can’t wait for people to come to you. You have to really make an effort to go meet them where they’re at,” Dr. Joseph Kanter, state health officer and medical director at the Louisiana Department of Health, said during Wednesday’s briefing. “As we looked at the back-to-school season, we’re leveraging one of the more effective programs we had during Covid, which is bringing vaccine out to people. We have teams that we instituted during Covid that we’re now leveraging for flu and RSV, to go out into the communities and host vaccine events at convenient locations for families,” he said. “We’re going to continue those campaigns because we know we need to reduce barriers wherever we find them, and we can help bring vaccines to people.” Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS are among the major US pharmacy chains that have begun rolling out flu and RSV vaccine appointments already. Walgreens is now offering both shots, the company said last week. Anyone 3 or older can get a flu shot at the pharmacy, and adults 60 and older are eligible for the RSV vaccine. Rite Aid also plans to announce availability of those vaccines soon, according to a company spokesperson. CVS is scheduling flu vaccinations, as well as allowing walk-in vaccinations at certain pharmacies. The chain is also preparing to offer the new RSV vaccines. Those chains have said they will offer the new Covid-19 boosters once they’re available. Entering ‘uncharted territory’ Although it’s hard to predict exactly how much flu, Covid-19 and RSV infections the United States may see this fall and winter, state health officials said they’re putting plans in place now to prepare for possible surges. okrasiuk/Adobe Stock As a summer wave of Covid-19 hits the US, questions about vaccines, quarantine and testing are back “We’re in uncharted territory. We don’t really know what this season is going to look like, and it’s going to look different in different areas of the country,” Juthani said. “One of the things we are doing in Connecticut is meeting with our children’s hospitals, understanding what their plan is going to be for if we see a surge starting this fall,” she said, referring specifically to RSV preparations. “So this is the type of planning that happens at the state level across the United States.” As health officials plan for the worst but hope for the best, they are closely monitoring data on how many respiratory illnesses are now being reported in the United States – as well as viral spread in the Southern Hemisphere and around the world. “We are all watching closely the respiratory season. It’s something that state health officials are always preparing for every fall, particularly this fall,” Dr. Anne Zink, chief medical officer for the state of Alaska and president of Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said during Wednesday’s briefing. “Flu continues to circulate. We’re watching closely what’s happening down in the Southern Hemisphere right now. Last year, we saw over 9 million illnesses, 4 million medical visits, 10,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths are associated with influenza,” she said. “However, we did see that vaccine prevented 1.8 million of those illnesses, 1 million of his medical visits, 22,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 deaths.” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. Each year, she noted, RSV appears to cause about 2.1 million hospital visits for children younger than 1 and up to 300 pediatric deaths. Among adults, RSV causes up to 160,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths a year. Also, “we continue to see Covid,” Zink said. “It continues to spread and be around.” Covid-19 was associated with about 244,000 deaths in the United States last year, according to CDC data. A report released last year by the Commonwealth Fund found that in the first two years that Covid-19 vaccines were available in the United States, they kept more than 18 million people out of the hospital and saved more than 3 million lives.

From January to July this year, the ministry logged 158 influenza clusters – compared with 255 clusters during the same period last year. Of the 158 clusters reported this year, 54% were in schools, followed by kindergartens at 20%. Health Minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said the total number of cases reported from the 158 clusters was 4,606, whereas in 2022 the cases were three times higher or 12,876 cases from 255 clusters. “The ministry still monitors influenza outbreaks and clusters that occur, although individual cases are not required to be notified by clinics and hospitals,” she said in an interview. This is because influenza, or the flu, is not subject to mandatory notifications under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342). Dr Zaliha said influenza tends to occur all year round and has the potential to attack all ages. While most people recover within a week without requiring medical attention, some may require admission for close monitoring, she said. Influenza and the common cold are both contagious respiratory illnesses but caused by different viruses, she added. “The flu is caused by influenza viruses only whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of different viruses, including rhinoviruses and (human) parainfluenza (viruses),” she said. Dr Zaliha said the best way to avoid infection is to get the influenza vaccine every year. She also advised those with symptoms to avoid close contact with others and keep a distance to protect other people from getting sick too. “Stay home when you are sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick,” she said. Flu viruses, she noted, spread mainly by droplets made when people cough, sneeze or talk. Dr Zaliha said practising good hand hygiene is also important to curb the spread of the flu. Germs can also be spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, she said. Other good health habits – such as cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill – should also be practised, she added. “Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food. Also seek immediate treatment if symptoms worsen,” she said. Federation of Private Medical Practitioners’ Associations Malaysia president Dr Shanmuganathan TV Ganeson said the flu season peaks in May to July and November to January.“For the first 24 weeks of 2023 in Malaysia, there was 18.45% positivity for influenza of the specimens sent. The figures for Singapore were quite similar at 20%,” he said. Dr Shanmuganathan said that as there are pockets of spread, the prevalence would vary from area to area and from time to time. For example, he said that in May, Klang doctors commented on increased influenza A and B cases, but doctors in Kuala Lumpur did not seem to corroborate that increase. Symptoms of influenza are fever, flu, cough and chest discomfort, sore throat, lethargy, headache and body aches, respiratory distress, and even vomiting and diarrhoea. Meanwhile, the symptoms of the common cold are sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, coughing, mucus dripping down your throat (post-nasal drip), watery eyes and fever. “However, most people with colds do not have fever,” said Dr Shanmuganathan. The at-risk groups include children below five years old, the elderly above 65 years old, those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease or chronic bronchitis, persons with poor immunity like HIV, cancer and chemotherapy patients, healthcare workers and caregivers, he added. Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said Covid-19 has taught the world how to curb the spread of upper respiratory infections, and that the same principles could be applied to flu infections. “The precautions are pretty similar to Covid-19, such as masking up, social distancing and hand washing – as well as isolation for those infected to control the spread,” he said. Dr Kuljit also said that in July, private hospitals saw a rise in bed occupancy due to many factors, most notably influenza.

Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Stonegate has attained an Avian Influenza (AI) insurance policy scheme in conjunction with NFU Mutual. It is the first time this kind of funded protection has been offered, as part of a complimentary partnership package, to this extent by any egg packer in the UK, and the first AI business insurance cover that NFU Mutual has placed since October 2021. The AI Group Insurance initiative is exclusive to Stonegate producers and is designed to protect their free range and organic egg farmers by offering six months business interruption should their poultry be infected with AI. Stonegate said it would fund the cost of this cover for their farmers. Stonegate said it wanted to give its producers confidence to invest in their businesses and the industry. Stonegate owns several brands including Clarence Court, Stonegate Estate, Enriched and Respectful eggs, as well supplying some retailers’ own label free range and organic eggs. “This scheme is all about reducing farmers risk, creating a stronger, more robust, sustainable supply chain to ensure our customers have reliable continuity of supply,” said Adrian Gott, chief executive of Stonegate. “We have been working on this scheme with NFU Mutual and their AI provider Markel for over six months and it will allow all our producers to take out this policy with their local NFU Mutual agency. It’s another significant step forward in our move to ever closer collaboration with our farming partners and I’m proud to be offering this unique scheme to them.” Simon Bates, Senior Partner and Poultry Specialist at NFU Mutual, said: “In the increasingly challenging circumstances that the sector has faced with Avian Influenza, we are particularly pleased to offer this opportunity to Stonegate. As the UK’s leading rural insurer, we remain committed to supporting our customers and providing them with the best outcomes available.” Stonegate said it would fund a core element of the AI cover, but individual producers have the option to add additional covers at their own expense, which can take the form of secondary cleaning and disinfection cover for AI. Individual producers will need to engage with their NFU Mutual agent and provide the required information so that cover can be placed. Share.

What concerns the most is that several patients are not coming forward to report fever or breathlessness and are practising self-medication. Although the state health authorities are yet to come up with any advisory, health experts have warned people to remain alert and report to doctors once they feel breathlessness and congestion in the chest following the detection of a few cases of Eris in Maharashtra.Senior internal medicine specialist Dr Niroj Mishra said despite the spike in viral and influenza cases, Odisha may not have yet reported any case of the new variant. But, since it can have a growth advantage of almost 15 to 20 per cent over previous strains and can spread faster, people must remain alert.“This variant is not much different from what we have seen with earlier Omicron and its sublineages. Waning immunity from previous infections and vaccinations could be the reason behind the fresh spike in infections, but people with Covid-like symptoms must undergo tests and report instead of self-medication,” he advised.Director of health services Dr Bijay Mohapatra said the state government is yet to take a call on the new variant as it has not been properly studied yet. “We are having a close watch on the rate of infection and spike in Covid cases, if any in other states. We urge people to follow normal hygiene and remain in self-isolation if they have flu symptoms and use masks at public places,” he said.Meanwhile, the state reported two new Covid cases out of 701 samples tested in the last 24 hours. After the recovery of two patients, the number of active cases stood at 14.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestCOVID casesfluShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

On that day, Spectrum Health in West Michigan had its highest-ever number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the omicron variant wave – 421. This week, there are eight people hospitalized with COVID-19 at Grand Rapids’ Corewell Health, the new name for Spectrum Health. “It’s almost unimaginable that we had that,” Lampen, an infectious disease physician and medical director for infection prevention at Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, said of the hundreds of COVID patients that once flooded his hospital. https://michiganadvance.com/blog/do-you-need-another-covid-19-booster-heres-what-to-know/ Three-and-a-half years into a pandemic that has killed 1.1 million Americans and 43,229 Michiganders, vaccines, widespread immunity and a better understanding of how to treat COVID has sent hospitalization and death numbers plummeting to some of the lowest levels experienced during the pandemic. Now, however, there’s an uptick in COVID hospitalizations throughout the country, which health experts said may be attributed in part to summer travel and soaring temperatures sending people to the air-conditioned indoors. “There is a trend that’s moving in the wrong direction, and that’s worth paying attention to,” Lampen said. There were 9,056 COVID-19 hospital admissions in the U.S. during the week ending July 29, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is a jump of about 12% over the prior week. That, however, is far lower than past peaks. During the omicron surge that left Michigan hospitals at a “breaking point” in late 2021 and early 2022, there were about 150,000 COVID hospital admissions every week in the United States. Since June, about 500 to 600 people in the U.S. have died from COVID each week; that number has not recently risen but typically lags behind hospitalization increases. In Michigan, the state Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHS) reported on Tuesday that there were 1,864 new COVID-19 cases over the past week – which is more than twice the 761 cases from the previous week. However, health officials emphasized that about 620 of the recorded new cases are actually cases from January through June that had not previously been reported. Any increase in case numbers is also not the best way to gauge what’s happening with COVID spread because of a proliferation of home testing – which is then not reported to state and federal health officials – and a drop in testing overall, medical experts said. Instead, they pointed to hospitalization rates as giving a more complete picture when it comes to any concerning trends. I would urge people to not get totally complacent. The deaths have gone down a ton, but it’s still killing people every day. – Marisa Eisenberg, an associate professor of epidemiology and complex systems at the University of Michigan The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Michigan has recently plateaued, state health officials reported. As of Monday, there were 169 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Michigan – one of the lowest hospitalization numbers seen during the pandemic, according to DHHS. At this time last year, there were 991 people hospitalized with COVID in Michigan. State health officials also reported five COVID-19 deaths in the past week, which is the fewest number of weekly deaths reported since March 2020. “We’re still at low levels of hospitalizations, but it is increasing,” Marisa Eisenberg, an associate professor of epidemiology and complex systems at the University of Michigan, said of nationwide trends. “It differs by region; there are parts of the U.S. where it’s starting to increase, less so in Michigan right now.” Still, health experts noted that, historically, COVID trends in other parts of the country tend to eventually play out in Michigan – which means they expect COVID numbers to increase as the weather turns colder and children return to school. To protect themselves, Michiganders need to make sure they’re vaccinated and boosted, experts said. For those who do feel sick, it’s important they get tested in order to be able to access medicine, like Paxlovid, that helps reduce the COVID case’s severity and often keeps people out of the hospital, health care professionals said. “I would urge people to not get totally complacent,” Eisenberg said. “The deaths have gone down a ton, but it’s still killing people every day.” State health officials urged individuals to get vaccinated if they have not done so and to stay current on boosters. An updated booster that targets the most recent COVID variants is expected to be available by the end of September. “Right now, Michigan is at historical lows, but we know COVID-19 is still a real threat,” DHHS spokesperson Chelsea Wuth wrote in an email. “It’s important for people to use the tools at their disposal, like vaccines and boosters, to keep themselves safe and understand their individual risk. We continue to urge Michiganders to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination as the vaccine remains our best defense against serious illness and hospitalization.” Currently, about 60% of Michiganders are vaccinated against COVID-19, but only 38.9% have received any of the recommended COVID vaccine boosters, which protect against COVID’s variants, according to the DHHS. While COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths remain low, the recent increase in hospitalizations is not something to dismiss, medical experts said. They noted it’s especially important to consider the impact of any increased COVID spread on individuals who are at risk of getting more serious cases, including people who are 65 and older and those who are immunocompromised. Dr. Peter Gulick “Also, there’s long COVID,” said Dr. Peter Gulick, an infectious disease expert and a professor of medicine at Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine who also works with HIV patients through the Ingham County Health Department. “For people who think, ‘Big deal, COVID is COVID,’ you can get long COVID, which is a real thing and causes people to be debilitated. That worries me. People think it’s like the flu; it’s no big deal. You get it, and it’s over with – but it may not be over with. Young people get long COVID; healthy people get long COVID.” Long COVID is a chronic illness that leaves individuals, including children, living with a wide variety of often debilitating COVID symptoms for months, or even longer, past their original COVID diagnosis. As COVID numbers climb, health experts said it’s extremely unlikely there will ever be a surge akin to those of previous years. “I don’t see us ever getting back to where we were as far as those major peaks and spikes we’ve had in the past,” Lampen said. “I don’t see us climbing back anywhere near where we were.” Still, Lampen emphasized, COVID is a new disease that health experts are still learning about. It is not as well understood as, say, the flu. “Influenza has likely been with humans since we began domesticating animals around 500 B.C.,” Lampen said. “It’s been with us for millennia. The difficulty with COVID is it’s only been with us for three years.” That means, Lampen said, it’s not entirely clear when experts will be able to say that COVID has fully transitioned to something that’s less lethal – something that is reminiscent of the flu, for example. (The flu, however, is still deadly – the CDC reported there were between 19,000 and 58,000 flu deaths between October 2022 and April 2023.) “I don’t think it’s quite the flu yet, but I do think the severity has been reduced a lot,” Eisenberg said. “I don’t think we’re really in flu range quite yet, but we are getting closer.” YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

But the move has sparked a row between union leaders and the NHS, with GP practices warning the delay means they will be forced to cancel thousands of vaccine clinic appointments already booked for September. NHS England has argued the delay will “maximise protection” by allowing flu and Covid vaccines to be given to patients at the same time. Responding to the delay, Dr Elliott Singer, medical director for the Londonwide Local Medical Committees, which represent all GP practices in the capital, said the move “throws into chaos a winter flu jab campaign” ahead of what is predicted to be an incredibly difficult winter for the NHS and vulnerable patients. He said: “NHS guidance says that flu vaccinations should be administered as soon as possible this autumn and many practices are ready to start this month. Delaying this to overhaul how these clinics run and wait for Covid vaccine stock puts vulnerable patients at risk. “Practices face the choice of making sweeping changes to be in a position to hold and deliver Covid vaccines, or cancelling their flu clinics while they wait for Covid stock to arrive. This is bad for patients who want flu jabs from their local GP, and bad for patients who want their local practice team to be able to focus on delivering appointments rather than rushing around in response to this last-minute upheaval.” The announcement came as the government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advised that Covid-19 jabs would now only be given to those aged over 65s in a departure from guidance last year which gave access to all those over 50. NHS England has told GP practices that to “maximise” protection, they should try to give adults both flu and Covid vaccines together from October. The money GPs get for administering Covid jabs was also slashed from £10.06 to £7.54 – a move criticised by the British Medical Association (BMA), which said practices would find it difficult to deliver them at the reduced fee. One GP practice leader told The Independent the campaign changes would “wreck general practice vaccinations”. They said: “By shoving [flu jabs] to October they start to hit the higher demand that October brings. There’s a good reason flu vaccinations are prioritised in September, it’s because that’s the last quieter summer month to get the most vulnerable. “October is right into flu season when the vulnerable may be caught before they get vaccinated.” In a message from the BMA to GP practices, seen by The Independent, doctors were told the organisation would soon release guidance on the issue, warning: “Practices must be allowed to start our flu campaigns as soon as we receive them in our fridges. “We are aware of increasing numbers of [integrated care boards] pressurising [primary care networks] to defer flu start dates into October. They can’t do that and we’ll explain why. “We suspect they are doing this because they know the Covid fee is totally inadequate, and they think there is a better chance of us doing the Covid jabs if they say it is all starting from 1 Oct…” An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS flu vaccination programme will begin in October based on the latest clinical evidence – it will maximise protection for patients right across the winter months when it is typically colder, and viruses are more likely to spread with people spending more time indoors. “The NHS is working to ensure a growing number of vaccine sites across England offer both flu and Covid-19 vaccines in the same visit, to make it as convenient as possible for people to get life-saving protection from both viruses ahead of winter.” Don’t forget to follow us on Twitter like us on Facebook or connect with us on LinkedIn!Have you read?
