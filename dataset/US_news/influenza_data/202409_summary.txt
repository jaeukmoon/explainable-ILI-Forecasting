Antibodies Targeting "Dark Side" of Influenza Virus Protein: Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have discovered antibodies that target a hidden region of the influenza virus called the neuraminidase (NA) protein head. This region, known as the "dark side," is common among many influenza viruses, including H3N2 subtype viruses. The antibodies could potentially be used as a new target for countermeasures against the influenza virus. The research, conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Vaccine Research Center, was published in the journal Immunity. This discovery could contribute to the development of more effective influenza vaccines and therapeutic strategies.
