New Zealand used these NPIs to eliminate coronavirus disease 2019 during its first wave. Using multiple surveillance systems, we observed a parallel and unprecedented reduction of influenza and other respiratory viral infections in 2020. This finding supports the use of these NPIs for controlling pandemic influenza and other severe respiratory viral threats.

From 2 February 2020, NZ introduced progressive border restrictions and a four-level alert system aiming to eliminate COVID-191. Soon after the emergence of community transmission of COVID-19, the stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of Level-4 (nationwide lockdown) were applied, lasting from 25 March to 27 April 2020. These included (1) blocking importation of the virus (border closure to non-New Zealanders and 14-day quarantine for returning travellers); (2) stamping out transmission within NZ (widespread testing, isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine of exposed persons); (3) physical distancing measures (stay-at-home orders, cancelling all gatherings, closing schools, non-essential businesses and all public venues and restricting domestic travel); (4) individual infection prevention and control measures (promoting hand hygiene and cough etiquette, staying home with mild respiratory symptoms and mask wearing if unwell); and (5) communicating risk to the public and various stakeholders. The implementation of these NPIs combined with public compliance effectively eliminated community transmission of COVID-19 during the first wave (12 February to 13 May 2020), achieving 101 consecutive days without detection of community COVID-19 cases2,3. Since this implementation, NZ has continued to apply NPIs in various forms up until submission of this report1.The effectiveness of NPIs in reducing viral transmission depends on transmission characteristics of the virus4. If a substantial proportion of transmission occurs before the onset of symptoms (i.e. pre-symptomatic shedding) or during asymptomatic infection, the population impact of health screening and case-patient isolation will be diminished5. Influenza virus has a short serial interval (the mean interval between illness onset in two successive patients in a chain of transmission) of 2–4 days. Viral excretion peaks early in the illness (i.e. during the first 1–3 days of illness). These features of influenza infection mean there is limited time to effectively implement isolation and quarantine measures. Additionally, substantial asymptomatic infection6 creates difficulties in finding cases to initiate nonpharmaceutical measures. These characteristics have led to the assumption that these NPIs would not be effective in controlling influenza virus7. However, robust field data are lacking. New Zealand’s use of stringent NPIs created a natural experiment enabling an understanding of the impact of these NPIs on illnesses caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses. This type of knowledge is valuable for informing pandemic influenza preparedness and seasonal influenza planning for the northern hemisphere’s upcoming winter in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Here we describe the complete absence of the usual winter influenza virus epidemic and a remarkable reduction of other respiratory viral infections in NZ during and after the implementation of these stringent NPIs in 2020.ResultsInfluenza activity in NZ during the winter of 2020 was very low as confirmed by multiple national surveillance systems (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Temporal distribution of acute respiratory illness and associated influenza infections in 2020 compared with previous years.a, b Hospital-based SARI incidence rate and influenza-associated SARI. c, d Sentinel GP-based ILI incidence rate and influenza-associated ILI. e, f SHIVERS-II&III-based ILI and ARI incidence rate and influenza-associated ILI and ARI. g ICD-coded influenza hospitalisation. h Laboratory-based influenza surveillance. SARI severe acute respiratory illness, GP general practice, ILI influenza-like illness, ARI acute respiratory illness, SHIVERS-II&III the second and third iterations of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance programme, ICD International Classification of Diseases, flu refers to influenza. The calculation for epidemic threshold and low influenza activity is described in “Methods”. A patient with cough and history of fever (subjective fever or measured temperature ≥38 °C) and onset within the past 10 days meets the SARI case definition if hospitalised or meets the ILI case definition if consulting a GP or participating in the SHIVERS-II&III study. The ARI case definition among SHIVERS-II&III participants refers to an acute respiratory illness with fever or feverishness and/or one of the following symptoms (cough, running nose, wheezing, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smellaste) with onset in the past 10 days.Full size imageFrom May to September 2020, hospital-based severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance (catchment population of 1 million people) showed very low SARI incidence rates, all below the seasonal threshold defined by the reference period of 2015–2019 (Fig. 1a). No influenza-associated SARI was identified (Fig. 1b).The national sentinel general practice (GP)-based surveillance usually covers ~10% of the NZ population and captures patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) attending medical consultations. However, this patient flow was altered in 2020 as many patients with ILI were channelled to COVID-specific testing centres where patients were predominantly only tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, the number of participating practices were 18–57% lower than the usual participation rate over the surveillance period. The ILI incidence rates were below the seasonal threshold compared to the reference period (Fig. 1c). No influenza-associated ILI were detected (Fig. 1d). Independently, the low ILI incidence rates were also observed in the HealthStat GP-based ILI surveillance system (Supplementary Fig. 1).SHIVERS-II&III (the second and third iterations of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance programme) are two community-based cohorts that follow ~1400 adults aged 20–69 years and ~80 infants in the Wellington region, respectively. Active surveillance for both cohorts in 2020 included swabbing of participants meeting the case definition for ILI and/or acute respiratory illness (ARI). The ILI incidence rate in 2020 was lower than the previous years of 2019 and 2018; however, ARI incidence was high (Fig. 1e). No influenza-associated ILI or ARI were identified (Fig. 1f).The national International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded (ICD-10AM-VI code J9-J11) influenza hospitalisations for all NZ public hospitals showed a significant decline (Fig. 1g). From 1 January to 31 July 2020, a total of 291 influenza hospitalisations were coded: pre-lockdown 238 (81.8%), lockdown 33 (11.3%), and post-lockdown 15 (5.2%). The Cochran–Armitage test showed a significant downward trend (p < 0.001) in influenza hospitalisations.The laboratory-based surveillance system includes testing samples ordered by clinicians during routine clinical diagnostic processes for hospital inpatients and outpatients (serving ~70% of the NZ population). Additionally, this system also includes testing samples from all influenza surveillance systems (Fig. 1h). During the COVID-19 laboratory response, some laboratories may have prioritised testing for SARS-CoV-2 over influenza and other respiratory viruses. From 1 January to 27 September 2020, there were 500 influenza virus detections: pre-lockdown 474 (94.8%), lockdown 20 (4.0%), and post-lockdown 6 (1.2%). The Cochran–Armitage test showed a significant downward temporal trend (p < 0.001) in influenza virus detections.Table 1 shows the number of respiratory viruses detected and the proportional reduction for each virus in 2020 (versus the reference period of 2015–2019) before, during and after the lockdown. Dramatic reductions were observed for influenza virus compared with the reference period: 67.7% reduction during and 99.9% after the lockdown. Marked reductions were also evident for other respiratory viruses during post-lockdown compared with the reference period (for temporal distribution, see Supplementary Fig. 2): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 98.0% reduction), human metapneumovirus (hMPV; 92.2%), enterovirus (82.2%), adenovirus (81.4%), parainfluenza virus types 1–3 (PIV1–3; 80.1%), and rhinovirus (74.6%). During post-lockdown when the restrictions were eased to Level-1, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of rhinovirus compared to the median rate for this period from the preceding period: 33% (175/529) from 8 June to 11 August 2020 vs. 4.8% (10/209) from 13 May to 7 June 2020 (p < 0.0001). The rhinovirus-associated incidence rates in 2020 among SHIVERS-II&III and SARI surveillance also increased after the ease of restrictions (Supplementary Fig. 3).Table 1 The number of influenza and other respiratory viruses detected and their reduction in 2020 before, during and after the lockdown compared with the reference period of 2015–2019.Full size tableDiscussionNew Zealand, a southern hemisphere country with a temperate climate, has a well-established influenza circulation pattern with peak incidences in the winter months8. Multiple surveillance systems showed that there was no annual laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreak or epidemic detected during the 2020 winter season. Remarkably, influenza virus circulation was almost non-existent during the 2020 winter, a 99.9% reduction compared with previous years. We postulate that NZ’s use of stringent NPIs (lockdowns and border controls) have markedly changed human behaviour3, resulting in substantial reductions in contacts between influenza-infected individuals and influenza-susceptible individuals. The nationwide lockdown occurred during late autumn before the usual influenza season. This timing may also be important as the resulting small number of influenza-infected individuals did not appear sufficient to trigger a sustained influenza epidemic in the oncoming winter in a setting of strict border control, personal hygiene promotion and ongoing forms of social distancing that remained in place after the lockdown1.The WHO’s pandemic influenza intervention guidance does not recommend stringent NPIs when pandemic influenza reaches sustained transmission in the general population because these NPIs have been considered ineffective and impractical5. However, the knowledge base used in developing WHO guidance for influenza pandemic prevention is limited and consists primarily of historical observations and modelling studies. NZ data, presented here, is consistent with what reported from other southern hemisphere countries9,10 in Australia, Chile and South Africa, as well as reported from Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemic11 and the COVID-19 pandemic12. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to re-evaluate the role of stringent NPIs such as lockdowns and border closures in mitigating or even eliminating severe pandemic influenza. Although such measures are associated with significant negative impacts on society, their potential beneficial effects on delaying, containing or averting transmission and saving lives should be assessed. New knowledge from this assessment may inform better preparedness for future influenza pandemics and other severe respiratory viral threats. Additionally, it would be a worthwhile endeavour to conduct detailed analysis to identify which components of NPIs were most effective for preventing seasonal influenza and other respiratory virus infection and transmission. Careful investigation of NPIs may identify new and sustainable interventions that can minimise and prevent seasonal and epidemic respiratory viral illnesses in the future.Other potential contributing factors for the reduction in influenza virus detections include influenza vaccination, climatic changes and viral–viral interactions. The NZ National Immunisation Register recorded ~22% influenza vaccine coverage in 2020 (35% more influenza vaccinations recorded during April–June in 2020 compared with 2019, personal communication). Cold temperature promotes the ordering of lipids on the viral membrane, which increases the stability of the influenza virus particle13. Winter 2020 was NZ’s warmest winter on record. The nationwide average temperature was 9.6 °C, 1.1 °C above the 1981–2010 average14. The warmer winter may reduce virus stability, contributing to lower influenza circulation. A number of viral–viral interactions may also be influencing the incidence of respiratory virus infections. Interferon-stimulated immunity caused by one virus infection can provide non-specific interference making it difficult for additional viruses to become established in a population. Increased levels of influenza A virus circulation have been shown to limit rhinovirus prevalence, potentially through an interferon-mediated mechanism15. Others have suggested that the opposite may also be true where rhinovirus circulation can limit influenza virus activity as was suggested in Sweden and France during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that the annual autumn rhinovirus epidemic interrupted and delayed community transmission of the emerging influenza virus16,17. The increase in rhinovirus detection after the lockdown that we noted here may have contributed to an absence of influenza virus circulation.Stringent NPIs may contribute to the significant reduction of all other non-influenza respiratory viral infections, including RSV, hMPV, PIV1–3, adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus. Unlike the report from the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network18 where an increase in RSV detections occurred at the tail end of the winter season, NZ did not see any increase in RSV detections during the whole 2020 winter season. When the NPIs were relaxed after lockdown, the incidence of rhinovirus increased rapidly, a trend not seen with these other viruses. The mechanism behind this finding is unclear. Rhinovirus infections, responsible for more than one-half of cold-like illnesses, are frequently transmitted within households from children to other family members19. Additionally, rhinoviruses are non-enveloped viruses so might be inherently less susceptible to inactivation by soap-and-water handwashing18. Furthermore, the quality of children’s handwashing is likely to be poor. These factors may have contributed to rhinovirus infection being less affected by the COVID-19 control measures.In the incoming autumn and winter of 2020 and 2021, many northern hemisphere temperate countries will have continuing COVID-19 circulation overlapping with the influenza season, resulting in increased burden on already stretched health systems. NZ’s experience strongly suggests that NPIs can greatly reduce the intensity of seasonal influenza and other respiratory viral infections. Continuation or strengthening of NPIs may, therefore, have positive impacts far beyond COVID-19 control. Even without these interventions, the severity of the 2020–2021 northern hemisphere influenza season remains uncertain. Both international and domestic air travel has been suggested as important drivers of influenza introduction and subsequent spread20. It is possible that fewer seeding events from NZ and other southern hemisphere countries, from both reduced influenza activity and reduced air travel, may result in low influenza activity in these northern hemisphere countries during their incoming winter.Our study has several limitations. First, this is an observational study. Multiple simultaneous measures were applied depending on alert levels, making it difficult to understand the relative contribution of each of these measures. Second, during the COVID-19 laboratory response, some laboratories prioritised testing for COVID-19 and reduced testing for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Additionally, those samples ordered by clinicians for hospital inpatients and outpatients during normal clinical practices were based on clinician’s judgement, rather than a systematic sampling approach. This may result in selection bias. Third, the government set up a number of community-based testing centres around the country to provide access to safe and free sampling for COVID-19. The usual flow and processes established for sentinel GP-based ILI surveillance may have been interrupted as many ILI patients would visit these centres instead of sentinel GP clinics. Additionally, national sentinel GP-based ILI surveillance requires swabbing from an ILI patient. This may contribute to the lower GP participation for this surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors probably resulted in lower consultation and reporting and sample collection for sentinel ILI surveillance in 2020. However, the SARI surveillance system and SHIVERS-II&III cohorts operated as usual and showed the same apparent elimination of influenza virus circulation.In conclusion, this observational study reported an unprecedented reduction in influenza and other important respiratory viral infections and the complete absence of an annual winter influenza epidemic, most likely due to the use of stringent NPIs (border restrictions, isolation and quarantine, social distancing and human behaviour changes). These data can inform future pandemic influenza preparedness and seasonal influenza planning for the northern hemisphere’s upcoming winter.MethodsEthical approvalEthical approval was obtained for the SHIVERS (including SARI and ILI surveillance), SHIVERS-II and III cohort studies from the NZ Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee (NTX/11/11/102). The ICD-coded influenza hospitalisation data and laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance data are part of public health surveillance in NZ. It is conducted in accordance with the Public Health Act and thus ethics committee approval was not needed for collection or use of these data.Hospital-based SARI surveillanceThe population-based hospital surveillance for SARI among residents (ca ~1 million) of Central (Auckland District Health Board) and South (Counties Manukau District Health Board) Auckland was established in 201221. Research nurses reviewed daily records of all overnight acutely admitted inpatients to identify any inpatient with a suspected ARI. They enrolled those patients with cough and history of fever (subjective fever or measured temperature ≥38 °C) and onset within the past 10 days, defined by the World Health Organisation as SARI. A respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab) was collected and tested simultaneously for influenza and other respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques22: influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus, PIV1–3, enterovirus, adenovirus, hMPV.Sentinel GP-based ILI surveillanceThe population-based surveillance for ILI among persons enrolled in sentinel GPs (~90) who seek medical consultations has been in operation since 19908, usually covering ~10% of the NZ population. The participating general practitioners and practice nurses assessed all consultation-seeking patients. If a patient met the ILI case definition: “an ARI with a history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 °C, and cough, and onset within the past 10 days, and requiring consultation in that GP”, a respiratory specimen (nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab) was collected to test for influenza and other respiratory viruses21. In 2020, sentinel GP-based ILI surveillance was not operated in the usual way due to the COVID-19 response. Instead of visiting sentinel GPs for medical consultations, many ILI patients would visit one of the community-based COVID-19 testing centres. Additionally, national sentinel GP-based ILI surveillance requires swabbing from an ILI patient. This may contribute to less GP participation (18–57% of the usual participation rate over the winter period in 2020) in the COVID-19 pandemic situation. These factors would contribute to lower consultation for, reporting and detection of influenza and other respiratory viruses compared with previous years.SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis cohort ILI surveillanceSHIVERS-II is a prospective adult cohort study in Wellington, NZ. The cohort study has been in operation since 2018 enrolling individuals aged 20–69 years, randomly selected from those healthy individuals listed in the GP’s primary care management system. In 2020, SHIVERS-II study staff followed these participants (~1400) and monitored their ILIs and ARIs.WellKiwis (i.e. SHIVERS-III) is a prospective Wellington infant cohort aiming to recruit 600 infant–mother pairs from Oct 2019 to Sept 2022 (200 pairs a year) and follow them until 2026. In 2020, WellKiwis study staff followed up ~80 infants and monitored their ILIs and ARIs.During May–September 2020, SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis study staff sent weekly surveys to participants regarding their respiratory illness. Due to COVID-19, the ARI case definition in 2020 has changed to: “ARI with fever or feverishness and/or one of the following symptoms (cough, running nose, wheezing, sore throat, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smellaste) with onset in the past 10 days”. The case definition for ILI during 2018–2020 was the same: ARI with cough and fever/measured fever of ≥38 °C and onset within the past 10 days. For those participants who met the case definition for ILI and ARI, research nurses visited the participant and took a nasopharyngeal or nasal or throat swab to test for influenza and other respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-223.ICD-coded influenza hospitalisationsHospitalisation data for ICD-coded influenza hospitalisations (ICD-10AM-VI codes (J09–J11) were extracted from the NZ Ministry of Health’s National Minimum Dataset by discharge date. In this data set, patients who spent <1 day in a hospital are excluded. Influenza-related hospitalisations are conservatively taken to include only those cases where influenza was the principal diagnosis. Repeat hospital admissions were included because infection with a different influenza A sub-type or influenza B virus is possible.Laboratory-based surveillanceThe laboratory-based surveillance for influenza and common respiratory viruses is carried out all year around by the NZ virus laboratory network consisting of the WHO National Influenza Centre at the Institute of Environmental Science and Research and six hospital laboratories in Auckland (2), Waikato, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. This laboratory network tests specimens ordered by clinicians for hospital inpatients and outpatients during normal clinical practice (serving ~70% of the NZ population). Sample collection is based on clinician’s judgement, rather than systematic sampling approach. This may result in selection bias. In addition, this laboratory network conducts testing for public health surveillance, including SARI, ILI and SHIVERS-II and WellKiwis cohort surveillance.Data analysesStudy data were captured using REDCap 10.0.19 electronic data capture tools24. Analyses were performed in Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC).The observed incidence rates of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or ARI were corrected each week to account for missed swabs from ILI cases by applying the influenza positivity rate of those tested to those non-tested (Corrected number of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or ARI events = Number of SARI or ILI or ARI × Actual number of influenza-PCR-confirmed SARI or ILI or ARI/Actual number of SARI or ILI or ARI swabs).Based on SARI and ILI surveillance data from 2015 to 2019, the start of the annual influenza season and intensity level of the influenza epidemics was defined by using the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)25,26,27. Briefly, MEM has three main steps: Step 1: for each season separately, the length of the epidemic period is estimated as the minimum number of consecutive weeks with the maximum accumulated percentage rates, splitting the season into three periods: a pre-epidemic, an epidemic, and a post-epidemic period; Step 2: MEM calculates the epidemic threshold as the upper limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of 30 highest pre-epidemic weekly rates, the n highest for each season taking the whole training period, where n = 30umber of seasons; Step 3: medium, high, and extra-ordinary intensity thresholds were estimated as the upper limits of the 40, 90, and 97.5% one-sided confidence intervals of the geometric mean of 30 highest epidemic weekly rates, the n highest for each season taking the whole training period, where n = 30umber of seasons. Five categories are used to set thresholds and define intensity level as no activity or below epidemic threshold, low (0–40%), moderate (40–90%), high (90–97.5%) and extra-ordinary (>97.5%) one-sided confidence interval of the geometric mean.Cochran–Armitage test for trend analysis was performed for ICD-coded influenza hospitalisations and numbers of the reported virus detections.Laboratory-based surveillance data and ICD-coded influenza hospitalisation data used the median weekly value to represent the reference period of 2015–2019. Median and interquartile ranges were calculated for the number of viruses reported during 2015–2019; percentage of reduction = 1 − [No. of virus (2020)/median no. of virus (2015–2019)]%.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Paired with the ongoing battle with COVID-19, medical experts from NewYork-Presbyterian medical groups say we could have a “twindemic” on our hands — an influenza epidemic unfolding in the middle of a relentless COVID-19 pandemic.The 2019 influenza virus caused an estimated 35 million illnesses in the U.S. The severity of this year’s flu season is unpredictable, but a lot of people may be coughing and sneezing, so the likelihood of transmission is much higher when you’re having active symptoms.But what exactly are those symptoms? Just as in the spring when it was difficult to tell the difference between seasonal allergies and COVID-19, the challenge now will be identifying what could be signs of COVID-19 vs. flu.COVID-19 vs. Flu: What’s the Difference?Medical experts say that it may be very hard to tell the difference between influenza and COVID. Therefore, although we outline the differences below, it is recommended to call your doctor to ensure the diagnosis and that you take the proper steps.Even though the flu and COVID-19 are caused by two totally different viruses, they share a number of symptoms:FeverFatigueCoughSore throatRunny noseShortness of breathBody achesHeadachesVomitingDiarrheaThere are, however, two distinct differences between the flu and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.First, the loss of taste and smell is specific to COVID-19 and is not seen in people who have the flu. While it does not happen in all patients, this is a very important difference that can help distinguish between symptoms of flu and COVID-19 (about 38% to 55% of patients have reported loss of taste and around 40% have reported loss of smell). This specific symptom might come on anywhere from two days after contracting the virus to up to 14 days after symptom onset.Second, the way in which symptoms present themselves in patients is very different. Both the flu and COVID-19 cause a cough and shortness of breath, but overall, COVID-19 symptoms tend to last longer than the flu. Medical experts say COVID-19 symptoms may last for several weeks if not months.Shortness of breath can also come later with COVID-19 and becomes more severe and long-lasting than the flu.There are also some new and ongoing reports of symptoms associated with COVID-19 that people should be on the lookout for:Red, swollen eyes. There have been occasional reports of red, swollen, and itchy eyes in some COVID-19 patients, which can look like conjunctivitis (or pink eye). This is a symptom that can come on with other strains of coronavirus, so while not a distinguishing factor for COVID-19 specifically, it’s something to be watchful for.Skin rashes. Viruses are often associated with rashes, so it’s not unusual for you or your child to develop one. Mostly reported in younger people, early data suggests that different skin conditions may coincide with COVID-19. These may range from little red bumps and hives to chilblains — now temporarily called ‘COVID toes’ — which are painful, red-purple, or itchy bumps on the toes.If you or your child has any new skin condition or rash, call your doctor just to be safe. Since it can be hard for a clinician to distinguish whether a skin rash is from a COVID-19 infection or, say, hand, foot, and mouth disease (a viral infection that manifests as painful mouth sores and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet), your doctor will likely want to test you or your child for COVID-19.How to Tell the Difference Between COVID-19 vs. Flu in ChildrenReports have shown that COVID-19 is less severe in children than it is in adults. It’s also rare, making up about 1% to 2% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. That being said, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), while rare, is a condition associated with COVID-19 and can occur in children ranging from toddlers to teens. Lookout for symptoms, including fever, vomiting, lethargy, and abdominal pain. If your child is experiencing common flu symptoms coupled with any of the above symptoms, contact their pediatrician.What to Do if You Think You Have the Flu, COVID-19 — or BothYes, it’s possible to test positive for influenza and COVID-19 at the same time, but experts say the chances of having a coinfection are very, very low. If you find yourself experiencing any of the symptoms discussed in this article, here’s a game plan for how to quickly determine a diagnosis.Talk to your doctor. If you’re coming down with a telltale sign of COVID-19 or the flu, seek medical care. Experts say it’s a good idea to put on a mask and self-isolate from your family if you have symptoms, to play it safe. Get tested. Experts agree that it’s important to be tested as quickly as possible for COVID-19 and flu. Here’s some good news: The nose swab can be used to test for both COVID-19 and the flu. Schedule an appointment with your doctor or local health clinic, or visit an urgent care center where tests should be available.Start treatment. After a diagnosis, move forward with the appropriate treatment. For the flu, the gold standard is an antiviral drug that your doctor might prescribe which helps to lessen the severity of symptoms and shorten duration of the illness. For milder cases of COVID-19, most people can recover at home by monitoring their symptoms, resting, and drinking fluids.If you are having trouble breathing, persistent pain, chest pressure, new confusion, an inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face, seek emergency medical care immediately.How to Protect Yourself Against the Flu and COVID-19To avoid a potential “twindemic” this year, medical experts at NewYork-Presbyterian medical groups recommend taking the following precautions:Get a flu shot. Call your doctor now to schedule an appointment to get your flu shot, as you should receive it prior to the COVID-19 vaccine.If there was ever a year when you were going to get a flu shot, this is the year. Call your doctor to make an appointment.Practice safety precautions. Fortunately, the preventive measures for COVID-19 also apply for the flu: avoiding large crowds and gatherings, wearing a mask, social distancing, frequent handwashing, and staying at home when you feel sick.Take care of your immune system. Caring for your immune system is very important to fight off infections, especially viruses. Boost your immunity by eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep.For more articles about science, care, and wellness, visit healthmatters.nyp.org.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 10-Feb-2021 Caution: 1918 influenza provides warning for potential future pandemic reemergence Peer-Reviewed Publication Michigan State University image: This graph shows the four distinct waves. Wave #1 March 1918 (Spring 1918 Wave), #2 October 1918 (Fall 1918 Wave), #3 December 1918 (Winter 1918 Wave) and #4 February 2020 (Winter 1920 Wave) view more Credit: Siddarth Chandra EAST LANSING, Mich. - The 1918 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale for what the future may hold for COVID-19, says a Michigan State University researcher. After a decade studying a flu virus that killed approximately 15,000 Michigan residents, Siddharth Chandra, a professor in MSU's James Madison College, saw his research come to life as he watched the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. "It was so surreal," said Chandra, who has a courtesy appointment in epidemiology and biostatistics. "All of a sudden, I was living my research." Chandra's research is published in the American Journal of Public Health with co-authors Julia Christensen, a graduate of James Madison College; Madhur Chandra, Senior Community Epidemiologist with the Ingham County Health Department and graduate of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at MSU; and Nigel Paneth, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and pediatrics at MSU. Using influenza infection and mortality data on Michigan from 1918-1920, Chandra identified four distinct waves. The first large peak was in March 1918. "After a second spike in cases in October 1918, the governor instituted a statewide ban on public gatherings," Chandra said. "Much like the restrictions that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic." After three weeks, the number of cases decreased and the ban was lifted, which led to another peak in December 1918. "The ban didn't stop the spread of the flu. It just delayed the spike in cases," he said. Chandra mapped the data showing the peaks and spikes in cases from October 1918 and December 1918 and tracked flu virus case growth by county over time. In October, counties in the southern part of the state and near the Mackinac Straits had the highest numbers but by December, the highest numbers of cases were in the heart of the state. The most surprising piece of data came 18 months later in February 1920, when a statewide explosion of cases created a massive spike even larger than the one in October 1918. For Chandra, it is an educated guess as to the reasons for this delayed increase. "Assuming it's the same influenza virus, World War I ended in 1918 and the men were coming home to their families," he said. "We had a mobile agent that brought the virus home to infect family members, which would explain the increase in cases among children and the elderly." Unfortunately, there is not a way to confirm this, Chandra noted. "We would need samples from patients in 1920 from across the state. Then, we would need to compare those with samples from patients in 1918 from across the state, and that's not likely to happen." The weather may have also been a factor since cool temperatures with low humidity likely provided optimal conditions for the virus to live and spread. Another factor that played a role was the absence of a vaccine. "In 1918, there was no hope for a vaccine. In 2021, we have a vaccine available," he said. One of the key insights from the 1918 pandemic that can inform the public health response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is the number of people who are susceptible to the virus. Which means that it is possible that a spike like the February 1920 one will occur in late 2021 or early 2022. "So many people will remain susceptible until they get vaccinated," Chandra said. "Bad things can still happen a year or two from now even if we see a decrease in the number of cases now. We still have over 200 million people walking around who are susceptible to the virus, including myself." ### (Note for media: Please include the following link to the study in all online media coverage: https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305969) Michigan State University has been working to advance the common good in uncommon ways for more than 165 years.

New advances are fueling a push for a long-lasting, broadly protective vaccine. Produced by Twitter Facebook Email Prototype universal influenza vaccines such as this one, a nanoparticle with a protein scaffold (blue) studded with influenza hemagglutinin proteins (green), could provoke an immune response to all human influenza subtypes.Credit: NIAID Before anyone knew a pandemic was looming, the virus spread steadily on Mexico’s pig farms. At some point, it acquired a mutation. That mutation gave the virus, which belonged to an influenza subtype known as H1N1, the ability to replicate and spread in humans. In the spring of 2009, reports from Veracuz, Mexico, showed that it had made the leap. Then it spread like wildfire, and within a year it had claimed the lives of as many as half a million people worldwide, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates.As devastating as the 2009 swine flu pandemic was, it could have been worse — far worse even than the ongoing battle with COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 2 million people. The infamous “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918 — also caused by an H1N1 strain — killed more than 17 million people, and was among the deadliest plagues in human history. Yet despite decades of warnings from experts about the dire threat of an influenza pandemic, no vaccine exists to prevent another just like it.Now emerging insights from a wide range of fields, from structural biology to immunology, and bioinformatics to bioengineering, are raising hopes for a universal influenza vaccine (UIV) — a potentially pandemic-stopping vaccine that could train the human immune system to recognize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, says Stacey Knobler, senior director at the Sabin Vaccine Institute. “There’s a sense of emerging optimism because of what we’re seeing from the science.”Evasive maneuversInfluenza vaccines have been around since the 1940s, and they offer important protection from seasonal flu. Yet the protection is far from complete. Influenza vaccines are regarded as good if they protect roughly 60% of recipients from infection, and some years that number dwindles to less than 20%. Partly as a result, influenza kills hundreds of thousands of people each year.Influenza is tough to stop because both major types of influenza virus — type A and type B — encompass a vast number of distinct strains, and immunity to one strain often does not confer protection from another. Researchers make educated guesses as to which strains are likely to spread in a given year, then develop a vaccine meant to stop them. But influenza evolves so quickly that an annual vaccine may not even confer full protection against that season’s strains.Predictions are even harder for pandemic strains, which jump without warning from animals to humans. “Our ability to predict the next pandemic strain is almost nonexistent,” says Keith Klugman, a specialist in respiratory pathogens who directs the pneumonia programme at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Researchers reason that an effective influenza vaccine should spur the immune system to target antigens that are both widely shared among diverse influenza strains and able to provoke a strong immune response. “The key barrier is that we do not have an effective target to induce long-term, cross-protective immunity,” Klugman says.Finding common groundAs the swine flu spread in 2009, University of Chicago immunologist Patrick Wilson uncovered some of the first clues that cross-protective immunity might be possible. He was investigating how the immune system responds when it encounters a novel subtype of influenza — in this case the H1N1 strain that caused that pandemic. He and his colleagues found that people who had previously been infected with or vaccinated against one strain of influenza generated antibodies against common features of the new pandemic strain.1This suggested that a broadly cross-protective immune response was possible. “These were just the kind of antibodies you would want for a universal vaccine,” Wilson says.Wilson is focusing on antibodies to a viral surface protein called hemagglutinin (HA) that mediates the initial steps of an influenza infection, helping the virus bind to and penetrate host cells. By identifying enough antibody binding sites, or epitopes, that are both strongly immunogenic and highly conserved, he and others could develop mosaic antigens containing several potent epitopes that together invoke broad cross-protection.New computational tools can also help develop mosaic vaccines, by identifying common features among different influenza strains. Ted Ross, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Georgia, is using them to scan HA protein sequences. “We’re using multiple rounds of consensus building and design on strains of flu that represent diverse time periods or regions of the world,” says Ross. Shared HA segments could be combined in mosaic HA proteins that elicit more robust protection than natural HA against emerging strains, including pandemic strains.2But HA evolves more readily than other influenza proteins, and new versions of HA can camouflage virus strains and help them escape immune detection.Influenza pandemics are caused by strains that make the jump from animals to humans.Credit: Honglei Sun Immune reinforcementsRather than targeting HA, Neil King, a biochemist at the University of Washington, and his UW colleague David Baker are targeting neuraminidase (NA), a key protein that helps influenza escape from infected cells.To elicit protective antibodies against NA, they are using a powerful program called Rosetta to design new versions of NA that are both more robust and more immunogenic. “Traditional flu vaccines have done a terrible job of eliciting anti-neuraminidase antibodies because they’re not designed to do that,” King says. But a vaccine that provokes a strong response to both HA and NA would fight the virus on two fronts at once.Besides blocking viral proteins, a successful antibody response to infection triggers other immunological effects that could be essential in stopping pandemic influenza, says Galit Alter of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard. To decipher these effects, her team uses sophisticated analytical techniques to perform what she calls “systems serology.”Alter and her colleagues reported recently that effective protection depends heavily on signals transmitted by parts of the antibody that don’t bind viral proteins.3 These signals activate the innate arm of the immune system, which mounts a rapid but non-specific defense against invading pathogens and infected cells. “It’s not just the antibody’s reactivity that matters,” Alter says. For an antibody-focused vaccine to achieve its full protective potential, “we also have to think about it as a molecule that can harness the immune system.”Beyond the antibody response, the T-cell-mediated cellular arm of the adaptive immune system can halt disease progression by clearing away infected cells. To stimulate this response, Sarah Gilbert’s team at the University of Oxford has been using harmless viruses to ferry various influenza proteins into human cells.4 The cells would then trigger an anti-influenza T-cell response that targets these proteins and provides lasting protection against diverse flu strains.Outsmarting the virusIt remains unclear how universal any single vaccine formulation can be — though that’s no reason to shy away from trying for universal protection, experts say. “The virus is going to continue to evolve, and we have zoonotic sources that will keep introducing variants into our population,” Ross says. For these reasons, “I think it’s unlikely that we can make a single vaccine now and be done.” Still, he says, broadly cross-protective vaccines are within reach. These ‘super-seasonal’ vaccines could provide extended protection against non-pandemic flu strains for years on end — and could induce immunity to potential pandemic subtypes.Sophisticated intel on individual immune responses could also help boost vaccine efficacy. The immune system trains itself to react to the virus variants it encounters early in life — a phenomenon called imprinting— which lessens its ability to respond to new strains of influenza encountered as we age. “If we can't overcome imprinting, your universal flu vaccine may have to be given as a first exposure to a newborn infant,” says Klugman.More intel could be collected using the Alter group’s systems serology approach, which can help reveal how different factors shape an individual’s response to both infection and vaccination. This knowledge could help develop vaccination strategies tailored for different populations. “By creating these tailored vaccine responses, we can then utilize preexisting immunity to shape the quality of the response,” Alter says.Speeding delivery No matter how well designed a vaccine is, it must be produced at scale and delivered. Today influenza virus is grown at scale in live cells or chicken eggs, extensively purified, then processed to isolate key viral antigens. It can take up to six months before sufficient vaccine is available for population-wide inoculation — a timetable that could cost countless lives in a pandemic.Alternative design and formulation strategies could streamline the production process. King and Baker are using Rosetta software to design viral proteins that self-assemble into compact nanoparticles. “They’re tailored to present influenza antigens in the optimal way to get the best possible immune response, and that's something that you can only do with computational protein design,” says King. In a recent preprint, the pair claimed proof of concept that this approach could match the protection provided by existing annual flu vaccines.5RNA vaccines offer hope as well, since they are cheaper and faster to manufacture than protein-based biologic drugs, Ross says. New RNA sequences can easily be swapped into a production pipeline, helping upgrade vaccine designs as researchers learn more about antiviral immunity.As discoveries emerge from the labs, funders and vaccine advocates have taken notice, and they’ve begun marshalling their forces for a major push toward a UIV. In 2018, the Global Funders Consortium for Universal Influenza Vaccine Development was formed as a joint effort between government agencies, non-profits, and research foundations in North America, Europe and Asia. In 2019 the Gates Foundation and Flu Lab issued $12 million in funding to support innovative strategies for “universal” influenza vaccine development.Also in 2019, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) launched a network of Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers, part of a seven-year program, launched with $51 million its first year, to advance new solutions for universal vaccine development. “This is one of the largest programmes that NIAID has ever launched,” says Ross.Meanwhile, Sabin continues to promote emerging technologies to achieve new vaccine breakthroughs. Knobler is encouraged by how rapidly COVID-19 vaccines were developed, and hopes they will serve as inspiration for the post-pandemic battle against influenza. “There is a redoubling of effort toward a universal influenza vaccine,” she says. “This is an enemy we know, and defences should be shored up now.” Explore how Sabin Vaccine Institute’s Influenzer Initiative is supporting the advancement of next-generation influenza vaccine solutions here.The Sabin Vaccine Institute is a non-profit organization committed to expanding vaccine access and uptake globally, advancing vaccine research and development, and amplifying vaccine knowledge and innovation. With more than two decades of experience, Sabin is committed to finding solutions that last and extending the full benefits of vaccines to all people.

This time last year, flu visits were in the 5 to 6% range, and above 3% in 2018, according to data compiled by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Back to Healio Influenza vaccine-provided immunity declines by around 10% each month following vaccination, according to study results published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Researchers said September or October are the best months to get the shot. “An annual influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older in the United States. However, the best time to get an annual flu vaccine remains up for debate,” Jill M. Ferdinands, PhD, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s Influenza Division, told Healio. “With mounting evidence showing that vaccine-induced immunity wanes over the course of the flu season, it’s important to consider whether early vaccination — for example, in July or August — may result in reduced immune protection against flu before the end of the season between March and May, especially among older adults.” Researchers observed a “significant” waning of influenza vaccine-provided immunity of between 8% and 9% each month following vaccination. Credit: Adobe Stock According to Ferdinands, current recommendations attempt to balance the need to immunize the population before flu starts to circulate each year with concerns about waning immunity by recommending that vaccination be offered by the end of October. “This study hoped to gain a better understanding of the extent of in-season waning of influenza vaccine protection to help reduce uncertainty regarding the best time to get a flu vaccine,” she said. Ferdinands and colleagues assessed vaccine efficacy among adults enrolled in the U.S. Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) who were hospitalized for acute respiratory illness during the 2015-2016 through 2018-2019 influenza seasons. According to the study, participants were interviewed to collect information about demographics, vaccination and illness characteristics while respiratory specimens were tested for influenza. Patients who tested positive for influenza were conted as cases, and those testing negative counted as controls. The researchers then used multivariate logistic regression models with influenza-associated hospitalization as the outcome and time in days between vaccination and symptom onset as the predictor to estimate vaccine efficacy. Overall, the study demonstrated that influenza vaccine effectiveness peaks shortly after vaccination and then declines at a rate of 8% per 30 days against influenza A (H3N2), 9% per 30 days against influenza A (H1N1), and 8% per 30 days against influenza B viruses among all adults 18 years or older. Ferdinands noted that, among adults 65 years and older, the declines are even greater, with effectiveness declining at a rate of 11% per 30 days against influenza A (H3N2), 10% per 30 days against influenza A (H1N1), and 11% against influenza B viruses. “The study found that there is significant, in-season waning of vaccine-provided immunity against flu. The public health implications of these findings warrant closer examination because optimizing timing of influenza vaccination could lead to appreciable gains in public health benefits, given the large burden of influenza morbidity and mortality annually in the U.S.,” Ferdinands said. “Getting vaccinated in July or August is probably too early, especially for adults 65 years and older, because of the likelihood of reduced protection against flu infection later in the flu season,” she said. “For now, September and October are good times to get vaccinated for most people.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Ferdinands JM, et al.

Now, experts are warning that the virus might be with us forever -- but it won't always be a deadly plague."This coronavirus is going to be here to stay," explained Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. "Eradication of this new coronavirus is basically impossible."Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, concurred, adding that he is also "not sure we're ever going to really eliminate this virus. ... It's not like measles, where you get life-long sterilizing immunity."But even if the virus sticks around, new vaccines and new drugs to fight the virus mean it's unlikely to cause severe illness in the future. Offit predicts "that eventually, it will cause fewer deaths than influenza."MORE: What CDC found about wearing 2 masksIt is possible, experts say, that COVID-19 could become a seasonal illness, like the flu. Virologists call this an "endemic" disease -- one that is constantly circulating among us. In the years and decades to come, many people will be exposed to it in childhood and develop some immunity, which would protect them later in life against serious disease.A child wears a coronavirus protective mask while being carried in Los Angeles, Feb. 10. 2021.Lucy Nicholson/ReutersMeanwhile, current vaccines have shown great success preventing symptomatic and severe disease, which will help save lives even if the virus continues to transmit at low levels."The hope is that with enough natural immunity and immunizations, this becomes part of the natural cycle of cold season, but doesn't have the same impact," Brownstein said."I think it will become seasonal. All acute respiratory viral infections are," added Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago.Whether this coronavirus does become endemic depends a lot on our behavior, Stephen S. Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, told ABC News. "Early on, when the virus was much more limited in distribution, it might have been possible to stop the pandemic ... if the world had acted earlier in a coordinated way."However, given how the pandemic has been handled so far, it is likely that it will become endemic, with the virus probably taking a similar route to the four existing "human" coronaviruses that are already in circulation and cause upper respiratory infections, Morse said."We dismissed the human coronaviruses as a 'common cold' or 'flu-like illness,'" Morse said. "But they've been with us for a while" and evolved into endemic coronaviruses. "I suspect we're probably seeing the same process repeating itself with this virus, eventually perhaps a fifth 'human coronavirus.'""I'd say it's already endemic," Cobey said. "The "endemic" flu is also a pandemic in the sense that it sweeps the globe every year. However, she continued, recurring epidemics of the virus will probably not be as severe as the first.MORE: 'The mutants are here': US vaccines in a race to box out virusPeople should not rely on achieving "herd immunity" as a way to curb COVID-19 infections, according to Jennie Lavine, a postdoctoral fellow at Emory University and lead author of a study conducted by researchers from Emory and Penn State University."Based on our analysis, we do not expect herd immunity to arise in the case of COVID-19," Lavine said. That is because if the immunity that prevents transmission wanes, people will continue to have periodic reinfections.Experts say it is still unclear as to how long immunity lasts after a COVID-19 infection, though evidence seems to suggest that, unlike some viruses, COVID-19 is unlikely to give you lifelong immunity. But even if you are infected again, the second infection will likely be less serious and probably won't make you as sick as the first.Due to uncertainty around immunity after receiving a vaccine, it is still a bit too early to determine if people will need a yearly COVID-19 shot, according to experts, who add that they also don't know how quickly the virus will continue to evolve."If CoV-2 experiences antigenic evolution at rates that are similar to influenza, annual shots for vulnerable populations may well be necessary. This is something we will need to continue to measure in the coming years," Levine added.A Covid-19 test is administed at a mobile clinic in the Brooklyn borough of New York Jan. 27, 2021.Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesBrownstein predicted that as more and more adults develop immunity through vaccination or natural infection, "the virus will naturally gravitate to younger age groups, because essentially that becomes the natural pool of people that are susceptible."Immunizations have been shown to reduce rates of severe cases and thus hospitalizations and deaths. If the virus continues to mutate and evade vaccines, scientists may have to adapt vaccines to more closely match the dominant strain."[We] will have to be nimble to be able to adjust readily, to make versions of the vaccine that actually are specifically directed towards whatever mutation is actually prevalent at any given time," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert said in a White House briefing Jan. 29.MORE: Couple starts Facebook page that helps thousands of older people get COVID-19 vaccinationsAlthough experts said it's impossible to predict the future, they agreed that the virus that causes COVID-19 is unlikely to be completely eradicated by current vaccines and prevention measures. Rather, it will likely transform into a milder illness that can be managed seasonally, like the annual flu."We may have to think about rewiring our brains around how we view this virus," Brownstein said. He said everyone should prepare for a yearly evolutionary arms race, similar to the one against the seasonal flu, and ultimately acknowledge that COVID-19 is here to stay.In addition, if we can curb transmission as much, and as rapidly as possible, with inoculations as well as by staying vigilant with "non-pharmaceutical interventions," such as masks, distancing, hand hygiene and ventilation, we could prevent or slow down the emergence of new variants, Morse told ABC News.ABC News' Sony Salzman contributed to this report.Related TopicsCoronavirusPopular ReadsCalifornia fire grows over 20,000 acresNov 7, 9:47 PMSeattle stabbings: 10 attacked in 2 daysNov 8, 7:04 PMFEMA probing supervisor over Trump sign orderNov 9, 3:46 PMWhat Trump's win reveals about American votersNov 9, 5:09 AM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsDeborah Fuller – The Conversation Menu Close Home Edition Africa Australia Brasil Canada Canada (français) España Europe France Global Indonesia New Zealand United Kingdom United States Edition: Available editions Global Africa Australia Brasil Canada Canada (français) España Europe France Indonesia New Zealand United Kingdom United States Get newsletter Become an author Sign up as a reader Sign in Search Academic rigour, journalistic flair Deborah Fuller (She/Her) 8 Articles 5 Comments Professor of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington Profile Articles Activity Vaccines and antivirals are the primary strategies used to combat viral infections in humans and emerging pandemics. HIV-1, influenza and more recently, the emergence of Zika and SARS-CoV-2, pose significant challenges. For HIV-1, infected individuals harbor a substantial array of HIV-1 variants, a situation that presents a daunting challenge for developing vaccines and therapies. Similarly, the worldwide variability in flu reservoirs makes it difficult to predict which flu strain might acquire the ability to infect the human population, and due to the narrow timeframe between detecting a human infection and the “predict and produce” method for generating the vaccine each season, current influenza vaccines will likely be inadequate for preventing the next flu pandemic. Furthermore, transmission of viruses form mosquitos, such as Zika or from animals, such as SAR-CoV-2 pose a constant threat and new vaccine and antiviral technologies capable or rapidly responding to these threats are urgently needed. In an effort to address these issues, we are investigating new vaccine and antiviral concepts aimed at achieving broader, more universal protection against a wider range of highly variable viruses. Toward this goal, we have designed a therapeutic HIV DNA vaccine that when administered in combination with antiretroviral drugs to nonhuman primates infected with a primary isolate of SIV, induces profound control of viral replication that persists after antivirals are withdrawn. Viral control in this model correlated with strong mucosal CD8 responses localized in the gut, and this finding has more recently led us to investigate new DNA vaccine approaches that can more precisely focus CD8 against highly conserved epitopes and novel genetic adjuvants that can localize these responses to the gut, which is a primary source of residual virus. Similarly, using DNA and RNA vaccines and antivirals designed to precisely target highly conserved regions in influenza, we have shown significant protection against a wide range of influenza strains in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates. More recently, we have shown that DNA and RNA vaccines can be rapidly developed in response to an emerging pandemic such as COVID-19. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of these new platforms for achieving broad protection against HIV and influenza and as a rapid response to emerging pandemics.. Studies currently in progress in the Fuller lab aim to elucidate mechanisms of protection mediated by these strategies and investigate various approach including novel adjuvants, DNA and RNA vaccine delivery approaches and combinatorial regimens to further improve these outcomes. Results from our work has resulted in over a dozen patents and two start-up biotechnology companies.

In many parts of the world, these viruses cause seasonal epidemics during the colder months of the year.The flu vaccine helps to protect you from getting sick with the flu. It’s made based on the strains that scientists predict will be most common during the upcoming flu season. Because of this, it can vary in effectiveness from year to year.This article will explore the benefits of the flu vaccine, how effective it is, and what may influence the vaccine’s effectiveness.What are the benefits of getting the flu vaccine?Before we discuss the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, let’s break down its various benefits.The flu vaccine reduces your risk of getting sickThe main benefit of the flu vaccine is that it can prevent you from becoming ill with the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that for the 2019–2020 flu season, vaccination prevented 7.52 million illnesses in the United States.While the flu typically causes mild to moderate symptoms in many people, getting sick can still be unpleasant and make it difficult for you to go about your daily life. It can also lead to increased doctor’s visits and missed days of school or work.Helps prevent serious illnessThe flu can lead to potentially serious complications like pneumonia or the worsening of underlying health conditions. Some people are more at risk for serious illness from the flu. This includes:adults aged 65 and olderchildren younger than 5 years oldpregnant womenpeople with chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetesthose with a weakened immune systemGetting the flu vaccine may help protect these higher-risk individuals from contracting the flu and potentially becoming very ill. In fact, the CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 105,000 hospitalizations during the 2019–2020 flu season.May reduce the severity of flu symptoms Some people who get the flu vaccine still become sick with the flu. However, there’s evidence that symptoms may be less serious in these individuals.For example, a 2017 study evaluated how vaccination impacted flu severity in adults who were hospitalized with the flu. It found that vaccination was associated with lower intensive care unit (ICU) admission and shorter hospital stays.A 2020 study investigated pediatric emergency room visits and hospitalizations during the 2018–2019 flu season. It found that flu vaccination reduced influenza-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations by 40 to 60 percent.Helps protect people in your communityWhen many people within a community receive the flu vaccine, it can help prevent influenza viruses from effectively circulating within that community. This can be an extra layer of protection, particularly for those at risk of serious illness.How effective is it?Flu vaccine effectiveness can change from year to year. At the time of writing this article, the 2020–2021 flu season is underway. In the coming months, scientists will begin to get estimates of the effectiveness of the 2020–2021 flu vaccine.However, the CDC does currently have information about the estimated effectiveness of the vaccines from past flu seasons. The chart below shows the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for the previous five flu seasons.Flu seasonPercent vaccine effectiveness2019–202039 percent2018–201929 percent2017–201838 percent2016–201740 percent2015–201648 percentDoes flu vaccine effectiveness differ across age groups?It’s possible that there can be some variance in the effectiveness of the vaccine between different age groups. The CDC tracks this data as well as data on the flu’s overall effectiveness. Here’s a look at the effectiveness estimates for all vaccine types across different age groups from the past five flu seasons, according to the CDC.

These factors can include the population studied, the specific flu season, and how the study was conducted.Is the nasal spray vaccine as effective as the flu shot?There are several different types of flu vaccines. Many of them are given as an injection. These vaccines contain inactivated (“dead”) flu virus or only single viral proteins.The nasal spray vaccine is a flu vaccine that’s sprayed into your nose. It’s made up of virus that’s been weakened so it can’t establish an infection. It’s known as FluMist or the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV).In previous years, the nasal spray vaccine wasn’t recommended. The reason for this was because it had less effectiveness in children against certain types of influenza viruses.However, there have been recent improvements in the manufacturing of this vaccine and some data indicates that the effectiveness of the nasal spray vaccine is now similar to that of the flu shot.Because of this, the nasal spray vaccine has been recommended since the 2018–2019 flu season. In fact, the CDC states that there’s no preference for one type of vaccine over another for the 2020–2021 flu season. Are there certain factors that can affect how well it works?Previously, we discussed that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine can vary from year to year. Let’s take a deeper dive into why this is the case.Flu strains chosen for the vaccineInfluenza viruses are constantly changing. Because of this, the influenza strains that were common during last year’s flu season may not be as prevalent for the current flu season.Early each year, scientists meet to select the strains to include in the flu vaccine for countries in the northern hemisphere, including the United States. These meetings are held early in the year because vaccine producers need time to make the vaccine so it’s ready for the beginning of the flu season in the fall.Vaccine strains are chosen based on what current surveillance data predicts may be the most common strains for the upcoming flu season. However, sometimes the selected strains don’t match well with the strains that actually end up being most prevalent during a flu season.When this happens, vaccine effectiveness can be low. However, if the strains selected are a good match, vaccine effectiveness is higher.Influenza virus subtypeFlu vaccines protect against two types of influenza virus: influenza A and influenza B. Influenza A viruses are very diverse and are further divided into different subtypes. Two subtypes that you may be familiar with are H1N1 and H3N2.Typically, flu vaccines give good protection for influenza B and H1N1 strains. However, they provide less protection against H3N2 strains. This is due to the various genetic changes that can commonly happen in H3N2 viruses.A 2016 review looked at 142 studies on flu vaccine effectiveness by flu type. It found that:Vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 strains was only 33 percent.Meanwhile, vaccine effectiveness was 54 percent and 61 percent against influenza B and H1N1 strains, respectively.When H3N2 vaccine strains were a good match, vaccine effectiveness was still only 33 percent. When vaccines weren’t a good match, effectiveness dropped to 23 percent.So, if H3N2 strains are more common during a flu season than other types of influenza, the effectiveness of the vaccine can be lower.Individual factorsIndividual factors, like your age and overall health, can also impact vaccine effectiveness. For instance, older adults tend to have a weaker response to influenza virus vaccination.To help with this, a high-dose flu vaccine is available for adults aged 65 and older. Large-scale studies of vaccine effectiveness in this population have found that the high-dose vaccine is slightly more effective than standard dose vaccines.Who should get the flu vaccine?The current recommendation for the 2020–2021 flu season is that all individuals aged 6 months and older receive a flu vaccine. No one type of vaccine is recommended over another.Getting the flu vaccine is particularly important for people that are at an increased risk of severe illness from the flu. This includes:adults aged 65 and olderchildren younger than 5 years oldpregnant womenpeople with chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetesthose with a weakened immune systemFlu vaccination and COVID-19Getting a flu vaccine is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are a couple of reasons for this:A flu vaccine can help protect you from getting sick with the flu, which has similar symptoms to COVID-19.The benefits of flu vaccination can help keep you out of the doctor’s office and hospital, which in turn helps to conserve medical resources for those sick with COVID-19 or other health conditions.How long is it effective for?Generally speaking, a flu vaccine should protect you through the current flu season. You’ll need to receive another flu vaccine for the next flu season. There are several reasons why a flu vaccine is only effective for one flu season. First, influenza viruses change constantly. Because of this, the strains included in this year’s flu vaccine may not be the most common strains during next year’s flu season.Second, the level of protection (immunity) generated by the flu vaccine wanes over time.For example, a 2019 study found that, across seven flu seasons, every additional 28 days after vaccination was associated with a 16 percent increase in the likelihood of testing positive for flu.When is the best time to get vaccinated?The CDC recommends getting your flu vaccine by the end of October each year. However, getting vaccinated later than this can still provide valuable protection.It’s generally a good rule of thumb to avoid getting vaccinated early, like in July or August. This is because the immunity generated by the vaccine declines over time. So, you could be at an increased risk for contracting the flu later in the season if you get the vaccine too early.The bottom lineThe flu vaccine helps to protect you from getting sick with the flu. It can also reduce the seriousness of your illness if you become sick. Additionally, it can help prevent influenza viruses from circulating widely in your community.Flu vaccine effectiveness changes from year to year due to several factors. Its effectiveness can be affected by viral evolution and by the subtype of influenza that’s predominant in a given year. Individual factors like your age and overall health can also play a role.Because influenza viruses are always changing and the immunity generated by the flu vaccine wanes over time, you’ll need to get a new flu vaccine every year, preferably by the end of October.

However, existing data is limited in availability, coverage, granularity, and timeliness. Data-driven forecasts of disease dynamics are crucial for decision-making by health officials and private citizens alike. In this work, we focus on a machine-learned anonymized mobility map (hereon referred to as AMM) aggregated over hundreds of millions of smartphones and evaluate its utility in forecasting epidemics. We factor AMM into a metapopulation model to retrospectively forecast influenza in the USA and Australia. We show that the AMM model performs on-par with those based on commuter surveys, which are sparsely available and expensive. We also compare it with gravity and radiation based models of mobility, and find that the radiation model’s performance is quite similar to AMM and commuter flows. Additionally, we demonstrate our model’s ability to predict disease spread even across state boundaries. Our work contributes towards developing timely infectious disease forecasting at a global scale using human mobility datasets expanding their applications in the area of infectious disease epidemiology.

A recently updated estimate of global influenza burden shows even higher than previously thought magnitude: 291,000–645,000 seasonal influenza-related deaths each year1. The 2017/2018 influenza season was of particularly high severity2. It resulted in 960,000 hospitalizations in the United States alone and extended periods of high influenza activity. Even with sustained efforts to improve vaccine coverage, influenza continues to strain the healthcare system. This highlights the need for developing systems that provide reliable and relevant forecasts of short-term and seasonal influenza activity. Forecasting seasonal influenza, especially within the United States, has been an area of active investigation in the epidemiological community. Contests such as the CDC Forecasting Challenge3,4,5,6 have fostered innovation and constant information exchange among researchers in the field7, and8 provide extensive reviews on the different approaches and methodologies used in practice for forecasting seasonal influenza. In order to forecast the influenza activity characterized by percentage of visits with influenza-like illness symptoms, researchers have used wide-ranging data sources including search trends9, social media10, medical claims11, and weather data12.While some of the techniques used to forecast influenza are statistical, i.e., using the patterns in the time-series data of cases and associated datasets, other methods involve a mechanistic representation of the disease process itself. This usually involves capturing the mechanisms and associated factors by which individuals are exposed to the pathogen, infect each other, acquire immunity by recovery or vaccination, etc. In addition to being more descriptive, mechanistic models allow incorporation of interventions and study of potential counterfactual scenarios. Metapopulation models are a popular class of mechanistic models, and are well suited to capture spatial heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Variants of this approach have been successfully used to model and forecast infectious diseases13,14,15,16,17. When modeling infectious diseases mechanistically, it is useful to note that in the human population the spread is facilitated by social contacts, which are in turn influenced by the movement of individuals. Researchers have leveraged this fact and have used information on human mobility to predict the dynamics of disease spread. When constructing a model of disease dynamics, even in the absence of high-quality mobility data, one may resort to standard models such as gravity or radiation18; provides an extensive review of such mobility models and their wide-ranging applications, including in the field of epidemiology. Datasets that capture movement of individuals at micro and macro scales are increasingly available (Supplementary Table 1), some of them in the public domain enabling their use in infectious disease modeling19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28 (see Supplementary Notes 1 for a more detailed literature survey). A recent study that combined these different facets and modeled sub-city influenza dynamics for New York City (NYC) was reported in ref. 17. Similar to our work, they used a metapopulation modeling approach to forecast influenza activity at the borough level (and zip code level) within NYC. Their main focus was to evaluate the presence and absence of travel networks on the forecast performance. In contrast, in our work we tested the effectiveness of different networks derived from official surveys, aggregated location data, and mobility models.Existing high resolution mobility data are based on call data records and therefore available only in limited jurisdictions, where the telecom provider is operating. As a result, cross-border movement is typically not captured, nor is long-distance international travel. By contrast, the aggregate flows of populations around the world we compute here are based on ambient location that is passively logged by the phones’ location sensors, when users opt into this feature. With the aim to better understand global patterns of population movements, we aggregate data from Location History collected passively from smartphones that opted-in to secure location history29. Anonymity is an important consideration in our work to ensure that no individual user’s journey can be identified, we only share representative models of aggregate data employing differential privacy30, which intentionally adds noise to the data in a way that maintains both users’ privacy, anonymity, and the data’s accuracy (see Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Snapshot of AMM.a Northeastern United States and b Southeastern Australia. Color of each 5 km2 cell corresponds to the annual average of total outflow volume in logarithmic scale (warmer colors imply higher connectivity). Note the variations in sparsity and total connectivity. Data are shown in the spatial resolution of cells, although for our subsequent analyses we use AMM aggregated to counties/states to match the surveillance data. Further, for the United States the study is performed at city (New York) and state (NY and NJ) scales, whereas for Australia the study is performed at a national scale, highlighting the versatility of the dataset.Full size imageIn this paper, we use a metapopulation framework to forecast influenza activity in and around the counties (boroughs) of NYC, and further extend the approach for state-level influenza forecasting in Australia. We choose these regions due to the availability of ground truth case data at high spatial and/or temporal granularity. As a source of ground truth, we use data on emergency department (ED) visits for NYC, lab-tested flu positive counts for New Jersey and Australia. To guarantee anonymity and match the resolution of health datasets, AMM data are aggregated at the resolution of counties in the United States, and at the resolution of states for Australia. These anonymized aggregated data come from users who opted-in to share their location data, which is already a vital source of information for estimates of live traffic and parking availability31. In addition to AMM, we use commuter counts from the respective Census agencies, unconstrained gravity model, radiation model with a global parameter for commuter proportions, and a no-mobility baseline for comparison purposes. We did not calibrate the gravity model with commuter data (to estimate the exponent, for example), to ensure that the compared networks are independent of each other. The complete list of datasets used in this paper is provided in Table 1, while Fig. 2 provides an overview schematic of the disease simulation and calibration process. More details on the data preparation, disease simulation, and calibration methodology are described in the “Methods”.Table 1 List of datasets.Full size tableFig. 2: Overall methodology.a Stages in a single iteration of the metapopulation model: the large circles represent the patches in the simulation, and the gray edges represent the travel network, with varying thickness denoting heterogeneity in flow volumes. The sample population shows four individuals in patch A (squares), five in patch B (circles), and three in patch C (stars). The colors represent the disease state the individuals are in (susceptible, exposed, infected, or recovered). The wavy dashed arrows show movement of individuals (randomly chosen according to outgoing edge probabilities). In the first step, individuals are moved from their home patch to another patch (first panel), creating the effective population (second panel). The disease dynamics may include exposure events (transition from S–E), onset of infectiousness (E–I), and recovery events (I–R). The nodes undergoing these transitions are highlighted in the third panel, where we see an onset of infectiousness in patch A, two exposures and a recovery in patch C. Finally, the individuals return to their home patch (fourth panel). Note that, although for descriptive purposes we use individual agents above, the system is actually simulated deterministically using the mass-action principle. b Bayesian calibration framework: the calibration involves generating samples from the parameter space, evaluating the corresponding simulated epidemic curves in comparison to the ground truth. The appropriate reweighted epidemic curves are combined to provide the forecast. See Supplementary Methods for details on both the disease model and the calibration procedure.Full size imageResultsExploratory analysis of mobility flowsIn an epidemiological model of influenza, the disease transmits via people-to-people contacts, thus a more realistic mobility network might be able to better characterize the epidemic dynamics, leading to better epidemic forecasting of influenza. Before reporting on influenza forecasting performance, we compare the four mobility networks structurally by using the normalized mobility flows for the counties of New York and New Jersey. While comparing the networks in terms of flow distributions and network structure, we focused only on pairwise flows, excluding self-loops, since all four networks had relatively large self-flows (self-loops are omitted only for mobility analysis). We refer to these networks obtained from the anonymized mobility map as AMM, commuter counts from the American Community Survey (ACS) as COMMUTE, gravity and radiation models computed using population sizes and distances as GRAVITY and RADIATION, respectively.By comparing flow distributions and node betweenness (shown in Fig. 3), we observe that (1) AMM and COMMUTE network are highly positively correlated (Pearson coefficient 0.9) in terms of the flow distribution, while RADIATION model has a reasonable match with AMM (PCC 0.71) and COMMUTE (PCC 0.63); GRAVITY model on the other hand has low similarity (PCC ~0.5) with the other three networks, (2) the mobility networks of AMM and COMMUTE network are sparse and exhibit a community structure usually seen in urban mobility networks, while RADIATION and GRAVITY are dense by definition, RADIATION network shows similar neighborhood structure to AMM and COMMUTE, (3) AMM and RADIATION networks have similar top betweenness counties, whereas COMMUTE data pick different neighboring counties. Note that while AMM is aggregated and anonymized data sourced from high resolution mobility, COMMUTE is obtained from representative surveys, which may be dated. Similar comparisons for the Australian networks, along with additional details on the mobility data description and network construction are provided in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Notes 2.Fig. 3: Structural comparison of the networks.a Correlation between networks. Pearson correlation coefficient between the different mobility networks (FIPS-sorted by source and destination). AMM and COMMUTE have a high positive correlation value (0.90), followed by RADIATION model (0.71 with AMM), while GRAVITY has relatively small positive correlation with the other networks. b–e Adjacency flow matrices of AMM, COMMUTE, GRAVITY, and RADIATION. Nodes are arranged by spatial proximity. Heatmap color is indicative of normalized flow volume (darker color denotes larger flow). Note that while AMM and COMMUTE are sparser and seem to be clustered, GRAVITY network, by virtue of its definition, is more homogeneous. More detailed versions of AMM and COMMUTE flows are shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4. f Betweenness measures at county level for all four networks. Among the four networks, AMM, and RADIATION models have similar sets of top counties by betweenness, while COMMUTE chooses nearby but distinct counties. These counties are reasonable choices, since they connect rural counties, e.g., Allegany or St. Lawrence or Cape May, to highly urbanized counties like Manhattan or Brooklyn. However, in GRAVITY we failed to identify any such distinct pattern.Full size imageForecast performance in NYCWe first report the networks’ ability in predicting ED visits during the 2016–2017 influenza season in the five boroughs of NYC (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). To give some context, nationally the 2016–2017 season had an onset (crossing and staying above baseline for three consecutive weeks) on week 50 of 2016, peaked on week 6 of 2017, and lasted until (stayed above baseline) week 14 of 2017. HHS Region 2 (which includes New York and New Jersey), while having the same peak and end week, technically had an earlier onset (week 47 of 2016). We perform a comparative study in forecasting influenza activity among the mobility networks and the no-mobility baseline by incorporating them in the metapopulation model framework, which we refer to as PatchSim32. Each of the instances of the PatchSim with different mobility networks (or no network) is first calibrated using the ground truth observations until a given week (also referred to as data horizon) and the calibrated models are run forward to produce short-term (1–4 weeks look ahead) and seasonal target (onset time, peak time, and peak visit count) predictions for each of the boroughs33.This experiment is run retrospectively at different time points of the influenza season serving as the data horizons and comparison is made based on the overall performance of the model throughout the season. We use a Bayesian approach to calibrate the model’s disease parameters. The calibration procedure yields a posterior probability distribution on the unknown model parameters, and 90% prediction envelopes are obtained where appropriate. For comparison among the performance of four models, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is computed for each data horizon based on 1-to-4-week-ahead median predictions.Figure 4a, b shows the 90% envelopes calibrated and forecasted ED visits predictions by each of the models in five NYC counties at data horizons of week 2 (pre-peak) and week 6 (post-peak) of 2017, respectively. From Fig. 4c, it can be seen that the performances of AMM and commute are similar, and are better than gravity and baseline models in terms of overall MAPE. We choose to show the short-term prediction performance between week 50 of 2016 and week 12 of 2017, since they roughly coincide with the onset and end of the 2016–2017 influenza season. The no-mobility baseline performs better during early weeks, especially before onset, but as the season progresses, its performance deteriorates in comparison to the other network models. The MAPE performance for individual boroughs and two other seasons (2015–2016 and 2017–2018) are provided in Supplementary Notes 2. We note that while the ordering of performance varies between seasons, AMM, COMMUTE, and RADIATION consistently perform similar to each other.Fig. 4: Prediction envelopes and comparative forecast performance.The figure shows the comparative performance of the five models in predicting emergency department visits in the five boroughs of New York City. a, b show the calibration envelope (light shaded) and 90% prediction envelope (dark shaded) at weeks 2 and 6 of 2017, respectively. These weeks were chosen to be roughly two weeks pre-peak and two weeks post-peak across boroughs. The solid lines show the ground truth, and colors throughout are representative of boroughs. The plots are arranged horizontally by boroughs and vertically by the mobility network. c MAPE performance. One-to-four-week-ahead median predictions at different data horizons are used to evaluate the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), for every other week of the flu season. Note that the lower the MAPE, the better the network. The overall MAPE is provided in the legend shows that AMM, COMMUTE, and RADIATION models perform similarly, and do better than the GRAVITY or NO-MOBILITY baselines.Full size imageFigure 5 shows the predictive distribution of the seasonal forecasts (specifically peak time) provided by different models at different data horizons for each of the boroughs (other seasonal targets such as peak intensity and onset time are provided in Supplementary Notes 2). We note again that as the data horizon increases, the models produce tighter estimates of the seasonal forecasts. At the beginning of the season, all mobility models predict an early peak, but as the season evolves the prediction intervals get narrower and cover the ground truth. We also note that for the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 season (see Supplementary for figures), similar conclusions can be drawn, where AMM, COMMUTE, and RADIATION perform similarly in terms of predicting the seasonal targets.Fig. 5: Multi-horizon comparison of seasonal forecasts across networks.For each of the networks (columns), and each borough (rows), the boxplots (median, IQR, and whiskers at 1.5 IQR) show the posterior predictive distribution for peak time forecast at different time horizons (n = 1000). Similar plots for other targets (peak value, onset time) and other seasons are available in Supplementary Notes 2.Full size imageExtending beyond the NYC boroughsIn addition to estimating influenza activity into the future, the mechanistic model can also be used to meaningfully impute potential gaps in case data in neighboring regions, utilizing the available case data and inter-regional mobility. To test the utility of the disease model along with the higher resolution AMM for this purpose, we first perform a leave-one-out cross validation study, where each time the PatchSim is calibrated using partial ground truth data leaving one of the five counties unused, and the calibrated model is used to predict the epicurve of the left-out county. Figure 6 shows the 90% prediction intervals for the held out counties along with peak time and peak intensity predictions. The results suggest that such a setup can be used to forecast even in regions where no past case data are available, provided we have case data for well-connected regions and a good estimate of inter-regional mobility.Fig. 6: Leave-one-out cross validation performance.a For each of the boroughs, the ground truth is shown in solid line along with the 90% calibrated envelope when the borough’s data were left out of the calibration process. b Boxplots (median, IQR, and whiskers at 1.5 IQR) of the predicted peak time and total ED visits (episize) for the left-out borough (n = 1000), with the ground truth shown by blue dots.Full size imageAs further proof of these idea, we extend the radius of the PatchSim simulation model to cover the entire states of New York and New Jersey. Based on past ILI data, while New York and New Jersey have typically peaked within 2 weeks in the last three seasons, in general, their peak timings could be off by about 8 weeks. Further, the county-level influenza dynamics also shows sufficient variability, and hence it would be interesting if our model could capture it. The disease model is again calibrated only for the NYC counties using the ED visits data, and the calibrated model is used to recreate the influenza season (ED visits to be exact) for each county in NY and NJ state. We show in Fig. 7 the simulated trajectories and the corresponding ground truth for the five boroughs and the six neighboring counties in New Jersey. Note that, since we did not have ED visits data for New Jersey, we used the lab-tested positive counts made available by the state’s health department. We also report summary statistics such as onset time, peak time, and end of the season, to show that the simulated trajectories are quite close to recreating the flu season in these neighboring counties. We also tried to match the aggregate curves to ILI% incidence from NY state and HHS Region 2 (comprising New York and New Jersey) with limited success. The simulated curves for all NY and NJ counties with ground truth data, and the stateegion level fits are shown in Supplementary Notes 2.Fig. 7: Extrapolation for New Jersey counties adjacent to NYC.a Simulated trajectories (thin lines) along with ground truth (bold lines) shown for the five boroughs of New York City, and the six neighboring counties in New Jersey.

Onset and end of season is defined with respect to a threshold of 10% of peak value.Full size imageForecasting influenza in AustraliaTo demonstrate the generality and potential global scope of AMM, we chose to replicate our approach for seasonal influenza forecasting in Australia. We chose Australia for the following reasons: (1) sparser populations spread across a wider spatial scale, where the effects of mobility may be more pronounced34, (2) the presence of high-quality surveillance data in the public domain, (3) “inverse” influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere. As a test case, we evaluated short-term forecasts for the 2016 influenza season. Similar to the NYC study, we compared the performance of AMM to that of COMMUTE, GRAVITY, RADIATION, and a NO-MOBILITY baseline. Data sources for commuter flows, populations, and influenza surveillance are listed in Table 1 (data preparation details are in the Supplementary Methods). Figure 8 summarizes the underlying datasets and the forecast performance comparison among the mobility models. As earlier, we note that AMM performs on-par with RADIATION, COMMUTE data. Compared to the NYC results, we find little difference between NO-MOBILITY and other mobility models, perhaps due to the sparsity of the region. The calibrated and forecast curves along with MAPE per region are provided in Supplementary Notes 2.Fig. 8: Summary of results for Australia.a Mobility datasets for Australia: the heat maps show a comparison between the different mobility networks used for Australia at the state level. The reported values are the natural logarithm of the normalized flows. Note that while there is a significant self-loop component in all four networks, there is a higher similarity in magnitude and distribution between COMMUTE and AMM. b Influenza surveillance for Australia, 2016: the dataset obtained from Australia’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) shows flu positive counts at State level aggregated to weekly resolution, with the baseline count removed (see Supplementary Methods for details). c Forecast performance comparison: similar to Fig. 4c, this figure shows the average MAPE across weeks for the four mobility networks (including the no mobility baseline). We see that all networks have similar performance with COMMUTE and AMM being the top two models. We also note that the NO MOBILITY baseline is not very different in performance, highlighting the sparsity of the region.Full size imageDiscussionInfectious disease forecasting has risen to prominence in the recent decade, thanks to the increased availability of public health surveillance system data and development of sophisticated methodologies. Real-time disease forecasting is still plagued by the lack of current estimates on mobility and interaction patterns, which are known to be key drivers of disease spread. We demonstrate the utility of high-quality mobility data for disease modeling and forecasting in areas that have detailed and extensive ground truth available, in order to be able to exactly quantify the efficacy of our approach.However, the implications of our approach extend beyond high-resource parts of the world. In fact, most regions, even in high-resource countries, do not have disease case data at sub-state resolutions. Another drawback of traditional case data streams is the temporal lag in data availability, thus making even nowcasting the current state of influenza a practical challenge. Models based on population accounting, both static (census counts) and dynamic (commuter and migration flows) are neither comprehensive nor current in most parts of the world, thus hindering the performance of mobility models used as proxies. In contrast, mobility statistics such as AMM are more timely and high-recall, and therefore serve as an important complement augmenting and filling gaps in influenza data. Given the coverage, the forecasting framework can be expanded to make predictions at a global scale. To this end, we apply our model to Australian flu epidemics, in addition to the United States. The results show consistent performance in a different region of the world with a more sparse population, different flu dynamics, weather, and seasons. While quite useful in the context of seasonal influenza, such a global system becomes especially relevant and essential in the context of emerging infectious diseases where mobility plays a stronger role in quantifying case introduction risk.Measures of flows of population at a fine granularity both in space and time have been limited due to lack of timeliness, availability, and accuracy of observational data. Here, we show that anonymous and aggregated mobility data improve the quality of models and can unlock interesting approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate this method is applicable at scale and is not limited to select jurisdictions and geographical areas that happen to collect necessary survey-based data at considerable expense and time delays. Our model captures global flows of populations and is not limited to within-state movements or other geographical boundaries.Methodologies based on aggregated samples of mobility do have their limitations. For instance, based on the way the trips are defined, it is difficult to distinguish between trips with varying dwell times. In the context of infectious diseases, the duration an individual spends at a location has a significant effect on the likelihood of passing on or contracting the infection. Further, due to anonymization, the datasets do not distinguish between individuals who reside in the patches, and those who are transients (e.g., tourists). The mobility data need to be appropriately aggregated to account for mobility patterns that have a significant impact on disease spread. Identifying the right aggregation mechanism for a given disease model is still an open challenge. We also want to note that, comparing four different mobility networks via epidemic modeling and prediction is not immune to effect confounding, since it is hard, if not impossible to distinguish the effect of different networks on the predictions from the effect of our choice of disease model and the calibration technique. Further, it is possible that a combination of aggregated mobility traces with sophisticated data-driven models might yield superior performance compared to either one in isolation. Recent collaborative efforts3 have revealed that ensemble approaches tend to perform better in forecasting, thus motivating further research on effectively combining these models. Finally, the availability of good quality ground truth is necessary to test different approaches in incorporating such datasets.The system being considered in the paper is not closed in reality, due to flows fromo neighboring states or due to international air travel. To look at the impact on neighboring states, we have modeled the NY–NJ states (HHS Region 2). Modeling disease dynamics for any region poses this “open world” problem. Finding correction terms, and to do so in a data-driven fashion using incoming flows and influenza indicators in external regions would be a broad open question worth pursuing.The Google Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset (referred here for brevity as anonymized mobility map, or simply mobility map) contains anonymized mobility flows aggregated over users who have turned on the Location History setting. Therefore, our mobility map shows only a sampled view into the actual population movements. However, our model makes the assumption that this is fairly representative of the aggregate inter-regional mobility patterns18,35,36,37. As recent third party surveys indicate38, Android has a fairly uniform coverage ~60% across gender, age, and other demographic factors. Further, we consider our work as a complement to alternative techniques, since any mobility model derived from real-world data (for instance commuter flows) will suffer from some form of bias (participation bias in census). Finally, noise is strategically added to the data to preserve privacy, as described in the “Methods”. The amount of noise is designed to protect individuals’ privacy while not significantly distorting the aggregate statistics. The mobility flows our system computes protect privacy and anonymity by leveraging differential privacy algorithms combined with data aggregation over large geographical areas and time intervals.Beyond the scope of our current work, we believe the mobility data and the framework can be extended to make predictions at finer spatial (e.g., zip code) and temporal (daily) resolutions. The scalable nature of AMM can help in areas that cannot invest as much in surveys and infrastructure as NYC. The global nature of the data source makes it an ideal candidate for potential pandemic preparedness studies and rapid risk estimation during an unfolding outbreak. With sophisticated agent-based models39 and on-device learning40,41, such techniques could also lead the way towards individual-level forecasting without involving the same privacy and anonymity constraints.MethodsAnonymized mobility map (AMM)The Google Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset contains anonymized mobility flows aggregated over users who have turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. This is similar to the data used to show how busy certain types of places are in Google Maps—helping identify when a local business tends to be the most crowded. The dataset aggregates flows of people from region to region.To produce this dataset, machine learning is applied to logs data to automatically segment it into semantic trips42. To provide strong privacy guarantees, all trips were anonymized and aggregated using a differentially private mechanism43 to aggregate flows over time (see ref. 44). This research is done on the resulting heavily aggregated and differentially private data. No individual user data were ever manually inspected, only heavily aggregated flows of large populations were handled.The automated Laplace mechanism adds random noise drawn from a zero mean Laplace distribution and yields (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy guarantee of ϵ = 0.66 and δ = 2.1 × 10−29 per metric. Specifically, for each week W and each location pair (A, B), we compute the number of unique users who took a trip from location A to location B during week W. To each of these metrics, we add Laplace noise from a zero mean distribution of scale 1/0.66. We then remove all metrics for which the noisy number of users is lower than 100, following the process described in ref. 43, and publish the rest. This yields that each metric we publish satisfies (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy with values defined above. The parameter ϵ controls the noise intensity in terms of its variance, while δ represents the deviation from pure ϵ-privacy. The closer they are to zero, the stronger the privacy guarantees. Each user contributes at most one increment to each partition. If they go from a region A to another region B multiple times in the same week, they only contribute once to the aggregation count. No individual user data was ever manually inspected, only heavily aggregated flows of large populations were handled.We aggregate flows within the US spatially at county level and temporarily at week level to obtain the mobility map. AMM contains normalized flows between pairs of counties in each week from 2016 week 40 to 2017 week 39, where weeks are indexed from week 00 to week 52 in a calendar year. \(\frac{{U_{t,ij}}}{C}\), where Ut,ij is the number of unique users making a trip from county i to county j in week t, and C is an undisclosed constant larger than the maximum flow over the entire year C > maxt,i,jUt,ij. This dataset covers most counties (3099) in the USA except those in Hawaii and DC. For the purpose of the paper, we used data pertaining to counties in New York and New Jersey, and at state level for Australia. In each study, flows connecting the regions of interest to the outside were not included.Mobility data preparationWe construct mobility networks (i.e., normalized flows between counties/states) based on various mobility datasets, including AMM, the Commute flow data obtained from the ACS, gravity, and radiation models of mobility. For any region, e.g., NYC, we generate a directed weighted network where a node represents a county and a directed edge represents a flow from a source county to a destination county. The edge’s weight is defined as the normalized flow (i.e., the outgoing flows of each node sum to 1) coming from the underlying mobility dataset. (1) AMM: the weight is the normalized Google mobility flows averaged across weeks from 2016 week 40 to 2017 week 39. (2) COMMUTE: the weight is the normalized commuter counts from source to destination obtained from ACS 2009–2013. In addition to the reported self-loop, we add the non-commuter population which is calculated by subtracting all commuter counts from population size of the source county. (3) GRAVITY: the weight is the normalization of gravity flows calculated as \(\frac{{P_iP_j}}{{(d_{ij} + 1)^2}}\) where Pi,Pj represent the population sizes (US Census, 2013 population estimates) of county i and j, and dij denotes the distance between i and j computed as the great-circle distance between the county centroids. (4) RADIATION: Using the definition in ref. 35, the flow for i ≠ j is obtained as \(T_i\frac{{P_iP_j}}{{(P_i + P_j + S_{ij})(P_i + S_{ij})}}\) where \(S_{ij} = {\sum }_{k:d_{ik} < d_{ij}} P_k\) is the population living in the circle centered around i with radius dij. Ti is the total commuter outflow from each patch, and is modeled as Ti = γPi, with (1 − γ)Pi set as the self-loop flow. For NYC and NJ experiments, based on US commuter data analysis in ref. 35, we set γ = 0.11. These flows are then normalized to be compatible with the simulation model. The mobility networks are constructed for both NYC (consisting of five counties) and a region of two states, New York plus New Jersey (consisting of 83 counties).We adopted a similar approach to obtain the AMM, COMMUTE, GRAVITY, and RADIATION flows for Australia. While in NYC we simulated at the level of boroughs (counties), for Australia, we chose to simulate at the spatial scale of states, based on surveillance data availability and also to showcase the generality of the AMM dataset. Interstate commuter flows were obtained from the Australian Labor Market Statistics based on the 2006 Census data. For the RADIATION model, based on median commuter outflow ratio to population sizes, γ was set to be 0.004.To compare the different networks, we used pairwise correlation and betweenness centrality of the nodes in the network. The correlation was computed as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the flattened flow matrices (i.e., vectors). It was used to show the similarity (or lack thereof) between two flow matrices. We used the definition of betweenness for a weighted network (fraction of pairwise weighted shortest paths passing through a node)45. The inverse of the normalized flow between a pair of nodes is used as the edge weight. Betweenness centrality is known to be one of the most effective heuristics in controlling epidemics on networks46. Although the relationship to a metapopulation model is not evident, betweenness is a useful measure to capture critical counties for the mobility flow. Additionally we calibrated the gravity model separately to the AMM and COMMUTE datasets of New York plus New Jersey, and tested the temporal matrices obtained from AMM for stationarity (see Supplementary Note 2).Case data preparationThe case data used in this work include: (1) NYC ILI ED visits provided by the NYC Department of Health. It contains daily ED visits for ILI per county within NYC for the past three seasons. The daily ED visits are aggregated to weekly data and scaled by the influenza virus isolation rates (aka percent positive, provided by WHO-NREVSS clinical labs) to obtain the ILI+ epidemic curves. We use the isolation rates corresponding to HHS Region 2, which includes NYC. (2) NJ Flu positive counts provided by the NJ Department of Health. It is a weekly cumulative total positive specimens per county for the past three seasons (week 40 of a particular year to the following year’s week 20). We calculate the weekly newly identified isolates by subtracting the cumulative count of previous week from that of the current week. (3) ILI% for NY state and HHS2 region provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is the total number of visits for ILI over total patient visits for the past three influenza seasons. (4) Laboratory confirmed influenza for Australia Influenza surveillance data was obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) maintained by the Australian Government Department of Health, and aggregated to weekly resolution for May–December 2016. The public dataset contains notification data collected on laboratory confirmed influenza via NNDSS at weekly resolution, for the states (excluding Australian Capital Territory), classified by type/subtype, age, sex, etc. We computed the total influenza positive counts per week and removed the baseline (the minimum count for each state in the year) to obtain the ground truth for the metapopulation model.Metapopulation modelPatchSim is a metapopulation SEIR model simulated using difference equations. From metapopulation modeling terminology, patches are habitable units (e.g., spatial regions) within which homogeneous mixing of individuals is assumed. For instance, in the NYC study, the individual boroughs (five of them) are the patches, whereas in the Australia study, the eight states (including Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory) are modeled as separate patches.Given a set of patches \({\cal{N}}\) to denote spatial regions (for example, counties in NYC or states in Australia), associated with each patch i, we have population Pi, and state tuple Zi(t) denoting the number of individuals in each of the disease states at time t. For a typical SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Recovered) model, the set of states is given by \({\cal{Z}} = \{ S,E,I,R\}\), with \({\sum }_{z \in {\cal{Z}}} z_i\left( t \right) = P_i\). Between a pair of patches i and j, we have the flow Fij, denoting the fraction of individuals belonging to home patch i spending their day in away patch j. In order to conserve patch populations (i.e., commuting model), we assume \({\sum }_{j \in {\cal{N}}} F_{ij} = 1\). The mobility is assumed to be homogeneous and memory-less, i.e., the commuting individuals according to Fij are assumed to be picked at random from the population Pi independent of their disease state, and independently for each day of the simulation. Due to the movement of individuals, the effective population of patches may differ from their home population Pi. This in turn also affects the state tuple Zi.PatchSim steps through the disease simulation in daily epochs. In order to compute the change in state tuple \(\Delta Z\left( t \right) = Z\left( {t + 1} \right) - Z(t)\), it incorporates (1) movement of individuals from their respective home patches to away patches according to Fij, (2) exposures, infections, and recoveries happening in the away patches, and (3) integration of state updates at the home patches. Let β represent the probability of exposure per day per SI contact, α the infection rate and γ recovery rate. α can be thought of as the reciprocal of mean incubation period, and γ the reciprocal of mean infectious period. Thus, given the disease parameters (β,α,γ) and a seeding profile X, PatchSim uses the population vector P and flow matrix F to produce the spatio-temporal evolution of disease states Z. The exact equations are provided in the Supplementary Methods section with the code, software documentation, and model description available at ref. 32.Bayesian calibrationModel calibration is the process of estimating the unknown parameters of the model with the help of observed data. In the context of our disease simulation PatchSim, we will be estimating the disease parameters and seeding profile by calibrating it against observed ground truth of influenza incidence. We adopt a Bayesian approach to calibrate the PatchSim model, where we begin with a prior distribution on the unknown parameters, which are then combined with the likelihood of observing the data to produce the posterior distribution on the parameter space.We begin by defining a statistical model for the observed data as a noisy version of model output, usually Gaussian, independent and identically distributed across the data points. The likelihood of observing the ground truth, given the model is run with parameter θ can then be written as a multivariate Gaussian across time points and patches. Given the prior distribution π(θ) and the data likelihood L(y|θ), the posterior distribution can be written by Bayes’ theorem.The analytic solution of the posterior distribution is often not feasible because of the complex simulation model, and hence Monte Carlo approaches to explore the posterior space are often used in such situations. Especially, in our context, we use importance sampling to generate realizations from the posterior distribution. Our choice of importance distribution is the prior π(θ) itself. This reduces the calculation of importance weights ω to just computing the data likelihood L at each sample from the prior. Thus a re-sample \({\hat {\!\theta}}\) from the original set of parameters θ with probabilities proportional to ω, with replacement, constitute a sample from the posterior distribution. The calibrated forecast can then be produced by running the PatchSim model at the parameter values \({\hat {\!\theta}}\), which are then used to compute several summary statistics on the forecast. More details on the calibration framework, and its adaptation for PatchSim and influenza forecasting is described in the Supplementary Methods.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Purvi Parwani, MD, a cardiologist at Loma Linda University International Heart Institute, discusses differences and correlations between flu and COVID-19 viruses, as well as how to avoid contracting the viruses. Being especially vulnerable to respiratory infections, people with CVD are more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications when infected with a virus, including the contagious respiratory illnesses — flu and COVID-19 — caused by different viruses, Parwani says. She says distinguishing between the severity of the complications derived from COVID-19 infection versus flu infection is key in gaining an accurate understanding of each virus and the precautionary measures needed to avoid them. Mortality rate is one of the most significant differences between COVID-19 and the flu, which is reportedly almost 15 times higher for COVID than the flu. The same study discloses that in anywhere from 15-70% of COVID-related deaths, people had underlying CVD. Parwani also says people with CVD who contracted COVID-19 require critical care far more frequently than cases of CVD patients contracting the flu. Another notable difference between the viruses: COVID-19 leaves long-term impacts on the heart far more frequently than the flu. Parwani says she has not seen patients first-hand who report lingering symptoms of pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and dizziness after flu infection. This stands in stark contrast with her experiences treating patients at the COVID Heart Clinic, she says, where patients of all walks of life report serious post-COVID symptoms like arrhythmia or blood clots in the lungs and legs. Though COVID-19 generally elicits more dangerous complications for cardiac patients than the flu, influeza infection also carries a set of real risks — especially during its prime time spanning from October to May. According to the CDC, heart disease has been one of the most frequent underlying chronic conditions in adults hospitalized with flu complication during recent flu seasons. A 2018 study found that the risk of heart attack was six times higher within a week of confirmed flu infection. The flu, though not nearly equal in the severity, to some extent behaves similarly to COVID-19 when it comes to proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects, reports the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. CVD patients who are infected with flu are more likely to experience fever, tachycardia and arrhythmias, while CVD patients infected with COVID are more likely to experience acute MI, myocardial injury, heart failure, disseminated thrombosis, hypotension, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Many of the safety measures to avoid the infections overlap, primarily: washing hands frequently, wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, avoiding gatherings (especially with recently sick people), and getting vaccinated. Parwani says patients with cardiovascular disease should get their vaccines for both flu and COVID-19 as soon as possible. For patients with cardiovascular disease, the benefits of receiving COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the much higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection — a statement upon which Parwani further expands in an article offering advice about COVID-19 vaccines for people with cardiovascular concerns. Flu shots have a long, established safety record in people with heart disease, and have even been associated with lower rates of some cardiac events among people with heart disease, according to the CDC. And yet, the Cardiovascular Research Foundation reports that only about half of people in the country with chronic heart failure received the flu vaccine in 2017. Given that people with CVD are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu, Parwani urges people not to neglect flu shots. Ongoing trials are even investigating whether flu vaccinations could potentially decrease the overall damaging impacts of other viral infections, such as COVID-19, on the body. As hopeful prospects form on the horizon for new generations of vaccines, technology, and medical advances, Parwani advises people with CVD to carry on with safety measures and remain informed of how different viral infections could impact them. Loma Linda University International Heart Institute care teams are committed to providing patients with compassionate, comprehensive, and personalized cardiovascular care.

To explore whether vaccine adjuvants can increase the immunologic response to vaccination in obesity, researchers at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital inoculated lean and obese mice against two different strains of flu using alum-adjuvanted, squalene-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines. They found that adjuvanted vaccinations resulted in increased seroconversion and the production of neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies in all mice. However, obese mice were not protected against flu when they were subjected to viral challenge. Reporting in mBio (online, 2 August 2016)[1] , the researchers conclude that the growing prevalence of obesity in the population means there is a critical need to understand why it results in impaired vaccine responses.References [1] Karlsson EA, Hertz T, Johnson C et al.

(WSFA) - Earlier this year, health experts feared hospitals would be overrun this winter trying to tackle both the flu and COVID-19, but so far that hasn’t been the case.According to this chart from the Alabama Department of Public Health, statewide influenza-like illness(ILI) is at 1.32% which is a slight increase compared to last week, but is still well below Alabama’s baseline of 3.29%. It is also a stark contrast to the over 8% of illness seen this same time the previous two flu seasons.Alabama's weekly influzena report. Week 4: January 24,2021 - January 30,2021.(Source: The Alabama Department of Public Health)Montgomery-area pulmonologist Dr. David Thrasher said in past years, city hospitals would be full of flu patients right now, but so far that hasn’t been the case.“The fact that our flu numbers are down 60% from this time last year is just phenomenal,” Dr. Thrasher said. “That’s a blessing because if we had the normal number of people that had the flu going to the hospital, many of them end up on ventilators and many of them die every year from the flu about 40,000 on average, our hospitals would be overwhelmed.”Health experts believe that high vaccination rates against the flu – combined with social distancing, mask-wearing and hand-washing employed to stop the spread of the coronavirus – played a huge role in preventing influenza transmission this season.“Clearly, the big deal is the masks. Probably if there was no vaccinations, wearing masks would cut the numbers way down, just that alone,” Thrasher said.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, flu numbers are down across the country. Between September and December of 2019, the CDC reported 65,000 cases of the flu, and during the same period this year only 1,016 cases were reported.This CDC flu activity map of the U.S shows that in January 2020, high or very high flu activity dominated the countries map.CDC flu activity map for January 2020.(Source: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention)But in January 2021, most states are reporting minimal activity.CDC flu activity map for January 2021.(Source: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention)This is all not to say that the flu has completely disappeared. ADPH reports that since October, the state has seen cases of Influenza A and B in four of it’s eight health districts, which can be seen on ADPH’s Influenza Surveillance Map. And so far, one death has been reported for the season.ADPH is using ILINet, short for the Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network, to look for flu-like illnesses that are reported by outpatient providers. Those include symptoms of fever and coughing with possible sore throat.It’s also using a process known as Syndromatic Surveillance, which gives ADPH the ability to look at COVID-19-like illness trends up against flu-like illness trends.Influenza season typically runs from October to May. Health experts say despite the low flu numbers this season, you should still take steps to protect yourself, including getting a flu shot.Copyright 2021 WSFA 12 News.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 10-Feb-2021 Definitely not the flu: risk of death from COVID-19 3.5 times higher than from flu Peer-Reviewed Publication Canadian Medical Association Journal image: Risk of death from COVID-19 3.5 times higher than flu view more Credit: CMAJ A new study published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) found that the risk of death from COVID-19 was 3.5 times higher than from influenza. "We can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza," says Dr. Amol Verma, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and the University of Toronto. "Patients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU, and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza." These findings are similar to study results recently reported in France and the United States. The study compared hospitalizations for influenza between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, in 7 large hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga -- areas with large populations and high levels of COVID-19. It included all patients admitted to medical services or the intensive care unit (ICU) for influenza or COVID-19. There were 783 hospitalizations for influenza in 763 unique patients compared with 1027 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in 972 unique patients (representing 23.5% of all hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Ontario during the study period). Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had few other illnesses, and 21% were younger than 50 years of age. People younger than 50 also accounted for almost 1 in 4 (24%) admissions to the ICU. "Many people believe that COVID-19 mainly affects older people," says Dr. Verma. "It is true that COVID-19 affects older adults most severely. We found that among adults over 75 years who were hospitalized with COVID-19, nearly 40% died in hospital. But it can also cause very serious illness in younger adults. Adults under 50 accounted for 20% of all COVID-19 hospitalizations in the first wave of the pandemic. Nearly 1 in 3 adults younger than 50 hospitalized with COVID-19 required intensive care, and nearly 1 in 10 required an unplanned readmission to hospital after discharge." People hospitalized for COVID-19 had greater use of the ICU, were more likely to be put on a ventilator and had longer hospital stays than people with influenza. "These differences may be magnified by low levels of immunity to the novel coronavirus compared with seasonal influenza, which results from past infections and vaccination," says Dr. Verma. "Hopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe." ### "Characteristics and outcomes of hospital admissions for COVID-19 and influenza in the Toronto area" is published February 10, 2021.

Back to Healio Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a mortality risk that was nearly 3.5 times higher than those hospitalized with influenza, according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. “We can now say definitively that COVID-19 is much more severe than seasonal influenza,” Amol A. Verma, MD, MPhil, BSc, a general internal medicine resident at St. Michael’s Hospital, Unity Health Toronto, and the University of Toronto, said in a press release. “Patients admitted to hospital in Ontario with COVID-19 had a 3.5 times greater risk of death, 1.5 times greater use of the ICU and 1.5 times longer hospital stays than patients admitted with influenza.” Reference: Verma A, et al, CMAJ. 2021;doi: 10.1503/cmaj.202795. Verma and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study using information from seven hospitals in Toronto and Ontario. They evaluated adults admitted to the ICU between November 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. A total of 783 admissions for influenza and 1,027 admissions for COVID-19 were included in the study. The researchers noted that these admissions made up 23.5% of all COVID-19 hospital admissions in Ontario during the study period. Patients aged younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all COVID-19 admissions and 24% of ICU admissions for COVID-19. The researchers determined that patients admitted with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality compared with those hospitalized with influenza (19.9% vs. 6.1%; adjusted RR [aRR] = 3.46; 95% CI, 2.56-4.68). They also found that patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater ICU use compared with those with influenza (26.4% vs. 18%; aRR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.25-1.80). Additionally, patients with COVID-19 had longer length of stay in the hospital, with a median of 8.7 days compared with 4.8 days among patients with influenza (aRR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25-1.69). According to the researchers, patients with COVID-19 were more likely than those with influenza to undergo invasive mechanical ventilation (18.5% vs. 9.3%; P = 0.001) but were less likely to undergo a bronchoscopy (2% vs. 5.6%; P = 0.005). The rate of readmission at 30 days was not significantly different between patients admitted with COVID-19 and those with influenza (aRR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.70-1.39). “These differences may be magnified by low levels of immunity to the novel coronavirus compared with seasonal influenza, which results from past infections and vaccination,” Verma said in the press release. “Hopefully, the severity of COVID-19 will decrease over time as people are vaccinated against the virus and more effective treatments are identified. There is, unfortunately, also the possibility that variants of the virus could be even more severe.” References: Press release Verma A, et al, CMAJ. 2021;doi: 10.1503/cmaj.202795.

Noam Galai/Getty ImagesFlu season has been mild this year, thanks to the mitigation measures used to contain COVID-19, such as physical distancing and mask wearing.School and office closures also contributed to the unusually inactive flu season. The mitigation measures curbed influenza activity even though COVID-19 surged.Last summer, infectious disease specialists warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could spiral into a “twindemic” when seasonal influenza hit. But that nightmare scenario never unfolded. The flu didn’t get a strong footing in the United States this season and a twindemic never struck. COVID-19 is likely far more contagious than the flu. Because the virus that causes seasonal influenza spreads via respiratory droplets, the safety precautions used to prevent COVID-19, such as mask wearing and physical distancing, also helped cut down flu activity. What drove down flu activity?Due to influenza’s short incubation period and widespread population immunity, the measures used to stop the spread of COVID-19 also caused flu activity to drastically drop.Between Oct. 1 and Jan. 30, only 155 people in the United States have been hospitalized with the flu. That’s a 98 percent decrease from the same window of time in the 2019-2020 flu season in which 8,633 people were hospitalized with the flu. The precautions used to prevent COVID-19 ended up drastically reducing influenza transmission. Both are respiratory infections that spread via aerosol droplets.“Any precaution you take to avoid COVID will also reduce your risk of contracting an influenza virus. Hand washing, social distancing, and wearing masks are certainly driving down cases of the flu,” said Dr. Casey Kelley, a family medicine physician and the founder and medical director of Case Integrative Health in Chicago.School and office closures led to a drop in transmission The closure of schools also contributed to this year’s low flu activity. According to Kelley, children have less immunity to the flu since their immune systems haven’t been exposed to many pathogens. Schools are also high-contact environments, making kids particularly susceptible to catching and transmitting the flu. Past evidence suggests kids are the number one source responsible for bringing the flu into households. Like schools, offices are flu hotspots. Flu germs can live on common surfaces — like doorknobs or the copy machine — for up to 24 hours. They also shoot through the air when a person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.“Public transit, office buildings and business travel are all high-contact events that are down significantly [this year],” Kelley said. Why COVID-19 is surging as the flu lies lowCOVID-19 is thought to be far more infectious than the flu especially as few people have immunity against this new disease. Researchers calculate the contagiousness of a disease by looking at the R number, which represents how many people, on average, a person with the disease will spread the virus to.The R number for COVID-19 is thought to be around 2 to 3, whereas the R number for influenza is around 1 or 2.“No one on Earth had antibodies to COVID-19 when the outbreak started, so every interaction was an opportunity for it to spread,” said Kelley, adding that we’ve had years to build up at least partial immunity to influenza.COVID-19 also has a longer incubation period that can last up to a couple of weeks. With the flu, people typically develop symptoms just a couple of days after being exposed to the virus.“Most people with the flu experience symptoms relatively early in their illness — usually within 2 days of exposure,” said Dr. John Showalter, an expert in communicable diseases and the chief product officer of Jvion in Suwanee, Georgia.Once flu symptoms begin, people usually isolate themselves, reducing the chance they’ll transmit the virus. “With COVID-19, individuals can actively spread the virus for up to 7 days before they experience symptoms,” Showalter said.In addition, COVID-19 often causes irregular symptoms, such as gut issues or headache. “This means many don’t even realize they have — or are spreading — the illness for a week or longer, and likely have not altered their interactions with others during that time,” Showalter said. Will we see the flu make a comeback next fall?When the pandemic restrictions are lifted, experts suspect the flu will make a comeback. “Flu is one of the most consistent and persistent illnesses in recorded medical history, with reports of influenza-like illness dating back to ancient Greece,” Showalter said. While we will likely see minimal flu activity in the 2021-2022 flu season due to continued safety precautions, Showalter said the flu “isn’t going anywhere.” Kelley is hopeful that the mitigation measures adopted to contain COVID-19 will last and help contain the flu in the future. “Building and maintaining a strong immune system, washing hands, self-isolating when you don’t feel well, and even wearing a mask during the peak flu season will all reduce the spread of flu, even after the pandemic is history,” Kelley said. The bottom line The flu season has been historically mild this year, thanks to the mitigation measures, such as physical distancing and mask wearing, used to contain the spread of COVID-19. School and office closures also contributed to the unusually inactive flu season. The mitigation measures used to control the spread of COVID-19, along with the widespread population immunity against the flu, helped curb influenza activity this year.However, while flu activity has been unusually low this season, COVID-19 has surged.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Julia Ries on February 11, 2021 — Fact checked by Michael CrescioneRead this nextWhat to Know About Having Influenza A When You’re PregnantInfluenza A is the most common variant of the flu and the one you’re most likely to get during pregnancy.

(Photo: A. & G. Zimmermann, Geneva) view more Credit: Archive of the History of Medicine, University of Zurich In the event of a pandemic, delayed reactions and a decentralized approach by the authorities at the start of a follow-up wave can lead to longer-lasting, more severe and more fatal consequences, researchers from the universities of Zurich and Toronto have found. The interdisciplinary team compared the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919 in the Canton of Bern with the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. The Spanish flu was the greatest demographic catastrophe in Switzerland's recent history, causing approximately 25,000 deaths in the country during 1918 and 1919. In the wake of the current coronavirus pandemic, there has been increased public and scientific interest in the events of that time. An interdisciplinary team of researchers in evolutionary medicine, history, geography and epidemiology from the universities of Zurich and Toronto has spent several years analyzing historical data on the spread of influenza-like illnesses during 1918 and 1919 in the Canton of Bern. The canton is ideally suited as a Swiss case study, because it is large and has a diverse landscape, it was hit particularly hard by the Spanish flu, and right at the start of the pandemic in July 1918 it introduced an obligation to report cases. Public health measures effective in the first wave The results of the new study show that the spread of Spanish flu differed depending on the region. In the first wave in July and August 1918, the Canton of Bern intervened relatively quickly, strongly and centrally, including by restricting gatherings and closing schools. "We see from the numbers that these measures - similar to today - were associated with a decrease in infection numbers," says co-first author Kaspar Staub of the Institute of Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich. After the first wave had subsided, the canton lifted all measures entirely in September 1918, which led to a rapid resurgence of cases and the onset of a second wave after only a short time. Delayed action at start of second wave was fatal At the beginning of the second wave in October 1918, the Canton of Bern reacted hesitantly, unlike in the first wave. Fearing renewed economic consequences, the cantonal authorities left responsibility for new measures up to the individual municipalities for several weeks. "This hesitant and decentralized approach was fatal and contributed to the fact that the second wave became all the stronger and lasted longer," says co-first author Peter Jueni of the University of Toronto. In addition, shortly after the peak of the second wave in November 2018, there was a national strike with demonstrations on social and labor issues and, most importantly, larger troop deployments. These mass gatherings, as well as a subsequent relaxation of the ban on gatherings when the number of cases was still far too high, were accompanied by a significant resurgence in infections. Ultimately, about 80 percent of the reported illnesses and deaths were attributable to the second wave. History repeats itself in 2020 By comparing the weekly case counts of the Spanish flu and coronavirus, the researchers found that the second wave started in almost the same calendar week in both 1918 and 2020, and the official delayed response was similar. "While there are still considerable differences between the two pandemics, the steadily increasing parallels between 1918 and 2020 are remarkable," Staub says. The study also shows that empirical knowledge from past pandemics - for example, on the challenges and how to deal with follow-up waves - is available. "Since November 2020, deaths from Covid-19 have far exceeded those caused by cancer or cardiovascular disease and for around three months it has been the most common cause of death in Switzerland. In view of the high death rate during the second wave in comparison with other countries, and with the threat of a third wave due to virus mutations from England, South Africa and Brazil, lessons from the past could help the authorities and the public to rethink their response," adds Jueni. Historical archive data with relevance for the present day The study was based on records in the Bern State Archives of cases of influenza-like illness by municipality and region, as reported weekly by doctors to the cantonal authorities. "These records are a real treasure trove and a great example of how data that is more than 100 years old can be relevant today," Staub says. Back in 2015, the research team began transcribing the more than 9,000 medical reports with over 120,000 influenza cases from 473 Bernese municipalities between June 1918 and June 1919. They then analyzed the data using modern epidemiological methods and reconstructed the measures taken at cantonal level to prevent the spread of the pandemic to create an overall picture. ### Journal Annals of Internal Medicine DOI 10.7326/M20-6231 Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

Doing so requires overcoming barriers of awareness, availability, and (sometimes) vaccine hesitancy. Here we focus on nudging people to vaccinate through online advertising. We conducted a pre-registered online ads campaign encouraging people to vaccinate against three diseases: influenza, human papillomavirus, and herpes zoster. Ads were shown to ~69,000 people and were compared to similar ads shown to 8.6 million people. Outcome measures were clicks on ads and future searches for relevant terms. We find that ads have two main effects: First, a congruence effect whereby ads increase the likelihood of clicks and future searches by up to 116% in people who express an interest in the disease or the vaccine. Most commercial vaccine advertising is aimed entirely at this population. Second, we observed a priming effect, where ads shown to people who were searching for terms unrelated to the vaccine could be encouraged to click on them (odds ratios of 7.5–33.0) and, more often, search for the vaccine later (hazard ratios of 6.9–157.3). We provide analysis for optimizing vaccine advertising campaign budgets to balance the two populations. These findings demonstrate that digital advertising campaigns should consider not just advertising to direct keywords or to individuals that look exactly like existing customers, but consider tangential keywords that draw a wider target population who are likely earlier in their conversion funnel, thus increasing the number of people who vaccinate and maximizing vaccines uptake.

Nevertheless, vaccination coverage is far from complete: In the USA, only 35% of relevant adults vaccinated against Herpes Zoster (shingles), 52% of females (21% of males) against human papillomavirus (HPV), and 45% of adults were vaccinated against influenza (flu)2.One way to increase vaccination coverage is by advertising these vaccines to increase awareness to them and to inform people of their necessity. Specifically, online advertising offers a highly efficient way to tune adverts to inferred user needs and demographics. For example, in search advertising ads are served based on query keywords which indicate intent3. For this reason, spending on search advertising (also known as sponsored ads) in 2019 in the U.S. was valued at US$36.5 billion4 and US$109.9 worldwide5.Ads have been used to steer people towards healthier behaviors, including smoking cessation6, weight loss7, and reduction in harm from eating disorders8. Directly measuring the effect of an online advertising campaign is difficult (e.g.,9). Thus, more often a proxy for the intended outcome is used. Web searches have been shown to be a powerful predictor of a wide variety of future behaviors. This includes a number of health-related behaviors and metrics, such as prescription drug utilization10, usage of electronic cigarettes11, mask-wearing12, as well as rates of both infectious13,14 and non-infectious diseases15,16. However, the utility of search as a predictive tool extends far beyond health behaviors. Web search data has also been used to predict home and auto purchasing behavior17, airline travel18, unemployment19, voter registration20, and suicide21. Given this plethora of predictions, it is reasonable to infer that searches for vaccines should be considered meaningfully related to actual vaccination behavior, in addition to raising awareness to (in our case) a vaccine. The only stronger proxy we are aware of, for vaccine advertising, is the work by Mohanty et al.22, which used the appearance of a person’s phone within a vaccination clinic as an indication that the person vaccinated.Research into online advertising campaigns promoting vaccines focused on messaging which stressed the benefits of immunization or on providing information on opportunities for vaccination (see, for example22,23). Little attention has been given to the ways in which users can be reached and on ways to identify user intent. As we show below, most commercial vaccine advertising is aimed at people already expressing awareness of the vaccine, if not outright intention to vaccinate. We hypothesize that the reason for this focus is to nudge people to use specific vaccine types or vaccine providers. In marketing terms, these people are already in the conversation funnel, on their way to buying a vaccine, just debating over which one and where24.This paper thus speaks to a robust literature on where search ads are in the conversion funnel, especially in relation to their brand specificity. The bottom of the funnel normally has very specific, more rare keywords, as people search for specific products they are going to buy, making them ripe to click on ads versus organic (non-paid) links24. This also speaks to the research on category searches25 which tend to diminish when the brands are well known. With vaccines the brands are not known (with exception of locations for flu shots, but those searches are relatively rare), so the searches are almost always categorical. Thus, in some ways, the vaccines may feel more like indirect sales, than direct sales, benefiting from varied, less direct keywords26.We focus on an extreme example of indirect sales, people at the very top of the funnel who are unaware of a relevant vaccine (or even the disease): this is especially important for a stakeholder that may not care about which vaccine they receive or where, but simply that they obtain it. This is complicated by the fact that a large percentage of the relevant population for vaccination is unaware of the need to vaccinate with many unaware of the medical condition itself.Therefore, we ask, is it possible to drive people who are unaware of a vaccine towards inoculation, and if so, what should the balance between advertising to people who are unaware, compared to those who are aware but have not yet vaccinated, be so as to maximally raise the number of vaccinated people?ResultsCampaign statisticsWe ran advertising campaigns for vaccinations against three diseases: influenza, HPV, and herpes zoster.Figure 1 exemplifies an advertising campaign and its execution. As described in the Methods, once campaign keywords are selected (a) the ads are shown to users who query using these keywords. Such campaign showings are called impressions (b). The impressions are divided between those where the campaign ads are shown (d) and where the ads of other advertisers are displayed. Each ad can be clicked by a user (f).Fig. 1: Flowchart of the advertising campaign.Letters refer to the numbers shown in Table 1.Full size imageTable 1 shows the statistics of the three campaigns, including the dates of the campaigns, the number of distinct ad texts we created and the number of search terms used to trigger ads, number of times that the ads were shown and clicked, and the number of times that other ads were shown in response to the same queries as those for which the campaign ads were shown, denoted by “all ads”. The statistics in Table 1 refer to the steps in Fig. 1.Table 1 Statistics of the advertising campaign and of concurrently running vaccine-related ads from other advertisers.Full size tableAmong all vaccine-related ads, 98.1% of influenza ads were shown in response to vaccine- or disease-related keywords. Over 99.99% of HPV and Herpes Zoster ads were shown in response to such keywords.Crowdsourcing coding of terms for their relatedness to the disease or vaccine produces very clear results for many terms being unrelated. On a scale of 1 (for “Definitely NOT searching for [vaccine]”) to 5 (for “Definitely searching for [vaccine]”), 40 of 68 Flu, 14 of 27 HPV, and 19 of 26 Herpes Zoster had means of 1 (i.e., every coder gave them a 1). On the top end there is less precision as coders gave terms for the actual vaccines means between 2.5 and 5.0 with an average of 4.2, and terms for the underlying illnesses between 1.7 and 4.2 with an average of 3.2. Sample terms and their scores are shown in Supplementary Data 1.Priming effectWe calculated the term similarity, CTR and the percentage of future searches for the keywords of each campaign. Table 2 shows the correlation between term similarities and the two latter variables. CTR is uncorrelated with term similarity. However, term similarity is strongly correlated with the percentage of future searches. Note that the distribution of term similarities is not uniform (see Supplementary Data 1), which may lead to an underestimation of the actual associations.Table 2 Correlation of term similarity with CTR and with the percentage of future searches for the vaccine.Full size tableUsing a Cox proportional hazard model, we evaluated the likelihood that a searcher who queried for one of the target terms (e.g., the condition searches) would later search for vaccines. Searches for terms which were not in the list of condition searches were marked as non-condition searches. The dependent variable is the time to future search from the original ad impression. Impressions that were not followed by a vaccine search from the same user were counted as censored. Table 3 shows the results of this model. We find that in all three cases, treated searchers were more likely to search for vaccines in the future than untreated searchers, and, most important: treated non-condition searchers were much more likely to search than untreated non-condition searchers.Table 3 Hazard ratio of a Cox hazard model of post-ad vaccine searches. Numbers shown are hazard ratios.Full size tableNot only was the effect of treatment on post-ad vaccine searches greater, this effect extended to post-ad vaccine clicks. Table 4 shows the results of a logistic regression model for post-ad vaccine clicks. Searchers were coded as a 1 if they did a post-ad vaccine search and clicked an ad or organic (unpaid search) link in the search results, and 0 if they either did not do a post-ad vaccine search or did not click on any of the results. Table 4 presents the results of this model, which show that our ads generated a significant increase in post-ad clicks on vaccine-related links.Table 4 Logistic regression model of future vaccine clicks.Full size tableFigure 2 shows the cumulative hazard curves for post-advertisement vaccine searches, with the horizontal axis representing hours elapsed since since the search for a relevant term, stratified by whether the user queried for the disease or vaccine or not, and whether the user saw our campaign ads. As the figures show, treatment always increases the likelihood of future vaccine searches, especially in the near future (see also ref. 27). Curves for the control population which queried for the vaccine are significantly higher than for those who didn’t search for the vaccine. However, treatment of the latter population increases their likelihood of future vaccine searches to almost the same level as that of the control population which did search for the vaccine, clearly demonstrating increased awareness in this population.Fig. 2: Cumulative hazard curves for post-ad vaccine searches.The randomized column displays results of the ad experiment, with users who saw our ads counted as “treated”. Vaccine Ad column displays results of robustness check, with user who saw any vaccine ad counted as “treated”.Full size imageNote that, in the case of non-condition original query, we see a large difference at time zero between the treated and control units. This is because for the non-condition searches, people are making a search unrelated to the vaccine or disease, and in the control, they are also not shown a vaccine ad. As such, if any of these people do eventually search for vaccines, it is likely to be long after their original search. On the other hand, a significant proportion of the non-condition users who were in the treatment group and received a vaccine ad on their search term did indeed search for vaccines shortly after seeing the ad, providing evidence of a priming effect of the vaccine ad on vaccine searches.Congruence effect of adsWe refer to the congruence effect to describe the change in the likelihood of clicks and future searches caused by the display of relevant ads to people who express an interest in the disease or the vaccine. We evaluated this effect by modeling the likelihood that links to ads or, separately, organic (unpaid search) links will be clicked, as a function of their parameters as well as those of the remaining page, taking into account whether additional ads and/or organic links pointed to the same website as that of the considered link (ad or organic).Specifically, the model parameters account for the placement of the page or ad, as calculated by the rank of the ad or organic link in the page, where rank 1 means that they are placed highest. Model parameters of the page include the total number of ads and organic links on the page and the probability of the query among all queries. Model parameters of congruence include the fraction of ads or links on the search page which refer to the same website as that of the examined link.The attributes we evaluated were: The number of ads displayed on the page The number of organic links displayed on the page The rank of the ad or the organic link Query popularity: Logarithm of the number of times this query text appears in our data Fraction of additional ads pointing to the same website Fraction of additional organic links pointing to the same website Table 5 shows logistic regression models for the likelihood of clicks, separately for ads and for organic links. As the table shows, pages and ads which are higher in the page (lower rank) receive more clicks (as also shown in ref. 28). Additional ads are correlated with more clicks on ads but fewer organics, whereas fewer organic links are correlated with a higher likelihood of clicks on both ads and organic links.Table 5 Logistic regression model of clicks on ads and organic links for vaccination queries.Full size tableInterestingly, more ads pointing to the same website have a mixed effect on clicks, in some cases (Herpes Zoster) associated with more clicks on ads and in some fewer (HPV), whereas their appearance is correlated with an increasing likelihood of clicks on organic links. Additional organic links from the same website are associated with more clicks on ads in the case of HPV, and less on the organic links in the case of influenza and HPV, but not Herpes Zoster. Thus, it would appear that for vaccine-related queries, it is useful to place ads to websites which appear in the organic links, as the latter drive even more people to click on the ads.Optimizing the distribution of campaign fundingIn the section “Priming effect” we demonstrated the priming effect of advertising on terms perceived as less-relevant to vaccines, eliciting future searches for the vaccine. However, our results in the section “Congruence effect of ads” showed that placing an advertisement when a link to the advertiser exists in the organic link dramatically increases the likelihood of a click on the ads.Some people who already know about the vaccine or even plan to vaccinate, that is, people already deep into the conversation funnel, will be more likely to actually do so if their searches are enhanced through ads placed as a response to their searches on these topics. But, our results suggest that if the goal is to recruit more people to vaccinate, advertisers could prime people through advertising to the less-relevant terms, hitting people in the target population but unaware of the vaccine, not even in the conversion funnel.To find the division of advertising budgets between searches for the vaccine and less-relevant searches so as to maximize the number of people who vaccinate we consider these two factors as follows: First, the increase in click probability due to priming and second, the increase in click probability due to ads placed for vaccine searches. Specifically, let \({P}_{c}^{v}\) be the probability of click on an ad or organic search result related to vaccination when the user queried for the vaccine, given that a vaccine ad was shown. Similarly, \({P}_{c}^{nv}\) denotes the same, given that the vaccine ad was not shown. For the priming effect, let \({P}_{p}^{v}\) be the probability of click on our ad or a future search for a vaccine, where the search term was not vaccine-related and our ad was shown. \({P}_{p}^{nv}\) denotes the same, but when our ad was not shown.Increased click probability for vaccine searches is calculated as \({E}_{C}={P}_{c}^{v}-{P}_{c}^{nv}\) and the priming effect, EP, is equal to \({P}_{p}^{v}-{P}_{p}^{nv}\).The probabilities are shown in Table 6. Note that for influenza, showing the vaccine ads seems to reduce the likelihood of clicks on the ads, but this is likely due to the fact that many people search for the condition without explicitly mentioning the vaccine.Table 6 Change in click probability and future search probability.Full size tableOur goal is to maximize EC ⋅ α + EP ⋅ (1 − α), where α is the fraction of campaign spending on vaccine searches (α ∈ [0, 1]), which is complicated due to the varying prices for any set of keywords. If all keywords were the same price, and EC > EP, the maximum of this function is reached when relevant ads are shown for all searches for the vaccine, and the remaining budget is given to priming searches. Conversely, when EC < EP, the function is maximized by showing relevant ads to all priming searches, and the remaining budget spent on vaccine searches. But, in reality prices do differ and for priming to be the more cost-effective option, the price of the cheapest set of priming keywords (where there is an expansive set of possible keywords with diverse pricing) just needs to have a higher expected return per dollar than the cheapest set of keywords for illness or vaccine-related options (which is much more limited in the scope of options). And, keywords later in a conversation funnel, branded keywords in particular, are more generally expensive29.DiscussionNudging people towards vaccination is an important public health goal which has received significant attention over the years. Here we focused on methods for finding people to whom vaccine ads should be shown, identifying two main effects of such ads. First, we demonstrated a priming effect, whereby people who might not have otherwise considered vaccination could be nudged towards searching for information on the vaccine by showing vaccination-promoting ads to seemingly irrelevant terms, albeit ones used by the target population. Second, we found a congruence effect, whereby people who had shown an interest in the disease or the vaccine against it were more likely to click on relevant ads or increase the number of future searches following an ad displayed to them. We also found that the vast majority of ads promoting vaccines were targeted at this population.Finally, we found that there is a complex interplay between organic (unpaid) links and ads. More ads pointing to the same website are correlated with an increasing likelihood of clicks on organic links. Additional organic links from the same website are associated with more clicks on ads in the case of HPV, and less on the organic links in the case of influenza and HPV, but not Herpes Zoster. Similar mixed effects were found in previous work30,31,32, but ours is the first to show that even among different vaccines this effect exists. Thus, advertisers should be careful to take this effect into consideration when designing campaigns.Our work has several limitations: First, as noted in the Methods, here we chose to focus on two measures of outcome: clicks on relevant ads and future searches for the diseases or the vaccines against them. Though actual vaccination rates would have been a superior outcome, these are difficult (if not impossible) to obtain in our anonymous cohort. However, as shown in Supplementary Data 3, there is a good correlation between vaccination rates and the percentage of people searching for vaccines, when measured at the state level.Second, our campaigns were run to all users who queried with a relevant keyword. In many cases, it may be possible to focus an advertising campaign by showing it to only the relevant demographics. However, in this paper, we did not test this option as it is unclear to which extent such demographic targeting is accurate and whether it would skew our results.Third, when asked to quantify term similarity, most people gave scores that were either high (4 and higher) or very low (1–1.5). This was likely due to the difficulty that people have in assigning the middle values to the similarity ranges. Thus, the reported correlations could be skewed because of this difficulty.Another limitation of our work is that we did not examine the specific attributes of the ads themselves. As noted in the Methods, the ads were chosen from popular ads shown on Microsoft Advertising. However, past work (e.g.,33,34), attributes of ads, including for example, whether they contain informational content, appeal to emotion, and include a call to action, all affect how people respond to ads. Another aspect which was not examined in this work was the effect of images which can be included in some forms of advertising, and are known to be useful for eliciting action35. These aspects are left for future work.Research has found that people do not receive recommended vaccinations for a variety of reasons. Mulet Pons et al.36 found that people did vaccinate because they didn’t think they needed the vaccine, were unaware of it, were worried by adverse reactions or had just forgotten. Similar results were found by Bricout et al.37 for the case of the herpes zoster vaccine. More recently, vaccine hesitancy38 was shown to be an important factor. As we show in Supplementary Data 2, a significant percentage of the population are unaware of either the diseases or the vaccines that we studied, even in the target populations. This is in agreement with prior work39,40, which found a similar lack of knowledge on these issues. However, our experiments only attempt to alleviate people being unaware of the vaccine (see also Supplementary Data 2). Future research will endeavor to address the other factors cited above through appropriate wording of the ads.Taken together, our finding have clear implications for the way in which the importance of vaccinations is communicated: If the goal of a campaign is to generate revenue for a particular vaccine manufacturer or provider, it may make sense to focus on the congruence effect, maximize spending on searches near the end of the conversion funnel, that is, on those already searching for the illness or vaccine itself. But, if the goal of a campaign is maximize the number of people in society who receive the vaccine, regardless of type or provider, there is a potentially higher return in focusing on the congruence effect for people in a target population for the vaccine who were searching for something unrelated to the vaccine, but are not already in the conversation funnel. However, as we show (“Optimizing the distribution of campaign funding”), care must be taken to balance the advertising budget across the different parts of the conversion funnel: While there are more people in earlier stages of the funnel, they are also less likely to change their behavior41.This result has implications for digital campaign targeting (especially if future research will show direct measures of vaccine uptake): Digital advertising campaigns should consider not just pushing direct keywords or derive sets of individuals that look exactly like existing customers, but consider tangential keywords that draw in the wider target population who are likely earlier in their conversion funnel, or maybe not even in it. Moreover, we posit that part of the reason for advertiser’s focus on the population which already expressed an intention to vaccinate is that the most common measure for campaign success is click-through rate, which is naturally higher in this population. Therefore, those platforms that run digital advertisements should consider the return on investment measures like the one we note here on expected lift per dollar which is easy enough to automate even for smaller campaigns.MethodsIn this work, we advertised vaccines against three diseases: Influenza, HPV, and Herpes Zoster. All three vaccines are regularly advertised by pharmaceuticals and health authorities in the USA. The budget for all campaigns was set at a maximum of US$15 per day. Ads were shown to users in the USA.Advertising campaign developmentSearch advertising campaigns comprise of three main elements: Keywords (which searches direct someone to an ad), ad text (words of the ad itself), and landing page (where the ad sends someone that clicks on it).Ads were shown in response to user queries on Bing which included a campaign keyword, if the bid engine of Microsoft Advertising decided to show said ads. The ads comprise of a short (one sentence) title and a 1–3 sentence body. The ad also includes a link to a website landing page which is displayed to users who click on the advertisement. Ads are shown in one of two locations on the search results page: Top or bottom. They are marked as ads to indicate to users that these are paid search results. We note that search pages also display unpaid links to websites. These are known as organic links.Each display of an advertisement to a user is referred to as an impression. Advertisers pay whenever an ad is clicked. A common measure of ad performance is the percentage of ads that are clicked by users, also known as the Clickthrough Rate (CTR).Treatment users in this study were people who queried using the campaign ad keywords and were shown the campaign advertisements. Control users in this study were people who queried using the campaign ad keywords but were not shown the campaign advertisements. Control users saw either no ads or ads from other advertisers, as served by the advertising system. The bids were set by the advertisement system to be the smallest values that would still make the ads appear on the first page of the search results, making the assignment to the treatment and control semi-random. As no demographic information is available on the populations, we cannot verify that the randomization was completely effective.Below we provide details on how each element of the campaigns was selected for each of the vaccines.Keywords for the influenza vaccine comprised of three types: Flu vaccine keywords, including mentions of the flu vaccine or the just the flu, and seasonal keywords. All three campaigns have a similar pattern of vaccine and illness-related terms, targeting people who are inside the conversation funnel, and some set of tangentially related terms (which differ slightly in structure to match the illness), targeting people who are in the target population, but may be outside the conversion funnel. In this case the latter was found by selecting searches with the following keywords that had at least 1000 daily searches in October/November 2018 and had similar levels of search across both 2017 and 2018: “weather”, “fall”, “autumn”, “pumpkin”, “halloween”, “thanksgiving”, “turkey”, “gravy”, “daylight saving”.The text of the ads was developed by the authors, after examining other influenza vaccine ads shown on Microsoft Advertising. All ads led to the HealthMap Vaccine Finder website https://vaccinefinder.org/.Keywords for the HPV vaccine were derived from the following classes of terms: Vaccine-related: Commercial names of the HPV vaccine or the term “hpv vaccine” Disease-related: HPV, “human papilloma virus” Keywords of other HPV vaccine ads: Other keywords used by advertisers of the HPV vaccine on Microsoft Advertising, e.g., “cervical cancer vaccine” and “signs of cervical cancer” High-school related: Keywords related to college applications (e.g., “common app”, “gpa”, “scholarship”), standardized testing (“sat”,“ap”), parent-school district connection software (“parent portal”, “infinite campus”) Parent queries: We identified people who were likely parents by finding those people who queried on Bing between 1 October 2018 and 31 March 2019, and mentioned the terms “my teen”, “teenage son”, or “teenage daughter”. We then scored queries during that time range as the fraction of users who made each query and were in the parent population. The top 50 queries were included as keywords. Weather- and news-related terms, as in the influenza vaccine adverts. Advertisements comprised of the text of the most popular HPV vaccine ads shown on Microsoft Advertising on September 2018. The landing page for the ads was the Center for Disease Control (CDC) page on the HPV vaccine, https://www.cdc.gov/HPV/parents/vaccine.html.Keywords for the Herpes Zoster vaccine were derived from the following classes of terms: Vaccine-related: Commercial names of the Herpes Zoster vaccine or the term “zoster vaccine”. Disease-related: “shingles”, “herpes zoster”. Older people’s queries: We found the 50 queries made by the highest percentage of people aged 50 or older during October 2019. Age was provided by users at the time of registration to Bing. Weather- and news-related terms, as in the influenza vaccine adverts. Advertisements comprised of the text of the most popular Herpes Zoster vaccine ads shown on Microsoft Advertising on September 2018. The landing page for the ads was the CDC page on the Herpes Zoster vaccine, https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html.Assessing campaign effectivenessAs noted in the Introduction, directly measuring vaccination rates as a result of advertising is difficult. Therefore, here we use two other proxies for behavior change: Clicks on the ads (as measured by the CTR) and future searches by the same user on a search engine. The latter measure was the percentage of users who queried for the vaccine on Bing, either by name or by general terms, e.g., “flu vaccine”, following the display of a relevant ad. The latter is a common proxy for medically related behavior change6,7,8. As shown in Supplementary Data 3, at a state-level, this latter measure is a reasonable proxy for vaccination rates.Searches of users in this experiment were anonymized before the investigators had access to them. Each search comprised of the time and date of the search, an anonymous user identifier, and the query text. We define condition searches as those searches that contained keywords related to either the vaccine or the disease. Data were extracted for the duration of the advertising campaigns.Classification of search term similarityWe used Amazon Mechanical Turk to code the search terms on a 5-point Likert scale to classify if the intent of the search was aimed towards a vaccine or not. The scale ran from “Definitely NOT searching for [vaccine]” to “Definitely searching for [vaccine]”. For background we provided the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article on the vaccine and encourage the workers to search if they need more information. For each vaccine we coded the term with over 100 ad impressions or (in the case of HPV) the top 25 terms by impression. We asked six workers to classify each term and took the average score given by them.Trial registration and IRB approvalThis study was approved by the Microsoft Institutional Review Board. Informed consent could not be received from the anonymous participants. This trial was registered on AsPredicted registration number 34050.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

YonhapBy Bahk Eun-jiWhile the government has been bolstering measures to prevent the spread of avian influenza, animal welfare organizations and veterinarians are criticizing the measures ― culling poultry regardless of whether or not they have been infected.They say culling is nothing more than animal slaughter, and vaccines for the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu should be introduced as a preventive measure. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the number of chickens and ducks culled here, since last Nov. 26 when the first H5N8 case broke out, topped 25.3 million as of Feb. 3. There were 75 cases of infections nationwide.In Gyeonggi Province alone, more than 6.8 million chicken and ducks in 83 poultry and egg farms were culled during the same period. Of these, 4.24 million at 65 farms, or 61 percent, were culled as a preventive measure although they were not infected with the virus. The government has been culling all poultry within a three-kilometer radius of infected farms since 2018. However, animal welfare organizations and veterinary associations are questioning whether the government's policy is the only viable solution.Members of 45 organizations, including the Korea Association for Animal Protection (KAAP), held a press conference in Gwanghwamun in Seoul last month, saying more than 100 million poultry have been buried underground since the very first outbreak of avian influenza here in 2003."Based on scientific and elaborate analysis, culling should be carried out mainly on the farms infected with the virus. As a fundamental measure to solve the problem, a vaccine for H5N8 should be introduced, just like vaccines turned out to be the fundamental solution to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," said Lee Won-bok, head of the KAAP."Although the country can minimize culling by using vaccines, the government sticks to culling and it seems to only be because of administrative convenience."Lee Sung-sik, head of the Gyeonggi Veterinary Medical Association, also said even though there is a simple test kit that can detect the virus within three hours, the government adheres to culling the animals without convincing reasons."It seems the authorities are hesitant out of fear of losing the country's status as a bird flu clean zone if they use vaccines for avian influenza, but now we have to begin vaccination as the virus breaks out every year," he said. According to him, losing its status as a "bird flu clean zone" could result in restrictions on the export of domestic poultry and related products, and increase the possibility of allowing imports of poultry products from China, which have been banned as the country is not designated as a clean zone.In August 2008, Korea declared itself a bird flu clean zone in accordance with guidelines set by the World Health Organization.He also noted the biggest reason for the government's hesitation to implement a vaccination program is fear of a virus mutation that could be deadly to humans.Culled chickens are buried near a poultry farm in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, Jan. 21, after an outbreak of avian influenza was confirmed there. YonhapVirus variants can develop when vaccines are used; the H5N8 strain of avian influenza does not pose a great threat to human health, but there is a chance for a variant to develop that is lethal to humans, he explained."The virus is powerful enough to infect a million birds with just 1 gram," an official of the agriculture ministry said, adding no one can predict what mutations could occur or how these mutations might affect humans. "Despite the large number of culled birds, it should be understood as a measure to prevent greater damage," he added.Some other experts argued that the government's position is understandable given that some types of avian influenza can infect both animals and humans, but claimed the government still needs to consider other options."We should not blindly block the introduction of a vaccine, but examine the possibility of a variant in a scientific and rational manner," said Song Chang-sun, a professor of veterinary medicine at Konkuk University. ejb@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in National 12 umbrella unions stage large-scale rallies in Seoul 2Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 3Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 4Yoon grapples with growing unpopularity at halfway mark 5Fire erupts at POSCO Pohang plant; 1 worker injured Top 10 Stories 1Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 2SK chief wins chance to challenge $986 mil. divorce settlement 3Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 4Korean essay on 'ramyeon' to be published in UK 5Lotte, Shinsegae in limelight after Trump win 6Nobel laureate Han Kang to hear Korean introduction at award ceremony in Stockholm 7Putin finalizes N.

Further testsThe latest outbreak follows confirmation of cases of the H5N8 strain in a flock of free-range chickens on a poultry farm in Sanday, Orkney, in December.A total of 39 birds in that flock died and the remaining 11 were put down.Bird flu concern as charity warns of more cases in ScotlandChickens culled after bird flu confirmed in OrkneyAll captive birds in Britain to be kept indoors amid outbreakScotland's chief veterinary officer Sheila Voas said: "This highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (H5N1) has been confirmed on a farm of approximately 14,000 mixed game birds with high mortality in the last few days."All remaining birds are being humanely culled for disease control purposes."It is vital that keepers take steps to improve their biosecurity and protect their birds from disease. Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flock should seek veterinary advice immediately."Your private vet, or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office, will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection."Image source, PAImage caption, Free-range chickens were found to have Avian flu at a farm in OrkneyFood standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers and do not affect the consumption of poultry products, including eggs.Producers and bird keepers are reminded to comply with the order to house birds that came into effect on 14 December or ensure they are kept separate from wild birds and follow biosecurity procedures.Rural Affairs Minister Ben Macpherson said "Following this confirmation, I have put in place controls required under domestic and EU legislation that will help control any further spread of the disease in the surrounding area."We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds.
