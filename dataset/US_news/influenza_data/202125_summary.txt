- Influenza is an infectious disease that leads to severe illness and respiratory deaths worldwide each year.
- Early detection and prediction of influenza outbreaks are crucial for efficient resource planning and saving lives and healthcare costs.
- A data-driven methodology for influenza outbreak detection and prediction at local levels has been proposed.
- The methodology utilizes a doctor's diagnostic dataset of influenza-like illness from over 3000 clinics in Malaysia.
- A new region index (RI) is proposed to measure the severity of influenza outbreaks based on the diagnostic dataset.
- Anomalies in the weekly RI value are analyzed to identify potential outbreaks using statistical methods.
- An ensemble learning method is developed to predict potential influenza outbreaks.
- The methodology has shown to be sensitive and accurate in predicting outbreaks, with average recall, precision, and accuracy scores of 75%, 74%, and 83%, respectively.
- The results are validated using data from Google Flu Trends, news reports, and surveillance data from the World Health Organization.
- Early detection of influenza outbreaks is crucial for efficient resource planning, saving costs, saving lives, and controlling the spread of the virus.
