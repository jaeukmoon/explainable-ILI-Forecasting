In this randomized trial (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03722589), sera pre- and post-vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated egg-based (IIV4), cell culture-based (ccIIV4), and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines were collected from healthcare personnel (18-64 years) in 2018−19 (N = 723) and 2019−20 (N = 684) influenza seasons. We performed an exploratory analysis. Vaccine egg-adapted changes had the most impact on A(H3N2) immunogenicity. In year 1, RIV4 induced higher neutralizing and total HA head binding antibodies to cell- A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4. In year 2, among the 7 repeat vaccination arms (IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4), repeat vaccination with either RIV4 or ccIIV4 further improved antibody responses to circulating viruses with decreased neutralizing antibody egg/cell ratio. RIV4 also had higher post-vaccination A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in year 1, but there was no significant difference in HA stalk antibody fold rise among vaccine groups in either year 1 or year 2. Multiple seasons of non-egg-based vaccination may be needed to redirect antibody responses from immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and re-focus the immune responses towards epitopes on the circulating viruses to improve vaccine effectiveness.

Conventionally, influenza vaccine seed viruses are propagated in embryonated chicken eggs to produce inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). However, this manufacturing process can lead to egg-adapted mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in IIV, that could result in altered antigenicity and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the circulating influenza strains1,2,3,4,5,6. Therefore, vaccine manufacturing platforms that do not rely on eggs have been established in the past decade including a cell culture-based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quadrivalent™ by Seqirus, Inc., ccIIV4) and a recombinant influenza vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent® by Sanofi Pasteur, RIV4). RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). Both ccIIV4 and RIV4 are currently licensed in the US7. Clinical trials evaluating ccIIV and RIV have shown comparable to advantageous immunogenicity compared to standard-dose egg-based IIVs in different age groups8,9,10,11,12,13. Observational studies and clinical trials reported that ccIIV and RIV demonstrated modest to significant improvement of VE over egg-based IIV in different age groups and influenza seasons7,14,15,16.Repeat annual influenza vaccination is another factor that may affect the antibody responses elicited by influenza vaccines. Studies indicated that frequent prior vaccination could blunt the antibody responses to influenza vaccination over time11,13,17,18,19,20,21 which can lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness22,23,24,25,26. One study reported that repeat vaccination reduced antibody affinity maturation to the HA antigens of all vaccine components from egg-based, cell-culture based, and recombinant influenza vaccines20. Thus far, there are few direct comparisons of immunogenicity of the three vaccine platforms in populations with a history of frequent influenza vaccinations. We recently reported the comparison of immunogenicity of ccIIV and RIV to egg-based standard dose IIVs among US healthcare personnel (HCP) aged 18−64 years from a randomized, open-label trial during the 2018−2019 season27 and the 2019−2020 season following repeat vaccination in 2 consecutive years28,29. Those comparisons were focused on the neutralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses only. RIV4 elicited higher neutralizing antibody responses than IIV4 against cell-propagated vaccine viruses27. Repeat vaccination with ccIIV4 or RIV4 in 2 seasons also resulted in significantly higher post-vaccination antibody responses to cell-propagated vaccine viruses29. Most HCP participants had received egg-based influenza vaccines frequently during the preceding five seasons.We previously reported that antibodies targeting the egg-adapted epitopes could be preferentially boosted from repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines3. The potential of non-egg-based vaccines to mitigate the impact of prior egg-based vaccination remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed neutralizing antibody responses to both egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and total binding antibodies to both HA head and HA stalk among HCP following vaccination with RIV, ccIIV, and standard egg-based IIVs in two influenza seasons to investigate whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines can overcome the effect of prior repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines.ResultsInfluenza vaccines and vaccine viruses used during the 2018−2019 and 2019−2020 study seasonsThis study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in the United States during the Northern Hemisphere 2018−2019 (Year 1, n = 723) and 2019−2020 (Year 2, n = 684) influenza seasons (Fig. 1). In year 1, HCP were randomized to receive one of four influenza vaccines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax), RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4. Year 1 vaccines contain 2018−2019 Northern Hemisphere formulation including an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage) (Table 1). ccIIV4 in the 2018−2019 season contained cell-culture derived seed strains for the influenza A(H3N2) and B vaccine strains but egg-based seed strain for A(H1N1)pdm09. In year 2 (2019−2020 season), HCP were re-randomized into 7 repeat vaccination arms: IIV4-IIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) components were updated to a A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus and an A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like virus respectively while the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata components remained the same (Table 1).Fig. 1: CONSORT diagrams for screening and Enrollment of participants in Year 1 (2018−2019) and Year 2 (2019−2020).Abbreviations: IIV4: Inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone® or Fluarix® Quadrivalent); ccIIV4: Cell-culture based IIV (Flucelvax® Quadrivalent); RIV4: recombinant-hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (Flublok® Quadrivalent). *Numbers in parenthesis are new enrollees for Year 2.Full size imageTable 1 Vaccine egg-adapted mutations in the HA head domain of egg-grown vaccine viruses and CVVs in year 1 and year 2 of the studyFull size tableEgg-adapted amino acid substitutions in egg-based vaccines in both study yearsHA sequences from components of IIV4, ccIV4 and RIV4 vaccines used in both study years were first analyzed (Table 1). Within the same season, the study vaccines contained different candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) that are antigenically-like the prototype vaccine viruses recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)30. Compared to the cell-grown vaccine prototype viruses, the vaccine antigens from all 4 subtypes in the egg-based vaccines had HA substitutions due to egg-adaptation. A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV formulated in Fluzone IIV4 had Q223R substitution in both years, while the egg CVV used for Fluarix IIV4 and ccIIV4 in year 1 had G225A substitution instead (Table 1). For A(H3N2), year 1 egg-based vaccine had T160K (resulting in a loss of glycosylation motif at HA 158), L194P, and D225G egg-adapted changes, while year 2 egg-based vaccine had D190N and N246T substitutions. Influenza B vaccine viruses remained the same in both years. Egg-based B/Victoria vaccine had T199I substitution, which can cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197; whereas egg-based B/Yamagata vaccine had a N197D substitution that can also cause a loss of glycosylation motif at HA position 197.Antibody responses at pre-vaccination, 1-month and 6-months post-vaccination in Year 1We first measured neutralizing antibody responses by microneutralization assays (MN) for A(H3N2) and hemagglutination inhibition assays (HI) for A(H1N1)dpm09 and Bs. In year 1 at baseline, pre-vaccination MN/HI geometric mean titers (GMTs) were similar (p > 0.05) among the 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 2). Significant differences in neutralizing antibody responses were detected at 1-month post-vaccination. For A(H3N2), RIV4 vaccination induced significantly higher (p < 0.05) neutralizing antibody responses to the cell-propagated A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and IIV4s (Fluarix and Fluzone) in both age groups; RIV4 group also mounted significantly higher (p < 0.05) MN antibody responses to the egg-propagated A(H3N2) virus than ccIIV4 and Fluarix-IIV4. For A(H1N1)pdm09, RIV4 induced significantly higher (p < 0.05) post-vaccination HI antibody responses to both egg- (GMT 122) and cell- (GMT 137) propagated A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses than ccIIV4 (egg virus GMT 76; cell virus GMT 77) in the 18-44 years age group, and significantly higher (p < 0.05) post-vaccination HI antibodies to egg- (GMT 82) and cell- (GMT 76) propagated A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses than Fluzone-IIV4 (egg virus GMT 43; cell virus GMT 36) in the 45-64 years age group. In contrast, post-vaccination HI antibodies to B/Victoria and B/Yamagata viruses were mostly similar (p > 0.05) among the 4 vaccines in both age groups, except that RIV4 induced significantly higher (p < 0.05) HI antibody responses (GMT: 117) to cell-propagated B/Yamagata vaccine virus than ccIIV4 (GMT: 80) in the 18−44 years age group (Fig. 2). RIV4 also had higher seropositivity rate (proportions of titers ≥40) and seroconversion rate (SCR) than egg-based IIV4 vaccines against the cell-grown A(H3N2) virus (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2)27.Fig. 2: MN or HI Antibody responses to egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination in Year 1.Antibody titers from each of the four vaccine groups were presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) respectively for 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups. Gray dots represented individual titers. Fluzone IIV4 18−44 years: Day 0 (n = 52), 1 m (n = 52), 6 m (n = 47); Fluzone IIV4 45-64 years: Day 0 (n = 58), 1 m (n = 58), 6 m (n = 54); Fluarix IIV4 18−44 years: Day 0 (n = 55), 1 m (n = 55), 6 m (n = 48); Fluarix IIV4 45−64 years: Day 0 (n = 65), 1 m (n = 63), 6 m (n = 59); ccIIV4 18−44 years: Day 0 (n = 135), 1 m (n = 133), 6 m (n = 124); ccIIV4 45−64 years: Day 0 (n = 148), 1 m (n = 147), 6 m (n = 142); RIV4 18−44 years: Day 0 (n = 99), 1 m (n = 98), 6 m (n = 85); RIV4 45−64 years: Day 0 (n = 98), 1 m (n = 98), 6 m (n = 92); Microneutralization titers (MN) were measured for A(H3N2) virus, while hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were measured for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria (B/VIC), and B/Yamagata (B/YAM) viruses. One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs of each time point among the 4 vaccine groups. Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.Full size imageWhen comparing post-vaccination antibody responses by fold rise, RIV4 induced overall higher geometric mean fold rise of neutralizing antibody titers to the vaccine viruses (Fig. 3A, B). For A(H3N2), RIV4 induced higher fold rise of neutralizing antibodies to both cell- and egg-propagated A(H3N2) viruses compared to other vaccines in both age groups (Fig. 3A, B). MN fold rise to A(H3N2) cell vaccine virus was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in RIV4 groups (3.5 in 18−44 years, 4.6 in 45−64 years) than those in IIV4 and ccIIV4 groups (range: 1.0−1.6). Neutralizing antibody responses waned at 6-months post-vaccination in year 1. GMTs to each virus at 6-months reduced by 1−2.5 folds comparing with the GMTs at 1-month post-vaccination (Fig. 3C, D). At 6-months post-vaccination, although fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies (6 month/1 month) was greater in RIV4 recipients to cell-A(H3N2) in both age groups, and to cell-A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the 45−64 years group (Fig. 3C, D), the titers of neutralizing antibodies to cell-grown viruses in RIV4 recipients still remained at similar or higher levels compared to other vaccine groups (Fig. 2).Fig. 3: Fold rise of MN or HI antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination and waning of antibody titers at 6-months post-vaccination in Year 1.Geometric mean (GM) fold rise of antibody titers (1 m/Day 0) from each of the four vaccine groups were calculated for egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses, and for 18−44 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 52), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 55), ccIIV4 (n = 133), RIV4 (n = 98)) and 45−64 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 58), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 63), ccIIV4 (n = 147), RIV4 (n = 98)) age groups respectively (A, B). Antibody waning was expressed as the GM fold-reduction of titers from 1-month to 6-months (1 m/6 m) post-vaccination for 18−44 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 47), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 48), ccIIV4 (n = 124), RIV4 (n = 85)) and 45−64 years (Fluzone IIV4 (n = 54), Fluarix IIV4 (n = 59), ccIIV4 (n = 142), RIV4 (n = 92)) respectively (C, D). MN titers were measured for A(H3N2) virus, while HI titers were measured for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM viruses. One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GM fold-rise or fold-reduction of each time point among the 4 vaccine groups. Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.Full size imageTo further elucidate the quality of the antibody responses, we then analyzed the total binding antibodies by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to both HA head of the 4 antigen subtypes and HA stalk of the A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes in the quadrivalent vaccines. Total binding antibodies include both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. For A(H3N2), consistent with MN responses, RIV4 induced significantly higher (p < 0.01) total binding antibodies (Fig. 4A) and significantly higher (p < 0.001) fold rise (Fig. S1A) to the cell-A(H3N2) HA head at 1-month post-vaccination compared to IIV4 and ccIIV4. For A(H1N1)pdm09, all 4 vaccines induced similar fold rise (1 month/day 0) in the total binding antibodies to egg- and cell- A(H1N1)pdm09 HA (Fig. S1A), although RIV4 group had the highest total binding antibodies to the cell-A(H1N1)pdm09 HA at 1-month post-vaccination, it is likely due to the higher levels of pre-vaccination total binding antibodies (Fig. 4A). For influenza Bs, RIV4 induced significantly higher (p < 0.01) fold-rise against B/VIC and B/YAM cell virus HA head than Fluarix IIV4 but not Fluzone IIV4 (Fig. S1A). At 6-months post-vaccination, total binding antibodies to the HA head waned but the levels of total binding antibodies to the cell-grown virus HA head of all 4 subtypes in the RIV4 group remained the highest among the 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4: Total HA binding antibody and HA stalk antibody responses measured by ELISA at pre-vaccination (Day 0), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination in Year 1.Antibody titers from each of the four vaccine groups were presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for combined 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups. Gray dots represented individual titers. Fluzone IIV4: Day 0 (n = 24), 1 m (n = 24), 6 m (n = 21); Fluarix IIV4: Day 0 (n = 24), 1 m (n = 24), 6 m (n = 23); ccIIV4: Day 0 (n = 56), 1 m (n = 54), 6 m (n = 51); RIV4: Day 0 (n = 40), 1 m (n = 40), 6 m (n = 38). A: HA (A(H1N1)pdm09) or HA head (A(H3N2), B/VIC, B/YAM) binding antibodies. B: Ratios of egg/cell HA or HA head binding antibody titers with 95% CI. C: H3 stalk and H1 stalk antibody responses at day 0, 1-month and 6-months post vaccination. D: Fold rise of H3 stalk and H1 stalk antibody titers from pre to 1-month post-vaccination with 95% CI. One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs of each time point among the 4 vaccine groups (A, C). One-way ANOVA nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the fold changes among the 4 vaccine groups (B, D). Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.*: In (C), paired t test (two-tailed) was used for comparing the pre- and 1 m post-vaccination stalk antibody titers within the same vaccine group: significantly higher HA stalk antibody titers were detected in 1 m post-vaccination than pre-vaccination for H3 stalk binding antibody in Fluzone IIV4 (p = 0.0009), ccIIV4 (p = 0.0004), RIV4 (p < 0.0001); and for H1 stalk binding antibody in Fluzone IIV4 (p = 0.0005), Fluarix IIV4 (p = 0.0092), ccIIV4 (p < 0.0001), RIV4 (p = 0.0015).Full size imagePre-existing A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies were detected in participants at varies levels. Comparing HA stalk antibody titers at 1-month post-vaccination versus day 0, vaccination significantly boosted A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk antibodies in all 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.01), and significantly boosted A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies in 3 of the 4 vaccine groups (p < 0.001, Fluzone IIV4, ccIIV4, and RIV4) (Fig. 4C). The RIV4 group had the highest A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies at 1-month post-vaccination, however the fold rises of HA stalk antibodies were low (<1.8) and similar among all 4 vaccine groups (Fig. 4D). At 6-months post-vaccination, waning of HA stalk antibodies were more notable in ccIIV4 and RIV4 groups compared to IIV4 (Fig. S2).Active surveillance was conducted during the influenza season in year 1, a total of 26 breakthrough infection cases were identified with an attack rate of 3.6% (26/723) (Supplementary Table S3).Antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes measured by antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratio in year 1To assess the levels of antibody responses targeting the egg-adapted epitopes, we used the antibody “GMT egg/cell titer ratio” as a proxy to quantify the extent of difference in antibody responses to egg- versus cell-viruses in each vaccine group (Fig. 5A, B). The post-vaccination neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratio was the most pronounced for A(H3N2), with elevated MN GMT egg/cell titer ratios in all vaccine groups (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting vaccination induced significant levels of neutralizing antibody responses targeting A(H3N2) egg-adapted epitopes related to 158 (CHO-), 194 P, and 225 G (Table 1). The post-vaccination A(H3N2) neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell ratio from the 18−44 years group who received Fluzone IIV4 (3.7), Fluarix IIV4 (3.8), and ccIIV4 (3.0) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the same age groups who received RIV4 (2.1) (Fig. 5A). Similar trend was also observed in the 45−64 years group, the post-vaccination A(H3N2) neutralizing antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratios in those who received Fluzone IIV4 (4.0), Fluarix IIV4 (3.5), and ccIIV4 (2.6) were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those who received RIV4 (1.7) (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5: Difference in MN or HI antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes stratified by age groups and vaccine type in Year 1.A, B: Geometric mean ratio of egg/cell virus titers at 1-month post-vaccination with 95% CI for each vaccine component among the 4 vaccine groups for 18-44 years (A Fluzone IIV4: n = 52, Fluarix IIV4: n = 55, ccIIV4: n = 133, RIV4: n = 98) and 45−64 years (B Fluzone IIV4: n = 58, Fluarix IIV4: n = 63, ccIIV4: n = 147, RIV4: n = 98) age groups. One-way ANOVA nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison of geometric mean ratio of egg/cell virus titers among the 4 vaccine groups. C, D: Proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 fold pre- and 1-month post-vaccination in each vaccine group. Proportions of participants who had ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio) at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination were presented for each vaccine component among the 4 vaccine groups for 18−44 years (C) and 45−64 years (D). Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was performed for comparing proportions of ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus between pre- and 1-month post-vaccination in each vaccine group. MN titers were measured for A(H3N2) virus, while HI titers were measured for A(H1N1)pdm09, B/VIC, and B/YAM viruses. Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars (A, B). P values on the trend lines of RIV4 group indicate significantly reduced proportions from pre- to 1-month post-vaccination (C, D).Full size imageIn contrast, the impact of egg-adaption is less profound in HI antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 and both B lineage viruses. For A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata, the post-vaccination HI antibody GMT egg/cell titer ratios were all <2 and similar (p > 0.05) among the vaccine groups (Fig. 5A, B). For B/Victoria, the post-vaccination HI GMT egg/cell titer ratios were slightly elevated (range: 2−3) with the ratio in Fluzone IIV4 recipients significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in RIV4 recipients from the 45−64 years group (Fig. 5B).Next, to assess whether vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines can overcome the impact of egg-adaptation and reduce the GMT egg/cell ratio in the vaccine responses, we calculated the “proportion of the participants with egg/cell ratio ≥4” in MN/HI titers at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D). At pre-vaccination, there was no significant difference in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 among the 4 vaccine groups. At baseline, around 40% of participants had GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 to A(H3N2) and B/Victoria viruses, suggesting a high prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies targeting HA egg-adapted epitopes in this highly vaccinated HCP population. After vaccination, in both age groups, the two egg-based vaccines generally reinforced the neutralizing antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes as evidenced by an increased trend in the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4. In contrast, among RIV4 and ccIIV4 recipients, the proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was overall lower at 1-month post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Fig. 5C, D), demonstrating the potential of non-egg-based vaccines to reduce the neutralizing antibody response difference to egg versus cell viruses. Most notably, only in the RIV4 groups to A(H3N2) virus, the proportions of GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4-fold were significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in both age groups (from 58% down to 26% in 18−44 years, and from 40% down to 21% in 45−64 years), suggesting RIV4 vaccination can potentially mitigate the pre-existing antibody memory to egg-adapted epitopes by improving the magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses to cell-propagated viruses (Fig. 5C, D).We then also analyzed the HA binding antibody “GMT egg/cell titer ratio” measured by ELISA. Similar trend was observed as with MN/HI antibodies that GMT egg/cell ratios were higher (p < 0.05) in the egg-based IIV4 groups than those in the ccIIV4 and RIV4 groups for A(H3N2) HA head and B/VIC HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4B). However, the GMT egg/cell HA binding antibody ratios (Fig. 4B) were around 1 for all vaccine groups and subtypes, even for A(H3N2), suggesting that unlike the neutralizing antibody responses, most total binding antibody responses do not target the egg-adapted epitopes on HA.Redirecting neutralizing antibody responses from egg-adapted epitopes following repeat vaccination with non-egg vs egg-based vaccines in year 2In year 2, participants who received ccIIV4, RIV4, and Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4 in year 1 were re-randomized into seven repeat-vaccination arms: ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) (Fig. 1).We compared the post-vaccination HI GMTs to the cell-vaccine viruses between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) and each of the 6 repeat vaccination arms with non-egg-based vaccines (Fig. 6). Participants in younger age group (18−44 years) in the ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, and the older age group (45−64 years) in ccIIV4-RIV4 and RIV4-RIV4 arms, all mounted significantly higher (p < 0.05) neutralizing antibody titers to cell-A(H3N2) virus than those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm. For HI antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09 cell virus, RIV4-RIV4 and IIV4-RIV4 arms in 18−44 years, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4 arms in 45−64 years all had significantly higher (p < 0.05) HI antibody responses than those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm. Vaccinees in the 18−44 years group in the ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms had significantly higher (p < 0.05) HI antibody responses to both B/VIC and B/YAM cell viruses versus those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm. Participants in the older age group (45−64 years) who received non-egg-based vaccine in year 2, most had significantly higher (p < 0.05) HI GMTs to both B/VIC and B/YAM cell virus compared to those in the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm, except ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and IIV4-ccIIV4 arms for B/YAM cell virus (Fig. 6). It is worth noting that those who received IIV4 in Year 1 then RIV4 in Year 2 demonstrated improved antibody responses to cell-grown vaccine viruses compared to those who received IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone). The seropositivity rates (Supplementary Table S4) and seroconversion rates (Table S5) to both egg- and cell- viruses in year 2 are summarized in the supplementary materials28,29. Overall, in year 2 participants who received one or two non-egg-based vaccines mounted higher post-vaccination HI antibody responses to cell-grown vaccine viruses than those who received repeated egg-based IIV4 vaccination in both years (IIV4-IIV4).Fig. 6: HI antibody responses to egg- and cell-propagated vaccine viruses at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination in year 2 stratified by 7 repeat vaccination arms.HI antibody titers from each of the 7 repeat vaccine arms were presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) respectively for 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups. Gray dots represented individual titers. 18−44 years: ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 42), ccIIV4-RIV4 (n = 45), RIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 28), RIV4-RIV4 (n = 30), IIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 49), IIV4-RIV4 (n = 48), IIV4-IIV4 (n = 47). 45−64 years: ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 59), ccIIV4-RIV4 (n = 61), RIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 45), RIV4-RIV4 (n = 44), IIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 57), IIV4-RIV4 (n = 56), IIV4-IIV4 (n = 56). Unpaired t test (two-tailed) was used to compare the post-vaccination GMTs to cell vaccine viruses between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 vaccine arms within the same age group. Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars.Full size imageAt 1-month post-vaccination during Year 1, 21−40% of HCP who received only one season of non-egg-based vaccine including RIV4 still had A(H3N2) GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 (Fig. 5C, D). We therefore investigated whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines in year 2 could further reduce the HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio (Fig. 7). Among recipients of IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), the proportion of participants with HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 generally increased, especially for A(H3N2) and B/VIC in the 18−44 years group, B/VIC virus and B/YAM virus in the 45−64 years group, suggesting repeated boost to antibodies targeting egg-adapted epitopes in these participants after receiving consecutive egg-based IIV4 vaccination. In contrast, among recipients of non-egg-based vaccines in just one study year (IIV4-ccIIV4 or IIV4-RIV4) or in both study years (ccIIV4-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4), the proportions of participants with egg/cell ratio ≥4 to generally decreased post-vaccination though did not reach statistical significance in some repeat vaccination groups (Fig. 7). Among those, the ccIIV4-RIV4 arm had significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the proportion of HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) viruses comparing pre- vs post-vaccination in the 45−64 years group, and the RIV4-ccIIV4 arm had significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the proportion of HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the younger age group in year 2, suggesting multiple seasons of repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines may be needed to overcome the dominant antibody responses to the egg-adapted epitopes and redirect the antibody responses away from the egg-adapted epitopes.Fig. 7: Dynamics of proportion of participants with HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥ 4 fold among seven repeat vaccination arms in Year 2.Proportions of Year 2 participants who had ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus (egg/cell titer ratio) at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination were presented for each vaccine component among the seven Year 1-Year 2 vaccine arms. A: 18-44 years age group and B: 45−64 years age group. Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) was performed for comparing proportions of ≥4 -fold reduced titer to cell vaccine virus between pre- and 1-month post-vaccination in each vaccine group. P values noted on the corresponding trend lines indicate statistically significant difference of the proportions between pre- and post-vaccination.Full size imageTotal binding antibodies to HA head and HA stalk in year 2 were also analyzed (Fig. 8). At 1-month post-vaccination, the levels of total HA binding antibodies were similar in most repeat vaccination arms, except ccIIV4-RIV4 arm induced significantly higher (p < 0.05) HA head binding antibodies to A(H3N2), both ccIIV4-RIV4 and IIV4-RIV4 arms induced significantly higher (p < 0.05) HA head binding to B/Vic and B/Yam than the IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm (Fig. 8A). The total HA binding antibody GMT egg/cell ratio was around 1 against all 4 vaccine components with no significant difference between 7 repeat vaccination arms (Fig. 8B), indicating most of the total HA binding antibodies are not targeting the egg-adapted epitopes.Fig. 8: HA head and stalk binding antibody responses measured by ELISA at pre- and 1-month post-vaccination in 7 repeat vaccination arms.Antibody titers from each of the 7 vaccine arms were presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for combined 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups. Gray dots represented individual titers. ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 20), ccIIV4-RIV4 (n = 22), RIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 16), RIV4-RIV4 (n = 16), IIV4-ccIIV4 (n = 22), IIV4-RIV4 (n = 22), IIV4-IIV4 (n = 22). A: HA head binding antibodies. B: Ratios of Egg/cell HA head binding antibody titers expressed as GM fold change with 95% CI. C: HA stalk binding antibodies for H3 and H1 stalk respectively. D: Fold-rise of HA stalk binding antibody titers from pre to 1 m post-vaccination expressed as GMFR with 95% CI. Unpaired t test (two-tailed) was used to compare the post-vaccination GMTs to cell virus HA between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 vaccine arms within the same age group (A). One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) was used to compare the GMTs of stalk binding antibody at each time point among the 4 vaccine groups (C). One-way ANOVA nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the fold changes among the 4 vaccine groups (B, D). Statistically significant differences between groups are indicated by p values on the horizontal bars (A, C). *In (C), paired t test (two-tailed) was used for comparing the pre- and 1 m post-vaccination stalk antibody titers within the same vaccine group: significantly higher HA stalk antibody titers were detected in 1 m post-vaccination than pre-vaccination for H3 stalk antibody titers in ccIIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.0001), RIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.004), IIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.03), IIV4-RIV4 (p = 0.03); and for H1 stalk antibodies in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.008), RIV4-ccIIV4 (p = 0.006).Full size imageComparing pre- and 1-month post-vaccination, A(H3N2) HA stalk binding antibodies were significantly boosted in ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4, IIV4-ccIIV4, and IIV4-RIV4 arms, while A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk binding antibodies were also significantly boosted in ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and RIV4-ccIIV4 arms (Fig. 8C). However, fold rise in both A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibodies were low (GM fold rise <1.78) with no significant difference (p > 0.05) among all 7 repeat vaccination arms (Fig. 8D).DiscussionIn this study, we compared the antibody responses to egg- versus cell-propagated vaccine viruses following vaccination with RIV4, ccIIV4 or IIV4 among HCP aged 18−44 and 45−64 years. RIV4 induced more robust HI and MN antibody responses than ccIIV4 and egg-based IIV4 against multiple vaccine strains including cell-propagated A(H3N2), consistent with previous reports9,13,15,27,28,29. Our analysis also indicates that repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines could overcome pre-existing egg/cell titer differences in neutralizing antibody levels by re-directing vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses away from egg-adapted epitopes, resulting in higher antibody responses to circulating cell-grown viruses, even with frequent prior vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines in HCP.Reported VE against A(H3N2) virus was low during the 2016−17 to 2018−19 seasons despite the absence of apparent antigenic drift of the circulating viruses1,4,31. The egg-adapted changes on the HA head domain in the egg-grown A(H3N2) vaccine virus: T160K, L194P, and D225G resulted in an “antigenic mismatch” from circulating strains that likely contributed to the low observed VE3,5,6. Our study showed that even at pre-vaccination, a high proportion of HCP in this study had MN GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 to A(H3N2) virus, suggesting the high prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies targeting 158 (loss of glycosylation caused by T160K) 194P, and 225G epitopes, likely due to the prior repeat vaccination with egg-based vaccines. More than 68% of the HCP in this study received influenza egg-based vaccine in all five preceding influenza seasons (Table 2). The imprinting effect of egg-based vaccines could be lifelong resulting in a persistence of antibodies targeting egg-adapted sites that could be preferentially reinforced following repeat egg-based vaccination3. This may impede the quality of antibody response to the circulating influenza strains and negatively affect VE. Our study suggests that non-egg-based vaccines, especially RIV4, might circumvent the effect of repeat vaccination with egg-based influenza vaccines that contain egg-adapted changes.Table 2 Participant characteristics in year 1Full size tableRepeat vaccination can lead to reduced VE23,32,33. In year 1, the frequent prior repeat egg-based vaccinations may blunt the antibody responses to the subsequent vaccination as reflected by the limited fold rise in MN/HI antibody titers (Fig. 3). Khurana et al. also observed significantly lower fold rise to A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses in those with prior vaccination irrespective of vaccine platforms received20. In a highly vaccinated population such as HCP, an effective vaccine should be able to overcome issues with both repeat vaccination and vaccine egg-adapted mutations. RIV4 vaccination reduced the proportions of participants with MN GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) by two-fold in both age groups (Fig. 5C, D). In year 2, all 4 repeat vaccination arms with non-egg-based vaccines (ccIIV-ccIIV4, ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4) further reduced the proportion of participants with HI GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 against A(H3N2) to less than 10% (Fig. 7), of which 3 in 18−44 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4) and 2 in 45−64 years group (ccIIV4-RIV4, RIV4-RIV4) induced significantly higher HI antibodies to A(H3N2) cell virus than IIV4-IIV4 arm (Fig. 6). Collectively, these findings suggest that multiple seasons of vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines may be needed to overcome the pre-existing immune memory to egg-adapted epitopes and re-direct the neutralizing antibody responses towards epitopes on cell-grown viruses that better represent circulating strains.Furthermore, the difference in antigenicity and egg-adaption between vaccine viruses from consecutive influenza seasons could further confound the effect of repeat vaccination. The A(H3N2) vaccine virus in year 2 was updated to a 3 C.3a A/Kansas/14/2017-like virus, which is genetically and antigenically distant from the 3 C.2a vaccine virus A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 in year 1. Year 2 vaccine virus A/Kansas/14/2017 virus bears different egg-adapted changes at D190N and N246T but possess 194 L and 225D that are the same as cell-propagated A(H3N2) vaccine virus in Year 1 (Table 1). This could have also contributed to the improved antibody response to the cell-grown A(H3N2) vaccine virus after the repeat vaccination in year 2. Thus far, most reported VE from repeated vaccination studies were from egg-based vaccines, evaluation of whether repeat vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines will improve VE, especially for A(H3N2), is warranted.To fully characterize the quantity as well as the quality of the antibody responses, we measured both functional, neutralizing antibody responses to egg- versus cell- propagated viruses (by MN or HI), and the total HA binding antibodies (by ELISA) that include both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses. For RIV4, both increased antigen dose and the absence of egg-adapted mutations may have led to the improved immunogenicity13. RIV4 contains 3 times the antigen dose at 45 µg HA/dose/strain compared to the standard dose IIV4 and ccIIV4 (15 µg HA/dose/strain). For A(H3N2), RIV4 vaccination not only improved the quality of the functional neutralizing antibody responses (Fig. 2) by reducing the MN GMT egg/cell ratios in both years, it also significantly increased the quantity of the total A(H3N2) cell HA head binding antibodies (Fig. 4A, Fig. S1A). However, for A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses, the difference in HI antibody versus the total HA head binding antibody levels among 4 vaccine groups was less consistent, suggesting that the magnitude of improvement differ between subtypes and were likely determined by the relative immunodominance of the egg-adapted HA epitopes for each subtype. In addition, the egg/cell HA head binding ELISA titer ratios were around 1 for all vaccine antigen subtypes irrespective of vaccine platforms (Fig. 4B), suggesting the total HA binding antibody responses induced by vaccination cannot differentiate egg-adapted epitopes on HA even for A(H3N2). This is in stark contrast to the highly elevated egg/cell GMT ratio in neutralizing antibody responses to egg- vs cell-A(H3N2) viruses (Fig. 5A, B), highlighting the importance of inducing high quality, neutralizing antibody responses from vaccination.Our study also demonstrated that the impact of vaccine egg-adaption may differ between influenza virus subtypes, with the biggest impact on neutralizing antibodies to A(H3N2) and moderate impact for influenza B vaccine viruses. HA changes due to egg-adaptation resulted in a loss of glycosylation at HA position 197 for both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata egg vaccine viruses (Table 1), which could alter the antigenicity of influenza B virus, particularly for B/Victoria lineage34,35,36. Disproportional impact of the egg-adapted mutation at HA position 197 on the two B lineages were also observed in this study. B/Victoria virus had a much higher GMT egg/cell titer ratio and proportion of participants with GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 than B/Yamagata virus in year 1 (Fig. 5). Similar to what was observed for A(H3N2), in Year 2, repeat vaccination with IIV4 boosted the antibody responses to egg-adapted epitopes at HA 197 in B/Victoria vaccine virus, resulting in substantially increased proportions of GMT egg/cell ratio ≥4 only in the IIV4-IIV4 arm (Fig. 7).The impact of egg-adaptation was the least profound on the antibody response to A(H1N1)pdm09. Both Year 1 and Year 2 A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine viruses bear egg-adapted change at HA Q223R. Studies have reported that Q223R egg-adapted change at the HA head domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus can promote virus replication in eggs, alter antigenicity and influence immune response37,38,39,40,41,42. In this study, 1-month post-vaccination GMTs to both egg- and cell-propagated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine viruses in year 1 were similar among the 4 vaccine groups, with GMT egg/cell titer ratio around 1.0, and the proportion of HCP with egg/cell titer ratio ≥4 was only 2−11% (Fig. 5), indicating a less immunodominant role of Q223R change. Furthermore, the two egg IIV4 vaccines induced similar antibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses regardless of the variation at 223. These findings are consistent with our previous report in which we found that among over 300 adults who received egg-based A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines with Q223R egg-adapted epitope during 5 influenza seasons, only 9% of participants mounted antibodies specific to 223R38.Multiple immune mechanisms can contribute to the protection from influenza infection. Broadly cross-reactive HA stalk antibodies have been considered as one of the targets for universal vaccine development. Here, we assessed both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) HA stalk antibody responses in all vaccine groups in both years. When comparing the post-vs pre-vaccination HA stalk antibody levels, vaccination induced HA stalk antibody rise in several vaccine groups and repeat vaccination arms. However, the levels of geometric mean titer fold rise were low (close to 1, Figs. 4D, 8D) with no significant difference in fold rise among different vaccine groups in both years, even in RIV4 group that received 3 times more antigen doses; the difference in HA stalk antibody titers post-vaccination mostly mirrored the difference in pre-existing HA stalk antibody levels. To this end, development of next generations vaccines that can induce multiple arms of immune responses could improve the effectiveness of the vaccines.Human immunity to influenza is quite complex and present challenges to improve vaccine effectiveness. Immune priming can play dual roles and is largely directed by the immunodominance of imprinted HA epitopes upon first exposure to influenza antigen, as well as the repeated influenza exposures by vaccinations or infections later in lifetime3,38. Here, our study demonstrated how immunodominant egg-adapted epitopes on A(H3N2) HA can impact the immunogenicity from repeated vaccination. Collectively with previous reports3, findings from this study could provide a few meaningful insights to improve vaccination strategy. First, for those who were repeat vaccinated with egg-based vaccines such as HCP and older adults, vaccination with non-egg-based vaccines could be especially beneficial; second, it would also be important not to prime naive children with egg-adapted epitopes3, it might be necessary to immunize naive children with non-egg-based influenza vaccines as their first priming dose. In addition, improved vaccine formulations, such as higher vaccine doses and the use of adjuvants, could also improve vaccine immunogenicity.Our study has several limitations. First, we only compared the immunogenicity of egg- vs non-egg-based vaccines in two influenza seasons. The effect of the vaccine egg-adapted changes on vaccine immunogenicity will vary by season depending on the antigenic properties of the vaccine viruses. A(H3N2) vaccine was updated to a 3 C.2a virus in 2021−2022 influenza season with the same T160K egg-adapted change in the egg-based vaccines and was updated again in 2022−23 and 2023−24 seasons with the egg-based vaccines carrying a different set of egg-adapted mutations30, thus, continued effort is needed to assess vaccine immunogenicity and VE. Second, we only focused on the antibody responses to HA. RIV4 lacks the neuraminidase (NA) component that also could contribute to the protective efficacy of influenza vaccines. Thus, whether the improved antibody responses to HA alone in RIV4 will translate into improved vaccine efficacy and effectiveness still needs to be assessed. Other humoral immune responses, such as antibody responses to NA, mucosal and cell-mediated immunity, also contribute to protection. Lastly, no correction for multiple comparisons was done because this was an exploratory analysis.Taken together, our study demonstrated that multiple seasons of vaccination with non-egg-based influenza vaccines can improve HA-mediated antibody immunogenicity to cell-propagated viruses representing circulating strains. Our findings support the use of antibody responses to cell-propagated viruses, rather than to egg-propagated vaccine viruses, as the primary endpoint in future immunogenicity studies for licensure or comparison of influenza vaccines. Influenza product and platform specific VE estimates could help confirm findings from comparative immunogenicity studies and provide additional information to identify optimal vaccination strategies to prevent influenza.Materials and methodsStudy designThe original study was a randomized, open-label trial conducted in the United States during the Northern Hemisphere 2018−2019 (Year 1) and 2019−2020 (Year 2) influenza seasons. This study is an exploratory analysis. The detailed participant enrollment, randomization, and blinding were previously described27,28,29. Participant characterisitcs in year 1 are described in Table 2. During Year 1, HCP were stratified by two age groups (18−44 years and 45−64 years) and randomized at 4:4:2:2 ratio to receive one of four quadrivalent vaccines: ccIIV4 (Flucelvax), RIV4 (Flublok), Fluzone IIV4 or Fluarix IIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0 pre-vaccination), 1-month, and 6-months post-vaccination. The Year 2 study was designed to evaluate the antibody responses following 7 different Year 1-Year 2 repeat vaccination regimens: IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone), IIV4-ccIIV4, IIV4-RIV4, RIV4-ccIIV4, RIV4-RIV4, ccIIV4-ccIIV4 and ccIIV4-RIV4 (Fig. 1). Serum samples were collected at baseline (day 0) and 1-month post-vaccination.Fluzone IIV4 and Fluarix IIV4, the two egg-based vaccines were analyzed separately for this exploratory analysis because the two vaccines have different egg-adaptated mutation on the HA of the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV (Table 1). Fluzone has Q223R substitution which was associated with focused antibody response to 223R in some vaccinees as we previously reported38, while the A(H1N1)pdm09 egg CVV in Fluarix had 223Q. In addition, the current analysis is also age-stratified by 18−44 years and 45−64 years age groups as we previously observed that the impact of vaccine egg-adaptation on antibody response to A(H3N2) virus may be age-related3.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assaysAntibody responses to A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage viruses were analyzed using HI assays using methods as previously described43. HIs for A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were performed using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes. Egg-grown viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Cell-grown A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Influenza B antigens were ether-treated prior to use in the HI assays. Egg- and cell (MDCK)-propagated A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) viruses were tested in year 1, Egg-propagated A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, cell-propagated A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, egg- and cell-propagated B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) viruses were tested in year 2 by HI using 0.5% turkey erythrocytes.Antibody responses to A(H3N2) viruses were analyzed by MN assays in year 1 (the cell-grown vaccine antigen of the study year does not hemagglutinate in the HI assays), and HI assays in year 2. Egg-grown A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, cell-grown A(H3N2) viruses were propagated in stably transfected MDCK cells with cDNA of human 2,6-sialyltransferase (MDCK-SIAT1 cells). Egg- and cell (MDCK-SIAT1)-grown A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 viruses were tested in MN assays in year 1 using MDCK-SIAT1 cells using methods as previously described44. In Year 2, egg- and cell-propagated A/Kansas/14/2017 viruses were tested by HI assays using 0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Twenty percent of participants were selected by random sampling from each vaccine group and age strata (18−44 yrs and 45−64 yrs) in year 1 (n = 144) and year 2 (n = 140), the MN/HI antibody levels of the subset are representative of the whole study populations in year 1 (Fig. S3) and year 2 (Fig. S4). These serum samples were tested by ELISA to evaluate the total binding antibodies against 8 recombinant HA proteins (rHA from both egg-and cell-propagated viruses of each of the 4 vaccine antigens), and 2 rHA stalk proteins (A(H1N1)pdm09 HA stalk, and A(H3N2) HA stalk). rHA from egg- and cell A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2), B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 1 sera; rHA from egg- A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09 and cell-A/Idaho/7/2018 (H1N1)pdm09, rHA head from egg- and cell- A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2), egg- and cell- B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Victoria), egg- and cell-B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata) were tested with year 2 sera. The purified and trimeric recombinant HA proteins were expressed from the baculovirus system using the established procedures45. For ELISA, rHA antigens were coated at 100 ng/well. Serum samples were tested at an initial dilution of 1:400 followed by 2-fold serial dilution. Antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human pan immunoglobulin conjugate to detect total binding antibodies. ELISA was performed based on previously described procedures46,47. The ELISA titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum samples that achieved an optical density (OD) value of 0.2 or greater.Sequence analysesAll the testing viruses used in this study were sequenced. Sequences were analyzed against the sequences of candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) of the study vaccines as deposited in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database by BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 (Table 1).Statistical analysesGeometric mean titers (GMTs) at day 0, 1-month and 6-months, geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of antibody titers at 1-month versus day 0, and geometric mean fold reduction of antibody titers at 6 months versus 1-month were calculated per vaccine group. “GMT egg/cell titer ratio” (ratio = GMT to egg-grown vaccine virus or rHA/GMT to cell-grown vaccine virus or rHA) was calculated to quantify the difference in antibody response to egg- versus corresponding cell-propagated vaccine virus for each vaccine group. The proportion of participants with MN or HI GMT egg/cell titer ratio ≥ 4-fold was calculated to quantify the percent of participants with antibodies predominantly targeting egg-adapted epitopes per vaccine group. One-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons (Tukey’s test) or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple group comparison, two-tailed paired t test was used to compare pre- and post-vaccination; two-tailed unpaired t test was used to compare the post-vaccination titers between IIV4-IIV4 (Fluzone) arm and each of the remaining 6 arms in Year 2; Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing proportions. P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) were used for statistical analyses.Ethic reviewThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the study sites and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A different animal discovered dead in October near Utqiagvik is now confirmed to be the world’s first documented case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a polar bear.(Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) This article was first published by the Alaska Beacon. A polar bear found dead on Alaska’s North Slope is the first of the species known to have been killed by the highly pathogenic avian influenza that is circulating among animal populations around the world. The polar bear was found dead in October near Utqiagvik, the nation’s northernmost community, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation reported. The discovery of the virus in the animal’s body tissue, a process that required sampling and study by the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management and other agencies, confirmed earlier this month that highly pathogenic avian influenza was the cause of death, said Dr. Bob Gerlach, Alaska’s state veterinarian. “This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere,” Gerlach said. As such, it was reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health and has gotten attention in other Arctic nations that have polar bears, he said. Bird flu in Washington For the Standard’s coverage from 2023 on the spread of bird flu in Washington, see here. Resources on the outbreak from the Washington State Department of Health can be found here. This was also the first Endangered Species Act-listed animal in Alaska known to fall victim to the disease. Polar bears, dependent on sea ice that is diminishing because of climate change, were listed as threatened in 2008. While polar bears normally eat seals they hunt from the sea ice, it appears likely that this bear was scavenging on dead birds and ingested the influenza virus that way, Gerlach said. Numerous birds on the North Slope of various species have died from this avian influenza, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. However, the bear need not have directly eaten an infected bird to have become sick, Gerlach said. “If a bird dies of this, especially if it’s kept in a cold environment, the virus can be maintained for a while in the environment,” he said. The polar bear death is a sign of the unusually persistent and lethal hold that this strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza has on wild animal populations two years after it arrived in North America, officials said. “What we’re dealing with now is a scenario that we haven’t dealt with in the past. And so there’s no manual,” said Andy Ramey, a U.S. Geological Survey wildlife geneticist and avian influenza expert. No longer just a poultry problem Highly pathogenic avian influenza is called that because it spreads rapidly in flocks of domestic poultry, often requiring massive culls to control the contagions. Such outbreaks have been of concern in the past because of their economic consequences for global agriculture. Until recently, wild birds were afterthoughts. Though they were known to carry the viruses, ferrying them between domestic poultry populations, they were largely unaffected. That has changed dramatically. The prior U.S. outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, in 2014-15, resulted in some wild bird infections, and some influenza-caused bird die-offs occurred in Europe shortly thereafter. But the current version is considered unprecedented in its effect on wild birds and other wildlife. “Across North America, and really around the world, lots of wild birds these days – I mean, thousands of wild birds these days, tens of thousands in some cases — are dying because of these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses,” Ramey said. The deaths are of particular concern when they occur in populations that are already vulnerable, he said. An extreme example he cited is the highly endangered California condors, with a population of just a few hundred. After 21 influenza deaths were documented, federal wildlife officials launched what promises to be a challenging vaccination program in that population. The disease has also killed a variety of mammals around the world. In Alaska, three foxes, a black bear and a brown bear have died from this avian influenza. Elsewhere, more bears have been found dead after being infected by the virus, along with skunks, raccoons, mountain lions and large numbers of seals in eastern Canada and off the coasts of Maine and Washington state, as well as outside of North America. The nation’s first detection of the disease in a squirrel was confirmed earlier this month in an animal found in Arizona. To Gerlach, the polar bear case was not surprising, considering that black and brown bears have died. It is possible that more polar bears succumbed to the disease, but in remote places out of the view of people to record the events, he said. “You’re really dependent on the public that’s out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,” he said. Documenting cases in any wild mammal population can be difficult, he added: “How long is a carcass going to be in the wild before it gets scavenged or eaten by something else?” Aside from the large and wide-ranging death toll in the wild, the current outbreak has some other differences, particularly its durability, as seen in its persistence away from domestic flocks. The virus that caused the 2014-15 outbreak spread in the wild bird populations for a while, but it “sort of fizzled out,” Ramey said, probably because it was eventually stamped out in poultry operations. But this one continues to be maintained in the wild, as evidenced by monitoring in Western Alaska, a place far from any big farms raising chickens or turkeys, he said. Gerlach gave the same assessment. “After the second year, that all of sudden disappeared,” he said of the 2014-15 version. “It didn’t stick around, where this virus seems like it’s sticking around.” Rather than winding down, it is continuing to spread across the world, he noted, even into bird populations in Antarctica, as has been recently documented. There are signs that it is now endemic in the wild, a fixed feature into the foreseeable future, he said. If so, “it’s not going to go away. It’s going to be here, and we have to have some way to deal with it,” he said. Alaska a disease crossroads For Alaska, “a mixing area” for global bird migrations, spread of avian diseases is always an issue, Gerlach said. “Alaska is a catchall area for birds from North America or the Americas, as well as from Asia,” he said. The highly pathogenic avian influenza of 2014 and 2015 was introduced from Asia to North America by wild birds migrating through Alaska. The current influenza is also crossing continents through Alaska, though from multiple directions, Ramey’s research has found. In a newly published study, Ramey and his research partners found what is likely to have been three separate and independent introductions of highly pathogenic avian influenza into Alaska last year. His research, with colleagues from the USGS and other agencies, used genetic analysis to trace one form of influenza to North America and two to Asia. “To have three introductions in Western Alaska, two from East Asia and one from the Lower 48, I mean, we haven’t seen anything like that before,” he said. “It really, I think, exemplifies how these viruses now are clearly able to be maintained.” That study examined birds harvested in the fall of 2022 by hunters in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge area at the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Ramey and his colleagues found only a tiny number of hunted birds that were infected with the currently active highly pathogenic influenza virus: out of 811 swab samples taken directly from birds and another 199 samples from feces, the only harvested birds identified as infected were eight pintails, one cackling goose and one widgeon. It can take months to get test results from samples, so what happened to those harvested birds is unknown, he said. But their meat was safe to eat as long as it was properly cooked to the recommended 165 degrees, he said. “Heat is remarkably good at deactivating viruses,” he said. Along with the cooking advice, there are other longstanding recommendations about safely handling hunted birds, such as regular handwashing and avoidance of obviously sick animals. There is little evidence that the current avian influenza wave poses an infection risk to humans. Only a few cases have been documented in the world, and those were general among people working with poultry. For Alaskans dependent on wild game, this highly pathogenic influenza poses a different type of risk: possible food-security problems. If large numbers of birds wind up dying, that might mean less food on the table in rural Alaska, Ramey and Gerlach said. “Obviously, less birds could equate to less availability, and also less resiliency in the population from things like disease, or climate change, or toxins, et cetera, that could in fact, impact these populations of birds,” Ramey said. Plenty of stressors already exist in wild populations, he said, “so adding another threat to these populations isn’t doing them any favors.” Alaska Beacon is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

After 21 influenza deaths were documented, federal wildlife officials launched what promises to be a challenging vaccination program in that population. The disease has also killed a variety of mammals around the world. In Alaska, three foxes, a black bear and a brown bear have died from this avian influenza. Elsewhere, more bears have been found dead after being infected by the virus, along with skunks, raccoons, mountain lions and large numbers of seals in eastern Canada and off the coasts of Maine and Washington state, as well as outside of North America. The nation’s first detection of the disease in a squirrel was confirmed earlier this month in an animal found in Arizona. To Gerlach, the polar bear case was not surprising, considering that black and brown bears have died. It is possible that more polar bears succumbed to the disease, but in remote places out of the view of people to record the events, he said. “You’re really dependent on the public that’s out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,” he said. Documenting cases in any wild mammal population can be difficult, he added: “How long is a carcass going to be in the wild before it gets scavenged or eaten by something else?” Aside from the large and wide-ranging death toll in the wild, the current outbreak has some other differences, particularly its durability, as seen in its persistence away from domestic flocks. The virus that caused the 2014-15 outbreak spread in the wild bird populations for a while, but it “sort of fizzled out,” Ramey said, probably because it was eventually stamped out in poultry operations. But this one continues to be maintained in the wild, as evidenced by monitoring in Western Alaska, a place far from any big farms raising chickens or turkeys, he said. Gerlach gave the same assessment. “After the second year, that all of sudden disappeared,” he said of the 2014-15 version. “It didn’t stick around, where this virus seems like it’s sticking around.” Rather than winding down, it is continuing to spread across the world, he noted, even into bird populations in Antarctica, as has been recently documented. There are signs that it is now endemic in the wild, a fixed feature into the foreseeable future, he said. If so, “it’s not going to go away. It’s going to be here, and we have to have some way to deal with it,” he said. Alaska a disease crossroads For Alaska, “a mixing area” for global bird migrations, spread of avian diseases is always an issue, Gerlach said. “Alaska is a catchall area for birds from North America or the Americas, as well as from Asia,” he said. The highly pathogenic avian influenza of 2014 and 2015 was introduced from Asia to North America by wild birds migrating through Alaska. The current influenza is also crossing continents through Alaska, though from multiple directions, Ramey’s research has found. In a newly published study, Ramey and his research partners found what is likely to have been three separate and independent introductions of highly pathogenic avian influenza into Alaska last year. His research, with colleagues from the USGS and other agencies, used genetic analysis to trace one form of influenza to North America and two to Asia. “To have three introductions in Western Alaska, two from East Asia and one from the Lower 48, I mean, we haven’t seen anything like that before,” he said. “It really, I think, exemplifies how these viruses now are clearly able to be maintained.” That study examined birds harvested in the fall of 2022 by hunters in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge area at the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Ramey and his colleagues found only a tiny number of hunted birds that were infected with the currently active highly pathogenic influenza virus: out of 811 swab samples taken directly from birds and another 199 samples from feces, the only harvested birds identified as infected were eight pintails, one cackling goose and one widgeon. It can take months to get test results from samples, so what happened to those harvested birds is unknown, he said. But their meat was safe to eat as long as it was properly cooked to the recommended 165 degrees, he said. “Heat is remarkably good at deactivating viruses,” he said. Along with the cooking advice, there are other longstanding recommendations about safely handling hunted birds, such as regular handwashing and avoidance of obviously sick animals. There is little evidence that the current avian influenza wave poses an infection risk to humans. Only a few cases have been documented in the world, and those were general among people working with poultry. For Alaskans dependent on wild game, this highly pathogenic influenza poses a different type of risk: possible food-security problems. If large numbers of birds wind up dying, that might mean less food on the table in rural Alaska, Ramey and Gerlach said. “Obviously, less birds could equate to less availability, and also less resiliency in the population from things like disease, or climate change, or toxins, et cetera, that could in fact, impact these populations of birds,” Ramey said. Plenty of stressors already exist in wild populations, he said, “so adding another threat to these populations isn’t doing them any favors.” Alaska Beacon is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

It indicates that abnormal expression of miRNAs plays a crucial role in the regulation of cross-species IAVs infection, which lays a solid foundation for further exploration of the molecular regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in IAVs cross-species infection and anti-influenza virus targets. IntroductionInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) are single and negatively stranded with rapid and frequent mutation and recombination rates, resulting in the emergence of new subtypes with unpredictable pathogenicity and transmissibility [1]. In general, IAVs have the characteristics of species-specific, however, some viruses of certain species can spread to humans across species and genera. IAVs cause approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide every year, in addition, cross-species influenza viruses from poultry and pigs have caused many deaths, posing a serious threat to human health [2,3,4,5]. Pigs are considered as intermediate hosts and “mixing vessels” for influenza viruses, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (pdm/09) was generated by multiple recombination of swine, human, and avian influenza viruses, infecting not only humans but also pigs, and became part of the swine influenza viruses (SIVs) gene pool after further recombination with other SIVs gene fragments [6, 7]. The SIV strain SW2783 we selected not only has a recombinant pdm/09-M gene, but also is highly related to the gene sequence of the H3N2 triple recombinant virus (TRV) strain (Vietnam/302/11) isolated from a Vietnamese girl with influenza [8]. In addition, previous research showed that SW2783 had the ability to infect human lung tissue in vitro and replicate and multiply in tree shrews to cause lesions without adaptation, spread between tree shrews and from tree shrews to guinea pigs, and stimulate better innate and adaptive immune responses [9]. It suggests that SW2783 has the potential to infect humans. Due to the widespread presence of pigs as natural hosts, SW2783 may have higher transmissibility and fatality rates if it is further recombined with other IAVs in pigs to create new subtypes, putting the risk of re-outbreak of this subtype of IAVs at any time. In addition, owing to the frequent occurrence of antigen drift and transfer as well as the continuous emergence of drug-resistant strains, it is particularly important to quickly explore the pathogenesis and develop more effective methods for prevention and treatment.The establishment of experimental animal models is extremely important for studying viral transmission, infection, pathogenesis, and immune responses of the host [10]. A variety of animal models have been developed for IAVs, including mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, and non-human primates (such as macaques), each with their own advantages and disadvantages [11]. The animal model selected in this study is tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), which has genetically closer to humans than rodents in terms of genetic relationships and phylogenetic development, and is often considered a lower primate. Sequencing of tree shrews genome has also confirmed that it has a high affinity with primates [12, 13]. It has been pointed out that tree shrews are very similar to humans in physiology, biochemistry and immune regulation, and lack of the important antiviral gene RIG-I, making them a suitable animal model for studying viruses infection. Study results showed that the distribution of IAVs sialic acid receptors of respiratory in tree shrews is analogous to that of humans and ferrets, and they would present various pathological changes and clinical symptoms after being infected with IAVs [14, 15]. In addition, they are small in size and reproduce under artificial conditions similar to those of rats, with a short cycle and lower cost than ferrets and non-human primates (such as macaques). Therefore, they have received extensive attention in the establishment of animal models for research on human diseases and virus infection [16, 17]. So far, several studies both domestically and internationally have used tree shrews as animal models of different types of influenza viruses infection, suggesting that they are more susceptible to infection and can show clinical symptoms similar to humans, which can provide a scientific animal model for studying the infection mechanism and prevention and treatment of influenza viruses [9, 18].MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNA of 21-22nt, which are known to be post-transcriptional regulators of animals, plants and some viruses. Studies have shown that a single miRNA can exert extensive and significant influences on physiological and pathological processes of the body, and alterations in its function can lead to biological dysfunction and diseases [19]. Researches on dysregulated miRNAs plays a key role in the progression of various diseases, such as aging, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer and viral infections such as HPV and HIV, which has opened new avenues for research on anti-influenza virus targets [20, 21]. In recent years, many studies have reported that the miRNAs regulatory networks constructed by the hosts and viruses are indispensable in the process of viruses infection and transmission, and the miRNAs expression profiles of the host changes after IAVs infection, which plays a role in inhibiting the replication and transcription of the influenza viruses through specific combinations with virus genes and regulating the antiviral immune response [22, 23]. Therefore, it is of great significance to begin with miRNAs that play a special regulatory role in the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of influenza viruses infection.The previous research have observed the histopathology of tree shrews infected with SW2783, and found that it mainly caused upper respiratory turbinate tissue infection [9]. Therefore, in this study, we conducted global miRNA and mRNA expression profiles analysis on turbinate tissue cells of tree shrews infected with the newly emerged swine influenza A virus SW2783 and explored the similarities and differences of miRNAs molecular regulation mechanisms at three different time points (3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi)). We screened miRNAs involved in influenza viruses replication and immune response regulation and used real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine whether the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was consistent with the sequencing results. It not only provides differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and mRNAs (DEGs) after infection but also provides detailed miRNAs regulatory networks, targeted genes, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encylopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, which provide new insights into the anti-IAVs mechanism. The selected miRNAs are the prelude to the biological progress of tree shrews infected with IAVs, and the use of tree shrews as model animals for the study of human influenza viruses infection provides a basis for further study of the role of miRNAs in IAVs infection and can provide a reference for the study of broad-spectrum antiviral targets to guide the prevention and control of influenza pandemics.Materials and methodsVirus strains, animals and cellsThe virus used in this study was a newly emerged H3N2 subtype of swine influenza virus A/swine/Guangxi/NS2783/2010 (H3N2) (abbreviation: SW2783), with its genome integrated with the gene fragment of the 2009 new H1N1 pandemic virus (pdm/09), which was preserved in our laboratory. Healthy adult tree shrews of the West Yunnan Asian species were purchased from the Department of Experimental Zoology of Kunming Medical University. Animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the animal protection and use system and rules of the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Guangxi Medical University. Approval Code: 202008013, Approval Date: 2020.08.13. 293T and MDCK cells lines were purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China), grown in DMEM(Gibco), supplemented with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Liquid (100×) (Solarbio) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco).Virus infected tree shrews and total RNA extractionTwelve tree shrews were isolated for one week and then took nasopharyngeal swabs and inoculate them with chicken embryos and MDCK for hemagglutination (HA) test to detect the presence of IAVs infection. Blood samples collected from the tail vein were taken for centrifugation and sera were collected for the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test to ensure that there were no IAVs antibodies in the test animals. Tree shrews were randomly divided into two groups: nine in the SW2783 group (three in each of the 3, 5 and 7 dpi groups) and three in the negative control (NC) group; 3% pentobarbital sodium was intraperitoneally injected according to the weight ratio (0.2 mL/100 g) for anaesthesia. The virus solution, diluted with PBS to 105 TCID50/mL was used for infection experiments through the nose, eyes, and pharyngeal tonsils. Each tree shrew was inoculated with 250 μL of virus diluent, 200 μL into the nasal cavity (100 μLasal cavity), 20 μL into the eye conjunctiva (10 μL/eye), 30 μL into the tonsils (15 μLonsil). The NC group was given 250 μL PBS and the dosage was the same as that in the experimental group. The turbinate tissues of tree shrews were collected aseptically and divided into two parts, which were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for several hours and then stored at − 80 °C. One part was used for RNA extraction and determination of relevant immune molecules, and the other part was analysed by high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq).Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol. Chloroform was added to extract the upper aqueous phase after homogenising the tissue samples, and RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and 75% ethanol. After drying, 50 μL RNase-free water was added to dissolve the RNA in a water bath, and the RNA was quantified using NanoDrop and stored at − 80 °C.miRNA sequencing and expression profiling analysismiRNA sequencing was performed using BGISEQ-500 by BGI Wuhan, and SOAPnuke which was developed independently by BGI, was used for filtering. Next, AASRA was used to compare the clean tags with the reference genome sequence of the species to determine the location of the fragments originating from the genome. Finally, the miRNAs were quantified and the output result was an expression matrix with a count value. Differential analysis of miRNAs was performed using the DESeq2 package in R, with screening conditions Fold Change ≥ 2 and Adjust P-value ≤ 0.05. The DEMs were displayed in a volcano map and clustered in a heat map. The target genes of the DEMs were predicted using RNAhybrid and miRanda software, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of them were performed using the clusterProfiler package based on the hypergeometric distribution in R.mRNA sequencing and expression profiling analysismRNA sequencing was also performed by BGI. After sequencing and filtering, HISAT2 was used to compare clean reads with the reference genome sequence of the species to determine the location of the genome from which the fragments originated. Gene expression was calculated using the expected fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments sequenced (FPKM) method. The method of differential analysis of genes was the same as that of miRNA. Cluster analysis, enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG, and KEGG orthology (KO) analyses were performed on DEGs.Cross-linking analysis of miRNA and mRNAVenn Diagram is a graph that uses a closed curve to visually represent a set and its relationship. It is often used to show the mathematical or logical connection between different groups of things (sets), and the data from different groups in the experiment are intersected, and the research direction is selected through the information of different data intersection [24]. First, the Venn Diagram package was used to analyze DEMs and DEGs in the 3, 5 and 7 dpi groups to verify whether miRNA regulatory gene expression was timeliness after IAVs infection. The intersection of the target genes predicted by DEMs and DEGs was determined using R. Next, the gene database of tree shrews was downloaded using the AnnotationHub package in R to screen for miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs related to viral replication and immune regulation after SW2783 infection. Finally, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network was mapped using Cytoscape.Detection of DEMs and DEGs by RT-qRCRTo validate the high-throughput sequencing results, three miRNAs and three mRNAs were selected for the RT-qPCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the NC group and the three experimental groups with different infection times and then reverse transcribed to synthesise cDNA. RT-qPCR primers were designed by NCBI primer blast and synthesised by Sangon Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. RT-qPCR was performed using ABI 7500 fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument and the reaction mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 30 s in 384-well optical plates (Roche, Swiss), followed by 40 cycles of incubation at 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the relative expression was calculated using 2−△△Ct [25].Cell culture, transfection and relationship validationIn order to confirm the targeted regulatory relationship between the screened miRNAs and mRNAs, the simple random sampling method was used to select two miRNAs and seven target genes from the interaction networks with random numbers generated in Microsoft Excel. Specific miRNA mimics and mimics NC were synthesized by GenePharma Shanghai, and 293 T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 3,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then RT-qPCR was performed to detect miRNA and mRNA expression according to the same method mentioned above, and U6 and β-actin were selected as internal parameters of miRNA and mRNA. The used primers were listed in Table 1.Table 1 Primers used for RT-qPCRFull size tableLuciferase reporter assayLTF wild-type sequences containing miR-324-3p binding site and mutant sequence without miR-324-3p binding site were cloned into GP-miRGLO vectors to construct wild-type reporter vectors (WT) and mutant reporter vectors (MUT), which were completed by GenePharma Shanghai. Then, miR-324-3p mimics, miR-NC and GP-miRGLO were co-transfected into 293 T cells by Lipofectamine™ 3000. 48 h later, the cells were split on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged. Dual-Glo Reporter Assay System (Promega) was used to analyze luciferase activity based on the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of firefly luciferase was normalized to that of renilla luciferase.Statistical analysisData were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least four independent experiments. SPSS 21.0 software was used for statistical analyses. One-way ANOVA analysis for multiple groups, and the difference between the two groups was determined to be statistically significant at a value of P < 0.05.ResultsExpression spectrum analysisIn order to explore the changes of gene expression in viral infection and immune response regulation in tree shrews infected with the newly emerging swine influenza A virus SW2783, all miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in turbinate tissue cells in 3, 5 and 7 dpi groups were compared with those in the NC group. DEMs and DEGs were selected under a Fold Change ≥ 2 and Adjust P value ≤ 0.05.The expression of miRNAs in the infected groups were compared with that in the NC group, and a total of 40, 60 and 53 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the 3 dpi (12 upregulated and 28 down regulated), 5 dpi (25 upregulated and 35 down regulated), and 7 dpi (21 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated) groups, respectively, as shown in Table 2. The expressions of DEMs are plotted as bars in Fig. 1a. More down-regulated miRNAs were detected in the three experimental groups, indicating that the changes in miRNA expression were mainly down-regulated after IAVs infection. A volcano diagram was used to display the expression of the miRNAs that met the screening criteria (Fig. 1b). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the DEMs. The expression trend of the same miRNA at different time points of infection in different tree shrews was basically the same, but the expression levels were different, as shown in the heat map in Fig. 1c.Table 2 Number of DEMs and DEGsFull size tableFig. 1miRNAs expression profiles of SW2783 infected and NC groups. a Expression of DEMs. b Volcano map of DEMs, gray is the gene with non-significant difference, red and blue are the genes with significant difference (red represents up-regulated, blue represents down-regulated); the X-axis direction is the display of log2 Fold Change, and the Y-axis direction is − log10 (P adjust). c Hierarchical clustering Heatmap of DEMs, red represents upregulated, and blue represents downregulated.

Based on the volcano map and heat map (Fig. 2), the DEGs were more up-regulated in the 5 dpi and 7 dpi groups, and more down-regulated in 3 dpi the group. Among them, most DEGs were found in the 5 dpi group. Differences in genes expression were observed at different stages of viral infection.Fig. 2mRNAs expression profiles of SW2783 infected and NC groups. a Volcano map of DEGs, gray is the gene with non-significant difference, red and blue are the genes with significant difference (red represents up-regulated, blue represents down-regulated); The X-axis direction is the display of log2 Fold Change, and the Y-axis direction is − log10 (P adjust). b Hierarchical clustering Heatmap of DEGs, red represents upregulated and blue represents downregulated.

Among them, 24,226 target genes were predicted by two databases in 3 dpi VS NC, 42,181 in 5 dpi VS NC, and 37,956 in 7 dpi VS NC, as shown in Table 2. To elucidate the regulatory pathways and functions of DEMs in tree shrews during SW2783 infection, we cross-linked DEGs after viral infection with the target genes predicted by DEMs, and performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses (Fig. 4). The results showed that 321 terms were enriched in the 3 dpi group, 330 terms in the 5 dpi group, and 197 terms in the 7 dpi group, with the highest enrichment in the 5 dpi group. The GO terms enriched by DEGs were basically the same, but the number differed at different times. In the classification of biological process (BP), the GO terms enriched were mainly related to cellular processes, biological regulation, stimulus response, immune system processes, localisation, and organisation or biogenesis of cellular components, such as, GPD1, BATF2, IRF1, CXCL10, RSG4, NEU2, etc. In cellular component (CC), the terms enriched including cell membranes, organelles, extracellular regions, polymer complexes, membrane-sealed chambers, and cell junctions, such as, C1QC, GNG7, PSMB8, CTSC, KRT4, PDK4, etc. In molecular function (MF), the most frequent functional changes in virus-infected tissue were related to binding, signaling, molecular transduction activity, catalytic activity, molecular function regulation, and transport activity, such as, CXCL9, IL1B, NHLH1, OTX2, S100A2, etc. The enrichment of immune response, stimulus response, and biological regulation increased significantly in 5 dpi and 7 dpi groups; However, the enrichment of cell components or tissues, development, and other processes increased significantly in 3 dpi group, and began to decrease at 5 dpi group, and decreased significantly or did not occur again at 7 dpi group, indicating that the antiviral response and function of damage repair gradually subsided and returned to normal with the control of infection at this stage. The enrichment of functions related to molecular transduction and catalytic activity after viruses infection increased significantly in the 5 dpi group, and decreased to a level similar to that in the 3 dpi by the 7 dpi group. Combined with CC, it was suggested that the viral reproductive activity is reduced and the virulence is weakened at this stage in vivo.Fig. 3Venn Diagrams of target gene in two databases.

Among the pathways with the most significant post-infection enrichment, those related to the immune system, signal transduction, signal molecules and interactions, and viral infectious diseases were concentrated at various time points. These pathways were mainly involved in influenza virus infection and antiviral immunity; however, the number of major pathways and DEGs covered at different time points were different. The important pathways involved in the 3 dpi group mainly include haematopoietic cell lineage, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, IL-17, NF-κB and TNF signaling pathway. The altered genes inclusion of S100A9, IL6, CXCL8, CCL20, IL1B, CSF3 and TNFAIP3, indicating that in the early stage of infection, the host activates innate immune cells to produce immune effects and inflammatory responses in various ways, giving play to the role of early antiviral; In the 5 dpi group, the pathways included cell adhesion molecules, immune networks that produce IgA, haematopoietic cell lineages, antigen processing and presentation, Th17 cell differentiation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and phagosomes, such as, IL1B, CD14, IFIH1, CCL21, ICAM1, CD40, etc. At this time, the enrichment of DEGs in the above pathways increased significantly, indicating that the adaptive immune response was initiated and the functions of innate and adaptive immune cells were active, playing a strong antiviral role. In the 7 dpi group, the pathways included antigen processing and presentation, haematopoietic cell lineage, immune network-producing IgA, influenza A virus, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, and cell adhesion molecules, including MX1, ISG15, IRF7, CXCL10, OAS2, etc. By this time, the DEGs had gradually decreased, indicating that the adaptive immune response was the main response at this stage. Under proper immune regulation, the immune effect gradually weakens and recovers to a steady state, indicating that the host is in the stage of infection recovery. Further analysis showed that among the significantly enriched KEGG pathways related to the immune system, most of the DEGs were up-regulated, especially in the 5 dpi group, which involved the innate and adaptive immune pathways, indicating that the host immune system played an effective immune effect after virus infection. Notably, IL-17 and Th17 cell pathways were significantly enriched after tree shrews infected with SW2783, suggesting that they may play an important role in regulating SW2783 infection and inflammatory response.According to the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, the DEGs of SW2783 infection were analyzed and displayed in the IAV pathway (ko05164). The DEGs in any groups at the three time points after infection are shown in Fig. 5. It can be found that the DEGs are mainly concentrated in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which are consistent with the results of KEGG functional enrichment. These show that some miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression in the immune response through changes in expression after SW2783 infection, to stimulate the immune function of the body and maintain the balance of the body against viral infection.Fig. 5DEGs involved in the influenza A pathway (ko05164).

DEGs, differentially expressed genesFull size imageTimeliness analysisVenn Diagrams of DEMs and DEGs on different days after SW2783 infection was conducted (Fig. 6). The top ten genes with differential expression multiples in each group are shown in Table 3. Among these, seven miRNAs and 60 mRNAs were differentially expressed at all three time points after infection. Combined with functional analysis, S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, and other genes were consistently highly expressed under the regulation of upstream miRNAs, suggesting that these miRNAs and mRNAs have a continuous impact on the host during the stage of virus replication and activation of immune regulation after early viral infection. It was also found that the expression of these three genes was the highest in the 3 dpi group and lowest the in the 7 dpi group, showing that with the response of the body to the virus, the body tended to be stable and the expression of the effector genes gradually recovered. There were 11 miRNAs and 92 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in both 3 dpi and 5 dpi groups, Among them, miR-324-3p, miR-3120 and others play a regulatory role in the early replication stage after viral infection by regulating genes such as FOSB, BCL3 and TNFAIP3, and the up-regulation of IL1B and CSF3 stimulate the body to induce innate immune response to resist virus infection, moreover, the expression levels of these genes in the 3 dpi and 5 dpi groups were basically the same, and decreased to the corresponding level with the NC group in the 7 dpi group, indicating that the body exerted innate immune response at the 3rd and 5th days after infection, and this effect disappeared at the 7th day. In addition, IL-6 was differentially expressed only in the 3 dpi group and CCL5 only in the 5 dpi group, which played a role in the signal transduction of antigen presentation and mediating the transformation from innate immunity to adaptive immunity. The expression of IFIT3, CCL21 and CCL15 increased at the same time as C1QB and IRF1, which played an innate immune response at the 5th day, with significant differences, affecting pro-inflammatory and apoptotic cell pathways and mediating the adaptive immune response of the host; 12 miRNAs and 129 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both 5 dpi and 7 dpi groups, miR-31, miR-16b, miR-106b-3p and many miRNAs changed significantly, which regulated C1QC, SELE, IFIT2, LTF, CD28 and others stimulates the body to produce an adaptive immune response while maintaining a fixed immune function and jointly resisting viral infection. In addition, the expression of the above genes reached a peak in the 5 dpi group, and lower in the 7 dpi group, showing that the immune defense function of the body showed a downward trend, and the body was gradually stabilizing. The expression of many genes involved in innate immunity was down regulated from 5 to 7 dpi group, and there was no significant difference compared with the NC group; By comparing the 3 dpi and 7 dpi groups, it was found that miR-429-1, miR-143-3p-1, etc. were differentially expressed in both two groups, and they mainly regulated CALCRL, MYO3B, SP7 and others, which played a role in the regulation of transcription and signal transduction, which may be related to cross-species infection of SW2783. However, in addition to the high expression of some genes related to adaptive immune function in the 7 dpi group, the expression of HSPH1, other heat shock proteins, and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated to maintain the immune balance of the host. Differential expression was observed at different time points after SW2783 infection, indicating that there are different regulatory mechanisms at different stages of viral infection and the immune system, as well as the molecular regulatory mechanism of miRNA-mRNA after influenza virus infection is timeliness.Fig. 6Venn diagrams of DEMs and DEGs on different days after infection. 3d vs NC (red), 5d vs NC (blue), 7d vs NC (green).

Cytoscape was used to create network maps of differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA interactions in the 3, 5 and 7 dpi group. There were 408, 1781, and 519 interaction pairs in each group. Due to the expression of many miRNAs and mRNAs was observed to change after SW2783 infection, we selected those only related to replication, antiviral, and immune negative regulation. These miRNA-mRNA interactions may be closely related to many signaling pathways and biological functions during SW2783 infection. After screening, 133, 553, and 132 interaction pairs were found to play a regulatory role in the process of infection in the 3, 5 and 7 dpi groups, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7.Fig. 7miRNA-mRNA relationship pairs involved in the regulation of SW2783 infection. a 3d vs NC. b 5d vs NC. c 7d vs NC.

MYB, MUC5B, FOXN4, TFEC, and others were involved in viral replication and transcription. RSG4, IFIT2, IFIT3, TLR2, PSMB9, TNFAIP3, SOCS1, C1QB, C1QC, AZGP1, SIT1, and CXCL10 were involved in innate immune signaling pathways and CD2, CD38, CD48, CD74, IL2RB, NCF1, CSF3, LOC102498158, CCL21, IRF8, and SELE were involved in adaptive immunity. The expression of miR-106b-3p, miR-34a, and novel_mir214 was down-regulated, whereas that of miR-760-3p was up-regulated in the 7 dpi group. Their target genes, such as INSM1, LPP, FOXN4, TRIM22, CDYL2 and SP7, played a role in signal transduction during multiplication, the expression of SEMA7A, LOC102481956, LTF, CTSW, CD8A, C1QC, etc. are up-regulated to activate immune system, while the expression of IRF7, IFIT5, ISG20, etc. are down-regulated to play a negative regulatory role in immune response. The targeting relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs screened above is shown in Table 4.Table 4 Relationships between miRNAs and inversely correlated target genesFull size tablePreliminary verification of DEMs and DEGs by RT-qPCRThe miRNAs and mRNAs obtained by sequencing were verified using RT-qPCR to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the RNA-seq. We verified three miRNAs (miR-30a-3p, miR-324-3p, and miR-181e) and three mRNAs (S100A12, CD74, and MEF2B), respectively. And the results showed that the expression trends of the DEMs and DEGs in RT-qPCR were consistent with the sequencing results (Fig. 8), indicating that the RNA-seq results were accurate and reliable.Fig. 8RT-qPCR validation of selected DEMs and DEGs. DEMs, differentially expressed miRNAs; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; 3d, 3 days post infection; 5d, 5 days post infection; 7d, 7 days post infection; NC, negative controlFull size imageValidation of interaction networksTo validate the regulatory relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs expression in the interaction network, we investigated the effect of changes in the expression of two representative miRNAs (miR-324-3p and miR-449b) of tree shrews infected with SW2783 on the expression levels of their target genes (miR-324-3p: LTF, CD6, SELE, TNFAIP2; miR-449b: RND2, RRM2, CAMP1, KIF1A). We designed and transfected two specific miRNA mimics into 293 T cells to enhance miRNA expression, and then detected the expression of miRNA and their target genes by RT-qPCR. The results showed that miR-324-3p and miR-449b were significantly upregulated after transfection, and each target gene had varying degrees of decreased expression in the transfection group, with statistical significance compared with the NC group (P < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 9b. The results indicated that there was a targeted negative regulatory relationship between screened miRNAs and mRNAs by differential and functional analysis. Based on the above results, luciferase reporter assay was continued to verify the targeting relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs in the network, and miR-324-3p and LTF were selected to prove the existence of miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis during viral infection. Firstly, the binding sites of miR-324-3p and LTF were identified (Fig. 9c). After co-transfection with miR-324-3p mimics and WT plasmids, the luciferase activity was significantly inhibited, decreased by about 50%, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 9d. The results showed that there was a direct targeting relationship between miR-324-3p and LTF, which verified the accuracy of the above target gene prediction and the construction of the virus-related miRNA-mRNA interaction network, indicating that the expression of target genes could be regulated by adjusting the screened miRNAs, forming the miRNA–mRNA regulatory axis to play the role of antiviral infection.Fig. 9Verification of interaction networks. a The transfection efficiency was observed by fluorescence microscopy. b Expression levels changes after miRNA mimics transfection.

MiRNAs play an indispensable role in the regulation of biological activities in nature. Their regulation is usually not isolated, but constitutes a regulatory network through a coordinated mechanism, and a miRNA can simultaneously target multiple genes located in the same signaling pathway, which is widely used in clinical medicine [27,28,29]. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that some miRNAs can inhibit IAVs replication and exert antiviral effects by targeting the expression of PB1, PB2, M1, NA, and other viral genes in the host [30]; There are also miR-20a-5p and miR-29c to resist the invasion of influenza virus by regulating immune-related genes, such as cytokines and chemokines, or enhancing the ability of presenting disease antigens [31,32,33]. However, there are relatively few studies aimed at studying the effect of miRNAs on influenza virus cross-species infection by regulating the signal pathway through target genes expression. Therefore, strengthening the study of miRNAs expression and its possible regulatory signaling pathway in the immune system after IAVs infection is of great significance for influenza virus prevention and treatment, new targets for vaccine research and cross-species infection prediction.Our preliminary study indicate that tree shrews can better simulate the pathogenicity, transmissibility and immunity of human influenza virus infection, and are suitable mammalian models for studying the pathogenicity and cross-species transmission of IAVs. The results showed that the newly emerged SIV SW2783 can infect tree shrews and cause discomfort, and has strong infectivity and replication activity in the respiratory tract tissue of tree shrews, mainly causing self-limited upper respiratory tract infection in turbinate tissue [9]. Consistent with the viral replication symptoms and clinical symptoms phenotype, with the enhancement of viral replication, the host initiates the corresponding natural immune response, which plays an important role in antiviral activity [9]. Therefore, in this study, tree shrews were selected as the animal model of newly emerged SIV infection, the turbinate tissues were sequenced, and the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were comprehensively analyzed at 3, 5 and 7 dpi with the NC group, so as to explore the characteristics of miRNAs and mRNAs changes in respiratory tissue cells of cross-species infected tree shrews at different time points. To investigate whether there are specific DEMs that play a key role in the process of cross-species infection and host interaction of the influenza virus, analyzing and predicting the key regulated target genes and their possible mechanisms of action through bioinformatics software, and preliminarily verifying the accuracy of the analysis.The gradual adaptation of IAVs to the host and its ability to continuously break through species barriers, including the ability to bind to and enter host cells, replicate within host cells, evade host limiting factors and innate immune responses, and spread between host individuals, are key to their ability to obtain cross-species transmission and cause a new host pandemic. The ability of virus replication and immune escape is particularly important in the process of cross-species transmission. Therefore, based on the previous successful establishment of a model of cross-species infection of low pathogenic animal IAVs in human respiratory tract tissues and tree shrews without adapted, this study intended to conduct integrated analysis of expression profiles in turbinate tissues of tree shrews infected with SW2783. Through integrated analysis of sequencing results, a total of 40, 60, and 53 DEMs, 372, 850, and 425 DEGs were selected in the 3, 5, and 7 dpi groups, respectively. In addition, 408, 1781 and 519 miRNA–mRNA interaction pairs were constructed at three groups by bioinformatics tools prediction and analysis, among which 133, 553 and 132 may play a regulatory role in SW2783 infection of tree shrews. Combined with functional analysis, miR-760-3p, miR-449b, miR-30e-3p and miR-429 may play an important role in the regulation of viral replication; miR-324-3p, miR-1301, miR-103-1, miR-134-5p, miR-29a, miR-31, miR-16b, miR-34a, and miR-125b may regulate the immune system to defend against virus infection; It is speculated that miR-106b-3p may be related to the cross-species infection potential of SW2783.We have reviewed a large number of relevant literatures, and most of the results show that the changes in miRNAs are different after IAVs infection, which may be species-specific, but the regulated target genes are partially similar. For example, in studies on infection with IAV in rhesus monkeys, chickens, and swine, the same miRNAs as ours were not found, but some target genes such as TNFAIP2, STAT3, FOSB, etc. were altered, mainly regulating inflammation, immune response, as well as MAPK, NF-κB anti-virus signaling pathways, similar to the results of our study [31, 34,35,36]. In addition, homologous IAVs were used in the study of chickens and swine, which is different from the cross-species infection in this study. Interestingly, in our previous study of cross-species infection of MDCK and human A549 cells with SIVs, no similar miRNA changes were observed. However, the changes in genes such as CXCL10, MX2, and IFIT2 were the same. It suggests that although miRNA changes are different, they may exert antiviral effects by regulating the expression of the same genes [2, 4]; In addition, in a study of microarray analysis after human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) infection with human IAVs of H3N2 subtype, although identical DEMs were not found, more DEGs, such as IRF7, STAT1, CXCL10, and IL6, were found mainly triggered inflammatory reactions and innate immune responses in the transmission of signals such as interferon, JAK-STAT, and Toll like receptors, similar to the changes observed in our experiment [37]. The nasal turbinate tissue and hNECs are both from the upper respiratory tract, which makes the results more comparable. At the same time, it also indicates that the genome of tree shrews has high similarity to that of humans, making it a better animal model for studying influenza virus infection. These cases lead us to speculate that the possible reasons for different DEMs are differences in virus sources, whether cross-species infections, in vitro and in vivo experiments, different tissues or cells of the respiratory tract, analysis methods, and other aspects. However, the most critical factor may be that there are species differences among the experimental models, so the function of the miRNAs screened in this study to regulate influenza virus may be specific to tree shrews.The outcome of IAVs infection depends on complex interactions between the hosts, viruses, and environmental factors [38]. The miRNA expression profiles of the host changed significantly after the IAVs infection. Previous research has shown that miRNA affects IAVs infection mainly through two ways: limiting virus replication and regulating immune response [37, 39,40,41,42,43]. Analysis of the expression profiles in our study revealed that miR-449a and miR-449b were highly expressed at the early stage of infection, whereas the expression of their target genes L1CAM, MYO3B, SCIN, and STMN1 decreased. MiR-449b has been proven to be a regulator of histone deacetylase 1 and interferon beta in IAVs infection [44]. Existing studies have shown that STMN1 plays an important role in viruses infection, and low expression of STMN1 inhibits dengue viruses replication [45, 46]; In addition, miR-760-3p regulates decreased expression of MEF2B and CDC25B. Some researchers have also verified the reduced replication of IAVs in CDC25B-knockout cells [47]. Combined with the results of these two studies, it is speculated that the increased expression of miR-760-3p and miR-449b may restrict the replication of SW2783 cross-species infection. Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins play an important role in the antiviral process. The results of this study found that the expression of TRIM22 increased under the regulation of miR-30e-3p. Functional analysis revealed that it was enriched in transcriptional regulation, signal transduction and immune regulatory-related pathways to play an antiviral role by inhibiting the transcription and replication of viruses at the early stage of infection. In line with previous studies by Isabel Pagani, TRIM22 has a limiting effect on the replication of different DNA and RNA viruses, especially in IAVs, controlling the transcription of viral genes, and TRIM22 has a pre-existing intracellular defense against IAVs infection in cells from the respiratory tract [48, 49]. In addition, it has been proven that miR-30e-3p inhibits the replication of influenza B virus by targeting virus NA and NP genes [40]. Therefore, through screening and analysis of the above expression profiles, miR-449b, miR-760-3p and miR-30e-3p may inhibit the transcription and translation of viral genes to prevent viral reproduction through the regulation of signal transduction in the early stage of SW2783 infection. It is speculated that the regulation mechanism of transcriptional signals may be related to the cross-species infective potential of SW2783 and have the potential to become the prevention targets of animal influenza viruses cross-species infected humans.The innate immune system is the first defense barrier against exogenous microbial infection. It is rapidly activated by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect infection. And then stimulate and activate a series of signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and IRF, induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon (IFN-α/β), and activate IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to produce a variety of antiviral proteins [50]. The screened miRNAs involved in the pattern recognition and downstream signaling pathways of influenza viruses infection are shown in Fig. 10. KEGG analysis showed that multiple signaling pathways of innate immunity were significantly enriched after IAVs infection, including NF-κB, chemokine, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Among them, miR-184, miR-324-3p, miR-16b, miR-125b, miR-155, miR-29a, and miR-31 were down-regulated, and significantly increased IFIH1, TLR2, and NLRC5. Recognizing the viruses and activating a series of signaling pathways play important roles in anti-influenza immune regulation, suggesting that these three types of PRRs signaling pathways are indispensable in tree shrews' resistance to SW2783 infection. It has been confirmed that miR-155 can target the expression of toll-like receptors and is extremely sensitive to tumor necrosis factor and interferon, which confirms the reliability of our results [51]. Therefore, in the prevention and treatment of IAVs, the expression of three PRRs can be promoted by regulating the expression of miRNAs, so as to identify the invading virus more sensitively to activate the immune response. In the analysis of the NF-κB signaling pathway, it was found that the up-regulated expression of miR-29c and miR-21-5p inhibited the expression of IκB, thus increasing the activity of the NF-κB signaling pathway, producing a variety of interleukins and tumor necrosis factors, and causing inflammatory effects to kill the influenza viruses. Studies have shown that miR-29c can reduce the activity of NF-κB and express TNF-α, INF-β, IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8 through ubiquitinase A20 [52]. In addition, miR-3120 and miR-125b-3 were found in the interferon receptor signaling pathway to affect the expression of STAT and IRF, promoting the expression of cytokines, such as interleukins and chemokines, and increasing the body's killing effect on viruses. IRF5 can regulate the production of IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL5 after H1N1 infection, which lays the foundation for the inference of our results [53]. After influenza virus infection, the influence of DEMs and DEGs on a variety of signaling pathways was explored to provide scientific basis for further discussion of the prevention and control mechanism of influenza virus infection, evaluation of the effect of intervention strategies, and prediction of cross-species transmission potential.Fig. 10The pattern recognition and downstream signal pathway of influenza virus infection regulated by miRNA. Solid arrows indicate direct effects and dotted arrows indicate indirect effects. *Indicates that the miRNA has been reported to be involved in IAVs regulation [54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61]. The unlabeled miRNAs were selected in this studyFull size imageOn the other hand, miRNAs can also activate innate immune cells and regulate the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T and B cells in adaptive immune by affecting the expression of certain cytokines after IAVs infection, playing an important antiviral role [62]. In this study, miR-1301, miR-143-3p-1, miR-103b, and other miRNAs were down-regulated in the 3d group, and their targeted regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFAIP2 was up-regulated to varying degrees. A large number of DEMs were added in the 5d group, such as miR-134-5p-1, miR-103-1, miR-125b, miR-324-3p, miR-193a, miR-16b, novel_mir214, and novel_mir128. Regulating various transcription factors, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory factors were significantly up-regulated, which are of great significance in innate and adaptive immune responses after IAVs infection. Differential expression of these miRNAs plays an important role in the cross-species transmission of SW2783. Simultaneously, miR-301a-CXCL8, miR-134-5p-CXCL10, miR-324-3p-CCL20, and miR-23b-3p-2-CCL15 regulate the expression of chemokines and promote migration, recruitment, differentiation, and activation of various innate and adaptive immune cells, which are indispensable for immune response [63,64,65]. The expression of most antiviral and inflammation-related miRNA–mRNAs in our study was also similar to the transcriptomic study by Tan, which used human influenza virus H3N2 to infect hNECs. The results showed that the nasal epithelial response was strongly inclined to the type I inflammatory response after viral infection. The JAK-STAT-mediated type I inflammatory response was activated by triggering the innate and adaptive immune activating cytokines IL-6, CXCL10, and IFNλs, which were similar to the results of our study, and the tree shrew turbinate tissue cells selected made the results more comparable [37].To determine the changes in miRNAs expression at different stages after infection and the role of the regulatory mechanism by observing the differential expression in different time groups, which could provide a new target for precise regulation of influenza virus infection. In this study, we observed changes in miRNAs over time at 3, 5 and 7 days after tree shrews infected with SW2783. 7 miRNAs, including miR-429, miR-126-3p, and others, were highly expressed at the three time points after infection. By regulating the expression of CALCRL, MYO3B, DNASE1, FGF20, and other genes, they can inhibit intercellular signal transduction, transcription and replication processes to resist virus invasion and cell apoptosis after infection, and exert the immune response effect of interferon effector genes such as MX1, IFIT2, and CCL15. miR-324-3p showed significantly lower expression in the 3 dpi and 5 dpi groups, and the change in expression was not statistically significant in the 7 dpi group. Based on interaction analysis, miR-324-3p mainly regulated FOSB, MX1, and IFIH1, which can inhibit transcription and replication in the early stages of viral infection, and stimulate to produce the innate immune response. With the control of the infection on 7th day, the replication of the virus was reduced, and the innate immune function gradually faded back to normal. It has been indicated that miR-324-3p can regulate the expression of TRIM27 to reduce viral replication during infection, and TRIM27 is a negative regulator of IFN-α/β to induce antiviral immune response [66, 67]. The expression of miR-16b and miR-15a in the 3 dpi group were similar to those in the NC group, and began to be significantly down-regulated from 5 to 7th days. They regulated IFIT2, IFIT3, SELE, CXCR3, C1QC, and other genes to exert adaptive immune functions. The chemokine CXCL10 and interferon regulatory factors, such as IFIT2, ISG20, and IRF7, were down-expressed in the 7 dpi group under the condition of high expression of miR-126-3p and miR-760-3p, which changed from higher to lower than the control or no difference in the 5 dpi group. It could be that the response state of the body is relatively stable after 7 days, and the immune response is reduced to maintain the physiological balance of the body. Interestingly, although the expression of type I interferon (IFN-α/β) was not up-regulated on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days after infection, some miRNAs were down-regulated on the 5th day, including miR-16b, miR-324-3p, miR-124a-1 and miR-31, etc. ISGs expression was significantly up-regulated, including IFIT2, IFIT3, RSAD2, Mx1, CSF3, and LTF, suggesting that the IFN-α/β production pathway was activated and ISGs protein production was induced by above miRNAs. The results of our study were similar to those of Pont, who observed the infection of swine influenza virus H1N1 subtype in pig lung tissue and speculated that the reason might be that the induction of IFN-α/β occurred earlier than the 3rd day [68]. In summary, the expression profiles of miRNAs changes over time after IAVs infection, and they regulate downstream target genes changes over time and play different regulatory roles at different periods after infection. Therefore, the screening of miRNAs with different effects in different periods can lay a theoretical foundation for the research and development of influenza virus vaccines and drugs.Because there are numerous subtypes of IAVs in nature and their high susceptibility to mutation, when a variety of IAVs are mixed with infection, genetic recombination occurs, resulting in increased virulence of the viruses and changes in the infected hosts, thus giving some IAVs the ability to infect cross-species. Some IAVs can overcome the species barrier and jump directly to humans under certain conditions [69]. Humans can be infected with avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2, H5N8, and H10N3, etc., and with SIVs H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, etc. have been reported recently [70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77]. Therefore, the exploration of miRNAs that can interfere with cross-species transmission is of great practical significance for dealing with the threat of animal-derived influenza to humans. In this study, the emerging H3N2 strain SW2783, which recombination internal gene fragment of pdm/09 H1N1 had previously been verified to have cross-species infection potential, was selected for the integrated analysis of miRNA–mRNA after SIV cross-species infection. The results showed that the newly emerged SW2783 could not only infect tree shrews and cause tissue lesions, but also directly spread from tree shrews to guinea pigs across the species barrier [9], and could infect human lung tissue in vitro without adaptation (unpublished data). Through the integrated analysis of miRNA-mRNA expression profiles, it was found that the expression of FOXN4, MUC4, KLK1 and CD163 were up-regulated under the action of miR-106b-3p after infection. GO and KEGG functional analyses revealed that these DEGs mainly played the functions of transcriptional regulation and cell matrix attachment. FOXN4, a member of the forkhead box/winged-helix transcription factor superfamily, is an important transcriptional regulatory gene and significantly overexpressed in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), promoting EBVs replication and cells tumorigenesis [78]; KLK1 is a widely distributed serine protease, and it has been shown that the levels of KLK1 increased, in the lungs ofmice during influenza virus infection. KLK1 cleaved H1, H2, and H3 HA molecules and consequently enhanced viral production [79]; CD163 is the most important and critical molecule in the life cycle of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which is responsible for mediating virus uncoating and genome release, so by up regating the expression of CD163, it promotes the replication of the viruses in the cells and thus increases the efficacy of infection [80]. MiR-106b-3p, as regulatory factors of the above mRNAs, decreased after infection, and combined with the these genes can promote viral replication to enhance infectibility, it was speculated that miR-106b-3p might be related to the cross-species infection potential of SW2783. However, there are few relevant studies on miR-106b-3p in influenza viruses, so further researches are needed to determine whether they are related to the cross-species infection potential of IAVs. In a study by Gao [4], SW2783, the same SIV as in this study, was selected to cross-species infect human A549 cells. 24 h after infection, miRNAs such as miR-21-5p and miR-29b-1-5p were under-expressed, and genes expression such as SCARB2, TRIM27 and RPS28 were up-regulated. Through functional analysis, it was found that they were mainly enriched in viral transcription, signal transduction, metabolism and others, which proved the potential of cross-species infection of SW2783. The functional analysis results of the above genes were similar to those of this study, suggesting that the expression changes of miR-106b-3p may also be related to the cross-species infection of IAVs. However, the above DEMs and DEGs could not be found in our study, which may be caused by the different establishment of the experimental models and time nodes. Nevertheless, these results were consistent with the cross-species infection ability of SW2783 previously confirmed.ConclusionsIn conclusion the upper respiratory tract is the first portal invaded by the influenza virus and is the main site of virus replication. It is also the origin of the host antiviral response to IAVs infection and pathological injury. In this study, the miRNAs and mRNAs expression profiles were comprehensively analyzed at 3rd, 5th and 7th days after infection with the NC group using RNA-seq, after the new SIV SW2783 was infected with the turbinate tissue of tree shrews. It was observed that miR-760-3p, miR-449b, miR-30e-3p, and miR-429 were significantly differentially expressed, and combined with functional analysis and interaction networks, it was speculated that these miRNAs might inhibit influenza virus replication in cells through signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. miR-324-3p, miR-1301, miR-103-1, miR-134-5p, miR-29a, miR-31, miR-16b, miR-34a, and miR-125b were low expression, and the analysis of their predicted target genes suggested that they were involved in the prevention of IAVs infection by regulating the expression of mRNAs related to immune signaling pathways. In addition, it is speculated that miR-106b-3p may be related to the cross-species infection potential of SW2783. The differential expression of the above miRNAs may affect viral replication and antiviral immunity in the cross-species transmission of SW2783 and the expression level changes with time of infection. Their abnormal expression may promote viral replication and immune escape, which is speculated to be of great significance in the cross-species transmission of SW2783. Although it remains to be determined whether these miRNAs play a role in regulating the immune response during IAVs infection, this study lays a foundation for the study of the molecular regulatory mechanism of miRNAs during IAVs infection and provides a valuable candidate biomarker for the intervention or control of influenza virus outbreaks in the population.

Updated: Jan. 4, 2024] The new year has brought a surge in flu and COVID-19 cases at a time when experts are monitoring both viruses, as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). All three illnesses have swept through the United States during the past several winters, causing severe illness in vulnerable people and overwhelming hospitals with pediatric and adult patients. This year, flu is on the rise in most parts of the country, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report. COVID cases and hospitalizations have also been ticking upward. The good news is that, for the first time, there are better tools to prevent—or minimize the effects of—these diseases. It’s not too late to get a flu shot or an updated COVID vaccine, and there are vaccines and a monoclonal antibody injection for those most vulnerable to RSV. How much they will help head off the threat of a so-called “tripledemic”—all three diseases hitting at once—is still difficult to say. “There are predictive models,” says Shana Gleeson, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist. “But we can’t say for sure how it's all going to play out.” One potential factor is how many people get the new shots, Dr. Gleeson explains. “Another is how much more likely these viruses will be to spread at a time when most people have stopped wearing masks and taking other precautions, such as avoiding crowded, enclosed spaces,” she says. Below, Yale Medicine experts tell you what you need to know to keep yourself and your family safe from influenza, COVID, and RSV.What is the difference between flu, COVID, and RSV?All three of these respiratory illnesses are caused by highly contagious viruses. They all cause cold-like symptoms, such as cough and runny nose. However, each has unique features, such as loss of taste or smell with COVID (although the latter symptom is reported to be less frequent than it was before the Omicron variant), and wheezing in children with RSV. While many people experience mild illness from these viruses, factors like age and general health put some at higher risk for hospitalization and death. In the case of COVID, even healthy young people have developed Long COVID, defined as signs, symptoms, and conditions that can continue for weeks, months, or years beyond the initial infection or develop later. Flu can come on fast and cause the entire body to ache within a couple of days. COVID symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, while RSV takes four to six days; in the latter two diseases, symptoms build slowly. If you get sick from any of these illnesses, it may be difficult to figure out which one you have, although a rapid home test may rule out COVID, and a doctor can provide laboratory tests for flu and RSV, if necessary.InfluenzaFlu is a common illness during the winter. But it can be severe, especially in children younger than age 5 and adults ages 65 and older, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems and chronic conditions, such as diabetes or asthma. It attacks the respiratory system, causing fever, body aches, cough, headache, and sore throat. How to prevent the flu: Get the annual flu shot, which is available to everyone ages 6 months and older. Although the CDC recommends getting the shot by the end of October for peak protection, it is given throughout the season, which usually peaks between December and February, and can extend until May. Most people ages 6 months and older need only one dose of the flu vaccine; however, some children, ages 6 months through 8 years, may require two doses for the best protection. “Some people will still get the flu after getting the vaccine,” Dr. Gleeson says. “But data suggests that if you do, the vaccine decreases the risk of severe disease and hospitalization. You might feel bad, but not as dramatically ill as you would have been if you didn't get the vaccine.” This year, special measures for flu vaccination are no longer recommended for people with egg allergies, regardless of the severity of a previous reaction to egg. This is based on studies that show those severe allergic reactions are rare, according to the CDC, which also recommends all vaccines be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly. People with allergies to other vaccine ingredients should talk to their providers. If you get the flu: The CDC recommends staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone. The fever should go away on its own without over-the-counter medication, according to the CDC. Also, children and teenagers should not take aspirin or products that contain salicylate to treat flu symptoms, since that ingredient can cause a rare condition called Reye’s syndrome in people 18 and younger. You can talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for an antiviral drug, such as Tamiflu, especially if you are 65 or older, pregnant, or have a medical condition such as asthma or heart disease. Children can take these medications as well. Antiviral drugs, including pills, inhaled powders, and solutions delivered intravenously, fight the flu virus in your body, and they work best when you start taking them early, one or two days after symptoms start. Antivirals can help reduce symptoms, shorten your illness by one or two days, and prevent pneumonia and other serious complications, including death.COVID-19COVID cases rates are rising. A particular concern is the recent emergence of new Omicron subvariants, including JN.1, which quickly rose to become the dominant variant in the U.S. over the last months of 2023. How to prevent COVID: Get one of the updated mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, or the updated shot from Novavax for ages 12 and older. These shots were made to protect against XBB.1.5, an Omicron subvariant that was circulating widely earlier this year, and they are expected to prevent infection and severe disease from descendants and relatives of the XBB strain that are circulating now, according to the CDC. The agency also states that existing COVID vaccines, tests, and treatments still work well against JN.1. If you get COVID: You should stay home for at least five days to avoid spreading it to others. Most people have mild illness and can recover at home with the help of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medicines if needed. Talk to your doctor about the three prescription-only antiviral medications if you have mild or moderate COVID and are at high risk for severe disease. (You are at higher risk if you have an underlying medical condition, such as asthma, cancer, or heart disease, or a weakened immune system. Risk also starts to rise with age, starting at age 50.) You must take these medications as soon as possible after noticing symptoms. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends three antiviral therapies in order of preference, starting with Paxlovid™ (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir), a pill for children and adults ages 12 and up. Paxlovid must be taken within the first five days after noticing symptoms. Pills can be prescribed by a health care provider or, in some cases, a pharmacist, and taken at home. Remdesivir (Veklury®), the second choice on the NIH list, is for use when Paxlovid is not available or clinically appropriate. It can help adults and children who are at least 28 days old or weigh at least 7 pounds and who may or may not be hospitalized. It must be taken within seven days of when symptoms start. Remdesivir is given intravenously at a health care facility for three consecutive days. The third option is molnupiravir (Lagevrio™), a pill for adults to be taken twice a day for five days starting as soon as possible within five days after symptoms begin. RSVRSV is a common winter virus that can cause a cold-like illness. Most healthy children older than age 2 and adults younger than age 60 will have a mild case of RSV that will get better in about a week. However, people 60 and older can develop lower respiratory tract disease from RSV, leading to inflammatory conditions such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Also at higher risk are premature infants, infants up to 12 months (especially those 6 months and younger), and children younger than 2 years with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, weakened immune systems, and/or neuromuscular disorders. Those groups are at risk for hospitalization and death from RSV, and there are no treatments beyond supportive care. How to prevent RSV: If you are eligible, get an RSV vaccine, which can prevent an infection from spreading to the lower respiratory tract. If you are 60 or older, you can choose between two new vaccines: Arexvy™, developed by GSK, or Abrysvo™, from Pfizer. You can decide whether an RSV vaccine is right for you based on “shared clinical decision-making,” according to the CDC, meaning you may receive a single dose based on discussions with your health care provider. The Abrysvo vaccine is administered to pregnant women to provide them with protective antibodies that will be passed on to their fetuses to protect their newborns for their first six months of life. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the vaccine for seasonal use in most parts of the country, meaning that it should be given to pregnant people who would reach 32 to 36 weeks of gestation—the point when the vaccine can be given—during the period of September to January to protect babies born between October and March, when the risk of RSV infection is traditionally highest. From February to August, parents of small children approaching their first RSV season should talk to their pediatricians about a new immunization, a monoclonal antibody called nirsevimab (brand name Beyfortus™). This is a shot for infants up to 8 months old, born during—or entering—their first RSV season, and for a small group during their second season if they are between 8 and 19 months old and at high risk for severe disease (including children who are severely immunocompromised). Most babies who have protection against RSV from the vaccine given to their mother while she was pregnant should not need further protection from the monoclonal antibody, according to the CDC. An older monoclonal antibody called Palivizumab (Synagis®) is also available. It’s given as intramuscular injections starting before the start of the RSV season, and then usually once a month throughout the season to infants and young children who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease based on gestational age and certain underlying medical conditions. If you get RSV: Stay home when you’re sick—people infected with RSV may be contagious for three to eight days. Most people will have mild symptoms and get better in a week or two. Supportive care includes drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and taking over-the-counter medications for discomfort and fever. Dehydration, ear pain, or trouble breathing may be signs of a secondary infection that could become serious enough to require hospitalization, which might include treatment with intravenous fluids, oxygen therapy, or mechanical ventilation. Should you get all three vaccinations (if eligible) at the same time?The CDC considers it safe to get the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time. Research is in progress to explore the effects of administering both vaccines in a single shot. But the RSV vaccines for older adults and pregnant women (who can pass the antibodies along to their newborns) are new, and there isn’t data at this time to say for sure whether giving those at the same time as the other two shots is the best strategy. People who get more than one vaccine in the same visit may experience more side effects, Dr. Gleeson explains. "You may notice increased side effects, such as fatigue, muscle aches, and soreness at the injection site, if you get them on the same day,” she says. “However, most side effects remain mild and are short-lived, even in people who get both vaccines at the same time.”What other steps can you take to avoid infections?While vaccines offer strong protection, they may not always protect against infection, so it’s wise to take additional precautions. For COVID, this may include keeping home tests on hand to use if you feel sick so you can avoid spreading the virus if you have it. You can order COVID-19 rapid tests for free from the government. Other strategies to prevent winter respiratory viruses, provided by the CDC, include: Practicing strategic masking, which means wearing well-fitting masks or respirators that cover your mouth and nose when people around you are coughing, sneezing, or talking—or whenever you feel it is appropriate. Improving indoor air quality by using air filters or opening windows.Using household cleaners that contain soap or detergent to remove dirt and germs from surfaces. Use a weaker bleach solution or EPA-sanitizing spray to sanitize surfaces or objects. Practicing hand hygiene. Staying away from people who are sick. The closer you are to a greater number of people, the more likely you are to be exposed to a respiratory virus. The CDC is monitoring all three diseases. If you want to know whether they are spreading in your area, you can check the CDC website for COVID-19 hospitalizations in your county, weekly flu maps, or RSV trends.Read more Yale Medicine newsRelated SpecialistsShana GleesonMDCherise RowanMDMarjorie GoldenMDMore Related SpecialistsRelated Fact SheetsMeaslesMeasles is a contagious virus commonly seen in children that causes fever, cough, runny nose, and pneumonia.

There are ways to prevent getting it.The Center for Disease Control indicates that influenza activity in Mississippi was “very high” as of Dec. 23, the most recent data available. The map, which categorizes the influenza activity by color, shows Mississippi as purple, the highest level.Six states including Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina and New Mexico share Mississippi's purple, "very high" status.This status follows a trend of increasing activity since the start of fall. In early Nov., the activity rose to the “high” category, indicated in red on the digital map, and has remained in the red or purple ever since.The map tracks patient visits for respiratory illnesses that share symptoms of influenza, such as cough or high fever, but are not necessarily confirmed cases of influenza. COVID-19 data is kept separate.Richard Calderone, assistant dean of graduate medical education at William Carey University, said this spike is pretty typical for this time of year. Because of the colder weather, people move gatherings indoors, making the spread of respiratory illnesses more likely. This trend is compounded by holiday gatherings.The flu is not the only respiratory illness spiking. COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus infections are also elevated."We are truly seeing a 'tripledemic' of respiratory illnesses right now," Calderone said. "One of my colleagues in Hattiesburg recently had a family come in where one individual tested positive for flu, one positive for COVID-19 and one positive for RSV."The southern states are historically the most disease-burdened when it comes to influenza and related illnesses. Calderone said there is no known singular reason for this trend, but it may have to do with low vaccination rates in the South.The data for Christmas Eve and beyond have yet to be published. Calderone said he expects the numbers to continue increasing, especially after the "holiday lag" in which many testing sites and health centers were closed.While this seasonal spike is considered normal, Mississippians can still take precautions. Calderone suggested reading up on how to prevent respiratory illnesses on the CDC website.Calderone suggested the following preventative measures:Avoid close contact with those who are sickStay home if you are sickRemain home for at least 24 hours after a fever is goneWear masks, especially if you are coughing and sneezingSee a doctor for treatment if you experience flu-like symptomsWash your hands frequentlyIt's not too late to get your flu vaccine. The CDC recommends anyone over the age of six months (with rare exceptions) should get a flu vaccine seasonally.

Patrick Sison/AP hide caption toggle caption Patrick Sison/AP COVID cases are rising but hospitalizations and deaths are lower than last year's respiratory virus season. Patrick Sison/AP In most U.S. states, respiratory illness levels are currently "high" or "very high," according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Friday. "After the holidays, after we've traveled and gathered, we are seeing what is pretty typical of this time of year, which is a lot of respiratory viruses," says Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC. A few viruses have been driving the upward trend, including flu which is very high and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV which appears to have peaked around Thanksgiving. COVID-19 levels have climbed higher than last season's peak. Still, they remain far below where they were at the height of the pandemic — as do levels of severe disease. Sponsor Message "We are still very far below the levels that we were seeing with the omicron peak [in the 2021-2022 virus season]," says Amy Kirby, who leads the CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System. "We're not looking at that really massive wave of infections. This is much more on par with what we saw [in the 2022-2023 season]." And while COVID levels are still higher than they were last season, other COVID metrics including emergency room visits, hospitalization rates and deaths are lower now than previous seasons, indicating that "COVID-19 infections are causing severe disease less frequently than earlier in the pandemic," according to the CDC. Loading... Staggered start for viruses this season Respiratory viruses are hitting the southeast especially hard, said the CDC's Cohen, "but no part of the country is spared." Flu levels are especially concerning. "The influenza virus is the thing that's really skyrocketing right now," says Dr. Steven Stack, public health commissioner for the state of Kentucky and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "Influenza is sharply escalating and driving more hospitalizations." The flu is coming in later this season, compared with the 2022-2023 season, when "RSV and flu really took off right at the same time along with COVID," says Marlene Wolfe, assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University and a program director at WastewaterScan. "All three of those together were pretty nasty. This year, there's more of an offset." That has been good news so far for hospital capacity, which has remained stable this season, meaning that people who are quite ill and need medical care are generally able to get it. Sponsor Message Some hospitals in different parts of the country — from Massachusetts to Illinois to California — are starting to require masks for staff again and in some cases for patients and visitors. Vaccines can still help Health officials say that getting the latest flu and COVID-19 vaccines now can still protect people this season. While Stack, with Kentucky's Department for Public Health, encourages seasonal preventive shots for everyone 6 months and older, he says it's particularly important for "everybody who is elderly — and not even old elderly — like young elderly, 60 and older," since they are more likely to get very sick from these viruses. CDC data shows that fewer than half of U.S. adults have gotten a flu shot this fall and winter. That's still better than the vaccination rate for this season's COVID-19 booster, which fewer than 20% of U.S. adults have gotten, even though COVID-19 remains the bigger danger. "The thing that is putting folks into the hospital and unfortunately taking their lives — the virus that is still the most severe [at the moment] — is the COVID virus," says the CDC's Cohen. Beyond vaccines, health officials say there's still a place for masking as a preventive measure. Early testing can aid treatment Those who are sick should stay home and watch their symptoms. If they progress beyond a runny nose and a light cough "to body aches, fevers, difficulty moving through your day, a heavier runny nose, a worsening cough ... [those more severe symptoms] should trigger you to go get tested," says Cohen. Getting tested and diagnosed early, with COVID-19 or the flu, can help those at risk of serious illness get access to prescription pills that can reduce their chances of ending up in the hospital. Flu and COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments should be covered by health insurance. Sponsor Message For those who are uninsured, the government is also offering a program called Test to Treat that offers free tests, free telehealth appointments and free treatments at home. Cohen says people can protect themselves over the next few weeks by staying aware of what's happening in the community and their individual circumstances. "You want to know what's happening in your community," she says. "Is there a lot of virus circulating? And then, what are the tools that I could layer on to protect myself, depending on who I am, my age, my risk, as well as who I'm around?" The CDC has maps of COVID-19 hospitalizations down to the county level on its website, and it provides weekly updates on respiratory viruses nationwide. Cohen says there are many tools — including vaccines, masks, rapid tests and treatments — available to help people reduce their risks this season.

And the peak may still be a long way off, according the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Thirty-three states are reporting high to very high case counts of influenza-like illnesses, and there have been about 4,500 flu-related deaths, including those of 20 children, since the 2023-24 season began in October. Flu began to take off around Thanksgiving in Louisiana, which has one of the worst outbreaks in the country, said Dr. David Janz, the director of medical critical care services at University Medical Center New Orleans. About 20% of his critically ill patients are sick from influenza. Flu cases are "increasing at a much faster rate that they had post-Thanksgiving," said Janz, who treats adults. "By some measures, here in Louisiana, this looks like it's probably going to be our worst influenza season since at least the 2009 H1N1 outbreak."That was one of the most severe flu seasons in decades, with an estimated 12,000 deaths nationally. Back then, H1N1 was a new flu strain, and it hit children particularly hard. In subsequent years, H1N1 has circulated seasonally, including this year.Janz warned that other states should prepare for the flu virus, which is spreading fast at the same time as Covid and other respiratory viruses. "This is not just a Southern issue," he said.Already, a number of states in the Northeast and the Midwest are reporting increases.

Now, flu levels continue a steady path upward in the New Year.Although ER visits among school-age children dipped last week while kids were home for winter break, flu overall isn't dropping anywhere. The current season looks to be "pretty typical," Dr. Mandy Cohen, the head of the CDC, said in an interview Wednesday. "While we're still on the upswing," Cohen said, "we're not see any big surges."The CDC estimates that there have been at least 7.1 million flu illnesses this season, with 73,000 hospitalizations. At least 14,732 people were admitted to the hospital for flu in the week that ended Dec. 23. According to Cohen, there is no indication that the rises in flu or other respiratory illnesses like Covid are straining hospital systems yet.Most patients sick enough to be hospitalized and die from flu are ages 65 and older. Children, too, can get severely ill from flu, and it can be especially dangerous for kids ages 5 and younger. ER visits for flu among babies ages 1 and under rose significantly during the week that ended Saturday, the CDC reported. North Carolina, which is in the midst of "very high" flu activity, has reported three pediatric deaths this year — already matching the number of children who died in the state during all of last year's flu season, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services."We are definitely seeing a surge in cases of influenza right now," said Dr. Jonathan Miller, the chief of primary care pediatrics for Nemours Children's Health. "A lot of sick kids, a lot of sick families coming out of the holidays when everybody was getting together." The Nemours system includes children's hospitals and dozens of pediatricians in Delaware, Florida and Pennsylvania.Dr. Amina Ahmed, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Atrium Health Levine Children's in Charlotte, North Carolina, said she has also noted the steady uptick in pediatric flu cases. Those young patients typically come in with fevers, cough and often either runny noses or sore throats, Ahmed said.Both Ahmed and Miller of Nemours said that, anecdotally, it seems that the kids sick enough to be hospitalized with flu didn't get this year's flu shot."These kids are pretty much all unvaccinated," Ahmed said. "The uptake on the influenza vaccine wasn't as robust as we would have hoped."According to a CDC survey, just 43.9% of kids ages 6 months to 17 years received the flu shot this year. The survey estimated that about the same percentage of adults — 43.8% — said they got the shot. The percentage tends to be lower in states like Louisiana, where Janz estimates that just 30% to 40% had had their flu vaccines. Cohen said this year's flu shot does seem to cover the influenza strains that are circulating: mostly H1N1, an influenza A strain. And, she said, there is still time to get the shot."We have weeks and weeks" of flu season to go, she said, "and maybe even a couple of months." Along with vaccinations, the CDC recommends:Getting tested for flu and Covid when you're sick. There are antiviral medications for both illnesses, and they are best when given early.Practicing regular hand-washing.Staying home and away from others when you're sick.

University of Maryland School of Medicine studies how virus is transmitted By Adam Thompson January 5, 2024 / 8:38 PM EST / CBS Baltimore Vic Carter has your Friday evening news update (1/5/2024) Vic Carter has your Friday evening news update (1/5/2024) 01:38 BALTIMORE - Would you expose yourself to the flu for money?The University of Maryland School of Medicine is conducting a "flu transmission" study.The study is designed to examine the person-to-person transmission of community-acquired influenza in healthy adults aged 18 to 59.If you have been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and have had an onset of influenza-like symptoms (fever ≥100.2°F and cough or sore throat) in the past 48 hours, you may qualify to participate in the flu-transmission study as a flu donor."Viruses can be transmitted in different ways," Dr. Wilbur Chen, the study co-investigator at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which is partnering with the university's School of Public Health, told our media partner at The Baltimore Banner. "Some might be more airborne than others." individuals will be housed in a hotel research quarantine unit for up to five days at the Lord Baltimore Hotel. Those people will participate in group activities that will expose other people to your influenza. When you are not participating in the group activities, you will be required to remain in your own private hotel room in the hotel quarantine unit. You will be instructed to only interact with other volunteers (recipients and donors) in the hotel research isolation unit during assigned group activities in a specialized transmission room. You will also be asked to remain isolated in your assigned private hotel room when not participating in group activities.According to the Banner, eight healthy people have already been recruited for the task. Dr. Donald Milton, the principal investigator from the school of public health, said the results can be used to update public health policy. That could mean changes in masking advice and improved air quality, which could prevent transmissions of a lot of viruses, the Banner reports."We hope to clearly define how flu is transmitted, which will allow us to set better policy," Milton said in an interview recorded by the university. "It could lead to policies to improve air quality in schools, homes and places people catch the flu."Qualified Participants to Be a donor for this study must:Be 18-59 years oldHave laboratory-confirmed influenza within 48 hours of admission to the quarantine unitHave the onset of flu-like symptoms (fever ≥100.2°F and cough or sore throat)Be able to remain in a hotel research quarantine unit for up to 5 daysBe available for one outpatient clinic visit and one telephone call after being released from the hotel research quarantine unitYou could get paid up to $1,900. Meals and medical attention will also be provided.If you want to volunteer, call 410-706-8800. The study will continue until March.

Karine Labaky. A couple socially distances during the pandemic in the Philippines. Recent surges in the flu and COVID-19 have governments concerned about getting vulnerable populations vaccinated. Image by Iqbal Nuril Anwar from PixabayJanuary 5, 2024Influenza cases are spiking alarmingly in the Asia Pacific, alongside new waves of COVID-19. Affected governments must confront poor funding mechanisms for funding programs and education populations on vaccinations, write Dr. Lulu Bravo and Karine Labaky. .Just as we think that the dust has settled from COVID-19, the Asia Pacific (APAC) region is now grappling not only with waves of COVID-19 infections but also a significant rise in flu cases.Â The impact of influenza on daily lives and healthcare systems is evident throughout the region. In the Philippines, cases of influenza-like illnesses have increased by 46%. Malaysia is urging older adults to get vaccinated due to a sudden increase in flu cases, which has resulted in a shortage of hospital beds. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), flu levels remain high in Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines. Thailand, in particular, has experienced a fivefold increase in influenza cases in 2023 compared to last yearâs monthly average, according to the Thai FDA. Japan has even closed schools due to widespread flu outbreaks. While cases have gradually decreased since surpassing the summer influenza threshold, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection continues to remind the public to get vaccinated to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system.Â Â Vulnerable populations, including infants, children, pregnant women, and older adults (those age 60 and above) face the highest risks from infectious diseases. While government-funded immunization programmes often cover the young and underprivileged, many older adults are left to manage their preventive healthcare on their own. In the case of influenza, older adults account for up to 70% and 85% of hospitalizations and mortality, respectively. Aging increases the likelihood of serious complications due to frailty and weakened immune systems, with those with cardiovascular diseases particularly susceptible. This is concerning as older adults make up around 15% of the population in the region.Â The current flu outbreak disproportionately affects older adults without government-funded immunization coverage, placing a significant burden on families, caregivers, and healthcare systems, straining government budgets, infrastructure capacity, and family finances. Beyond the financial costs, 10% of older adults hospitalized due to influenza complications experience loss of independence, impacting their quality of life and family members providing caregiving support.Â National Vaccine Coverage CrucialThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of older adults and the importance of protecting them through vaccination. Preventing vaccine-preventable diseases like influenza is crucial to avoid future health crises and strain on healthcare systems.Â Immunization is a critical pillar of healthy aging policies. Evidence demonstrates that vaccinating older adults reduces the health and economic burden on individuals, societies, and the healthcare system, with the 2023 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine reducing influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52%.While certain countries in the region, like Singapore, have made great strides in preventive health measures, more needs to be done across the region to make adult immunization routine. Singaporeâs Healthier SG initiative aims to improve citizens' health and quality of life by providing subsidized screenings and vaccinations, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.However, many APAC countries lack recognition of the importance of routine vaccination beyond childhood, leading to low vaccination rates among older adults and vulnerable groups. Influenza vaccine uptake is only 14.9% among the general Asian population and 37.3% among high-risk groups, well below the WHO target rate of 75%. In Singapore, only 32.4% of adults 65 years and older are vaccinated against influenza, and in Malaysia, it is around 5.5% for those over 60. Countries like Malaysia and Thailand lack adult influenza vaccination programs, burdening high-risk groups with immunization costs. Vietnam has limited subsidized immunization services for the elderly, and vaccine accessibility remains a challenge.Â Concerted efforts are necessary to better protect our older adults from the flu, including increasing vaccination rates and implementing targeted strategies. Achieving high immunization rates will require purposeful action and collaboration amongst diverse stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem.Â Keys to Successful Immunization ProgramsIn APAC economies without national immunization programs (NIPs) targeting older adults, the current flu season presents an opportunity to explore differentiated funding mechanisms that provide necessary protection against influenza for vulnerable populations. For example, the Philippines has successfully utilized âSin Taxesâ to purchase and include new vaccines into its NIP.Â Even in countries with free vaccine programs through NIPs, awareness about vaccine-preventable diseases remains low, compounded by misinformation and misconceptions about their severity. In the Philippines, where influenza vaccines are provided for free to older adults, only 30% of the population are aware of such programs. In Indonesia, many people underestimate the fluâs health threat and believe they will recover without treatment, leading to a lack of perceived need for vaccination. Singapore faces challenges with vaccine misinformation and low confidence, resulting in low uptake rates.There are common priorities that could enhance pandemic preparedness and improve seasonal influenza prevention and control. These recommendations in a recent whitepaper by the EU-ASEAN Business Council, supported by Sanofi, prioritize life-course immunization in a post-pandemic era, preparing health systems, healthcare workers, and stakeholders to manage future burdens:Increase affordability of vaccinations through free or subsidized vaccinesIncorporate life-course immunization as part of national immunization policiesIncrease awareness, education and engagement of the public, healthcare providers, community health workers and the media on the value of vaccinationImprove vaccine procurement, supply chain and logisticsDevelop robust data surveillance systems and infrastructureTo ensure continued access to influenza vaccines for older adults and protect against flu complications, sustainably funded programs and strategies are crucial. Governments can implement differentiated vaccine strategies that prioritize vulnerable populations and leverage high antigen content flu vaccines. Differentiated influenza vaccines offering broader protection, including against pneumonia and heart attacks, have shown improved health outcomes. Influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of flu-triggered heart attacks by up to 45%.Everyone deserves protection from vaccine-preventable diseases like influenza. Access to the appropriate vaccine should be available to all, regardless of age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or healthcare risk factors.

Game Commission stocks fewer pheasants because of avian influenzaPublished: Jan. 02, 2024, 12:12 p.m.The Pennsylvania Board of Game Commission said on Dec. 27, 2023, that is releasing fewer ring-necked pheasants because of the detection of avian influenza at a game farm in Northumberland County. (File photo)Pennsylvania Game CommissionBy Deb Kiner | dkiner@pennlive.comThe Pennsylvania Game Commission is stocking fewer ring-necked pheasants than it had originally planned because of avian influenza.The commission said highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected at a private game farm in Northumberland County that is close to one where the commission acquired its pheasants.The commission said it is adjusting its “late season pheasant stockings to help safeguard the agency’s pheasant program and better ensure it will continue next year in the 2024-25 hunting seasons.”Last week the commission said, in the eastern part of the state, there would only be on stocking “with properties that receive birds essentially seeing their final two releases of the year combined as one.”The influenza, the commission said, was detected at Martz’s Game Farm.“While the pheasants released by the Game Commission originate from a different facility, Mahantongo Game Farm, where HPAI has not been detected nor suspected, that facility also is in Northumberland County.The proximity of HPAI to the facility represents a concern. If there was an HPAI outbreak there, agricultural regulations would require euthanasia of many or all of the breeding pheasants that provide stock for the Game Commission’s program, jeopardizing the program’s future.”The commission said it will “hold onto all of the hen pheasants, and about 5% of the roosters, that had been slated for release in the final two pheasant releases of 2023-24.”Then, if avian influenza “remains undetected through continued testing of birds at Mahantongo Game Farm, pheasants there will be temporarily transferred to the Game Commission’s Loyalsock Game Farm. That’s why the counties served by Loyalsock will get their final two releases all at once this week. The pheasants to be released need to be cleared out to make room for those coming in.”Loyalsock Game Farm serves the following counties that were stocked last week: Adams, Berks, Bradford, Carbon, Centre, Columbia, Cumberland, Franklin (State Game Lands 235 only), Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Monroe, Montgomery, Northumberland, Perry, Pike, Schuylkill, Snyder, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Union, Wayne, Wyoming and York.The remaining counties are served by the Southwest Game Farm, and rooster-only pheasant releases in those counties will continue as scheduled.RECOMMENDED•pennlive.comSuburban Philly restaurant celebrating 9 years with Laurent-Perrier champagne dinnerNov. 6, 2024, 10:05 p.m.CDC calls for expanded bird flu testing after blood tests reveal more human infectionsNov. 7, 2024, 3:00 p.m.“This wasn’t a decision the Game Commission took lightly, because we know that pheasant hunters have been looking forward to the late small game season pheasant releases and will be inconvenienced by our making these adjustments on short notice,” said Ian Gregg, wildlife operations division chief. “However, we believe this precautionary approach is the right thing to do because it will significantly reduce the risk of disease impacts that would be far more devastating to pheasant hunting in the long run.”READ MORE: Pa.

Approximately 100,000 pheasants and chukars were destroyed as state and federal officials worked to mitigate the impact.Martz’s is a third-generation business that offers upland bird hunts and sporting clays across 1,300 acres. The operation remains closed and is under quarantine, but the business hopes to reopen the sporting clays sometime next week and the hunting preserve at some point this winter, under strict guidelines and pending government approval. The upland hunting season at Martz’s, which is a private preserve, typically runs until the second week of April, but that may be pushed back to the end of the month. The state Department of Agriculture also established a control area around the farm. Control areas are the 10-kilometer perimeter around an infected, quarantined farm. Poultry owners in control areas are subject to testing requirements and must have permits to transport poultry, poultry products and related equipment. Anyone within 3 kilometers of the infected farm may not transport any poultry or egg products.The influenza case prompted the Pennsylvania Game Commission to adjust its late-season pheasant stockings to help safeguard the agency’s pheasant program. Pheasant hunting season remains open across the state until Feb. 29, but the Game Commission will stock fewer pheasants this year because some will need to be kept as a safeguard for future production.The agency has two game farms and no longer rears pheasants, but purchases them from private facilities. One of the farms where the Game Commission purchases pheasants is the Mahantongo Game Farm, which is also located in Northumberland County just a few miles from the Martz operation.Avian influenza has not been detected at the Mahantongo location, but Game Commission officials are concerned about its proximity to the current outbreak at Martz’s facility. If there was an outbreak at Mahantongo, it would require euthanasia of many or all of the breeding pheasants that provide stock for the Game Commission’s program, jeopardizing the program’s future.According to Ian Gregg, wildlife operations division chief, approximately 17,000 pheasants will be transferred out of the Mahantongo facility and held at the Game Commission’s Loyalsock Game Farm in Lycoming County over the winter.Assuming there are no additional issues with influenza, those birds will be taken back to Mahantongo for the start of the 2024 breeding season in the spring.To make room for the birds, the Game Commission will stock all but 2,000 pheasants at the Loyalsock location. Gregg said those 2,000 birds, which are mostly hens, will be sent to the agency’s Southwest Game Farm and held through the winter. Another 2,000 birds at that farm will also be held over for the winter and not stocked for this hunting season.While the birds are being held, strict biosecurity guidelines will be in place.“Each farm regularly tests pheasants for avian influenza,” Gregg said. “The testing requirements will be stepped up for a period of time on the Mahantongo birds after they are moved to the Loyalsock Farm.”The outbreak at the Martz game farm is the first avian influenza detection in Pennsylvania since March 17, 2023.State Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding urged backyard bird owners and poultry and egg producers to remain vigilant as wild bird migration season continues.“In partnership with USDA and PA Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, we quickly responded to the incident,” he said. “This case is a reminder that this disease can strike anywhere, at any time, and that poultry owners must protect their birds through biosecurity and planning.” Newsletter Success!

Vaccination rates remain low as respiratory virus illness activity continues to increase across the US. Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/AP CNN — As seasonal virus activity surges across the United States, experts stress the importance of preventive measures – such as masking and vaccination – and the value of treatment for those who do get sick. Tens of thousands of people have been admitted to hospitals for respiratory illness each week this season. During the week ending December 23, there were more than 29,000 patients admitted with Covid-19, about 15,000 admitted with the flu and thousands more with respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationally, Covid-19 levels in wastewater, a leading measure of viral transmission, are very high – higher than they were at this time last year in every region, CDC data shows. Weekly emergency department visits rose 12%, and hospitalizations jumped about 17% in the most recent week. Young man washing hands - stock photo Solskin/Digital Vision/Getty Images Did you gather in large groups for the holidays? A virus may be your post-holiday present And while Covid-19 remains the leading driver of respiratory virus hospitalizations, flu activity is rising rapidly. The CDC estimates that there have been more than 7 million illnesses, 73,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths related to the flu this season, and multiple indicators are high and rising. RSV activity is showing signs of slowing in some parts of the US, but many measures, including hospitalization rates, remain elevated. Overall, young children and older adults are most affected. “It’s a wave of winter respiratory pathogens, especially respiratory viruses. So it’s Covid, it’s flu, and we can’t diminish the importance of RSV,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. “So it’s a triple threat, and arguably a fourth threat because we also have pneumococcal pneumonia, which complicates a lot of these virus infections.” Respiratory virus activity has been on the rise for weeks. Now, flu-like activity is high or very high in two-thirds of the United States, including California, New York City and Washington, as well as throughout the South and Northeast, according to the CDC. “Remember, all of these numbers are before people got together for the holidays,” Hotez said. “So don’t be disappointed or surprised that we even see a bigger bump as we head into January.” Vaccines can help prevent severe illness and death, but uptake remains low this season – despite a historic first, with vaccines available to protect against each of the three major viruses. Just 19% of adults and 8% of children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine, and 17% of adults 60 and older have gotten the new RSV vaccine, CDC data shows. Less than half of adults and children have gotten the flu vaccine this season. “We have, as a population, underutilized both influenza and the updated Covid vaccines, unfortunately,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “But it’s not too late to get vaccinated, because these viruses are going to be around for a while yet.” Positive COVID-19 self-tests mrs/Moment RF/Getty Images XBB.1.5, BA.2.86, JN.1: How to understand the Covid-19 alphabet soup According to the CDC, hospital bed capacity remains “stable” nationally, including within intensive care units. But with high levels of respiratory viruses, hospitals in at least five states are returning to requiring masks. Mass General Brigham spokesman Timothy Sullivan said it will require masking for health-care staff who interact directly with patients starting Tuesday, and patients and visitors will be “strongly encouraged to wear a facility-issued mask.” In Wisconsin, UW Health and UnityPoint Health – Meriter have expanded mask policies to cover more people. UW requires all staff, patients and visitors to wear a mask for patient interactions in clinic settings, including waiting areas and exam rooms. UnityPoint Health – Meriter says masks continue to be required for team members and visitors in patient rooms. Bellevue, a public hospital in New York City, said on social media last week that it had reinstated its mandatory masking policy due to an uptick in respiratory illnesses. In Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has required everyone to wear a mask when entering or inside since December 20. The systemwide masking policies were adjusted to “address the increase of respiratory virus cases” but may change when there is a “marked decrease in respiratory health cases,” according to the health care system. An order posted last week by the Los Angeles County Health Officer requires all health-care personnel and visitors to mask while in contact with patients or in patient-care areas, based on the CDC’s categorization of Covid-19 hospital admission levels. During the week ending December 23, more than 230 US counties were considered to have “high” levels of Covid-19 hospital admissions, defined by the CDC by at least 20 new hospital admissions for every 100,000 people. Nearly a thousand other counties, about a third of the country, have “medium” Covid-19 hospital admission levels, with at least 10 admissions for every 100,000 people. Vaccines and masks can help reduce the risk of severe illness before getting sick, but treatments are also available to help prevent people from getting very sick if they do become infected. Antiviral treatments for Covid-19, such as Paxlovid, and flu, such as Tamiflu, can be especially helpful for people who are more likely to get very sick, including people who are 50 or older and those with certain underlying conditions, such as a weakened immune system, heart disease, obesity, diabetes or chronic lung disease.

But “not enough people are taking them.” Seasonal respiratory virus activity can be hard to predict, but CDC forecasts suggest that hospitalization rates will continue at elevated levels for weeks and that this season, overall, will probably result in a similar number of hospitalizations as last season. “One of the ways to help us all go into a happy new year is for us to be as protected as we can against these viruses,” Schaffner said. “Of course, I continue to recommend vaccination, prudent use of the mask by high-risk people and, should you become sick, do not go to work and spread the virus further. Call your health care provider, because you may have some treatment available that will get you healthier sooner.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Get more newsLiveonJan. 6, 2024, 11:00 AM UTCBy Akshay Syal, M.D.While the U.S. is only a few weeks into winter, this year’s respiratory virus season is already looking different than last year’s. Covid and flu are both surging and there’s no peak in sight.While the U.S. is only a few weeks into winter, this year’s respiratory virus season is already looking different than last year. Both Covid and flu are surging together.Dustin Chambers / Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDuring the previous winter, flu and RSV got off to an early start but were already declining by the time hospitalizations from the omicron virus started to spike in December 2022.“What is new this year is we’re seeing both flu and Covid going up together,” said infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Phillips, chief epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health. “This is different.”At NYU Langone, positive tests for flu and Covid are “neck and neck,” with slightly more people sick with Covid, Phillips said.Dr. Helen Chu, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Washington, said providers are bracing for the impact of Covid and flu over the coming weeks in Washington state.“The Pacific Northwest tends to lag behind the Southeast and the East Coast by a week or two,” she said. “I think it’s going to be a pretty bad season.”The most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows flu levels are either high or very high in at least 38 states, as of the week ending Dec. 30. The CDC reported an estimated 10 million illnesses from flu last week, up from 7 million the week before. Covid-related hospitalizations are up 20% in the most recent week, the CDC reported Friday. How common is coinfection?With both viruses circulating at high levels, how likely it is for someone to get both at the same time?Fortunately, becoming infected with Covid and the flu appears to be rare.Last year, the CDC tracked coinfections in the U.S. and found that 3% of people hospitalized with the flu also tested positive for Covid. CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told NBC News in December that they don’t appear to be that common this year, either.“Right now we’re not seeing people who are testing positive for more than one respiratory virus at a time, but we are seeing a lot of illness,” she told NBC News. “We see coinfections at about a similar level to this time last season.”CDCJohn Wherry, director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania, said protection from coinfection has to do with our body’s own defense system.“There is a concept out there with data from animal models that one infection can make you more resistant to another infection occurring at the same time,” he said.This phenomenon, called viral interference, is where infection with one virus ramps up the body’s immune system and can make it less likely to get infected with another virus.“The immune response to one kind of shuts the door on the other,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at Stanford Medicine.Latest news on respiratory illnessesA new Covid variant has become dominant but fewer people are being hospitalized this winter.Flu is intensifying, especially among children. Covid hospitalizations: See the latest trend and current count. Scott, who treats patients at Stanford Hospital, is not currently seeing many people with flu and Covid.“I can’t remember ever having a patient who tested positive for both,” he said. “I think it’s pretty uncommon.”That can depend on the individual, however.“A 22-year-old who has the flu and recovers fairly recently may have that inflammatory resistance to Covid-19 for some period of time — of days or maybe a week afterwards,” Wherry said. “Whereas the frail 87-year-old who has the flu and is already compromised physically and respiratory-wise and then gets Covid-19 a week later now can have a much greater effect.”Evidence suggests that infection with Covid and influenza can make someone sicker.A meta-analysis of 95 studies, published in November in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, found people infected by both Covid and flu at the same time were more likely to need to be on a ventilator or to die, particularly if infected by the influenza A strain, which tends to cause more severe illness.There have been numerous reports this season that people can’t shake a lingering cough or runny nose, but that’s not necessarily unusual and doesn’t mean someone has more than one virus.Even a normal bout of respiratory infection can take several weeks to recover from.Stanford’s Scott said the high rates of both viruses right now are a good reason to be up to date on Covid and flu vaccines.Should I test for flu and Covid?Does it matter whether you’re sick with Covid or flu?It might. For example, it make a difference in how quickly someone gets back to a regular routine.With Covid, the CDC recommends isolating for five days after a positive test or from symptom onset. With flu, people are considered most contagious for the first three days of their illness. The CDC recommends staying home until at least 24 hours after fever is gone.Also, knowing which of the two viruses you are fighting can be important for people at high risk of having a bad infection, said Phillips. For people who are 65 or older, or pregnant or immunocompromised, the antiviral Paxlovid can help protect against hospitalization if taken in the first few days of a Covid illness. If it’s flu, a doctor can prescribe the antiviral Tamiflu.Early last year, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first at-home test that can differentiate and detect both Covid and flu. A new federal program called Test to Treat is providing free access to the tests.For everybody else who is not at high risk of severe disease, Scott’s advice is simple — stay home if you’re sick.“I get texts all the time from friends all over the country saying, ‘Hey, you know, I feel like I’m coming down with something, should I get tested,’” he said.In his view, if you aren’t high risk and don’t qualify for Paxlovid, a positive test won’t change much for Covid.Treatment is the same for Covid and flu — supportive, meaning things like adequate rest, hydration and isolation.Ultimately, what’s most important are the shots.“If you’re up to date on your Covid and flu vaccines, there’s nothing to worry about.”Akshay Syal, M.D.Dr. Akshay Syal is a board-certified internal medicine physician at UCLA Health and Instructor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

Co-infection of influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to poor prognosis of patients during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, reports on patients co-infected with avian influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 are scarce.Case presentationA 52-year-old woman presented with a fever, which has persisted for the past eight days, along with worsening shortness of breath and decreased blood pressure. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an air bronchogram, lung consolidation, and bilateral pleural effusion. The subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed positivity for H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).ConclusionThe H5N1 influenza virus is a cause of severe pneumonia. The clinical presentation of the patient had a predomination of H5N1 influenza rather than COVID-19. A PCR analysis for the identification of the virus is necessary to reveal the pathogen causing the severe pneumonia. The patient exhibited an excellent prognosis upon the use of the appropriate antiviral medicine. Peer Review reports BackgroundAvian influenza virus (AIV) is a significant threat to public health as it is associated with a high mortality rate, and several novel variants of AIV also keep emerging [1]. The H5N1 virus is a subtype of AIVs that has been circulating among wild birds for the past few years. The transmission mainly occurs from animals to humans, animals to animals, and the environment to humans [2]. In humans, infection with H5N1 commonly develops into respiratory stress and pneumonia [3]. The first case of the transmission of this virus from poultry to humans was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since then, several intermittent outbreaks have been reported in the human population throughout the world.SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that has become a constant threat to global health since 2019, and it also leads to varying degrees of pneumonia [4]. Co-infection with this virus, particularly with the pathogens responsible for pneumonia, has been attracting great attention since the beginning of the pandemic of 2019. According to studies, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with different influenza viruses leads to a higher fatality rate compared to infection with the COVID-19 virus alone [5]. However, an extensive review of the literature revealed no case reports of such co-infection in which the category of the influenza virus was identified. In this context, the present report discusses a case of severe pneumonia caused by a co-infection of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in a patient in China, the nation currently witnessing another surge in the cases of COVID-19.Case presentationA 52-year-old woman who has been living as a countryside resident of the Anhui province in China since her retirement developed a fever on 1 February 2023. The patient visited a local hospital, where she was prescribed antibacterial treatment using piperacillinazobactam and levofloxacin. However, two days later, her symptoms worsened, and she experienced shortness of breath and decreased blood pressure. The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. According to records, the patient had no history of smoking, hypertension, or diabetes upon admission.The examinations performed at admission revealed a body temperature of 39 °C, worsening shortness of breath, a blood pressure of 104/67 mmHg, a heart rate of 103 bpm, and PaO2/FiO2 of 86 mmHg. The laboratory examination results revealed elevated C-reactive protein levels, procalcitonin lymphocyte count, and D-dimer levels (Table 1). The throat swaps for COVID-19 were negative. The coronal CT of the lung depicted multiple patchy shadows (Fig. 1A). In the axial imaging, air bronchogram was predominant in the upper lobe and the right middle lobe, along with lung consolidation and bilateral pleural effusion (Fig. 1B). Without delay, the patient was placed on a non-invasive ventilator and methylprednisolone (40 mg once daily) for the management of the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Subsequently, sputum samples were collected from the patient and analyzed. The culture, bacterial PCR, and fungal PCR of these sputum samples were negative. The immunological tests for tuberculosis and common respiratory pathogens were also negative. Thereafter, on the night of 7 February 2023, the patient appeared irritable and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).Table 1 Laboratory result on admissionFull size tableFig. 1CT images prior to and after the treatment of the patient with the co-infection of H5N1 and COVID-19. The radiological examination of the patient after admission revealed an air bronchogram, lung consolidation, and bilateral pleural effusion (A and B)Full size imageIn the ICU, the patient was placed on intratracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. BALF samples were retrieved and subjected to metagenome next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The mNGS results were obtained three days after admission to the ICU, and the results were positive for H5N1 (Supplementary material). Therefore, a PCR analysis of the sputum and BALF samples from the patient was conducted for further identification of the virus, which confirmed the presence of the H5N1 influenza virus and presented a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, co-infection of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the etiology of severe pneumonia in this patient. The patient was then administered Peramivir (0.6 g once daily) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg, every 12 h) for the next 5 days.After treatment with the above antivirals, the inflammation indices and the temperature of the patient improved. Thirteen days after admission to the ICU, the pulmonary inflammation had reduced, as evidenced by the CT images (Fig. 2A and B). Accordingly, mechanical ventilation was withheld, and the corticosteroid was discontinued. Twenty-seven days after admission to the ICU, the patient tested negative for both H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 and was, therefore, discharged from the hospital.Fig. 2Ten days after treatment with the antivirals, the lung inflammation was relieved in the patient (A and B)Full size imageDiscussion and conclusionsThe PubMed database was searched using the terms “H5N1”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “co-infection”, and this search revealed no articles on patients having a co-infection of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2. According to previous reports, under proper supervision, the incidence rate of avian H5N1 influenza in humans has been decreasing in the past few years [6, 7]. However, the mortality rate due to severe acute respiratory distress induced by the H5N1 virus continues to be high [3]. In China, the implementation of “zero COVID” strategies was abandoned on 7 December 2022, after which a surge was recorded in the cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 [8]. Co-infection of the COVID-19 virus, particularly with the other pathogens responsible for pneumonia, has been attracting great attention since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to reports, co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with different influenza viruses leads to a higher fatality rate compared to infection with the COVID-19 virus alone [5]. Numerous cases of infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus were reported during the COVID-19 epidemic, while cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 were scarce [9]. In the case discussed in the present study, no other member of the patient’s family was infected with H5N1, except for the patient, who had been exposed to sick poultry. Therefore, it was understood that the spread of the virus was limited to animal-to-human transmission only. Accordingly, it is recommended to ensure the protection of the upper respiratory tract of humans against droplets containing AIVs, particularly during contact with infected chickens and birds.The CT images of the patient revealed interstitial infiltrates, lung consolidation, diffuse ground-glass opacities, and air bronchogram, all of which are symptoms observed during a common viral infection [10]. The typical features of COVID-19 in CT images include bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacities, which were not detected in the CT images of the discussed patient. The WHO has defined two types of SARS-CoV-2 variants: the variants of concern (VOCs) and the variants of interest (VOIs). Several VOCs have caused multiple waves of epidemics, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) [11]. The Omicron variant was first detected in China in December 2021. The prevalence of the Omicron variant in patients presented with a greater frequency of bronchial wall thickening and less-typical CT patterns [12]. However, the lesions occurring simultaneously in the central and peripheral regions of the lung and pleural effusion were uncommon in the cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentations were the same as those observed in the cases of isolated H5N1 infection and atypical for the pneumonia of COVID-19. Higher viral loads were evident in the BALF compared to the nasopharyngeal samples. Therefore, a single examination for the influenza virus, such as PCR for throat swabs, usually exhibited a relatively low sensitivity. [3]. In the event of viral pneumonia, timely antiviral treatment is key to decreasing mortality [9]. Therefore, for the case discussed in the present report, the mNGS of the BALF samples and the PCR test were performed at the earliest to verify the diagnosis, and this played a vital role in elucidating the etiology of viral pneumonia [13]. After the diagnosis, considering that the infection was caused by two viruses, the corresponding two categories of antiviral medicine were prescribed. While previous studies have demonstrated that co-infection with influenza and COVID-19 leads to a poor prognosis, the administration of both antiviral and anti-inflammation treatment in the present case could relieve lung inflammation, leading to an excellent prognosis.In conclusion, it is important to state that co-infection of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in patients may not lead to a terrible prognosis if timely treatment is administered. Indeed, influenza A virus infection can elevate ACE2 expression to promote the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. [14] However, despite the absence of any severe or adverse events in the disease course of the present case that had a co-infection of H5N1 and SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to ensure further precise treatment by verifying the pathogen responsible for causing severe pneumonia through various examinations.

So far, there are 7 million confirmed illnesses, 73,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths related to flu.Louisiana continues to be hit hard by the flu. On a CDC map from Dec. 29, Louisiana was listed as having the top level, or “very high” category of influenza activity.The Louisiana Department of Health says emergency department visits went from 11.6% to 14.2% for the week of December 17. The LDH says the highest percentage of flu emergency department visits were among 2-to-4-year-olds (34.3%) and 5-to-11-year- olds (40.2%).“Yes, very high levels of flu-like illness in Louisiana and in multiple other states across the United States. In fact, almost two-thirds of the states in the United States have high to very high levels of flu-like illness resulting in more cases and more hospitalizations,” said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious diseases specialist at LSU Health New Orleans.Dr. Lopez says the flu vaccine is a good match for the strain of the flu that is circulating.“It’s always a retrospective analysis to see just how effective the flu vaccine is but based on data from the southern hemisphere and what we’ve been seeing here so far it looks like a pretty good match for the strains that are circulating in the United States, meaning that in the vaccine are the strains that are causing illness in the United,” said Lopez.Lopez and LDH stress that it is not too late to be vaccinated against the flu.“Absolutely not. I’m glad you brought that up because people feel we’re in the throes of this, there’s no reason to get it now but remember flu season is all the way from October to May and even if you’ve already had the flu, you should go get a flu shot.”The surge in influenza-like illness is happening as COVID-19 and RSV continue to sicken people.Lopez said, “It’s like a triple threat. We’ve got COVID going up causing more hospitalizations, we’ve got flu going up and RSV seems like it may have plateaued in some areas of the United States but still, levels of activity that are quite significant, and yet we still hear data that people are not availing themselves of the vaccine.”At Castellon’s Pharmacy in New Orleans, pharmacist and co-owner Scott Beninato says customers with upper respiratory illnesses are coming in to get prescriptions filled and are buying over-the-counter medications.“Everything, lot of bronchitis, a ton of bronchitis. We’re filling syrups, tablets, capsules, antibiotics,” said Beninato. “We haven’t seen so much the flu, we have a couple of scripts of the flu but just the general upper respiratory type stuff. We’re seeing more of that than anything.”Lopez says mitigation measures used for COVID-19 are effective against other respiratory viruses.“It’s why they were on the wane during the height of the pandemic because people were masking, they were distancing, they were isolating when they got infected. All of these kinds of things worked to decrease the transmission not just of COVID-19 but also of all of those other respiratory virus illnesses, I know people don’t necessarily want to hear it,” he said.And he said it is not too late to get the COVID and RSV vaccines.“Less than 50% of adults have availed themselves of the flu vaccine, less than 20% of the adults who are eligible for the RSV vaccine have availed themselves of the RSV vaccine and less than 20% have availed themselves of the COVID-updated vaccine,” Lopez stated.See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

These kiosks offer access to testing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. After completing a brief registration form, the kiosks dispense two test kits. One kit is for COVID testing, and the other is for influenza (types A and B). The test kits include a nasal swab and instructions on collecting the specimens. Nasal swabs must be done for each test. Once the specimens are collected, they are safely packaged back into the kits and placed in the kiosk. The specimens are picked up daily and sent to an accredited lab for PCR testing. Individuals will receive notification of their test results by email or text, usually within 48 hours of specimen collection. Pre-registration for testing at the kiosks is not required but is available at https:/egister.testandgo.com. Additionally, there is no out-of-pocket cost for the tests provided through a DPH kiosk; but for individuals with insurance, their insurance will be billed. COVID and influenza testing are among the many prevention measures that protect you and others by reducing the chances of spreading illness. Vaccination and good respiratory hygiene also help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses like COVID and flu: Frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and warm water. Alcohol based gels are the next best thing if you don’t have access to soap and water. Cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow or arm to help prevent spread of germs. Avoid touching your face as germs can get into the body through mucus membranes of the nose, mouth and eyes. Stay home from work or school if you’re sick.

Main Line Health and Cooper University Health Care added mask mandates this week in response to the surge.COVID and influenza cases are increasing dramatically in some parts of the region and hospitalizations are also rising.People are being advised to take extra precautions to avoid being infected.RELATED: Philadelphia Health confirms 3 measles cases, warns another exposure at day care and hospitalsThe Philadelphia Health Department says there's been an increase in respiratory virus activity since the beginning of November, including COVID, flu and RSV. The department says it's not considering a public mask mandate at this time but is urging people to remain proactive.The new guidance says people should stay home if they're sick, wear a mask in indoor public spaces and get vaccinated.Virtua Health Voorhees has been packed with sick patients in the Tri-State region due to respiratory infections being the highest in New Jersey, according to the CDC.In Pennsylvania, health department data shows flu cases have nearly tripled over the past three weeks. Across the country, there have been more than 73,000 flu hospitalizations and more than 4,500 deaths, including 20 children. Fewer than half of children have received this year's flu vaccine, the lowest in five years. RSV infections are dropping, but flu and COVID cases continue to rise.Dr. Jonathan Stallkamp, the chief medical officer of Main Line Health, says the surge in respiratory illnesses has prompted the system to re-instate a mask mandate for at least the next two weeks."It's different this year because we're seeing our spike of COVID and flu hitting at the same time," Stallkamp said. To stop the spread of all patients, employees, medical staff and visitors will be required to wear masks in all Main-Line healthcare locations."One to prevent a patient from passing it on to another patient, or from patient passing to one of our staff members, or staff members passing it on to them," Dr. Stallkamp said.

Read the article... Why You Should Get a Flu Vaccine Vaccination is the first and most important step to protect against the flu. Everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccination each year to protect themselves and their loved ones against the flu. The flu can be serious. It is a contagious disease which affects the lungs and can lead to serious illness, including pneumonia. Even healthy people can get sick enough to miss work or school for a significant amount of time, or even be hospitalized. The close-contact environment that college students live in can lead to rapid spread of influenza. So it is important for students to get immunized to help protect the university community. The flu vaccine cannot give you the flu. The vaccine is either made with an inactivated virus, or no virus at all. The most common side effects from a flu shot are a sore arm and sometimes a low fever or achiness. If you do experience them at all, these side effects are mild and short-lived. The minor pain of a flu shot is nothing compared to the suffering that can be caused by the flu. The flu can make you very sick for several days—you could even be hospitalized. Plus, you could make others in your family or community ill when you get the flu. Flu vaccines are safe. Flu vaccines have been given for more than 50 years and they have a very good safety record. Hundreds of millions of flu vaccines have been given safely. 2039 Kennedy Blvd Jersey City, NJ 07305 About Admissions & Aid Academics Student Life Community 201-200-3234 Undergraduate Admissions 201-200-3409 Graduate Admissions 201-200-2000 General Info Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube ©2024 New Jersey City University All Rights Reserved Notice of Equal Opportunity Access to Online Resources Blackboard Work at NJCU Back To TopBay Area wastewater levels high with COVID, RSV and flu after holiday season, data shows - ABC7 San Francisco 24/7 LiveSan FranciscoEast BaySouth BayPeninsulaNorth BayWelcome, Mickeymickey@disney.comManage MyDisney AccountLog Out HEALTH & FITNESSBay Area wastewater levels high with COVID, RSV and flu after holidays, data showsByDustin Dorsey Tuesday, January 2, 2024Bay Area wastewater levels high with COVID, RSV and flu: dataWastewater data is showing higher-than-normal levels of all three viruses across the Bay Area.SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- It's not quite "here we go again," according to infectious diseases experts, but the big three -- RSV, flu and COVID -- are on the rise again.Wastewater data is showing higher-than-normal levels of all three viruses across the Bay Area.As we ring in the New Year, we turn the page on the holiday season calendar.But UCSF Infectious Diseases Specialist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong says what's left over are respiratory diseases.MORE: Santa Clara Co. doctors see increase in RSV wastewater numbers ahead of Thanksgiving"What we've seen over the past few years is a typical pattern of a 'one-two-three-punch' with Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukah and then New Year, followed by increase cases in the community and spillover in the hospital," Chin-Hong said.The new JN.1 variant is rapidly spreading nationwide and the WastewasterSCAN dashboard shows us the Bay Area is not immune.Santa Rosa, San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose are all showing high levels of COVID, to name a few.The South Bay city is showing the third highest levels since 2021, according to Santa Clara County Department of Public Health data.MORE: 230,000 more doses of new RSV immunization for babies are on the way, White House says"We're still seeing a lot of COVID in the community, and a lot of people are getting sick, and it's causing a lot of disruptions," Chin-Hong said. "It seems like everybody I know, or almost everyone, has some sort of respiratory illness right now, including COVID."That's what has doctors concerned right now.It's not just COVID. UCSF Epidemiologist George Rutherford says there are rising trends of influenza and RSV nationwide as well."There are substantial increases in respiratory syncytial virus cases and hospitalizations in adults and substantial increases in influenza, in hospitalization, cases and tests in adults and children," Rutherford said.MORE: Doctor shares how to prevent and treat viruses this 'sick season'These experts say keeping hospitalizations down now, in spite of rising wastewater, is key.They suggest getting diagnosed quickly by testing to figure out how to get healthy again.But to remain healthy from the big three respiratory viruses, they are still suggesting vaccines."The current vaccine covers the current variants," Rutherford said. "So, if you haven't gotten the new vaccine, that's been around since October, I would definitely get it. If you haven't gotten the RSV vaccine and you're 60 or older, I'd definitely get it. And if you haven't had the flu vaccine and you're six months old or older, I would definitely get it."

Nobody likes getting the flu. The sore throat, the stuffy nose, the coughing, the fevers and chills -- there's not much to like, and it's certainly not something most people would choose, if they had the option. But if getting sick could put $1,900 in your bank account, many people would consider it. 📺 Watch News4 now: Stream NBC4 newscasts for free right here, right now. To figure out how the flu is transmitted, researchers at UMD are conducting "a first-of-its-kind study" -- and recruiting some brave, paid participants. The University of Maryland School of Public Health in College Park and the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore are trying to learn more about how illness spreads. Their two-month study needs people willing to quarantine in a hotel with flu-infected people, likely getting infected themselves. The goal is to better determine how the virus infects us every flu season. "Nobody has successfully observed influenza transmission under controlled conditions," said Dr. Donald Milton of UMD's School of Public Health. "It has never been done." There could be a number of factors that play a role in the flu's spread and infectiousness, and we need more information, the researchers say.

Farmer, 73, killed in hit-and-run while checking mailbox "There also might be the airborne component, and we just need to think about it when we get more of the data," said Dr. Wilbur Chen of UMD's School of Medicine. Milton and Chen are leading the study, which will recruit both healthy patients and those who are in the early, onset days of the flu. The patients will mingle together in the same air-controlled environment, playing games, talking and watching TV to mimic a gathering. "We just need to be able to capture it and monitor it very closely while on the quarantine unit," Chen said. "That then will tell us, if people get infected when the air quality is very poor, but not when the air quality is very good, that will tell us that they were getting it by breathing," Milton explained. What the study's findings may show If the researchers' flu transmission hypothesis proves to be true, they say it could serve as the catalyst for a change in public health policy. Their goal is to spark improved air circulation in buildings. "We can help make people healthier that way," Milton said. "Colds are one of the main ways that people end up with severe asthma attacks, end up in the hospital." The multi-million dollar study uses money from the National Institutes of Health. It will include medical devices to measure the number of virus particles in exhaled air, and to test UV lights and air filters. "I figured this will be a good opportunity to just kind of take a look and experience how studies are being conducted so that I can make my own judgment," said Matthew Tan, one of the study participants. Researchers have already recruited the healthy volunteers, but Friday is when they're recruiting participants with the flu. To qualify, adults between the age of 18 and 59 must have: A cough or sore throat A fever of at least 100.2 and A positive flu test All volunteers will stay at the Lord Baltimore Hotel, with all expenses paid. They'll also get up to $1,900. News4 sends breaking news stories by email. Go here to sign up to get breaking news alerts in your inbox. The results of the study are expected in the spring.

But the disease hasn't stopped there.It has now been found in Marin County, where another farm has had to destroy its entire flock. Last month, Sonoma County declared an agricultural disaster when two poultry farms had to kill their entire flocks to try to keep the deadly pathogen from spreading. It's officially called "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza," and it's been a disaster for the poultry industry. UC Davis Professor Dr. Maurice Pitesky said there are very few tools to control it."We can't vaccinate because of economic and political reasons," he said. "So, the only method of control we really have are quarantine, bio-security and de-population." That "de-population" has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions of birds nationwide, with the highest level of infection right here in California. And on Dec. 28, there was another discovery, an egg farm in Marin.They had to euthanize 151,000 chickens. The county's Agriculture Commissioner, Stefen Parnay, won't identify the location, but said there is little anyone could do about it."At this point, the goal is to not have it spread more than the one site it's at," he said. "So, that's the challenge."It's a challenge because the infections are happening despite rigorous bio-security measures to try to keep any foreign sources out of the farms. Here's how quickly the disease is spreading: The first detection of the current strain of avian flu in the United States was in February of 2022. By the end of last month, 16 commercial flocks have had to be euthanized in just the state of California alone."It's incredibly unnerving, and our producers are doing everything they possibly can," said Parnay. "And, again, sometimes you do everything right and you still become a casualty of this disease."That's because the disease seems to be spreading from migratory birds, which can carry the virus without it harming them. The slightest dropping from an infected bird that finds its way into the poultry population can be disastrous. It can even be carried on dust in the wind.Dr. Pitesky said he believes the only realistic way to limit the spread is to begin locating poultry farms in areas where there aren't a lot of migratory birds passing through."The same way you make daily predictions about weather, we can make daily predictions about the presence or absence and abundance of waterfowl next to these farms," said Dr. Pitesky. "So farmers can be prepared to understand where the risk geographically is."But it may make it very hard for an area like the North Bay to continue as a poultry production center."This is, at some level, an existential issue for the commercial poultry industry," said Dr. Pitesky. "It's going to take some time for the industry to adapt to this new reality. But unfortunately, I think, we're in kind of a new world in the United States with respect to the risk." The economics may be the determining factor. The price of eggs nationally has already more than doubled since the outbreak began. And at a certain point, farmers simply won't be able to continue operating in a place where a bird flying overhead can be enough to put them out of business.

Gerlach said it was likely the bear was scavenging on the carcasses of infected birds.Polar bears are listed as “vulnerable” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of endangered species, mainly due to the loss of sea ice.It is possible that more bears have died unnoticed as they tend to live in remote places with few people, said Gerlach. “You’re really dependent on the public that’s out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,” he said.The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 – which started in 2021 – is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Globally, thousands of mammals have also died of the virus, including black bears and brown bears. Bald eagles, foxes and kittiwakes are among the species to have died of the virus in Alaska in recent months.“It’s been in Antarctica and now it’s in the high Arctic in mammals – it’s horrifying,” Diana Bell, emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, told the Guardian.“And yet I’m not surprised – in the last couple of years the list of mammals killed has become enormous. It’s killed such a wide range of predatory and scavenging mammals now, this isn’t just a poultry disease.“When it hits a large, charismatic species like a polar bear, people suddenly sit up and listen – or at least I hope they will. We’ve already got a pandemic in biodiversity and it’s called H5N1 because it’s killed so many birds and mammals.”The first known cases of H5N1 were detected in the Antarctic region in October among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Two months later, hundreds of elephant seals were found dead. There have also been increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua at several other sites.Scientists have warned that the highly contagious virus could bring “one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times” if it reaches the remote penguin populations.The virus is continuing further south in the Antarctic region. A Brown skua is suspected to have died from it in Heroína Island, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.It is currently awaiting further testing, according to the latest update on the SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) website. “It doesn’t bode well,” said Dr Meagan Dewar, leader of the SCAR Antarctic Wildlife Health Network.Dewar was one of the authors of a risk assessment which found many Antarctic animals were threatened, including gulls, skuas, fur seals and sea lions.She said: “The analysis indicated a heightened risk that HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] would present in Antarctic species in 2023 or 2024 in the Antarctic Peninsula region and that is exactly what we are seeing.”Ecosystems in polar regions are particularly vulnerable to bird flu because they contain many animals found nowhere else in the world which have never been exposed to similar viruses. They are also among the places most affected by climate breakdown.Explore more on these topicsAlaskaThe age of extinctionBird fluHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(Robert Short/CBC)Social SharingA growing number of health-care workers in Nova Scotia are not getting their annual flu shots, according to figures released by their employer, Nova Scotia Health.In response to a request by CBC News, authority spokesperson Jennifer Lewandowski wrote: "As of December 14, 2023, 7,231 (22.5%) employees have had the flu vaccine during the 2023-24 flu season."That's the lowest flu vaccination rate in at least a decade, according to statistics posted on the Nova Scotia Department of Health's webpage. Vaccination rates range from 45.1 per cent during the 2015-16 flu season to 29.8 per cent last year.Although Nova Scotia Health tracks employee vaccination rates, Lewandowski said some health-care workers may have gotten their shots on their own, at pharmacies and clinics, without informing their employer. There's no obligation to report.Strang concernedDespite that, the drop in the vaccination rate worries Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang."We're nowhere near where we really need to be in vaccine uptake," Strang said Thursday."Nova Scotia is not alone in terms of what I would call [the] underuse of influenza vaccine by health-care workers. It's an issue across the country and beyond."But I personally [am] still mystified that health-care workers, many of whom are well educated on influenza and see the impacts of influenza, still decline to get the protection from the vaccine."Janet Hazelton, the president of the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union, called the decline disappointing but understandable."I think it's very important for health-care workers, for everyone, to get the flu shot, but especially for health-care workers because they're around vulnerable people," said Hazelton."But I also understand that health-care workers are just fatigued. They've been through a rough couple of years."Robert Huish is an associate professor of international development studies at Dalhousie University. (Steve Lawrence/CBC)Robert Huish, an associate professor of international development studies at Dalhousie University, was also surprised by this year's 22.5 per cent vaccination rate."For only one in five health workers, that's a new low," said Huish, who is writing two books on COVID 19 and the response by governments to the pandemic, including the use of vaccines."Physicians are usually at the highest rate of those who go for flu shots or vaccines, whereas nurses [are] lower. And then health aides and even paramedics are the least likely to participate in that."Mandatory vaccinations consideredIn 2019, Strang suggested mandatory vaccinations might be needed in response to a 41 per cent flu vaccination rate for health-care workers classified as acute-care staff.Given the province's experience with the COVID-19 vaccination program, and the ongoing controversy over vaccines, the province's top public health official is no longer convinced that's the answer."That mandatory policy was very justified in an acute pandemic," said Strang. "It's harder to justify those mandatory approaches in a non-pandemic time. But we certainly need to look at all ways that we could use to get more health-care workers and the general population vaccinated."Both Hazelton and Huish think the same way."I think in order to make something mandatory there has to be a health crisis like COVID, and even that met with a fair bit of resistance," said Hazelton. "I don't think the flu shot is something that we should mandate."Huish said "there's a bit of saltiness still in the air for some health workers after the COVID-19 pandemic, where their employers said you must be vaccinated or you can pack your bags and leave.""And a lot of nurses," he said, "a lot of paramedics [and] other people who work in the health system as well, chose to say no."All three agree that educating people and making the vaccine readily available will convince more health workers to get their flu shots.Why aren't more health-care workers getting their flu shots this year?10 months agoDuration 5:36Increasingly more health-care workers aren't getting the flu shot, with fewer than one in four Nova Scotia Health employees having gotten their flu shots since September.

By DR. ITAI GAL JANUARY 3, 2024 19:07 Flu and cold season is here. Prepared accordingly (photo credit: HERBALIFE, PR) Predictions about winter illnesses are materializing. With the Gaza and Northern conflicts and low vaccination rates, both coronavirus and flu are rapidly spreading. Health Ministry data indicates a sharp rise in adult and child morbidity. Concurrently, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) virus infections, which cause severe illnesses in infants and children, are also rising significantly.Hospitals are now treating hundreds of infants and elderly with severe pneumonia. Laboratory tests have identified influenza virus types A and B, coronavirus, and positive RSV virus samples. Community clinics have also reported a high number of patients with coronavirus, flu, and RSV.This spike in infections correlates with the population's alarmingly low vaccination rates. For instance, out of 500,000 vaccines ordered by Maccabi Health Services, only 347,000 people have been vaccinated. This figure is about 100,000 lower than last year’s flu vaccinees. At Clalit, just 150,000 out of 260,000 available doses have been used, marking a 14% decrease from last year. Similarly, at Leumit, only 65,000 of the 120,000 ordered vaccines have been administered, down from 74,000 last year. Overall, about 775,000 individuals have been vaccinated at Clalit, a 15% drop from the previous winter. The situation with coronavirus vaccinations is even more dire. Health Ministry data shows that only about half a percent of Israelis are currently vaccinated against the virus. Approximately 70% were vaccinated in the past, but their immunity is now ineffective against the new strains. The majority of the vaccinated are elderly, aged 70 and above.This very low vaccination rate is not unique to Israel but is a worldwide trend as the virus continues to mutate. The latest strains, JN1 and HV1, part of the Omicron family, are spreading rapidly in the United States and replacing previous variants. In Israel, the JN1 strain has been detected in hundreds, causing new symptoms like anxiety and sleep disorders. Unlike previous variants, loss of taste and smell is less common with this strain.Dr. Roni Ferber, Director of Public Health at Clalit, noted, "The flu arrived a bit late this year, leading to a false sense of security among the public." Since the start of the conflict, there has been a noticeable decrease in vaccination rates among most risk groups. The recent weeks have seen an uptick in flu cases, leading to hospitalizations and straining the healthcare system. The flu vaccine has proven 67% effective in preventing hospitalizations and severe cases among those vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. Annually, the flu, a disease caused by the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses (influenza A, B, and C), claims millions of lives globally. Man with flu working in the office (credit: INGIMAGE)Preventative Measures to Avoid Hospitalization:- Vaccination: Health funds still have a significant stock of flu and coronavirus vaccines. Even if vaccinated against the flu last year, immunity wanes after a year. Past coronavirus infections do not confer immunity against new strains. Vaccination is especially critical for high-risk groups like infants, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses. - Home testing: If symptoms like high fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or vomiting occur, perform a home antigen test for corona. Home tests for flu and throat inflammation are also available. If positive, stay home and consult your doctor.- Online consultation: Health funds offer 24-hour online medical advice and nurse hotlines. Some also provide the "Tytocare" device for complete physical examinations at home.- Medications delivered: Health organizations now deliver medications to your home. Check your medication stock, validity, and order as needed. Delivery costs around 30 shekels, free for the elderly. Stay updated with the latest news!

Practice good hygiene, like sneezing into your elbow, and frequent hand washing.- Managing symptoms: Fever can be treated with over-the-counter medications. For cough and shortness of breath, saline inhalations can be helpful. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist.- Emergency care: Visit the emergency room for serious symptoms like prolonged high fever, rapid breathing, severe dehydration, or unexplained bleeding. Always consult your health fund's nurse hotline or online doctor service first. These practical steps and heightened awareness can help mitigate the impact of flu and coronavirus, ensuring better health and safety for all.

(Ben Nelms/CBC)Social SharingA third child has died in British Columbia due to complications linked to influenza, cases of which continue to rise in the province.The latest update from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control says it received three reports of influenza-related deaths in children under the age of 10 during the final week of 2023.It says that means influenza was a contributing factor but not necessarily the primary cause of death in the children.The centre previously said on Dec. 29 that two children had died in the preceding two weeks and early findings indicated secondary bacterial infections had contributed to their severe illness, which can be a complication of the flu.Thursday's report says cases of influenza are rising in B.C., along with RSV, while hospitalizations and deaths linked to COVID-19 have decreased since early November.2 B.C. children have died from influenza amid rise in cases: B.C. Centre for Disease ControlThe centre says there are currently 219 people in hospital with COVID-19 throughout the province, with 26 in critical care.It says in its first weekly summary since Dec. 21 that admissions to critical care have remained stable since early November.It adds that COVID-19 was not found to be the underlying cause of death in 59 per cent of people who died within 30 days of a positive test over the last six months.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia Drought state of emergency enters 15th week in central B.C. village Conservation group buys out hunting rights in B.C.'s Great Bear Rainforest to protect wildlife The first legal Vancouver pot shops opened 5 years ago.

(Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) By Rong-Gong Lin IIStaff Writer Jan. 2, 2024 Updated 11:02 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print California’s hospitals are getting busier with more COVID-19 and flu patients, some of whom are suffering from both viruses at the same time.The simultaneous sickness is another wrinkle in an already hectic respiratory virus season. Although hospitals are not nearly as crowded as during the emergency phase of the pandemic, they are becoming increasingly so — with Los Angeles County recently entering the “medium” COVID-19 hospitalization category outlined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the first time this winter. “Some of these patients are testing positive for more than one virus — influenza definitely likes to travel with COVID. [And] we’re seeing an outbreak of RSV,” said Dr. Daisy Dodd, an infectious disease specialist with Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Advertisement The viral cocktail could also include coronavirus or flu with RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, simultaneously. Sometimes a common cold virus, like rhinovirus, is in the mix. California Everyone in California seems to be sick with respiratory illness. Here’s why COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are all on the rise or at a high level in California and elsewhere. Dec. 27, 2023 And it’s not just the very young and the very old who are getting hit with a double whammy of disease — younger and middle-aged adults have also been afflicted. Dodd said she’s seen some patients reporting fevers lasting more than a week.“Now it seems like everyone has this hacking cough that doesn’t want to go away,” she said. “It’s making them fairly sick and ... it’s not very gentle.” Advertisement For many of the patients who need medical attention, “they’re miserable. No doubt about it.”It’s hard to say why doctors are seeing a number of viral co-infections this winter, experts say. “Is it that one lowers the immunity and allows them to catch the other one easily? Don’t know the answer,” Dodd said. “But we’re seeing a lot of ‘double whammies’ going around.” Advertisement California A new coronavirus variant may be behind California’s COVID rise Coronavirus transmission is once again spiking in California entering the winter holiday season — and the new JN.1 subvariant may be partly to blame.Dec. 23, 2023 L.A. County’s entry into the “medium” COVID-19 hospitalization category has prompted local public health officials to order hospitals, nursing homes and any other inpatient facility to require healthcare employees mask up while in patient-care areas. Visitors to those facilities are also required to mask up in the same areas. When a county enters the “medium” COVID-19 hospitalization level, those at high risk of getting very sick should wear a high-quality mask — such as a KF94, KN95, or N95 mask — when indoors in public, the CDC says. The agency also says that those who live with, or have social contact with, someone at high risk should consider getting a rapid COVID test before meeting with them, and consider wearing a mask when meeting with them indoors. A negative rapid COVID test result helps reduce, though does not entirely eliminate, the risk of passing along a coronavirus infection. There is a chance that a single rapid test may not detect an infection in its initial stages.Multiple tests over a time period, such as over two or three days, can be helpful, “especially when the people using the tests don’t have COVID-19 symptoms,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. California COVID, flu, RSV on the rise in California. Is another ‘tripledemic’ coming? California’s respiratory virus season is ramping up, prompting officials to renew their calls for residents to get vaccinated in hopes of reducing pressure on hospitals.Dec. 5, 2023 More infected people are being admitted into California’s hospitals. For the week that ended Dec. 23, 3,279 coronavirus-positive patients were newly admitted statewide, up 14% from the prior week and the highest weekly tally in 10 months. Advertisement New hospitalizations remain considerably lower than last winter’s peak, however. And a number of hospitals are not seeing signs of a COVID-19 surge in their intensive care units. “Our ICUs are busy, but they’re not overwhelmed with COVID,” said Dr. Tevan Ovsepyan, medical director of the hospitalist program at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. Still, the sickness season continues apace. California’s level of flu-like activity — which includes nonflu illnesses such as COVID-19 — recently rose to “very high,” one of the worst levels as defined by the CDC, for the first time this winter. Ovsepyan said that at his hospital, there was an uptick in coronavirus-positive patients about a week and a half ago that has tapered off as of Friday. But, he said, “I don’t know what the future will hold, because ... we have New Year’s ... and people are getting together. So I’m sure we’ll probably see a little uptick.” For the week that ended Dec. 23, California had a “very high” level of flu-like activity, which includes nonflu illnesses such as COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Other areas in California that are in the CDC’s “medium” COVID-19 hospitalization category include the four-county area around the state capital — Sacramento, Placer, Yolo and El Dorado counties — and several counties in the rural north: Butte, Tehama and Glenn. The rate at which lab specimens are coming back positive for the coronavirus and flu is continuing to rise in L.A. County. For the week that ended Dec. 23, the most recent available, 23% of specimens tested at surveillance labs came back positive for flu, a jump from the prior rate of 18%. As for COVID-19, 12% of specimens are coming back positive for the coronavirus, an increase from the prior week’s 11%. RSV, which can cause severe illness and death, especially among babies and older people, has plateaued at a high rate countywide, with 10% of specimens coming back positive over the most recent week. The positive test rate has stayed within 10% and 15% in recent weeks, a relatively high rate compared with the prior six years, but still below last year’s terrible RSV season, when the positive test rate exceeded 20%.For the week that ended Dec. 4, L.A. County averaged five COVID-19 deaths a day, up from an average of two in mid-November, though still below last year’s numbers. Advertisement California COVID-19 and flu cases are rising in California. How bad will the holiday uptick be? COVID-19 and flu are rising across California, sparking new warnings from health officials to take precautions as the wider winter holiday season looms. Dec. 16, 2023 In terms of severe illness and deaths, hospitals are in a better place than the terrible first winter of the pandemic and the initial Omicron wave the year after. “Omicron was just horrible. It was a terrible time, because we were just overwhelmed with COVID-positive then, and people were sick,” said Ovsepyan, who is also chair of the hospital medicine department at Facey Medical Group, which has outpatient clinics in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Simi valleys.Ovsepyan urged people to be responsible and stay home if sick. And if you must leave the house and go anywhere there’s a crowd and have symptoms such as sniffles, “wear a mask,” Ovsepyan said. “With time, people have had this COVID fatigue, and the fatigue of masks. That’s all reasonable,” Ovsepyan said. “But it’s still a virus. It still causes illness. It’ll be harmful for our frail patients, our elderly or people with co-morbid diagnosis ... those are the people who end up getting hospitalized.” California New COVID vaccines are here: Now’s the time to get one, officials say Only 5% of Californians have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine since it became more widely available earlier this month, and health officials say that’s not good enough.Oct. 27, 2023 People might initially shrug off a little sniffle or a tiny sore throat. But that can be the beginning of a full-fledged viral illness, and it would be “fabulous” if those who feel that start wearing a mask as soon as possible to protect others around them, Dodd said. “Probably 95%, if not more, of respiratory infections, you feel it in your throat to begin with,” she said. Advertisement It’s likely a combination of factors that has led COVID-19 to be less deadly than it used to be, including protection provided by vaccinations and lingering immunity from infection, as well as the development of anti-COVID drugs that can be taken after infection.But health officials worry about the lackluster utilization of those drugs, as well as lagging uptake of the latest COVID vaccines. The CDC urges virtually everyone age 6 months and older to get a fresh COVID-19 vaccination this winter, as well as the seasonal flu shot. California COVID-19 vaccines easier to get in L.A. County; shots are free at all public health centers The updated COVID-19 vaccine is now available at all eight of L.A. County’s public health centers as well as clinics near Watts and East L.A.Oct. 11, 2023 RSV immunizations are also available for babies, those who are pregnant and people age 60 or older.Officials urge more widespread use of antiviral drugs such as Paxlovid that can reduce symptom severity and the risk of hospitalization and death. They’re best taken early on, but many people aren’t doing so, or their healthcare providers aren’t prescribing them. “There is an ample supply of COVID-19 therapeutic agents, but they have been underused,” the California Department of Public Health said in a health advisory. “Lack of familiarity with new medications ... and the misperception of drug scarcity have contributed to low treatment rates, including reports of eligible patients ultimately being denied treatment.”California still offers a free telehealth service through Sesame Care, where sick people can talk to a healthcare provider by phone or online and get a prescription, if eligible. (A copay might be needed to pick up the prescription.) That service is available to Californians age 12 and up, regardless of insurance status, until February, by calling (833) 686-5051 or visiting sesamecare.com/covidca. Advertisement L.A. County residents can do the same by contacting the county’s Public Health Call Center at (833) 540-0473, which is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The county says free and low-cost treatment is available for eligible patients, including those who are uninsured or on Medi-Cal. A program funded by the National Institutes of Health, featured at test2treat.org, gives adults who test positive for COVID-19 or flu free access to telehealth care and treatment. That program is expected to run through the early summer. Adults who aren’t positive can still enroll to get free tests shipped to them if they are uninsured or underinsured; on Medicare or Medi-Cal; or in the healthcare system of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service.The U.S. government is also allowing residents to order free at-home COVID tests through COVIDtests.org. People are able to order four free at-home tests per household. And if they didn’t already place an order between Sept. 25 and Nov. 19, they’re eligible for two separate orders of four tests.

Read our privacy policyCovid-19 and flu cases were on the rise as the holiday season came to a close last week, according to newly released government data.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of weekly flu hospital admissions continues to rise across the country. In the last week, 20 children have died from influenza-associated conditions.The agency is estimating that at least 7.1 million people in the US have contracted influenza so far during the 2023-2024 season, with about 73,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 total deaths. The most commonly reported virus is H1N1.The CDC recommends that individuals older than six months obtain an annual flu vaccine as the illness continues to spread. Additionally, it’s possible to obtain prescription flu antiviral drugs that can treat flu illnesses.Wheezing, a sore throat and fever could be indications that the sufferer has contracted the illness. The symptoms could also be indicative of other types of sickness, such as respiratory syncytial virus or strep throat.Other types of symptoms common with strep throat include painful swallowing, red and swollen tonsils, swollen lymph nodes, and headaches.As a result, anyone should consider being seen by a medical professional if they exhibit the symptoms.To avoid contracting the flu, medical professionals suggest wearing a mask and using proper hand hygiene, including hand sanitizer and regular hand washing.More aboutFluCovidCDCCenters for Disease Control and PreventionJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/0Covid and flu are rising.

How to avoid the flu, RSV, COVID-19 'tripledemic' - ABC7 New York 24/7 LiveNew York CityNew JerseyLong IslandNorthern SuburbsConnecticutWelcome, Mickeymickey@disney.comManage MyDisney AccountLog Out HEALTH & FITNESSHow to avoid the 'tripledemic' of RSV, COVID-19, fluByJonny Harvey Friday, January 5, 2024Respiratory illnesses on the rise throughout the USRespiratory illnesses are on the rise throughout the U.S.Respiratory illnesses are on the rise throughout the United States, and health officials are warning of a tripledemic. They recommend taking action to mitigate the spread of airborne illnesses.Here's what we know about the tripledemic and healthy habits to avoid catching respiratory illnesses this season.What is a tripledemic?Though it's not an official scientific term, a "tripledemic" represents the spread of three major viruses during this respiratory illness season: flu, COVID-19 and RSV. The medical community refers to the season of respiratory illnesses as "respiratory illness season."How serious is this respiratory illness season?Public health experts say it's difficult to compare this respiratory illness season to previous years as COVID-19 emerged as a new threat over the last three years. During the height of the COVID pandemic in the 2020-2021 flu season, there was limited to no flu activity.Now, the U.S. is beginning to return to seasonal trends with all three of the viruses circulating. Last year was an unprecedented early season."A steady increase in respiratory illnesses is a common annual trend, typically fueled by holiday gatherings and travel. This year is no exception," said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and ABC News medical contributor. "With January and February often marking the peak of such illnesses, it's crucial to exercise heightened vigilance now."Risks of each tripledemic illnessEveryone is at risk of getting any of theses illnesses. Some areas are dealing with more flu, others with more COVID, others with more RSV.Adults over 65 have the highest rates of flu and COVID hospitalizations, while kids under 4 have the highest rates of RSV hospitalizations. Adults over 65 continue to have the highest rates of death due to any respiratory virus. COVID remains the main driver of all viral respiratory deaths.What are the symptoms of each illness?Each virus has very similar symptoms. There is no real way to tell what you have unless you get tested. There are COVID at-home tests readily available. Some over the counter flu/COVID tests are also available. RSV is typically tested for at the hospital or medical clinic.Symptoms of COVID-19, RSV, and FluABC News Photo Illustration, CDC, Mayo ClinicCOVID-19 symptoms include:CoughBrief feverShortness of breathAbdominal painLoss of taste or smellCongestionFatigueSore ThroatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaMuscle or body achesHeadacheFlu symptoms include:FeverChillsHeadacheRunny noseNauseaFatigueLoss of appetiteSore throatRSV symptoms include:Runny noseDecreased appetiteCoughingSneezingFeverWheezingMORE: Everything you need to know about RSV symptoms, treatments, shotsHealth workers are preparing for a possible "tripledemic" of flu, COVID-19, and RSV this winter.

Sometimes, viruses can be spread by touching a surface and then touching your own mouth, nose or possibly eyes.Respiratory illness activity generally tends to begin in the South and migrates West and North across the U.S. The Centers for Disease control updates data for what states are dealing with high/very high activity.

Nic Coury—Bloomberg/Getty ImagesMore U.S. hospitals are requiring masks and limiting visitors as health officials face an expected but still nasty post-holiday spike in flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses. While many experts say this season likely won’t prove to be as deadly as some other recent winters, it still could mean hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and many thousands of deaths across the country. New York City last week instituted a mask mandate for the city’s 11 public hospitals. Similar measures were ordered last week at some hospitals in Los Angeles and Massachusetts. Some hospitals reinstated masking rules for employees months ago, in anticipation of a seasonal rush of sick people. Flu and COVID-19 infections have been increasing for weeks, with high levels of flu-like illness reported in 31 states just before Christmas. Updated national numbers are to be released Friday, but health officials predict infections will grow in many states well into January. “What we’re seeing right now, in the first week of January, is really an acceleration — of flu cases, in particular,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is some good news. Flu and COVID-19 cases may peak by the end of the month and then drop, Cohen said. Though the flu has been skyrocketing, this year’s cases are being caused by a strain that usually doesn’t cause as many deaths and hospitalizations as some other versions. What’s more, signs suggest current flu vaccines are well-matched to the strain. “I don’t think it’s going to be overwhelming,” said Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. He deemed the current season “moderately severe.” The CDC is pointing the public to an agency website where people can look up their county, which can help them make decisions about whether to wear masks or take other precautions. Cohen urged people to get vaccinated and to seek treatment for flu and COVID-19. Vaccinations are down this year, officials say. About 44% of U.S. adults had gotten flu shots by Dec. 23, according to the most recently available CDC vaccination survey data. Only about 19% of U.S. adults were reported to have received an updated COVID-19 shot as of early December. COVID-19 cases are causing more severe disease than the flu but have been rising less dramatically. Health officials are keeping an eye on JN.1, a new version of the ever-evolving coronavirus. The omicron variant was first detected in the U.S. in September and just before Christmas accounted for an estimated 44% of COVID-19 cases. The JN.1 variant may spread easier or be better at evading our immune systems, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease than other recent variants, health officials say. Current evidence indicates vaccines and antiviral medications work against it. The CDC also has reported disappointing vaccination rates against another seasonal bug, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That is a common cause of mild cold-like symptoms, but it can be dangerous for infants and older people. RSV cases rose in the fall but appear to have plateaued and are even going down in some places, according to the latest data. At Hillsdale Hospital in southern Michigan, a 65% increase in respiratory illness activity in late December triggered a limitation to visitors in the birthing center. Only a spouse, a support person and grandparents can visit. They all must wear a mask and not show symptoms of sickness. The restriction is common for the hospital around this time of year, said Dr. Nichole Ellis, a pediatrician who is the hospital’s medical chief of staff. But it’s more difficult this season, she added. “In the past, we would have one … disease that we were tracking or monitoring at one time,” Ellis said. “But now, babies and children will have multiple diseases at the same time. It’s not that they just have RSV … but they’re getting RSV and COVID at the same time, or influenza and RSV at the same time because all of the diseases are prevalent in our community.”A newsletter for the boldest, brightest leaders: CEO Daily is your weekday morning dossier on the news, trends, and chatter business leaders need to know.

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the presence of the virus was confirmed on January 3 in Papineau Regional County Municipality in Quebec. The size of the flock and the type of poultry operation involved was not reported.The confirmed case is the 44th case in Quebec since the start of the 2022-2023 HPAI outbreak. The last reported case in Quebec was located at a commercial poultry farm in Les Maskoutains, reported on December 4.Canada had 103 poultry flocks lost to HPAI in 2023, down from 190 reported flocks in 2022. Most provinces have also saw a year-over-year decrease. Quebec is the exception with 27 affected flocks in 2023, but 15 in 2022.Changing approach to HPAI controlHPAI vaccination may be necessary to stop the spread of the virus globally, reported a recently published policy brief from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). When implemented properly, vaccination against HPAI should not impact safe trade, it added.“There has been a global rise in HPAI outbreaks and an increase in the genetic diversity of circulating virus strains. Thus, the use of sanitary control measures alone may no longer be a sustainable solution to effectively contain the disease,” the statement said.“However, poultry vaccination can no longer be excluded from the available alternatives and should be considered a complementary tool.”To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

By Staff Author and Chuck Abbott Chuck Abbott The slow-talking son of an Illinois farm family, Chuck Abbott covered U.S. food and agriculture policy in its many forms since 1988, from farm bills (six so far) and crop insurance reform to school lunch, ag research, biofuels and the Dietary Guidelines. Editor of the daily electronic newsletter Ag Insider published by the Food and Environment Reporting Network and contributor to agriculture.com. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on January 5, 2024 Close Photo: Sansubba / Getty Images One-fourth of U.S. losses to bird flu in outbreaks that began in early 2022 were recorded in the past three months, when the viral disease staged a resurgence, according to USDA data released on Thursday. Some 20.9 million birds were culled in infected domestic flocks from October through December to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Bird flu hit egg farms so severely in 2022 that egg prices soared 32% above the 2021 average, the largest increase for any of the food categories tracked by the USDA during a year of high food inflation. With flocks rebuilt, egg prices rose only marginally in 2023 and are forecast to fall 12% this year. “HPAI was confirmed in egg layers in November 2023 for the first time since December 2022. Price impacts of the outbreak will be monitored closely,” said USDA economists two weeks ago. A total of 79.7 million domestic birds, mostly egg-laying hens and turkeys being raised for human consumption, have died from HPAI or in eradication efforts since the first confirmed outbreak on Feb. 8, 2022. Since then, the disease has been confirmed in 1,059 flocks in 47 states. Because bird flu can wipe out a flock quickly, standard practice for agricultural officials is to kill all the birds in an infected flock and monitor nearby farms in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. Some owners of large poultry operations have received millions of dollars in indemnities for the loss of flocks due to HPAI in 2022 and 2023. Rembrandt Enterprises in Iowa received $17.3 million, Cold Spring Egg Farm in Wisconsin received $12.1 million, and Sunrise Farms in Iowa received $6.6 million, according to California veterinarian Crystal Heath, who filed a public records request for the information. “Killing animals is big business — a big taxpayer-subsidized business. You are paying for it whether you eat animals or not,” said Heath on social media. USDA press aides were not immediately available to discuss HPAI indemnities or modifications to the department’s HPAI database, which is now focused on recent outbreaks, especially those occurring in the past 30 days. “While it also includes summary data compiled since the outbreak began, looking at cases confirmed over the last 30 days provides the best picture of how the virus is currently impacting U.S. birds,” said the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which compiled the database. “We expect the number of cases to ebb and flow as the level of virus continues to change in different areas based on wild bird movement.” HPAI is most prevalent during the cold months. Officials say the disease is spread by migratory waterfowl. They advise owners to keep their flocks away from wild birds and to follow biosecurity practices, such as changing footwear, to prevent accidental contamination of bird housing. The ongoing HPAI outbreak is the worst U.S. animal disease event ever and is far larger than the 2014-15 outbreak that killed 50 million birds in commercial flocks. Was this page helpful?

(Spectrum News 1 file photo) Saint Vincent Hospital sees spike in respiratory illnesses By Spectrum News Staff Worcester PUBLISHED 4:33 PM ET Jan. 05, 2024 PUBLISHED January 5, 2024 @4:33 PM SHARE WORCESTER, Mass. â Saint Vincent Hospital, like other health care facilities in the state, says they've seen a large increase in respiratory illnesses following the holidays. The Worcester hospital says they're treating people with RSV, COVID-19 and influenza, as well cases of pneumonia. Chief of emergency medicine Dr. Adam Darnobid said some patients are coming in with a combination of more than one illness. He said there are ways to avoid becoming seriously ill. "Wear your mask, wash your hands, get your vaccines,â Darnobid said. âI would encourage people to keep themselves and their families safe. If you have loved ones who can get sick, I would be cognizant of that. âSwab yourself, see if you're positive before you go for a family dinner or go out with them. And if you're not feeling well, I would consider changing your plans or wear a mask when you're in close proximity to somebody who might get sick from these illnesses."

Between Dec. 16 and 30, 2023, the dashboard added 762 hospitalizations, which included Albertans of all ages. Albertans under 90 years old were among the intensive care unit admissions that jumped by 77 in that same time period.The cumulative 2,220 influenza hospitalizations and 248 flu ICU admissions this respiratory virus season have already surpassed last season’s.The annual respiratory virus season usually starts near the end of August.In the last two weeks of influenza reporting, the number of total deaths attributed to the flu nearly doubled, from 44 to 80. Those new deaths were counted among Albertans 40 and older. 2:26 Health Matters: Death of third child in B.C. linked to flu H1N1 has been driving much of this early wave of flu cases. Story continues below advertisement Positivity rates and weekly lab-confirmed cases of influenza have been trending down since an early-December peak. But in past years, Alberta has seen a second, smaller wave of influenza cases creep up.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) appears to be the next virus gaining steam in the community, as positivity rates and lab-confirmed cases have been increasing since the fall.

As of Dec. 30, 2023, there were 179 RSV patients in hospital and 12 in ICUs – the first time the respiratory virus dashboard showed RSV hospitalizations since its launch.Provincewide, RSV positivity was at 9.2 per cent at the end of 2023, with the Calgary Zone having the highest positivity rate at 13.7 per cent. 1:54 Low vaccine uptake fuels spike in respiratory illnesses: health officials COVID-19 continued to hospitalize and kill Albertans through the holiday season. Story continues below advertisement In the last two weeks of December 2023, 294 new hospitalizations and 20 more ICU admissions were added to the records. And 55 more COVID-attributed deaths were accounted for, all in Albertans aged 40 or older.Throughout this respiratory virus season which started on Aug. 27, 2023, Alberta has averaged three COVID-attributed deaths a day.Since the start of the pandemic, 6,220 Albertans have had their deaths registered as caused by the airborne vasculotropic disease.The Public Health Agency of Canada says the use of respirators, like NIOSH-certified N95 or certified KN95, can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, guidance that matches with what aerosol scientists say about preventing airborne diseases. Vaccination rate still low More than a million influenza vaccine doses have gone into arms this season, but the overage coverage rate in Alberta remains among the four lowest seasons since 2010 at 23.5 per cent. Story continues below advertisement And COVID-19 vaccinations have been going out at a slower rate, despite being reformulated to target XBB subvariants. Only 16 per cent of Albertans have rolled up their sleeves to get a COVID shot this season.On Friday, Alberta Health Services started administering the new Novavax vaccine that uses protein-based technology, rather than the mRNA technology in the Pfizer and Moderna doses. 2:16 Alberta’s immunization campaign raising questions According to Gerald Evans, an infectious disease specialist at Queen’s University, the updated XBB-targeting vaccinations should be effective against the JN.1 subvariant, which the Public Health Agency of Canada recently said is now the dominant strain in the country.Doctors and public health authorities say it is safe to get the influenza and COVID vaccine at the same time, and pharmacists have told Global News they have ample availability and appointments. Story continues below advertisement Alberta Health says Albertans can get their COVID shots as soon as three months since their last vaccination or infection, immunizations which protect against severe disease and hospitalization.–with files from Katie Dangerfield, Global News Related News JN.1 is Canada’s new dominant COVID-19 subvariant.

By Doyle DietzUPDATED: January 6, 2024 at 5:00 PM ESTAs a third generation operator of Martz’s Gap View Hunting Preserve in Northumberland County, Mike Martz was living the dream, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father.That dream turned into a nightmare when highly pathogenic Avian Influenza was discovered four years ago.Two weeks ago, HPAI was discovered in one of the pheasant pens at Martz’s, necessitating the ceasing of all activities, including field hunts, Continental hunts and trap shooting.Martz hopes some activities could resume before the scheduled closing in April and the business will be an exhibitor at the Great American Outdoor Show at Harrisburg in February.“This is the hardest event to unfold on our third-generation farm,” Martz said. “We still have many unknowns and we’re not quite sure what the immediate future holds. One thing we are most certain about is that there is hope. We must endure. We will rebuild our flock. We are blessed to have such an amazing, tight-knit network of breeders and community members.“While we are not the first farm or game breeder to have this catastrophic event hit their flock, we do feel we had an extraordinarily swift response that was due to the hard work, dedication, and grit of our employees, community members and case workers.”Because of the detection of HPAI at Martz’s, the Pennsylvania Game Commission adjusted its late-season pheasant stockings to help safeguard the agency’s pheasant program and better ensure it will continue next year in the 2024-25 hunting seasons.Over the last two weeks, the PGC released fewer pheasants statewide than initially planned, and in the eastern part of the state, pheasant releases occurred only last week, with properties that receive birds essentially seeing their final two releases of the year combined as one. These relatively minor adjustments, however, could significantly reduce the risk of an HPAI outbreak with potentially devastating impacts for pheasant hunters.While the pheasants released by the PGC originate from a different facility – Mahantongo Game Farm, where HPAI has not been detected nor suspected – that facility also is in Northumberland County.The proximity of HPAI to the facility represents a concern. If there were to be an HPAI outbreak there, agricultural regulations would require euthanasia of many or all of the breeding pheasants that provide stock for the PGC’s program, jeopardizing the program’s future.So, the agency is taking some precautionary measures.First, the agency will hold onto all of the hen pheasants and about 5% of the roosters that had been slated for release in the final two pheasant releases of 2023-24. Then, if HPAI remains undetected through continued testing of birds at Mahantongo Game Farm, pheasants there will be temporarily transferred to the PGC’s Loyalsock Game Farm.That’s why the counties served by Loyalsock got their final two releases as one last week to make room for those coming in. Loyalsock Game Farm serves Adams, Berks, Bradford, Carbon, Centre, Columbia, Cumberland, Franklin, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Monroe, Montgomery, Northumberland, Perry, Pike, Schuylkill, Snyder, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Union, Wayne, Wyoming and York counties.“This wasn’t a decision the Game Commission took lightly, because we know that pheasant hunters have been looking forward to the late small game season pheasant releases and will be inconvenienced by our making these adjustments on short notice,” PGC Wildlife Operations Division Chief Ian Gregg said. “We believe this precautionary approach is the right thing to do because it will significantly reduce the risk of disease impacts that would be far more devastating to pheasant hunting in the long run.”Martz said he extends his heartfelt appreciation to the outpouring of support shown that began within the first few hours of the announcement. Since then support and understanding has continued as they navigate through a difficult time.“We will do everything in our power and control to protect our employees, neighbors and customers during this process,” Martz said. “Information will be shared as it becomes available. In the interim, we are working diligently to reach out to those who had reservations with us.“This is a nightmare that came true.” Originally Published: January 6, 2024 at 12:00 PM ESTShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most PopularDowntown Wilkes-Barre upscale housing project moving forwardDowntown Wilkes-Barre upscale housing project moving forwardDown but not yet out, Sen.

Photo: ShutterstockHong Kong is set for a double whammy next week as the peak winter flu season is expected to begin, coinciding with a rise in Covid-19 infections, as per health officials.The officials called on the public, especially members of high-risk groups, yesterday to get flu and coronavirus shots to avoid serious conditions.“Based on the latest surveillance data, we soon, probably next week, may enter the flu surge period,” Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection’s communicable disease branch, said during a press conference.Allergies, a cold or coronavirus? How to tell the differenceThe prediction was based on two key indicators, according to Chuang. The first was the hospital admission rate of patients with a principal flu diagnosis, which had already exceeded the threshold signalling the start of a peak season. The second key indicator was the percentage of respiratory specimens handled by public laboratories, which was also approaching the threshold.“If both [indicators] are above the threshold, it means we have entered the flu surge period,” Chuang said.Currently, influenza A subtype H3 is the most prevalent type of flu virus in the city, making up about 80 per cent of infections. It is followed by influenza B and flu A subtype H1.Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the Centre for Health Protection’s communicable disease branch warned that the city will enter the flu surge period next week. Photo: Dickson LeeChuang said that serious flu cases had also been slightly increasing, with official data showing 23 were registered last week, up from 14 the week before.Health authorities noted the city was also recording more Covid-19 infections.“The overall active level of Covid-19 has also significantly increased,” Chuang said, stressing the viral load in sewage samples and the number of infection cases had risen.The viral load found in sewage samples surged by about 40 per cent between the December 24 to 30 period, compared with the week before. But serious and fatal Covid-19 cases had not significantly increased, she said.Southeast Asia stares at another Covid wave; calls grow for return of masksOfficials expected JN. 1, which the World Health Organization (WHO) listed as a “variant of interest”, could replace XBB to become the dominant Covid-19 strain in the city.“This variant has a growth advantage over other existing variants,” Chuang said, adding that a significant increase in the proportion of this strain out of all coronavirus infections overseas had been recorded within a short period of time.She said a similar phenomenon had also been observed in Hong Kong, adding that 60 per cent of patients’ specimens and 26 per cent of sewage samples had the emerging variant.“The WHO said no evidence showing JN.1 could bring extra public health risks globally, compared with other circulating strains such as XBB,” she said.High-risk groups have been asked to get vaccinations by health authorities. Photo: TNSThe inpatient bed occupancy rate at acute care hospitals stood at 116 per cent as of Wednesday, while that at paediatric departments was 92 per cent in the same period.The government has procured 200,000 doses of XBB vaccine, with priority vaccination given to the high-risk groups.Dr Albert Au Ka-wing, head of the centre’s emergency response and programme management branch, said about 20,000 doses had been administered since mid-December when the vaccine was made available.But he said the overall Covid vaccination rates among young and old people remained low. Only 30 per cent of children aged six months to three years had received the vaccine, while a quarter of elderly people aged over 80 had taken four or more doses.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

Here's how to avoid getting sick By Analisa Novak Updated on: January 3, 2024 / 12:38 PM EST / CBS News Respiratory viruses rise across the U.S. New year kicks off with a rise in respiratory virus infections and hospitalizations 02:54 As the new year gets underway, health officials are issuing a nationwide alert about a triple threat: The simultaneous spread of the flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting a significant rise in emergency room visits due to flu and COVID-19, while RSV infections continue to pose a serious risk — particularly to infants and the elderly.Dr. Celine Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor and KFF Health News editor-at-large for public health, said that the U.S. is seeing a flu spike and a rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations. "We've had 10,000 people across the U.S. die from COVID since November, so this is definitely not gone," said Gounder.More free COVID-19 tests can be ordered nowAre COVID-19 symptoms still the same? What to know about this winter's JN.1 waveWith symptoms often overlapping, Gounder said it was important to test to differentiate between the viruses. She also advocated for vaccination and the use of masks, such as N95s, as effective prevention strategies. "They will not necessarily prevent all infections, but they will prevent you from getting really sick. Especially if you're somebody who doesn't want to miss time at work or at school," said Gounder.Comparing the current situation to previous years, Gounder said that this season is better than the last couple since the pandemic started."Even before the pandemic bad flu season could really crush the hospital. In terms of the number of patients coming in. And so now you have a whole new virus on top of what we were seeing before. And so there's really not a lot of bandwidth to take on more patients if people get sick," said Gounder.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that during the week of December 23, there were more than 29,000 patients admitted to hospitals with COVID-19, about 15,000 admitted with the flu and thousands more with RSV. CDC data shows COVID-19 is currently the leading cause of respiratory illnesses with emergency department visits up 12%, hospitalizations up 17% and the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 up 10%. There have been at least 7.1 million people sick with the flu, 73,000 hospitalizations, and 4,500 deaths from influenza so far this season. RSV illnesses seem to be slowing down in some regions, but hospitalizations are up, especially in cases involving young children and older adults. And to add to the danger, pneumococcal pneumonia is worsening some cases. Some experts predict the numbers may go even higher due to the many gatherings of friends and families during the recent holidays. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO To help protect yourself, stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines. It’s not too late to get your flu vaccine. There are RSV immunizations available for infants, and if you are age 60 or older, there is a vaccine available to protect you from severe RSV. There are treatments available for COVID-19 ─ these should be started within five to seven days after you first develop symptoms. There also are prescription drugs to treat flu illness which should be started as early as possible and are especially important for higher risk patients. Free COVID-19 tests are also available; every home in the U.S. is eligible to order four free at-home tests. You can order here. Follow these steps to help prevent getting sick: Stay home if you are sick. Stay home if you have a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. Avoid contact with people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your shirt sleeve, not your hands. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with others, such as kissing, shaking hands and sharing cups and eating utensils. Clean frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and mobile devices. Many medical facilities are again requiring masks. The World Health Organization says masks can be part of your regimen, in addition to avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, proper handwashing and covering your coughs and sneezes.

Polk County Lakeland Regional Health sees COVID-19 and flu cases double over the holidays by: Staci DaSilva Posted: Jan 2, 2024 / 04:05 PM EST Updated: Jan 3, 2024 / 05:07 PM EST by: Staci DaSilva Posted: Jan 2, 2024 / 04:05 PM EST Updated: Jan 3, 2024 / 05:07 PM EST SHARE LAKELAND, Fla. (WFLA) — Dr. Tim Regan drove to work Tuesday mentally preparing himself for what he knew would be a busy day in the Lakeland Regional Health emergency room. “Right after New Years and there’s a lot of respiratory illness in the community, people have now shaken off their holiday and are looking to feel better. So we do see a lot of traffic through the emergency department this time of year,” said Dr. Regan, the hospital’s Chief Medical Officer. According to Dr. Regan, patients with COVID-19 and flu have doubled at Lakeland Regional Health, with those cases still making up less than 10% of total hospitalizations. New Florida laws in effect for 2024. Here’s what to know Most COVID-19 infections now are causing cold-like symptoms, he said, which can be treated with ibuprofen and decongestants. Patients are also coming in with RSV. “You tend to talk about RSV in children, but elderly people and people who are at risk for illness are at risk for RSV as well and it can have bad outcomes,” he said. Pamela Wood, who lives in Lakeland, said she had a persistent cough and her doctor tried everything to prevent her from getting RSV. “Just had a head cold and normally I can shake them off and this time I didn’t, had a bad cough. Went to the doctor and he gave me an antibiotic and steroid shot and meds,” she said. “When you get 70 years old, you can’t shake this stuff off like you could when you were younger.” Jo Hair, a snowbird who winters in Lakeland, said her family had a firsthand experience with severe respiratory illness. Woman sues dentist after 4 root canals, 8 dental crowns and 20 fillings in a single visit “We did have a child in the family up north that was hospitalized with RSV so it brings to light everybody should be paying attention, continue doing what you should be doing,” she said. Luckily, that infant recovered. Meanwhile, data from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention shows COVID-19 hospitalizations are “low” in all Florida counties except for Sarasota, Desoto and Charlotte counties, which are “medium.” When it comes to influenza, according to the CDC as of Dec. 23, Florida is at a “high” level of cases, surrounded by states at a “very high” level. “That is to be predicted this time of year, with influenza being very seasonal throughout central Florida. We’ve seen greater numbers of influenza which sort of correlates to years in the past,” said Dr. Jarett Gregory, an urgent care physician at Watson Clinic’s south campus. He said it is the combination of cooler weather, people traveling and visiting with family over the holidays and snowbirds coming to Florida that leads to the spike in illness. “We’ve certainly seen a higher number of acuity, higher number of cases, certainly quite a bit busier than we have been in the months previous,” said Dr. Gregory. He said the timing of a doctor’s visit is an important factor when it comes to getting effective treatment. “If a patient’s had cough, cold, fever or body aches for one to two days, they want to act more promptly rather than waiting. If they can be seen and evaluated over the next 24 to 48 hours treatment can be initiated and often make a big difference and help them to recover much more quickly,” said Dr. Gregory.

YonhapBy Lee Hae-rinPatients are struggling to find prescription and over-the-counter medicines in pharmacies amid a nationwide outbreak of influenza as well as a global drug shortage.“We have run out of supply for some prescription medicines for influenza, such as children’s fever reducer, lately. Some popular over-the-counter cold medicines like Theraflu have been in supply shortage as well,” a pharmacist who runs a drug store in central Seoul said on condition of anonymity, Thursday.Another pharmacist, who also asked not to be identified, said his pharmacy is “allocated with six boxes of nighttime and daytime Theraflu every day,” which are sold out almost instantly.“We have some over-the-counter cold medicines, but supplies for prescription drugs have been unstable for some time,” he said, citing global drug shortages and an import suspension as the main cause.The drug shortage comes as influenza cases continue to rise this winter.According to the Korea Pharmaceutical Information Service, Thursday, several flu medicines and fever reducers, including Tamiflu capsules and Tylenol tabs for children and adults, are listed as medicines of unstable supply and demand.Chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouracil (F-FU) is also in short supply, putting at risk anticancer treatments across the country.The nationwide influenza outbreak has arrived in the first winter without mask mandates since the COVID-19 pandemic.According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency’s latest report of surveillance statistics of infectious diseases, the country saw 54.1 cases of influenza-like illness in every 1,000 outpatients between Dec. 10 and 16.The figure fell slightly from the previous week’s 61.3 patients per 1,000 outpatients, which marked a record high since 2019. However, local clinics remain crowded with patients.The recent outbreak is due to a lack of immunity against respiratory diseases other than the coronavirus, according to experts.“For almost four years, people have not been exposed to influenza and cold viruses as they wore masks and took social distancing measures. Thus, people couldn’t naturally grow immune (to influenza), making the outbreak more virulent and contagious,” Chon Eun-mi, a respiratory disease specialist at Ewha Womans University said.In response, the health authorities formed a public-private consultative group to restore stability in the supply and demand of pharmaceuticals.The Ministry of Health and Welfare held a meeting with medical experts last month to discuss ways to tackle the drug shortage and decided to request pharmaceutical manufacturers to increase production while increasing drug prices to stabilize the market.However, some pharmacists call for the government to take stronger measures.“The government should have a clear understanding of the supply status of essential drugs at all times by monitoring manufacturers’ reports on production discontinuations and supply delays,” Lee Dong-geun, the leader of a civic group of pharmacists calling for a healthy society said.Also, the government should reveal the progress on its efforts to tackle the ongoing drug shortage with more transparency and announce any suspension of the drug supply through the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, Lee added. lhr@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in National 1Yoon practices golf in case of possible round with Trump2Seoul City to test UAM service next year for 2030 commercialization 3Police officer acquitted after alleged prostitution involvement during college years 4Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 5Chinese man released from police custody after questioning over filming NIS building with drone Top 10 Stories 1Yoon practices golf in case of possible round with Trump2Hiking in Seoul gains popularity among foreign visitors 3Seoul City to test UAM service next year for 2030 commercialization 4N.

Updated: Jan. 03, 2024, 1:52 p.m.|Published: Jan. 02, 2024, 5:02 p.m.Cases of respiratory infection are surging in New Jersey, likely circulated by holiday gatherings. (NJNP photo/Rich Krauss SL)SLBy Spencer Kent | NJ Advance Media for NJ.comYou’re sick. I’m sick. Your parents are sick. And the woman hacking in the movie theater across from me last night was definitely sick.Cases of respiratory infection — COVID-19, influenza and RSV — are all spiking in New Jersey, likely circulated by holiday gatherings.Hospitals throughout the state are seeing an increase in COVID-19 admissions. There’s also been a slight rise in deaths, experts say.Nearly 1,300 patients in New Jersey had tested positive for the coronavirus on Dec. 31, a jump of more than 40% from just before Christmas.About 250 COVID-19 patients alone were hospitalized Monday by RWJBarnabas Health’s 12 acute care facilities, according to Dr. Andy Anderson, the health system’s executive vice president and chief medical and quality officer.“Which is increasing,” he said. “If you look back a few weeks ago, it was in the low two hundreds. If you look back beyond that, it was even in the one hundreds, and even less than a hundred toward the end of the summer. So we’re clearly seeing more patients who are sick with COVID.”About 10% of hospitalized COVID patients at RWJBarnabas facilities are on ventilators — “a pretty high number,” Anderson said. There have also been COVID-related deaths over the past month at RWJBarnabas hospitals, he added, but he didn’t have an exact number.New Jersey has recorded nearly 100 COVID-19 deaths just within the past month, according to the state health department’s COVID dashboard.Atlantic Health — which operates seven hospitals in New Jersey — also said it’s seeing a rise in COVID-19, flu and RSV cases. The health system in a statement said that between those three viruses, its hospitals currently have a total patient population of around 300, which it called an “elevated number.”A spokeswoman for Hackensack Meridian Health declined to say how many COVID-19, flu and RSV patients were coming through its doors in recent days and weeks.Understanding hospitalization rates has been critical for experts, as tracking coronavirus cases post-pandemic has grown increasingly tricky.“It’s really difficult right now in terms of surveilling,” said Stephanie Silvera, an infectious disease expert and associate dean for research and faculty affairs at Montclair State University.To get a PCR test, you need insurance, she said. And more and more people are using at-home tests, which are not always available.“And even if you’re taking those, they’re not going into the (state and federal) data, so we don’t really have a sense of how much of the virus is circulating,” Silvera said.But experts are not blind to what’s unfolding. They are utilizing that hospitalization data as well as surveillance from a series of wastewater sites in the state, which provides a sense of spread in New Jersey.“All of those things are trending up,” Silvera said. “Deaths are trending up slightly — it’s not a huge increase, but any increase is something we don’t want to see.”But COVID-19 is hardly the only respiratory infection spreading. Cases of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are also rising across the state. And unless you get tested, it can be hard to distinguish which virus you’ve been infected with.It “really muddies the water,” Silvera said.Flu activity is now high in all regions of New Jersey. Nearly 20,000 positive cases have been reported, according to the state’s influenza tracker (PCR and rapid tests). RWJBarnabas is also seeing more flu patients — adult and pediatric — according to Anderson.But though hospital admissions are rising, there have been no flu-related pediatric deaths so far this season.“It has been trending up in terms of positive (flu) test rates. Outpatient treatment (and) hospitalizations have been trending up as well,” Silvera said.“As we get further away from pandemic mode … we’re going to continue to see a sort of fall back into a more typical (seasonal) pattern than we saw for the past few years,” she added.And RSV cases are higher than last year, according to experts.RECOMMENDED•nj.comField Hockey: Updated state tournament brackets through Nov. 6Nov. 7, 2024, 12:45 a.m.Boys Soccer state tournament preview, 2024: Breaking down the sectional quarterfinalsNov. 7, 2024, 6:30 p.m.“RSV, if we look at the year comparisons between this time last year and the year before, it is higher this year than it has been,” Silvera said.Our journalism needs your support.

But even in this post-masking era, we can still be considerate of othersFri 5 Jan 2024 10.26 GMTLast modified on Fri 5 Jan 2024 16.37 GMTShareWhen I was starting out in my career, back in the last century, an advertising campaign for Lemsip was running on public transport. “What sort of person goes to work with the flu?” asked the posters, with the take-no-prisoners answer, “The person after your job. Stop snivelling and get back to work.”That time now feels like ancient history – an era when even those of us with comfortable, keyboard-bound jobs couldn’t work remotely even if we didn’t have hard-as-nails jobseekers biting at our heels. Back then, I was one of those people who would go to work with a cold. I thought it showed grit and determination. Soon afterwards I sat next to a colleague who had cystic fibrosis, and it belatedly dawned on me that I wasn’t so indispensable as to have to risk other people’s health. Two decades later, the Covid-19 pandemic made sure everyone knew that. There’s nothing like watching deaths from an airborne respiratory illness climb to more than a thousand a day to ram home the message about keeping your germs to yourself.Now, though, that trend seems to have reversed. We’re currently at the height of the colds and flu season, and a fellow commuter openly sneezed at me yesterday. She looked up from her phone, held it at arm’s length and did a huge “atichoo!” right into my face. Just before Christmas, I was shouted at for wearing a mask on the London Underground. “It’s people like you who are fucking us all over,” said a woman on the Piccadilly line. “Slave to the government! Sheep!”In the week running up to Christmas there were 942 patients with flu in hospital in England each day, and 3,631 in hospital with Covid-19 over Christmas week – the latter up 57% from the same point in November. Cases of norovirus were also up 61% from the same period last year. This was all on my mind as I sat on a packed train for two and a half hours next to a man who repeatedly wiped his nose on the palm of his hand and then on to the table. It wasn’t deadly – at least, it wasn’t for me – but it was gross.What people seemed to understand before Covid, but seem reluctant to accept now, is that coughing and sneezing in public without covering your mouth is – at the very least – really bad manners. Have we been so traumatised by enforced mask wearing and staying indoors that we can’t bear to carry the burden of responsibility any longer? Has the availability of LFTs convinced us that a cough that hasn’t tested positive as Covid doesn’t count? Or is it from the sheer joy of being alive that some people so bountifully share their snot with their fellow travellers? It seems particularly obtuse when protecting others is so easy. If people really must go to work with a cold (and some people must), they can at least sneeze into their elbow, or a tissue, or anywhere that isn’t someone’s face.According to Adrian Martineau, professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, such simple precautions do work. There is good evidence that hand-washing reduces the risk of influenza infection, for instance. His other top tips for avoiding spreading colds, flu and Covid-19 this winter are: getting flu and Covid-19 jabs if you are eligible; working from home and reducing social contact if you have respiratory infection symptoms – especially if you may be in contact with someone who is particularly vulnerable; and wearing a face mask.NHS in England facing ‘storm of pressure’ as flu and Covid cases surgeRead moreTrish Greenhalgh, professor of primary healthcare sciences at the University of Oxford, adds that the best evidence shows that masks work to reduce transmission of all respiratory pathogens – flu, measles, TB, Covid and even the common cold. Of course, they only work when worn, and worn properly. “This sounds silly, but some of the controversy about masks stems from studies where people were advised to wear masks but few actually did,” she said.I’m still quite blase about catching a cold myself; despite starting my career in the 1990s I’m relatively young and healthy, and a week of nose-blowing won’t kill me. But the people I want to spend Christmases with are clinically vulnerable: one family member has pulmonary fibrosis; another has to take immunosuppressant medication. If I passed on an infection that sent them to hospital, could I forgive myself? And, if you gave me that infection in the first place, do you think I would ever forgive you?My parents remind me that when they were young, adverts and public health campaigns carried the information: “Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. Trap the germs in your handkerchief.” I wish we could go back to the public-spirited hygiene messages of the 1940s or 2020, and not be stuck with the revolting sneeze-sharing of the 1990s and now.

The bear was found dead in October near Utqiagvik in Alaska's northernmost community, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Polar bears endemic to the region are listed as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species for its loss of habitat — sea ice.The HPAI cade 2.3.4.4b has been circulating across the globe killing millions of birds and mammals. HPAI was first detected in the Arctic region in the second week of April 2023 among birds and a fox. Within two months, it was reported in a non-commercial backyard flock of chickens and ducks in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. It is suspected the virus travelled in the region via migratory birds.In these two months, it reportedly spread across different parts of the region as well as bird species such as bald eagles in Unalaska (in the Aleutian Islands) and Canada geese in the Anchorage area and Delta junction. Read more: H5N1 bird flu could wipe out thousands of penguins across Antarctica The death of the polar bear was confirmed in December 2023, after the samples of polar bear tissues collected in October showed presence of the virus. Speaking with news website Alaska Beacon, a veterinarian from Alaska state, Bob Gerlach, said, “This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere.”The bear is suspected to have contracted the disease after feeding on the carcass of an infected bird. Viruses tend to live longer on dead animals due to cold conditions, scientists said. “While polar bears normally eat seals they hunt from the sea ice, it appears likely that this bear was scavenging on dead birds and ingested the influenza virus that way,” Gerlach told Alaska Beacon. Numerous birds on the North Slope of various species have died from this avian influenza, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. The veterinarian said he suspected more bears have fallen prey to the disease but went unnoticed as they live in remote places with the presence of few people around. First reported in poultry, the HPAI outbreak of variant H5N1 started in 2021 after it spread rapidly among wild bird populations and spread to different parts of the world. In October 2023, it was reported to have reached the Antarctic region with infection found among brown skua on the bird islands of Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Read more: First cases of avian flu found in Antarctic region Scientists keeping close watch on the spread of infection in Antarctica assessed that during austral (Southern Hemisphere) spring, the contagion will spread in the dense populations of penguins in the peninsular region.If the virus happens to reach, it may lead to one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times, they warned.

Advancing public health AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Learn More The “low vaccination rates, coupled with ongoing increases in national and international respiratory disease activity caused by multiple pathogens, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), and RSV, could lead to more severe disease and increased health care capacity strain in the coming weeks,” says the advisory, which includes conversation guides, scripts and other tools for physicians and other health professionals to address the various reasons why patients forgo these essential vaccines. Doubts about safety and effectiveness of vaccines, vaccine fatigue and time constraints are common reasons for low uptake. But in some cases, it’s because physicians aren’t bringing the subject up with their patients. Doctors in particular “are the lynchpin” to patients getting vaccinated, said Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, director of the CDC. As one of the most trusted sources for patients, physicians can reframe conversations to encourage uptake, she said. Physicians, for example, can remind patients that the U.S. has distributed over 700 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. “Yes, it is new but is one of the most looked at and studied vaccines that we've had in history,” said Dr. Cohen, who joined Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, acting director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, for a fireside chat on the respiratory virus season. Sandra Fryhofer, MD, the AMA’s liaison to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and immediate past chair of the AMA Board of Trustees, moderated this event. It was sponsored by the AMA and Project Firstline, a national collaborative led by the CDC that provides infection-control training and education to front-line health care workers and public health personnel, and hosted on the AMA Ed Hub™. Respiratory virus cases are going up … Respiratory virus cases are going up … Combined trajectories on flu, COVID-19 and RSV aren’t that reassuring, although RSV is showing signs of a peak following six to eight weeks of rising infections. What doctors wish patients knew Subscribe for the answers to the latest questions patients are bringing to the exam room. Subscribe Now Flu season started just before Thanksgiving and has been rapidly accelerating. COVID-19, however, is yielding the most cases, hospitalizations, and deaths week after week. “We all wish we could leave COVID in the rearview mirror, but it is still here with us. We need to make sure that we are continuing to take it very seriously,” said Dr. Cohen. … But vaccine uptake is low … But vaccine uptake is low Seven million fewer flu vaccines were administered to adults in 2023 compared with 2022. Only 16% of adults have gotten the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The new RSV vaccine for adults 60 and over only has an uptake rate of 15–16%. Reasons for low uptake vary among the different vaccines. With COVID-19, it’s a question of trust. CDC survey data reveals that unknown serious side effects (18%) is the top concern, followed by vaccine effectiveness. For the flu vaccine, the majority (27%) said they hadn’t had the time to schedule an appointment. But for RSV, 29% said their physician never recommended any action. Thirteen percent said the RSV vaccine was too new. Visit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for physicians for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics. An opportunity for a conversation An opportunity for a conversation The voice of the physician matters so much in whether folks decide to get vaccinated, said Dr. Cohen. With flu and COVID-19 cases on an upward trajectory, “we have an ability to impact those two curves here in particular,” she added. The CDC has created evidence-based conversation guides that physicians can use to address patient questions and concerns. Part of this strategy is approach, said Dr. Cohen. Instead of asking a patient whether they want to get a flu shot during a visit, physicians instead can say, “Hey, you’re due for your flu or your COVID vaccine today. I’ve gotten them and I recommend them for you too,” noted Dr. Cohen. If patients are unsure about getting a vaccine, the physician can walk them through the evidence-based reasons for getting a vaccine, assuring them that side effects are usually mild and temporary. For patients who keep forgetting to schedule their shot, the CDC has new tools for reminder languages physicians can use via patient portal or by text. Persistence is also key, noted Dr. Daskalakis. Success may not happen during the first interaction. But if you don’t succeed on the first round, then “try, try again,” he urged. Transparent communication and putting vaccination on the agenda may lead to success on the second or third try.

That’s been the same for many years with flu, and it was quite similar to what we saw with COVID, although young kids weren’t so badly affected there, but that’s already what we’re seeing here. They’re the people who really we should have been reaching out to for vaccine techniques over the past few months,” Wolfe said.Influenza cases surpassed coronavirus and began to soar in mid-December, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, and historical data shows that flu peaks in January and February.Wolfe said hospitals are mostly seeing Influenza A.“That’s the more aggressive type typically. That’s always the one that always occurs here a little bit earlier as well, so we’re certainly seeing that. We see it both in pediatric cases but we also see it in elderly and at-risk patients as well so it is certainly being felt,” Wolfe said.Not COVID, flu or RSV: Two other respiratory viruses making the rounds in NCIn December, 21% of all emergency department visits in the past week were for respiratory illnesses. The rising numbers have prompted some hospitals to return to requiring masks and limiting visitation.Which hospitals are restricting visitors?Beginning Jan. 2, visitors in all WakeMed hospital patient care areas, including waiting rooms, must be at least 12 years old.Similar restrictions go into place Jan. 2 for UNC Hospitals’ Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, and Youth Behavioral Health campuses. Visitors 11 and younger are prohibited from all inpatient areas and all waiting rooms. Masks are strongly recommended for staff and encouraged for patients and visitors.Duke University Health System is limiting visitors to two at a time per patient beginning Jan. 3, and children under 12 are not permitted to visit hospitals or wards without prior approval from health care providers and for special circumstances.“Each year we see patients, who – whether they realize their symptoms are severe enough yet to be influenza or not – bring that into the hospital. We saw the same thing with COVID. I think where the age restrictions come into it is anyone who has kids or grandkids will know, the younger the child frankly the less they are aware of their symptoms and the less they control where their hands, their secretions, and frankly where their snot goes. They’re just not very good at managing that themselves,” said Wolfe.Visitors to Duke hospitals are urged to wear masks and to perform hand washing frequently.The hospital systems are all asking those with fever or respiratory illness symptoms – including cough or shortness of breath – to stay home unless seeking treatment by a doctor.Child's flu death a warning: Take these symptoms seriouslyOn Monday, UNC Rex Hospitals announced the following changes to their visitor policies at their main campus in Raleigh, Holly Springs Hospital and their clinics: .Visitors aged 11 and under will be prohibited from inpatient and all waiting roomsVisitors with respiratory symptoms are prohibited from the same areas.Normal visiting policies remain in effect for the remaining areas of the hospitals.Healthy visitors of any age remain welcome in the hospital lobbies and retail and food locations.Masks required at Cape Fear Valley HealthAcross the state, hospitals in the southeastern counties reported the highest percentage of people going to emergency departments with flu-like illness; that rate was lowest in North Carolina's far western and northeastern counties.Effective Dec. 28, masks are required for all patients and visitors in waiting rooms and other areas of the emergency departments of Cape Fear Valley Health, including Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayeteville, Bladen County Hospital, Hoke Hospital, Central Harnett Hospital and Betsy Johnson Hospital.All Cape Fear Valley Health locations, including outpatient clinics, are limiting visitors.In pediatric emergency departments, one parent or guardian is permitted in the waiting room, and two parents or guardians are allowed once the child is placed in a room.Patients 65 and older or those who are cognitively impaired are allowed to have a visitor with them in the waiting room and triage areas.Once a patient is assigned a room, adult patients will be allowed one visitor at a time.More On This watch · 1:44New hospital restrictions start Tuesday to safeguard against flu, COVID & RSVnull MINS AGO watch · 3:08Hospitals set limits on visits as flu spreadsnull MINS AGOrelatedface maskrsvCape Fear Valley HealthhealthfamilyTrending Duke rises to No. 6, UNC falls to No. 10 in AP Top 25 poll No. 9 NC State falls in Final Four rematch vs. No. 1 South Carolina South Carolina a unanimous No. 1 in women's AP Top 25, Stanford and Oregon crack rankings Man shot multiple times in east Raleigh, rushed to hospital for surgery40 MINS AGO Late comeback falls short, No. 11 Duke loses at No. 18 Maryland 85-80Videos watch · 2:01WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch · 1:21Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch · 1:05:14President Biden and VP Harris participate in Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony watch · 1:27Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 watch · 0:41Mega Millions Drawing•CreditsJessica PatrickWeb EditorJodi Leese GluscoWeb EditorGilbert BaezReporterGrace HaybaReporterMichael JoynerPhotographerCopyright 2024 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

It is not COVID-19, but flu viruses," says epidemiologist By M. Waqar Bhatti | January 03, 2024 The picture shows two people riding a motorcycle. — AFP/File Thousands of influenza-like illness cases reported in Pakistan.NIH says H3N2 sub-type of Influenza-A virus is causing illness.COVID-19 positivity remained less than 1% during last week. ISLAMABAD: The National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad has clarified that a type of influenza virus is causing severe respiratory illness in adults across Pakistan and not COVID-19, The News reported Wednesday. Thousands of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases are being reported daily in the country, said the health institute, adding that the H3N2 sub-type of Influenza-A virus is causing the illness. Among children, it is Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) which is leaving them sick across Pakistan, NIH officials said. They urged people to take precautionary measures, including coughing etiquette, to prevent themselves from contracting respiratory illnesses.“No, it is not COVID-19 that is making people sick these days in Pakistan. Our surveillance and testing indicates it is H3N2 sub-type of Influenza-A which is making people sick in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, many cities of Sindh and most of Punjab these days”, a senior official of NIH told The News.The health official said people were blaming COVID-19 for respiratory illnesses. COVID-19 positivity remained less than 1% during last week when only 16 cases were detected across Pakistan after 3,609 tests conducted, he claimed. The majority of people were neither getting tested for COVID-19 nor the influenza-like illness, he added.Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) were being reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the NIH official said.According to NIH data, around 46,000 cases of ILI were reported in the country except Punjab during the 49th week of the year. The highest number of ILI cases was reported from Sindh where over 25,000 were detected, KP reported 8,354 cases, Balochistan 7,856 cases and Azad Jammu and Kashmir 3,619 cases.Punjab, from where the bulk of respiratory illnesses are being reported, doesn’t share its data with NIH Islamabad. So, the authorities don’t have any idea of the respiratory disease burden in the largest province of Pakistan.Commenting on the influenza outbreak in Pakistan, renowned infectious diseases expert Dr Faisal Sultan said influenza was being diagnosed more (due to the availability of PCR at many centres). “It is sometimes prolonged with weeks of fatigue associated with it," he said."It’s known in some instances it can have a prolonged convalescence. Additionally, the vulnerable parts of the population — elderly or with other heart or lung conditions — will have more complications (bacterial pneumonia),” Dr Sultan said.Health experts and pulmonologists in Karachi also confirmed influenza A was most commonly detected in the city as compared to COVID-19. It was causing severe disease to elderly people with comorbid (having other diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc), they said."Mostly, it is influenza. We have seen entire families infected with flu-like symptoms in Karachi. We have found the Infleunza-A virus as the cause of respiratory illness, sometimes causing the hospitalisation of the elderly with comorbid. In young adults it is self-limiting, which means they recover on their own," Dr Raeef Ahmed, a pulmonologist in Karachi, said.He urged people not to use antibiotics for the treatment of flu, saying that they had found good results of an antiviral medicine Tammy Flu among hospitalised adults.To a query regarding the availability of flu shots or influenza vaccine, he said the vaccine was not available in the market. Now, it was a bit late to get vaccinated against the flu, he added.Renowned epidemiologist Dr Rana Muhammad Safdar urged people to adopt the same precautions they used during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent themselves from contracting the respiratory illness."Poor air quality, smog in Punjab, the federal capital, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other areas adds to chances of respiratory illnesses. It is not COVID-19, but flu viruses, which are making people sick," he said.Safdar advised the people to gargle with lukewarm salt water before going to bed to prevent chances of throat infection.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: Slight increase in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 25 to 31 December 2023 (week 52), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 338 cases, compared to 686 cases the previous week (-51%). The positivity rate fell to 20% compared to 26% the previous week. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased, which is probably linked to departures during the end-of-year holidays. A similar drop was also observed in 2022 during the end-of-year holidays. The latest sequencing data available for weeks 48-50 show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (60.9%) (95% CI 52.0-69.8%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.3%) (95% CI: 5.5-17.1%) and the XBB.1.9 variant (10.4%) (95% CI: 4.9-16.2%) [1]. It should be noted that the JN.1 variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant with an additional mutation on its spike protein. Influenza For the week of 25 to 31 December 2023 (week 52), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 332 cases from 375 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 16% compared to the previous week. These data largely overlap with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus, followed by SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 25 to 31 December 2023 (week 52), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 77 cases, compared with 141 the previous week, presenting an increase of 45%.

Canine Influenza Virus (CIV) is a relatively new discovery in the disease world, but it’s gaining momentum and hitching rides overseas as eagerly as college kids ready to study abroad. Here’s everything you need to know about dog flu, including some important info on the mystery canine respiratory disease currently affecting dogs all over the country, to protect the pup in your life.Meet the ExpertsDr. Zac Pilossoph is a consulting veterinarian at Healthy Paws Pet Insurance. He has spent years traveling the country, working with pets and pet parents to find holistic solutions to animal ailments.

Dr. Danielle Bernal is a global veterinarian with Wellness Pet Company and all about natural wellness to ensure long, healthy pet lives.UCG/Getty ImagesWhat Is Dog Flu?According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, CIV is a respiratory disease caused by two separate Type A viruses. (Type A means the virus can infect animals, and its strains are always changing.) The first virus, CIV H3N8, showed up in Florida in 2004. The other, CIV H3N2, was discovered in Asia in 2006. Merck Animal Hospital says that in 2007 in the U.S., only Florida and Tennessee reported cases of H3N8 in dogs. By 2014, 36 states confirmed infection from H3N8. The next year, Chicago experienced a huge outbreak of H3N2, the first time this strain was reported in the U.S. Since 2018, 46 states have claimed cases of one or both strains.Basically, CIV, or dog flu, is on the move.bymuratdeniz/Getty ImagesWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms of Dog Flu?Dr. Karen Stasiak, a veterinarian at the animal health care company Zoetis, says appetite loss, cough, lethargy and a runny nose can all indicate a dog flu infection. These symptoms can last for a few weeks and change depending on the strain. “As with flu in humans, symptoms and severity of infection may vary from dog to dog,” she adds.Other possible symptoms of dog flu include sneezing, watery eyes and labored breathing, according to Dr. Zac Pilossoph, a consulting veterinarian at Healthy Paws Pet Insurance.Dr. Mondrian Contreras, DVM, a member of the Pumpkin Veterinary Advisory Board, says it’s common for pet owners to mistake CIV for kennel cough, but dogs with the flu have more intense symptoms. It’s also worth noting symptoms of H3N8 are less intense than those of H3N2. Keep an eye on your pup and visit the vet even if a cough seems mild or a runny nose isn’t super detrimental to your dog’s energy levels. You don’t want mild symptoms to become more severe over time.How Does Dog Flu Spread?Dog flu can spread quickly. First of all, CIV is not seasonal (aka, your dog can contract it at any time, not just during a polar vortex). All it takes is a sneeze, cough or lick to share germs and transfer CIV. Romps in the dog park, stays at a kennel and sharing toys can all lead to spreading dog flu.While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports there are no known cases of humans contracting either strain of CIV, in 2016 UW-Madison's School of Veterinary Medicine reported a group of cats in an Indiana shelter contracted H3N2 after contact with infected dogs. This means dog flu can spread to other pets in the house, which could be a pretty miserable situation.How Severe Is Dog Flu?Let’s cut to the chase: Can dog flu kill my dog? This is a tough question because it depends on the dog. After two to three weeks, most pups are back to their usual selves. Just like when you get the flu, your body fights it off as best it can and eventually you get better.Dr. Pilossoph doesn’t want dog parents to freak out if their pup displays flu-like symptoms. He says dog flu isn’t actually very common, at least not like the human flu season where it’s inevitable that you’ll get a bug at some point. Dr. Pilossoph says the number of dogs who get super sick or die from dog flu is extremely low.However, Dr. Stasiak says canines who are very young, very old or have compromised immune systems are at risk of developing pneumonia as a result of CIV, which can be fatal if left untreated.In fact, a new canine respiratory disease spread across the U.S. this fall, causing pneumonia in all types of dogs. Some died, while others remained sick for weeks. Many vet clinics are seeing shockingly high rates of dogs with pneumonia or breathing issues, yet scientists aren’t sure what’s causing it or how widespread the infection actually is. According to Dr. Contreras, this mystery illness starts with similar symptoms to dog flu, like coughing, then progresses to fever, sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes. Though similar to CIV, Dr. Contreras says this new disease causes symptoms for a longer period of time. The illness is also more resistant to antibiotics.Dr. Kristine Smith, the Biologicals and Infectious Disease Medical Lead at Zoetis, advises keeping up to date on any news of canine respiratory outbreaks in your area so you don’t accidentally let your dog loose in a dog park full of super-spreaders.How to Treat Dog FluUnfortunately, Dr. Pilossophh says there is no medication that cures CIV because it’s a virus. Like something out of Outbreak, the viruses are always adapting. Not to fear! There are other actions you can take to make your dog’s life easier.Visit the vet! Especially in the early stages when you may not be certain your dog has CIV, it’s important to make an appointment with your vet to check in and test for CIV. Though Dr. Pilossoph says confirming dog flu strains is difficult, a test could help narrow down the problem.Antibiotics or other medicines can be prescribed to ease symptoms and guard against additional infections (like pneumonia if your dog’s immunity is low). Dr. Pilossoph notes that antibiotics are not necessary for dog flu, but some vets may prescribe them if there’s a secondary bacterial infection.TLC also goes a long way. Make sure your sick pup rests, eats and drinks plenty of water. If your dog is coughing or has labored breathing, Dr. Pilossoph recommends nebulization, or placing your dog in a warm, steamy space. “[This] can be useful in moistening the airway and reducing the feeling of coughing,” he says.Supportive care in a veterinary hospital is an option for severe cases. Dr. Smith says this is ideal if your dog is very dehydrated and needs intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen or monitoring for bacterial infections.How Long Is Dog Flu Contagious?Just like humans spread the flu to one another, dogs pass CIV through respiratory droplets in the air and via touch. “After exposure, it can take a few days for clinical signs to appear,” says Dr. Smith. “Yet dogs can spread the disease during this ‘incubation period’ before they appear ill.”So, be a responsible dog owner! If your dog is diagnosed with CIV, keep her away from other pets and animals. The AVMA recommends isolating dogs infected with H3N2 for at least 21 days​ and dogs infected with H3N8 for at least 7 days to avoid spreading the disease. Dr. Pilossoph agrees that isolation for three weeks after you notice symptoms is a wise choice.Sebastian Condrea/Getty ImagesHow to Prevent Dog FluThe best way to prevent dog flu is steering clear of the virus in the first place. Since it’s so easy to catch and tricky to treat, one of the best ways to do this is through vaccination (basically a flu shot for dogs). Zoetis offers the Vanguard CIV H3N2/H3N8 vaccine, which targets both strains—obviously, talk to your vet about your options.All of the vets we spoke to recommend making sure your pup is up to date on vaccinations for CIV, parainfluenza, adenovirus and bordetella if you plan to board her or take her to the dog park, which Dr. Smith calls “ground zero” for transmissible infections. Don’t assume your pup is fully covered. Note that even though the vaccine can’t guarantee your dog won’t get sick at all, it will make the symptoms much less severe.If there’s a confirmed outbreak in your area (or honestly, even if there’s not), washing toys, bowls, beds and leashes frequently is smart. Kill those germs ASAP! If you run into the neighbor’s dog on your way inside, wash your hands before handling your own pup. Even if another dog doesn’t display symptoms, he could be carrying the virus.The vets we spoke to also note there are immunity supplements on the market that pet parents may want to give their dogs. Dr. Smith warns against believing everything you hear. “Most supplement products are not FDA-approved and thus not quality tested for their ingredients or their efficacy,” she says.As a more holistic-focused vet, Dr. Pilossoph says foods rich in Vitamins D and C are good at fighting off viruses. If you’re dead set on trying supplements, Dr. Pilossoph says you can try functional mushroom supplements with Chagas, Reishi and Turkey Tail mushrooms or products with Quercetin, an antioxidant bioflavonoid. As always, check with your vet first.Dr. Danielle Bernal, global veterinarian with Wellness Pet Company, says keeping dogs at a healthy body weight can support a life of well-being but also help reduce the risk of health upsets like respiratory disease. She says 70 percent of a dog’s immune system lives within the gastrointestinal system, so it is important to ensure supplements contain prebiotics and probiotics to support a healthy microbiome.Dr. Bernal recommends Wellness® Shield Health Supplements for their antioxidants, omega-e fatty acids, mushrooms, prebiotics and probiotics “These chews take a whole-health approach to immune health and seasonal allergy support,” she says.If your dog isn’t into supplements in pill or treat form, Dr. Contreras recommends foods like unsweetened yogurt, salmon, blueberries, strawberries and oranges—in moderation.If you are concerned at all that your pet may be showing signs of dog flu, contact your veterinarian and keep your dog at home. Use a pet sitter instead of a kennel if you’re leaving town. You don’t want to be the source of an outbreak! And you certainly don’t want your dog to feel ill.RELATED10 Pet Trends Pups, Cats & Humans Alike Will Pounce on in 2024Sarah AshleyFreelance WriterSarah Ashley covers dogs, cats and pet products for PureWow.

She said infections detected both in humans and in sewage were on the rise, though the number of severe or fatal cases remained stable. Regarding Covid, the prevalence of the JN.1 variant has been increasing, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of local infections and rising to 27 per cent globally, Chuang said.While the World Health Organization has said the variant is more transmissible, there was no evidence to suggest it posed additional public health risks, she said.“There’s a high chance that we are entering the peak influenza season next week. At the same time, we have also seen a significant increase in Covid-19 activity,” Chuang said.The overloaded public hospitals suffered from a shortage of doctors and nurses. Photo: Kyle Lam/HKFP. The XBB vaccine, which was rolled out in Hong Kong on December 14, also protects against the JN.1 variant, Chuang added.She advised the public to get flu and Covid-19 booster shots as soon as possible, and to wear masks in crowded or poorly ventilated places.Healthcare system under pressureDirector of Emergency Response and Programme Management Albert Au said the seasonal influenza vaccination programme has been running for about three months. More than 1.7 million vaccines had been administered as of January 1, a 21 per cent increase on the same period last year.Coverage rates have increased in various groups, with nearly 770,000 doses administered to those aged 65 or above, up 15 per cent from last year, achieving a rate of 46.7 per cent.File photo: GovHK. Children aged six months to 18 years had received nearly 510,000 doses, a 39 per cent increase from the same period last year, with a coverage rate of 51.3 per cent.Au attributed the increase in vaccine coverage for children to school outreach vaccination programmes, but said there was “still room for improvement” in rates for children and the elderly. As of January 3, nearly 20,000 doses of the XBB Covid vaccine had been administered.Larry Lee, chief executive of the city’s public hospital operator the Hospital Authority, said hospitals had increased beds and personnel on December 22.The public healthcare system has seen an increase in the number of emergency department visits and internal medicine admissions since late December with a more pronounced uptick following the Christmas holiday.The occupancy rate of internal medicine beds has risen from 96 per cent to over 115 per cent, while that of paediatric beds has increased from 75 per cent to about 90 per cent.Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Errorypo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | AppsHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team LATEST FROM HKFP 17 companies sign deal in gov’t push to boost Hong Kong’s tech sector, including one under US sanctions Tropical Cyclone Toraji: Hong Kong issues T1 typhoon warning as storm enters within 800km of city Global connections, local change: Social Enterprise Summit returns with focus on collaboration Hong Kong social worker ordered to pay over HK$440,000 to police officer assaulted during 2019 protests HKFP has an impartial stance, transparent funding, and balanced coverage guided by an Ethics Code and Corrections Policy.

Gavin McIntyre/Staff By Gavin McIntyre gmcintyre@postandcourier.com Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save If it seems like you and everyone around you is sick these days, that's probably true.South Carolina remains at the highest level of flu activity and was joined recently by most of the states in the Southeast, stretching from South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee across to Louisiana, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.COVID-19 and other viruses are also becoming very active, and some people may be infected with more than one, though it is rare, doctors said. Much of the surge in activity can be linked to the lack of protection, they said. Health SC still among the worst for flu as COVID, RSV also makes the rounds in 'tripledemic' By Tom Corwin tcorwin@postandcourier.com South Carolina still had the highest rate for influenza-like illness at 17.5 percent, easily topping Louisiana's 14 percent, according to a Post and Courier analysis of CDC data. One reason might be the flu vaccination rate, where only 22.68 percent in South Carolina have gotten the flu shot this year, and only 15.57 percent of adults below age 65 had been vaccinated as of Jan. 1, according to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control. The good news is the adult rate and the vaccination rate for children have both increased slightly in the last two weeks as physicians and public health experts sent out the call that it is not too late. South Carolina has historically had lower rates of vaccination — last year only 27 percent got a flu shot — but public health is seeing more vaccine hesitancy since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Dr. Martha Buchanan, lead medical consultant to DHEC.Serious COVID infections have also shot up, with the number of new patients admitted to the hospital in South Carolina jumping 49 percent, from 259 the week of Dec. 16 to 386 the following week, according to Post and Courier analysis. The state stopped posting weekly updates on COVID on June 28 but is still tracking it. The state is releasing data on outbreaks of the virus in certain settings, like schools and nursing homes. There have been 313 COVID outbreaks in long-term care facilities since Oct. 1, with nearly 30 each week since Dec. 9, according to DHEC."Cases or outbreaks of illness among our most vulnerable citizens are concerning," DHEC said in a statement. But the agency also noted that while it uses the term "outbreak," that can refer to a single resident or three staff members getting COVID while at the facility. At Roper Hospital, Dr. Kent Stock said he is seeing the COVID outbreak firsthand."Very clearly COVID-associated hospitalizations are going up," he said, with some patients having to wait for a bed. Health Very few getting updated COVID-19 shot ahead of potential viral surges as holidays near By Tom Corwin tcorwin@postandcourier.com Part of those outbreaks may also be due to the low rate of vaccination — only 6.36 percent had gotten the updated COVID-19 booster since it became available in the fall. That is 1 percent of children, 4 percent of adults, and 22 percent of those 65 and older, according to updated figures provided to The Post and Courier. "It's abysmally low," said Dr. Michael Sweat, faculty director of the Center for Global Health at the Medical University of South Carolina.It may also explain why fewer people are getting the flu shot, said Stock, an infectious disease physician with Roper St. Francis Healthcare."I think there is a little bit of vaccine fatigue," he said. All evidence so far shows this season's flu shot "is a pretty good match" to the strains that are circulating in the U.S., Buchanan said."We believe it is going to be very effective," she said. It's just that not enough people are getting it, said Dr. Helmut Albrecht, medical director of the Center of Infectious Diseases Research and Policy for Prisma Health and the University of South Carolina. "The problem is the vaccination rate, not the match" with the current viruses, he said. Columbia Flu death could signal an early start for virus season By Tom Corwin tcorwin@postandcourier.com Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, has caused 76 outbreaks since Oct. 1, mostly in child care settings, according to DHEC. Those peaked early in December and appear to have declined more recently. The tests are not reportable to the state, although doctors say they are still seeing it in clinics and emergency rooms.Some patients may be contending with more than one virus, though it is not clear how many. At Roper, there have been a "handful" of patients where testing showed they were co-infected with two viruses, such as COVID and Influenza A, or flu and another respiratory virus, Stock said.Most hospitals and clinics are only doing testing for Influenza A and B and COVID — the ones where there is a specific antiviral treatment if a patient is positive — so if there is a co-infection "they're not likely to see it," he said. Roper St. Francis Healthcare runs a broader respiratory panel for viruses and some bacterial infections, so it is more likely to show on that kind of test.But even then, it may be "sequential infections" where the person is infected with one virus, gets over it and weeks later comes down with something else, but the test may turn up both. That might be particularly true for COVID, where a person can test positive for eight to 12 weeks after on certain tests, Stock said."That's what always muddies those numbers," he said.It is unclear if the first infection makes the person more vulnerable to the next, but that might be true with those experiencing long COVID, where the persistence of the virus seems to make some patients more susceptible to common infections.

The department shared the findings.This virus is the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) that has spread into the most remote parts of the planet, including the Arctic region. The polar bear is suspected to have contracted the disease after feeding on the carcass of an infected bird.Speaking with news website Alaska Beacon, a veterinarian from Alaska state, Bob Gerlach, said, “This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere.” He explained that “while polar bears normally eat seals they hunt from the sea ice, it appeared likely that this bear was scavenging on dead birds and ingested the influenza virus that way”.HPAI was first detected in the Arctic region in the second week of April 2023 among birds and a fox. The virus is suspected to have travelled to the region via migratory birds.First reported in poultry, the HPAI outbreak of variant H5N1 started in 2021 after it spread rapidly among wild bird populations and spread to different parts of the world.Ecosystems in polar regions are particularly vulnerable to bird flu because they contain many animals found nowhere else in the world and never been exposed to similar viruses. Moreover, viruses tend to live longer on dead animals due to cold conditions, scientists said.Scientists keeping a close watch on the spread of infection in Antarctica fear that during austral (Southern Hemisphere) spring, the contagion may spread in the dense populations of penguins in the peninsular region. If the virus happens to reach the Antarctic, it may lead to one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times, they warned.Worldbird fluAntarcticaArcticArctic OceanShow CommentsRelated VideosNo stories found.

There has been a steady rise in the cases in India from past month. Here are some important signs and symptoms that should not be ignored. Published: January 4, 2024 12:15 PM IST By India.com Lifestyle Staff | Edited by Jigyasa Sahay Follow Us Are you Suffering From Persisitant Sore Throat? This Could Be a Sign of Swine Flu, 5 Symptoms to Know (Freepik) Swine flu, also known as H1N1 influenza, is a respiratory illness caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. Recently a 57-year-old man had tested positive for H1N1 virus and later succumbed to it. The patient was being treated for multiple diseases at a private hospital and underwent the test there. He was admitted to the isolation ward of the SSG on December 31, he said. “The patient had been suffering from many ailments, including Austin’s disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease for the last 10 years,” Dr Helaiya said. Swine flu, or H1N1 influenza, is a respiratory disease that causes nasal secretions, cough, decreased appetite and restless behaviour. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of regular seasonal flu but may be more severe in some cases. Here are six common symptoms of swine flu: SWINE FLU: 5 MAJOR SYMPTOMS Fever: One of the hallmark symptoms of swine flu is a sudden onset of high fever. The fever may be accompanied by chills and sweating. It is important to note that not everyone with swine flu will develop a fever, but it is a common symptom. Cough: A persistent cough is another common symptom of swine flu. The cough may be dry or productive, producing mucus or phlegm. It can be accompanied by a sore throat or a scratchy sensation in the throat. Body aches: Swine flu can cause severe body aches, muscle pain, and joint pain. Patients often describe feeling fatigued and experiencing overall body discomfort. These symptoms are similar to those experienced with seasonal flu. Headache: Many individuals with swine flu experience headaches, which can range from mild to severe. The headache may be accompanied by sinus congestion and pressure. Fatigue: Swine flu can cause extreme fatigue and weakness. Patients often feel exhausted and lack energy to perform daily activities. Fatigue can persist for several weeks even after other symptoms subside. Respiratory symptoms: Swine flu primarily affects the respiratory system. Patients may experience respiratory symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, and shortness of breath. Some individuals may also develop chest discomfort or chest pain. It’s important to note that these symptoms are not exclusive to swine flu and can also be caused by other respiratory illnesses, including the seasonal flu or the common cold. Additionally, some individuals infected with the swine flu virus may be asymptomatic, meaning they show no symptoms at all. If you experience any of these symptoms or suspect you have been exposed to swine flu, it is crucial to seek medical attention. Early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. Follow the guidelines provided by healthcare authorities, such as getting vaccinated, practicing good hygiene, and following respiratory etiquette to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading swine flu.

"The latest influenza indicators showed that we are about to enter the winter influenza season because one of the key indicators has exceeded the threshold and the other one is approaching the threshold," said Chuang Shuk-kwan from the Centre for Health Protection. "The usual duration of the influenza season in the past was maybe 8 weeks or 12 weeks, sometimes longer. So it is difficult to anticipate or predict the exact duration of the influenza season and also the severity." Officials said more than 1.7 million people had received the latest flu jab as of Monday. But while the number of children and elderly people getting vaccinated is higher than last year, half of such residents are still unprotected. Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said the occupancy rate of inpatient beds in the medical and paediatric departments of acute hospitals reached 116 percent and 92 percent respectively on Wednesday. "We are currently under pressure. But actually we have experience in handling such pressure," said the authority's chief manager Larry Lee. "We had twice the service demand surge last year... in the middle of the year and also in October. We have to follow our basic response plan. We monitor different parameters, including figures of influenza, Covid and also the bed situations. And also we have promulgated different measures to try to increase the turnover rate, efficiency, and manpower of our hospitals."

Focused On Health CDC map shows dramatic increase in illness in Mississippi by: Alix Martichoux Posted: Jan 5, 2024 / 12:19 PM CST Updated: Jan 5, 2024 / 12:19 PM CST by: Alix Martichoux Posted: Jan 5, 2024 / 12:19 PM CST Updated: Jan 5, 2024 / 12:19 PM CST SHARE (NEXSTAR) – What a difference a week can make. New data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday shows an 18% jump in people testing positive for influenza last week. The number of people going to the doctor with symptoms of respiratory illness — whether it be the flu, COVID, RSV, or none of the above — also continues to trend upward. Now, according to the CDC, 21 states, including Mississippi, and New York City are experiencing “very high” levels of sickness. Comparing the latest data to just one week prior (slideshow below) shows the situation worsening in the northern half of the country. Now, only one U.S. state, Minnesota, remains in the “minimal” category. COVID, flu, RSV or strep? How to know which you have The majority of states are seeing “high” or “very high” levels of sickness. (See more using the CDC’s interactive map here.) According to the CDC, Mississippi has seen “very high” levels of respiratory illness that includes fever plus a cough or sore throat. CDC map shows the level of respiratory illness by state as of Dec. 30, 2023. (Map: CDC)CDC map shows the level of respiratory illness by state the week prior, as of Dec. 23, 2023. (Map: CDC) Even as the CDC’s map grows increasingly grim, the agency predicts we haven’t yet reached this season’s peak. Since the early 1980s, the most commonly observed peak of flu season has come in February. It’s not just the flu going around. Hospital admissions for COVID have jumped 20% in the last week, and more people are testing positive for RSV, the CDC reports. Have COVID symptoms, but testing negative? You may want to check your tests To create the maps above, the CDC compares current data from health care providers to what’s normal for that area outside of flu season. The data is based on the number of people reporting to a health care facility with flu symptoms — fever, plus a cough or sore throat. It is not based on lab-confirmed influenza cases. That means the data could be including cases that turn out to be other respiratory illnesses, like COVID or RSV, but the cases could also be underreported, if people are staying home and fighting the sickness on their own. Though we don’t have exact numbers, the CDC estimates there have been at least 10 million illnesses, 110,000 hospitalizations and 6,500 deaths so far this flu season. Twenty-seven children have also died. Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox. Subscribe Now Daily News SIGN UP NOW Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Seasonal influenza, caused by influenza viruses, is a global occurrence, with approximately a billion cases annually, including 3–5 million instances of severe illness, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).Also Read: Misused face masks could cause more infections than they preventThe virus spreads through respiratory droplets, making vaccination the most effective preventive measure.Typical influenza symptoms encompass a sudden onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue.
