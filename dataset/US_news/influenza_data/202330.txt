This study aimed to investigate whether a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, a TLR4 agonist) and polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C, a TLR3 agonist) can enhance the protective efficacy of an inactivated A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR8) H1N1 influenza vaccine against homologous influenza infection and minimize illness outcomes. Results showed that combination MPL and poly I:C adjuvanted influenza vaccination increased the production of antigen-specific antibodies, decreased the levels of cytokines and cellular infiltrates at the infection sites, and induced significant memory T and B cell responses in mice. The results of this study suggest that the combination of MPL and poly I:C can be developed into a possible adjuvant for enhancing the efficacy of influenza vaccines.

Vaccination is the most effective strategy for preventing influenza virus infections. Widely used seasonal influenza vaccines are inactivated whole-virus, split-virus, and protein subunit vaccines, but the efficacy of influenza vaccines is suboptimum2,3,4. Moreover, these vaccines are ineffective in conferring cross-protection against antigenically different influenza viruses; thus, annual influenza vaccination is required, leading to an economic burden on the healthcare system and society4,5.Innate immune responses to pathogens are commonly induced by the recognition of specific patterns of pathogens via toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are expressed on most innate immune cells. Interactions between TLRs and their ligands activate downstream factors of TLR-dependent signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor-kappa B, activator protein-1, and interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-3/7. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and infiltration of innate immune cells into the infection site further initiate antigen-specific adaptive immunity6. Therefore, TLR agonists are promising candidates as vaccine adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy and enhance mucosal and humoral immunity.Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is a TLR4 agonist that stimulates immune responses via myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β factor (TRIF)-dependent pathways; at high doses (10–50 μg), MPL is used as an adjuvant for respiratory syncytial virus vaccines7. Synthetic double-stranded RNA polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) is a TLR3 agonist that induces the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and local immune responses. Poly I:C-adjuvanted influenza vaccines elicit a high anti-hemagglutinin (HA) response in nasal wash and enhance the production of IgG isotype antibodies, resulting in increased protection against influenza viral infections8. In previous studies, both MPL and poly I:C have been used with a relatively high dose; 10 μg to 50 μg of MPL and 50 μg of Poly I:C for mice, and up to 1 mg per each adjuvant for Rhesus Macaques immunization9,10,11,12. A combination adjuvant composed of low doses of MPL (1 μg) and poly I:C (10 μg) positively promotes innate and specific adaptive immune responses to ovalbumin13,14. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the combination of MPL and poly I:C enhances the protective efficacy of an inactivated A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR8) H1N1 influenza vaccine in comparison with nonadjuvanted or individual adjuvanted vaccines after homologous viral challenge and elicit heterosubtypic antibody production against the A/Hong Kong/1/68 (A/HK) H3N2 virus.ResultsMPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccine enhances antigen-specific antibody productionTo determine the effects of the adjuvanted influenza vaccines, we intramuscularly injected BALB/c mice (n = 10/group) with an inactivated A/PR8 (H1N1) vaccine (iPR8, 1 μg) alone or in combination with an adjuvant (either MPL 1 μg, poly I:C 10 μg, or MPL 1 μg + poly I:C 10 μg) two times with a 3 weeks interval. Sera were collected at 2 weeks after each immunization, and A/PR8-specific isotype antibodies were measured using ELISA. The A/PR8-specific HAI titers at 2 weeks post boost immunization were determined by performing an HAI assay. Compared with the nonadjuvanted vaccines, the adjuvanted iPR8 vaccines induced higher levels of virus-specific total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a isotype antibodies after the prime immunization (Fig. 1A). The levels of serum anti-A/PR8 antibodies were significantly increased by boost dose of iPR8 with MPL + poly I:C compared with iPR8 with MPL or poly I:C (Fig. 1B). iPR8 alone vaccination elicited the production of Th2-induced IgG1 isotype antibodies but not Th1-induced IgG2a isotype antibodies after boost immunization. The mice in the MPL- or poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine group presented a significant increase in the levels of antigen-specific antibodies compared to the unadjuvanted vaccine group. In addition, the HAI titers in immune sera were higher in the mice from the poly I:C- or MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group than in the mice from the MPL-adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted group (Fig. 1C).Figure 1Antibody production after inactivated A/PR8 vaccine with or without adjuvants. BALB/c mice (n = 10) were intramuscularly immunized two times with a 3 weeks interval, with inactivated A/PR8 (1 μg) with or without adjuvants (1 μg of MPL, 10 μg of poly I:C or MPL 1 μg + poly I:C 10 μg).

Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. *P < 0.0332, **P < 0.0021, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageMPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccine enhances protection against the lethal homologous influenza infectionAt 3 weeks after boost vaccination, the naïve and vaccinated mice were challenged with a lethal dose of A/PR8 (1.5 × LD50) to investigate the protective efficacy of the vaccine with the adjuvants. To rule out the non-specific protective effects of adjuvant itself, mice were immunized with adjuvants only (MPL, Poly I:C, or MPL + Poly I:C without iPR8) and evaluated antibody production and protection against the virus challenge. The adjuvant only immunization could not provide anti-viral responses as well as any antigen-specific antibody production (Supplementary Fig. 1). The adjuvanted vaccines showed effective protection against a lethal dose of A/PR8 infection, as evidenced by the no loss in body weight (BW) and 100% survival rate of the challenged mice, which is similar to those of the uninfected naïve mice. However, the naïve mice displayed severe weight loss (19%–25%) at 7 days post challenge (dpi) and 20% survival rate (Fig. 2A,B). Even survived mice exhibited severe illness such as near 20% weight loss, hunched posture, and scruffy hair coat during the infection. The iPR8-vaccinated mice displayed a slight decrease in BW (10–20%) and 80% survival rate at 6 days post challenge. After 9 days of challenge, the weights of the iPR8-vaccinated mice recovered to normal, but those of the naïve infected mice did not (Fig. 2A,B).Figure 2Protective efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccines in the immunized mice after the lethal influenza virus challenge. Immunized BALB/c mice (n = 10) were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous A/PR8 (1.5 × LD50) after 3 weeks of boost immunization. Body weight (BW) (A) and survival rates (B) of the challenged mice (n = 5) were measured for 14 days after viral infection, and percentages of changes were calculated based on BW at day 0. For statistical analysis, two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests were performed. *p < 0.0332, and ****p < 0.0001 between iPR8 and iPR8 + MPL + Poly I:C groups. (C) Lung homogenates (n = 5) were harvested at day 7 post infection, and lung viral titers were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. **P < 0.0021, ***P < 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001. All results were shown in mean ± standard deviation (SD) with individual dots.Full size imageTo investigate whether immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine together with adjuvants could prevent viral replication, we collected lung samples of vaccinated mice at 7 days after homologous challenge to measure viral titers (Fig. 2C). The nonvaccinated and iPR8-only-vaccinated mice showed significantly high levels of lung viral titers at 7 dpi, whereas the mice in the single-adjuvanted and MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted groups exhibited significantly lower titers, suggesting better viral control in the lungs. In particular, the mice in the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group showed the detection limit of viral titers. These data suggest that the MPL- and poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccines provided complete protection against homologous infection.Cytokine storms with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines elicit inflammatory cell recruitment to the infection site; however, the cytokine levels in the lungs after infection are inversely correlated with viral loads in the lungs and positively correlated with disease severity during influenza infection15,16. We measured the levels of cytokines and chemokines in lung extracts harvested from the mice in the vaccinated groups at 7 dpi (Fig. 3). Among the mice in this study, the naïve infected and iPR8-only-vaccinated mice showed the highest production of cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5) after lethal viral challenge. The adjuvanted immunizations, however, exhibited low or no cytokine/chemokine production, indicating that the adjuvants increased the protective efficacy of the vaccine.Figure 3Cytokines and chemokines released into lung extracts in BALB/c mice after homologous A/PR8 challenge. Lung samples of the vaccinated BALB/c mice (n = 5) were harvested at 7 days post challenge. Cytokine and chemokine levels were measured using ELISA. All results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) with individual dots. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. *P < 0.0332, **P < 0.0021, ***P < 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageTo further confirm the protective efficacy of the adjuvant combination against the influenza virus infection, lung samples were harvested, processed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Severe lung inflammation was observed in naïve and iPR8 immunized groups 7 days post virus challenge. Meanwhile MPL- and poly I:C-adjuanted groups exhibited moderate levels of lung inflammation, MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group did not display lung histopathology (Supplementary Fig. 2).MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccine prevents inflammatory cell infiltrates after A/PR8 viral infectionCellular infiltrates in the lungs of immunized BALB/c mice were observed 7 days after homologous viral challenge to assess a possible correlation with the protective efficacy of the vaccines (Fig. 4). Inflammatory cells play a role in protection against invading pathogens, but they also contribute to lung inflammation, leading to severe illness outcomes upon viral infection17,18. Consistent with the high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3), inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and DCs were recruited to the lungs of the naïve mice after viral infection. More inflammatory cells were observed in the lungs of the mice from the single-adjuvanted groups than in those of the mice from the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group, but the difference was not significant (Fig. 4A–E). Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first line of defense against pathogens invading the airway. The percentages of AMs were maintained in the mice from the iPR8-only, poly I:C-adjuvanted, and MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted groups, whereas the mice from the naïve infected and MPL-adjuvanted groups showed decreased AM populations in the lungs (Fig. 4F). These data suggest that the MPL + poly I:C adjuvant in the inactivated vaccine effectively prevented the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs upon influenza infection.Figure 4Inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs after homologous viral infection. Immunized BALB/c mice (n = 5) were infected with A/PR8 (1.5 × LD50) after 3 weeks of boost immunization. Lung samples were harvested at day 7 post infection and then cell phenotypes were investigated by flow cytometry. All results were shown in mean ± standard deviation (SD) with individual dots. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. **P < 0.0021, ***P < 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageInduction of memory T cell populations and antigen-specific T-cell responses as well as memory B cell responses by the intramuscular administration of vaccine adjuvanted with MPL + poly I:CMemory T cells provide protective functions against the invading influenza virus, and high frequencies of antigen-specific memory T cells contribute to the less severe lung diseases19,20. Furthermore, after resolving viral invasion, the majority of effector T cells die, leaving a small proportion of long-lived memory T cells contributing to the prevention of reinfection21. To test the hypothesis that adjuvants can influence the populations of memory T cells, we examined memory T cells and antigen-specific T cell responses at 7 dpi. The adjuvanted vaccine groups after virus exposure increased the populations of effector memory CD4/CD8 T cells (TEM) in the lungs and spleens (Figs. 5C,D and 6C,D), but MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccination strongly increased the populations of central memory CD4/CD8 T cells (TCM) (Figs. 5A,B and 6A,B). Subsequently, we examined the levels of IFN-γ/IL-4-producing T cell populations in the lungs and spleens of the immunized or naïve mice at 7 dpi after homologous A/PR8 antigen stimulation in vitro. Similarly, the cytokine production of T cells was higher in the mice from the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group after antigen stimulation than in the mice from the other groups (Figs. 5E–H and 6E–H).Figure 5Memory T cell populations and iPR8-specific IFN-γ and IL-4-producing T cells in the lungs of immunized mice. Vaccinated mice were infected with a lethal dose of A/PR8 (1.5 × LD50) after 3 weeks of vaccination. Lung samples were harvested 7 days after virus challenge and then stimulated with inactivated PR8 antigen for 5 h. Cell phenotypes were evaluated using flow cytometry. All results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) with individual dots. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. **P < 0.0021, ***P < 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageFigure 6Splenic memory T cell populations and iPR8-specific IFN-γ and IL-4-producing T cells in the immunized mice.

MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group exhibited significantly enhanced IgG production with higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (Fig. 7).Figure 7Antigen-specific antibody production of bone marrow and spleen cells from the immunized mice. Bone marrow (A–C) and spleen cells (D–F) were harvested at day 7 post virus infection and cultured in iPR8-coated plates for 1 day or 7 days, respectively. IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a ELISA was performed to measure the antigen-specific antibody production. All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) with individual dots. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-multiple comparison tests. *P < 0.0332, **P < 0.0021, ***P < 0.0002, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageCollectively, these results suggest that the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine was effective in eliciting memory T-cell differentiation and inducing antigen-specific functional T cell populations in addition to memory B cell responses, which provided an efficient protective response against viral invasion.DiscussionApart from COVID-19, influenza infections are among the most urgent infectious diseases to date and responsible for thousands of deaths annually worldwide. Vaccination is a common strategy for preventing the influenza pandemic. Inactivated pathogen vaccines are safer than live attenuated vaccines. Nevertheless, inactivated whole-virus vaccines sometimes lose immunogenicity and do not efficiently induce cellular adaptive immunity22. Adjuvants have been introduced to effectively stimulate vaccine antigen-specific immune responses via different pathogen-associated molecular pattern signaling pathways. TLR agonists are widely used as adjuvants that stimulate immune responses by regulating TRIF or MyD88-dependent signals23,24,25. MPL is an attenuated type of lipopolysaccharide that stimulates immune responses by upregulating TRIF/MyD88-dependent signaling pathways, which are licensed for hepatitis B virus vaccine (Fendrix) and human papillomavirus vaccine (Cervarix)7,26. Poly I:C is a synthetic double-stranded RNA that effectively triggers immune responses to the influenza virus by promoting the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway, which has been tested in humans8,26. The combination of MPL and poly I:C can induce strong innate immune responses and further stimulate antigen-specific antibody production and antigen-specific T cell responses to ovalbumin at high levels13,14. In the present study, the inactivated influenza virus (inactivated A/PR8 (H1N1)) vaccine combined with either MPL, poly I:C, or MPL + poly I:C at low doses exerted additive effects on enhancing virus-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a isotype antibody production; preventing weight loss disease, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inflammatory immune cell infiltration into the infection site upon viral infection. Additionally, the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccine elicited robust memory immunity, as demonstrated by the increased levels of antigen-specific antibody production by plasma and memory B cells, frequencies of central/effector memory T cells and antigen-specific cytokine producing memory T cell responses in the secondary lymphoid organs. These results suggest that the inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with the combination of TLR3 and 4 agonists (MPL and poly I:C, respectively) showed effective protection against viral infection with better antigen-specific memory responses.In the present study, the adjuvanted groups showed strong humoral immune responses with high levels of virus-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A,B). This result might be related to the pre-existence of memory CD4/CD8 T cell populations in the lungs and spleens upon viral infection21,27. In addition to serum antibody responses, neutralizing antibody (NAb) binding to HA plays a vital role in preventing the interaction between virus sialic acid receptors and the host cell27,28,29,30,31. The MPL + poly I:C- or individual poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 was effective in inducing high levels of HAI titers against A/PR8 (H1N1) (Fig. 1C), which contributed to viral clearance upon infection, as demonstrated by the very low viral titers (Fig. 2C). Moreover, NAbs not only function against the same strain of influenza but also accelerate the clearance of different serotypes of influenza32. Thus, we determined the A/HK (H3N2)-specific IgG and HAI titers in the sera and IgG production by plasma cells derived from bone marrow cells after immunization and homologous virus challenge (Supplementary Fig. 3). The MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine significantly enhanced heterosubtypic A/HK (H3N2)-specific immune responses such as binding IgG, HAI activities, and antibody-secreting plasma cells, suggesting that the combination adjuvant may elicit cross-protection against different influenza strains.The inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released into infection sites play vital roles in the recruitment of immune cells against invading pathogens33. However, excessive recruitment of cell infiltrates and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to immune-mediated damage, which exacerbates illness outcomes due to influenza infection34,35. AMs provide a crucial defense against pathogens during infection; lung-resident AMs contribute to the protection of alveoli from inflammation following viral infection36. In the present study, high levels of lung-resident AMs and moderately low frequencies of inflammatory infiltrates into the lungs were observed in the mice from the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted group after influenza infection (Fig. 4), and these mice had no BW losses and 100% survival rates (Fig. 2A,B).An efficient response of the Th1 and Th2 subsets contributes to the control of viral infections. However, high levels of IL-4, correlated with the induction of the Th2 response, may delay viral clearance37. Eosinophils, which are recruited in response to IL-4 and Th2 expression, have been associated with local allergic responses that can damage lung histopathology21,37. Though virus infection usually induces Th1 immune responses due to their intracellular activity, inactivated influenza virus vaccine was previously reported to induce Th2-biased immune responses38,39. As a result, immunization of whole-virus inactivated vaccine may present serious adverse events and lower vaccine efficacy. In the present study, the inactivated vaccine adjuvanted with the combination of MPL and poly I:C provided enhanced protection and reduced inflammation at the infection site (Fig. 2), but it also possibly increased Th1-polarized immune responses, as evidenced by the increased levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 (Fig. 5E–H), which provided sufficient protection against illness severity due to viral infection40.Lung-resident memory CD8 T cells are primarily localized in the epithelial layers and can mediate rapid responses to invading pathogens. Additionally, lung-resident memory T cells mainly comprise tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM cells), which play a predominant role in protective immunity41. Among functional CD8 T cell subsets, effector CD8 T cells protect against influenza by blocking viral replication. High levels of CD8+IFN-γ+ were reported to be correlated with an elimination of symptoms, reduction of illness severity, and clearance of virus in infected patients19,42,43,44. Aside from CD8 T cells, memory CD4 T cells contribute directly to viral clearance by interacting with antigen-presenting cells, helping virus-specific antibody-producing B cells, and improving CD8 T cell functionality21. CD4 T cell-derived IFN-γ directly downregulates T-bet expression on CD8 T cells, leading to TRM formation during influenza infection45. Moreover, IL-4-producing T cells induce the differentiation of CD44highCD62Lhigh central memory cell-like CD8 T cells after viral infection, which is a robust effector cytokine that controls chronic viral infection; therefore, virus-specific IL-4-induced innate CD8 T cells are potentially used in T-cell therapy46. In the present study, the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted iPR8 vaccine induced higher levels of CD8/CD4 TCM and TEM residing in the lungs compared with the individual adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 5), which conferred complete protection from severe disease outcomes upon viral infection. Furthermore, the vaccine with the combination adjuvant elicited more functional T-cell immunity, such as antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 production, than the other vaccines. In addition to the homologous protection, local CD4 and CD8 T cells confer cross-protection against different serotypes of influenza viruses47, supporting the cross-protective efficacy of the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine.T cells residing in secondary lymphoid tissues are important for providing long-lasting antiviral responses. Most effector CD4/CD8 T cells die after viral infection, but only a small number of memory T cells persist in the long term at the infection site48,49,50. Therefore, the memory CD4/CD8 T cells located in secondary lymphoid organs appear to play a critical role in the early clearance of the virus upon reinfection. In addition, central memory T cells have a unique functional attribute of migrating to the infection sites following differentiation into effector T cells producing antiviral cytokines, resulting in rapid and effective antiviral responses due to virus reinfection51. Our data revealed that the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine was not only effective in enhancing splenic TCM and TEM cell populations but also in efficiently inducing T cells to release significantly high levels of antigen-specific effector cytokines (IL-4 and IFN-γ).In summary, the results of this study showed that the iPR8 vaccine adjuvanted with the combination of MPL and poly I:C enhanced antigen-specific antibody production, memory T cell responses, and protection against homologous influenza infection. In addition, the MPL + poly I:C-adjuvanted vaccine showed potential cross-reactive IgG and HAI activities. Thus, this study suggests the combination of MPL and poly I:C as an adjuvant for influenza vaccines. However, further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which the MPL + poly I:C adjuvant induces cross-protection.MethodsMice and reagentsFemale BALB/c mice (n = 5 each group, OrientBio Co., Gyeonggi, Korea) were used in this study. The mice were 8–10 weeks old at the time of priming immunization. The mice were fed standard chow diet, provided with water ad libitum, and maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle at 22 ± 2 °C. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and O2 gas mixture for the experimental procedures. All animal experiments confirmed to the International Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Jeju National University, South Korea (protocol number: 2021–0051). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with relevant regulations and guidelines, and reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.MPL and poly I:C were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). All reagents were prepared in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. A/PR8 and A/HK grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs were used to prepare an inactivated virus vaccine with 1% neutral buffered formalin overnight at 4 °C and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (30,000 rpm, 1 h). The inactivated virus pellets were resuspended in phosphate-based saline (PBS) and then stored at − 80 °C until use. Live A/PR8 was used as the homologous challenge.Immunization and viral infectionBALB/c mice (n = 10/group) were immunized intramuscularly with inactivated PR8 (iPR8) vaccine (1 μg) alone or in combination with MPL (1 μg), poly I:C (10 μg), or MPL + poly I:C (1 μg + 10 μg, respectively). Vaccinations were administered two times (prime and boost) with a 3 weeks interval, and sera were collected 2 weeks after each immunization. At 6 weeks after the last immunization, the naïve and vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose (1.5 × LD50) of A/PR8. Changes in body weight (BW) and survival rates were monitored for 14 days after the challenge. In accordance with IACUC guidelines, mice displaying more than 20% BW loss were considered to have reached the endpoint and humanely euthanized to minimize pain.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody and cytokine productionsImmune sera were collected 2 weeks after each vaccination, and antigen-specific antibody levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA plates were coated with either inactivated A/PR8 (600 ng/well) or A/HK (H3N2) overnight at 4 °C and blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% tween20. The plates were added with serially diluted immune sera, incubated, and then washed. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were used to detect antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies. Tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate, and absorbance was obtained at an optical density of (OD) 450 nm by using an ELISA reader.The levels of cytokines and chemokines in lung extracts obtained from immunized mice were measured using interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α kits from Invitrogen (Waltham, MA, USA) and interferon IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1), and C–C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions.Lung viral titrationLungs of the A/PR8-infected BALB/c mice were harvested at 7 days postinfection (dpi) and minced mechanically with 2 mL of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific, Corning, NY, USA) per lung. Lung extracts were collected by centrifugation, and 200 μl of extracts was saved for measurement of lung viral titers. Embryonated chicken eggs were prepared for 9–10 days to be inoculated with diluted lung extracts with PBS, and viral titers were determined by HA assay of the allantoic fluids collected after 3 days of incubation. Viral titers at 50% egg infection dose (EID50)/ml were evaluated using the Reed and Muench method52.HA inhibition (HAI) assayThe ability of immune sera to inhibit HA was estimated by performing an HAI assay after boost and challenge infection. Immune sera collected from immunized BALB/c mice were inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 30 min and then treated with the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, sera were serially diluted in PBS and incubated with 4 HA units of A/PR8 (H1N1) or 4 HA units of A/HK (H3N2) for 30 min at room temperature (RT), and then 0.5% chicken red blood cells were added to determine HAI titers.Memory B cell responseThe A/PR8 or A/HK (H3N2)-coated plates were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum containing RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h at RT to measure the memory B cell response to influenza virus. Bone marrow and spleen cells derived from the infected mice at 7 dpi were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml onto the plates and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 day or 5 days, respectively. Anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a antibodies were used to detect influenza-specific antibodies secreted by antibody producing B cells.Flow cytometryThe inflammatory cell infiltration in the respiratory tract was investigated by collecting lung samples at 7 dpi and staining single cells with antibodies specific for CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD11c (clone N418), F4/80 (clone BM8), Ly6c (clone AL-21), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (clone I-A/I-E), SiglecF (clone E50-2440), B220 (RA3-6B2), and live/dead-amcyan (LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit) after blocking the Fc receptor.Lungs and spleens were harvested and stained with antibodies specific for CD45, CD3, CD4 (clone RM4.5), CD8a (clone 53-6.7), CD44 (clone IM7), CD62L (clone MEL-14), and live/dead cells to explore the memory T cells in lung and spleen cells.Intracellular cytokines (IL-4 [clone 11B11] and IFN-γ [clone XMG1.2]) of CD4 and CD8 T cells residing in the lung and spleen cells were stained after 5 h stimulation with inactivated A/PR8 to estimate the A/PR8 specific-IL-4/IFN-γ production by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Golgi stop (monensin, a protein transport inhibitor) was added to each sample during the stimulation. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed using the fixation/permeabilization solution kit (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.The phenotypes of the acquired cells were analyzed and gated by marker expressions on cells: alveolar macrophages (AMs): CD45+CD11b−CD11c+F4/80+; neutrophils: CD45+CD11b+Ly6clowF4/80−; eosinophils: CD45+CD11b+SiglecF+; total dendritic cells (DCs): CD45+F4/80−CD11c+MHCIIhigh; plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs): CD45+F4/80−CD11c+MHCIIhighB220+; CD11b+DCs: CD45+F4/80−CD11c+MHCIIhighCD11b+; CD4 naïve T cell: CD45+CD3+CD4+CD44−CD62L+; CD8 naïve T cell: CD45+CD3+CD8+CD44−CD62L+; CD4 central memory T cell (TCM): CD45+CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62L+; CD8 TCM: CD45+CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L+; CD4 effector memory T cell (TEM): CD45+CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62Lˉ; CD8 TEM: CD45+CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62Lˉ. The gating strategies of inflammatory cells and T cells are shown in Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5.Statistical analysisAll results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Modeling studies, such as the one conducted by Waterlow et al., provide vital information about the cost–benefit potential of these products compared to currently licensed vaccines. However, this approach only accounts for directly measured medically attended influenza-associated illnesses and has two major limitations. First, this method fails to capture the full disease burden of influenza (including non-respiratory and non-medically attended influenza illnesses), which are particularly important drivers of disease burden in infants and older adults. Second, the model does not describe the ancillary benefits of influenza vaccination such as the attenuation of severe disease, prevention of severe non-respiratory outcomes (e.g., myocardial infarctions), or reduced antibiotic use. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of influenza vaccines, we must strive to improve the inputs for future modeling-based evaluations. Peer Review reports The global influenza vaccine landscape is dynamic, with novel products such as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and combination influenza/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines currently being pursued. The recent publication by Waterlow et al. is an important contribution to the emerging evidence about the marginal benefit of these novel products when compared to currently used influenza vaccines. While such analyses are useful, it is important for readers to understand their limitations. Sentinel surveillance systems, often used to generate disease and cost inputs for economic modeling, can substantially underestimate the true value of influenza and the benefit of vaccination. To fully understand the benefit of influenza vaccines, especially in low- and middle-income countries, we need to work toward better inputs in at least three aspects of future full value proposition models.First, the use of hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) as a primary measure of the burden of influenza disease overlooks two important categories of influenza-associated illness: non-SARI hospitalizations and non-hospitalized severe disease. While the SARI case definition was designed to efficiently identify influenza viruses at a minimum cost to surveillance systems, it lacks sensitivity in capturing the full spectrum of severe influenza-associated illness [1, 2]. This is particularly the case among infants and older adults who often have non-respiratory clinical presentations or complications related to influenza. In one multi-country cohort, respiratory signs and symptoms were shown to underestimate influenza-associated hospitalizations among infants by a factor of 2.6 [3]. Older adults with influenza are also frequently hospitalized for the management of cardiac, endocrine, or other non-respiratory complications precipitated by influenza illnesses [4]. Moreover, individuals at high risk for severe disease, including older adults, may avoid seeking medical care and therefore remain undetected by routine surveillance systems. One large cohort in India recently found that 90% of adults 60 years and older with lower respiratory tract illnesses did not seek any medical attention (unpublished data from Indian Network of Population-Based Surveillance Platforms for Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses among the Elderly (INSPIRE) cohort [5]).Secondly, simple inputs of vaccine effectiveness (VE) tend to underestimate the direct benefits that vaccines offer to individuals, such as reducing the severity of influenza symptoms or preventing non-respiratory complications. Notably, averted illness and cost-effectiveness models do not typically account for vaccine-mitigated influenza illness. Findings from multi-year, multi-country VE networks demonstrate that those who are vaccinated against influenza but nevertheless develop influenza illness, remain in the hospital for fewer days, are less likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or die while hospitalized as a result of their illness [6]. Similarly, cost-effectiveness models do not typically account for the benefits of vaccines in preventing non-respiratory influenza complications. For example, pregnant women vaccinated against influenza have a lower risk of influenza illness and adverse birth outcomes during the influenza season [7] and give birth to infants who are at a lower risk of influenza infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant women [8].Lastly, it is important to consider the broader benefits of influenza vaccination beyond just individual-level protection. One important but indirect benefit of vaccination is that prevention of medically attended influenza illnesses helps preserve healthcare resources during epidemics and reduces the use of antibiotics as a first-line treatment. These vaccine-derived benefits are frequently cost-effective or cost-saving [9] even when they do not account for prevention of inappropriate antibiotic use; community-level reductions in antimicrobial resistance could also be quantified [10] and might demonstrate increased cost-effectiveness. Additional community-level impacts may go beyond the capacities of standard modeling approaches, such as potential advances in health equity. For instance, vaccination may prevent lower-income households from facing catastrophic health expenses.To adequately describe the value of current trivalent, quadrivalent, and enhanced influenza vaccines, and properly compare these with newer, yet to be licensed (e.g., mRNA) vaccine products for influenza, we need to leverage our shared knowledge on the full burden of influenza and the benefits of vaccination. This involves starting with standard surveillance outcomes [11] and also accounting for broader measures of disease burden and vaccine-averted illness [12]. By expanding this evidence base, we can make better-informed policies and investments that lead to better global health outcomes [13].

These in-depth articles will focus on cutting-edge NIH biomedical research topics, describing the current state of research in a field and where it may be heading. Illustration of a nanoparticle vaccine that contains proteins from many different flu strains. UW Medicine Institute for Protein Design In March 2020, the world changed in the blink of an eye as countries around the world locked down to slow the spread of COVID-19. This often deadly disease, caused by a previously unknown coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, seeded outbreaks across the globe in record time. By the end of 2022, it had killed more than 6 million people worldwide. But COVID-19 was far from humanity’s first pandemic. As recently as 15 years ago, an outbreak of pandemic flu sickened 60 million people globally. In 2003, a new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, sickened more than 8,000 people worldwide. It was caused by a virus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No one can predict when the next pandemic will happen—only that one eventually will. These recent pandemics have brought into stark relief the need to be prepared for the next emerging disease, whenever it arrives. To this end, NIH-funded research teams have been working to develop universal vaccines against diseases with pandemic potential. Unlike current vaccines, which confer immunity to one or several strains of a disease, universal vaccines are designed to teach the immune system to defend against all versions of a pathogen—even versions that don’t exist yet. They do this by targeting an element of the pathogen that remains the same across all strains and types. Such targets are usually those that are least accessible to the immune system. This has posed a significant challenge to vaccine researchers. But with recent progress in vaccine technology, researchers believe that universal vaccines are closer to reality than ever before. Moving beyond educated guesses For some viruses, the only constant is change. Locked in a continuous battle with the human immune system, many common viruses change, or mutate, rapidly. This means that even if you’ve been infected with a previous version of a virus, your immune system may not recognize an altered version the next time around. A well-known example of the arms race between viruses and humans is the influenza virus, commonly known as the flu. More than 20 types of the virus—each of which, in turn, contains many different strains—circulate among people and animals, changing almost constantly. The flu vaccine you get every year targets four strains that the scientific community predicts are most likely to predominate that season. “We have a well-established system to collect [information] on which strains are circulating all over the world,” says NIH vaccine researcher Dr. Karin Bok. “But it takes at least six months from the decision of which [strains] to include to the vaccine being available to the public.” And which flu strains circulate during that time can change unpredictably. As a result, seasonal flu vaccines vary in their effectiveness. Their ability to prevent severe disease ranges from as high as 60% to as low as 10%. All widely used flu vaccines to date teach the immune system to recognize a protein called hemagglutinin, which is found on the surface of the influenza virus. The virus uses hemagglutinin to enter human cells. In a recent NIH-funded study, researchers designed a flu vaccine to provide broad protection against different influenza viruses. To create the vaccine, the researchers fused hemagglutinin to building blocks that assemble into nanometer-sized particles, or nanoparticles. The nanoparticles included hemagglutinin from four different flu strains. The researchers reasoned that this would encourage the immune system to respond to parts of the protein that were more similar, or conserved, between influenza strains. “What these nanoparticles do is repetitively display the antigen—the protein from the virus—that you’re trying to mount an immune response to,” explains Dr. Neil King of UW Medicine, who helped lead the study along with researchers from NIH’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC). “And repetition…tells the immune system that this is something dangerous.” This approach can create a strong immune memory of the conserved part of these viral proteins. In studies in mice, ferrets, and monkeys, the nanoparticle vaccines induced antibody responses against the included strains that were as good as or better than those elicited by a commercial vaccine. Notably, the nanoparticle vaccines also provided near-complete protection against several related flu strains that were not included in the nanoparticles. In contrast, the commercial vaccine did not protect against those other strains. “These nanoparticle vaccines may be what we call a “supra-seasonal vaccine”—a vaccine that protects for more than one year,” King says. The vaccine, called FluMos-v1, is now in phase 1 clinical trials. VRC researchers have also been working on another vaccine that may provoke an even broader immune response to influenza. The team based their approach on the structure of hemagglutinin, which consists of a stem and a head. Flu vaccines to date have targeted the head of the protein, which is most accessible to immune cells. But this is also the part of the protein that mutates fastest. The new VRC vaccine, which has completed an early-phase human trial, uses a nanoparticle to display the hemagglutinin stem without the head. The hemagglutinin stem tends to remain relatively unchanged, even as the head rapidly changes. The trial found that immunization with this vaccine was safe and elicited immune responses to a range of hemagglutinins that lasted more than a year after vaccination. Showing the immune system the stem has an added advantage, Bok explains: it’s not something the immune system is used to seeing. This novelty provokes a stronger immune response. That, plus the conserved nature of the stem, “may make it so you would be able to mount an immune response to any hemagglutinin you’re exposed to [after vaccination],” Bok says. A pressing need for universal protection The nanoparticle technologies pioneered to develop universal flu vaccines are now being tested to create vaccines that could protect against multiple current and future coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. “SARS-CoV-2 has proven itself capable of making new variants that are prolonging the global COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dr. Pamela Bjorkman, who leads an NIH-funded research team at the California Institute of Technology. And SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t the first virus of its kind—a type called a betacoronavirus—to jump from animals to people. SARS-CoV came before, and so did MERS-CoV, which causes the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). A nanoparticle vaccine was made using 60 randomly placed receptor binding domains from eight different coronaviruses. Wellcome Leap, Caltech, Merkin Institute “The fact that three betacoronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2—have spilled over into humans from animal hosts in the last 20 years illustrates the need for making broadly protective vaccines,” she says. In a recent study, Bjorkman and her team combined pieces of the spike proteins from eight different coronaviruses into a new nanoparticle vaccine. The portion of the spike protein they used is called the receptor binding domain, or RBD. Coronaviruses use the RBD to enter human cells. Each nanoparticle included 60 RBDs, so that any two adjacent ones were rarely from the same coronavirus. As with flu vaccines, this arrangement encourages antibody-producing immune cells to target areas that are similar across the proteins. The team tested the new vaccine in mice engineered to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Following vaccination, the mice produced antibodies that recognized a range of different coronaviruses. And as expected, the antibodies recognized parts of the spike protein that remained similar between coronaviruses. Promising results were also seen when the vaccine was tested in monkeys. The animals were protected not only against a SARS-CoV-2 variant that wasn’t included in the vaccine but also against SARS-CoV. “We can’t predict which virus or viruses among the vast numbers in animals will evolve in the future to infect humans to cause another epidemic or pandemic,” Bjorkman explains. “What we’re trying to do is make an all-in-one vaccine protective against SARS-like coronaviruses. This sort of vaccine would also protect against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants without the need for updating.” The arrival of mRNA vaccines Another tool being tested to create more broadly effective vaccines is mRNA technology. This technology enabled COVID-19 vaccines to be developed and brought to the clinic within less than a year after the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced. Traditionally, vaccines used weakened or killed versions of an actual pathogen, Bok explains. As technology improved, more refined vaccines were made that included only the pathogen proteins that interact with human cells. mRNA vaccines are very similar, Bok says. “You’re still getting the same protein,” she explains. “It’s just the delivery mechanism that’s different. Instead of giving you the protein, it’s giving [your body] the source code—the software—so you can make [that protein] yourself.” This approach allows the immune system to be exposed to substantially greater quantities of a protein than with a traditional vaccine. That, in turn, can produce a stronger immune response. Another advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be much cheaper to produce and easier to modify quickly. These vaccines are now being tested to prevent a variety of illnesses beyond SARS-CoV-2, including influenza. An NIH-funded research team led by Dr. Scott Hensley from the University of Pennsylvania designed a vaccine that includes mRNAs for hemagglutinin from all 20 influenza types known to infect people. It hadn’t been possible to include so much variation with traditional vaccine production methods. But the researchers thought it might work with mRNA technology. In animal tests, mice that received the experimental mRNA vaccine produced antibodies against both similar and unique regions of all 20 different types of hemagglutinin. Levels of these antibodies remained unchanged for months after vaccination. This robust antibody production occurred whether or not the mice had previously been exposed to one of the flu strains. Further experiments showed that vaccination protected both mice and ferrets from a dangerous flu strain similar to one of those in the vaccine. “For a conventional vaccine, immunizing against all these types would be a major challenge, but with mRNA technology it’s relatively easy,” Hensley says. “The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs.” “When we think about pandemic preparedness,” Bok says, “what we’re most worried about is the first few months, before vaccines can be prepared. Universal vaccines, along with antivirals and other treatments, could provide [vital] protection against severe disease from the next pandemic.” —by Sharon Reynolds Related LinksBivalent Boosters Provide Better Protection Against Severe COVID-19Using mRNA Technology for a Universal Flu VaccineFighting Current and Future Coronaviruses with a Single VaccineExperimental Vaccine Protects against Multiple CoronavirusesNanoparticle Vaccine against Various CoronavirusesNanoparticle-Based Flu VaccineUniversal Mosquito Vaccine TestedNewly Identified Flu Antibodies Could Improve Vaccines and TreatmentsUniversal Influenza Vaccine ResearchPandemic PreparednessReferences: Quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccines induce broad protection.

Sophie Wei | July 28, 2023 Credit: Getty Images Research on the potential link between vaccines and Guillain-Barre syndrome has mixed findings — some indicate a minimal association; others do not find a significant causal relationship. Following a 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign in New Jersey, increased reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) raised concern throughout the United States. As a result, the influenza vaccination program was suspended and the nationwide surveillance of the potential link between GBS and influenza vaccination began.1 The rare neurologic disorder, GBS, occurs when the body attacks its nerves due to immune reactions triggered by certain bacterial or viral infections. It typically occurs in 0.4 to 4.0 cases per 100,000 individuals, with higher rates seen in men aged 75 years and older.2 Recent research on vaccines and GBS has yielded mixed findings, with some studies supporting an association, while others suggest vaccination may offer protection against GBS. A Proposed Mechanism When a virus triggers an immune reaction, the frontline immune cells of the body will activate T cell differentiation, which triggers macrophages and B cells. Macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and nitric oxide; B cells produce immunoglobulin G (IgG) to eradicate the virus, but when these proteins and immunoglobulins leak through the blood-nerve barrier, this mechanism can damage the peripheral nervous system. IgG can also trigger the complement system which can result in further nerve cell damage. The most common triggering infections are Campylobacter jejuni and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Evidence for links between GBS and varicella, measles, and influenza has also been studied. However, regarding vaccine-associated GBS, the mechanism could potentially involve similar immune patterns during vaccine-induced autoimmunity.3 First Incidence of Vaccine-Associated GBS In the first incidence of vaccine-associated GBS, surveillance found that 532 of 1,098 patients with a new onset of GBS had recently received an influenza vaccination. Higher attack rates were also observed among vaccinated individuals. The overall incidence was observed to be 7.1 cases per a million individuals, higher than the average incidence for GBS in the general population. Further analysis found that GBS risk varied with age and gender; individuals from ages 25-64 and men had a higher risk. The period of highest risk was found to be within the first 6 weeks of vaccine administration.1 These findings helped to substantiate a small but significant association between GBS and vaccination and lead to an increased sensitivity to vaccine adverse events and monitoring tactics. As vaccine safety became increasingly monitored, GBS association with vaccines other than influenza began to be studied. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Numerous programs in the US, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS)4 and the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)5 monitor vaccine adverse events. In 2005, research from VAERS spanning from 1990 to 2005 revealed the influenza vaccine was associated with the highest proportion of GBS cases, following the hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap), measles mumps and rubella (MMR), and pneumococcal vaccines; but, rates of severe outcomes were comparable with the general GBS population.6 Compared with previous seasons, in the 2018-2019 influenza season, a VSD analysis7 found no statistically significant increase in GBS risk with the high-dose influenza vaccine. GBS Severity and Clinical Features GBS severity can vary drastically from patient to patient with Campylobacter jejuni infection associated with more severe and disabling clinical features. Although postvaccination GBS can have similar severity at nadir, compared with typical postinfectious GBS, a 2017 retrospective review in Korea8 classified most cases as Brighton criteria levels 1-3 (level 1, highest level of certainty vs 4, the lowest certainty of diagnosis), indicating moderate to high certainty of GBS diagnosis associated with influenza vaccination. Influenza Vaccination May Protect Against GBS Although some evidence suggests an association between influenza vaccination and GBS incidence, most research indicates that active influenza infection poses a higher risk for GBS, and vaccination may provide protection against it.9 In a 2013 Canadian study, researchers utilized universal health care system data from 1993 and 2011 for a self-controlled risk interval trial. Of the 2,831 incidence admissions for GBS, the researchers found that 330 individuals received an influenza vaccine and 109 cases were preceded by influenza infection. Although the attributable risk for GBS hospital admissions was reported to be 1.03 per million vaccinations, the attributable risk was 17.2 GBS admissions per million influenza infections.10 In a 2015 simulation study, the researchers aimed to evaluate the impact of seasonal influenza vaccination on the absolute risk of GBS. Probabilistic decision tree simulation models demonstrated that vaccination is more likely to reduce overall GBS risk in individuals. For a hypothetical 45-year-old woman and a 75-year-old man, the calculated excess GBS risk after vaccination was reported to be −0.36/1 million vaccinations and −0.42/1 million vaccinations, respectively. However, in rare instances of low influenza incidence and poor vaccine effectiveness, the models predicted a slight increase in GBS risk, although the overall excess risk is estimated to be approximately 1 in 1 million individuals.11 “[N]atural incidence rates of GBS are similar to postvaccination rates of GBS; vaccines also play a major role in preventing various infections that may put an individual at higher risk for naturally acquiring GBS. In a 2022 cross-sectional study conducted in Taiwan, the researchers specifically studied GBS risk among adults aged 65 and older who received the influenza vaccine. The incidence rate ratio for GBS during days 1 to 7, 1 to 15, and 1 to 42 days after vaccination were 0.95, 0.87, and 0.92, respectively; no statistical significance was found. Subgroup analyses also reported consistent findings and support the notion that influenza vaccine benefits outweigh GBS concerns.12 GBS Recurrence After Vaccination Outside of direct vaccine and GBS association, another potential concern is that vaccination may trigger a relapse of GBS. In 2012, the researchers retrospectively identified cases of GBS from Kaiser Permanente databases from 1995-2006 to examine whether or not vaccination impacts GBS recurrence rates. Of the 550 cases of GBS identified, 989 vaccines were given to 279 of these individuals, of which 405 were trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines given to 107 individuals before GBS diagnosis. After chart review and neurologist evaluation, only 6 individuals were confirmed as having recurrent GBS. The calculated recurrence rate for GBS was 1.5 per 1,000 person-years; among the 6 individuals, only 1 had vaccine exposure prior to their recurrent GBS.13 Other Vaccinations and GBS Risk The incidence of GBS has been closely monitored as a potential adverse event following influenza vaccination, leading to investigations into its occurrence with other vaccines, including recombinant zoster virus (RZV), MMR, human papillomavirus (HPV), and meningococcal vaccines. In a 2021 observational case series cohort study utilizing Medicare claims data, RZV vaccinations were associated with an increase of 3 GBS cases per 1 million vaccinations during the 42 days following vaccinations, with a significant risk ratio (RR) of 2.84 (P =.001). Despite this increased risk, the researchers highlighted the importance of considering the benefits of reducing herpes zoster and its complications with the RZV vaccine, as the risk-benefit balance remains favorable.14 Case reports have documented a possible association between the MMR vaccination and GBS; however, several of the studies investigating this link remain controversial due to design limitations. In a study conducted in South America, the researchers compared the baseline incidence of GBS from 1990 to 1994 to 1-month periods of widespread measles vaccination campaigns from 1992 to 1993 in several South American countries. Among 73 million immunized children, GBS incidence rates were 0.67 per 100,000 individuals per year: a rate that is within the typical baseline frequency of GBS.15 HPV vaccination and GBS risk results have been historically conflicting; however recently, a large self-controlled case-series analysis was conducted in the United Kingdom, where a relative incidence of 1.10 of GBS was calculated for a 12-month risk period after the HPV vaccine.15 The quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MCV4) was studied in a retrospective trial with 9.5 million subjects where 15% had received the MCV4 vaccine. No confirmed GBS cases were diagnosed within 42 days of vaccine receipt; after 42 days, the incidence rate was calculated to be 0.45 cases per 100,000 person-year.15 COVID-19 Vaccination and GBS The COVID-19 pandemic revived vaccine controversies, leading to extensive scrutiny of COVID-19 vaccines for safety and efficacy due to the antivaccine movement. As mandates spread globally, the link between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS has also been assessed, The association between COVID-19 vaccination and GBS was first brought to light after 5 patients were reported to have GBS after COVID-19 onset in Italy.16 In a meta-analysis from January 2020 and November 2021, a total of 88 COVID-19 vaccine-associated GBS cases were studied; with 59.1% attributed to the AstraZeneca vaccine and 22.7% to Pfizer; 63% of patients had favorable outcomes despite varying severity and latency between vaccination and onset. In this group, 2 patients had a history of GBS and 5 patients had also received the influenza vaccine.17 In a recent retrospective cohort study, the researchers analyzed US Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS) data to compare COVID-19 vaccination methods with GBS case reports. Of the 487,651,785 COVID-19 vaccine doses, 295 individuals reported GBS diagnosis following vaccination; the researchers found that specifically, Ad25.COV2.5 COVID-19 vaccination had the highest risk for GBS with minimal risk associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.18 What’s the Scientific Consensus? The scientific consensus for vaccine usage overwhelmingly supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Regarding GBS in particular, natural incidence rates of GBS are similar to postvaccination rates of GBS; vaccines also play a major role in preventing various infections that may put an individual at higher risk for naturally acquiring GBS. However, given unique patient risk factors and history, it is important to individualize therapy based on the clinical evidence and risk/benefit analyses.

Since then, humans have passed the strain to pigs at least 370 times in the US By Chen Ly 27 July 2023 Facebook / Meta Twitter / X icon Linkedin Reddit Email A pig having its snout swabbed to test for virusesM.Marti and A.Grimes, USDA People have passed swine flu to pigs at least 370 times over 12 years in the US. Better understanding how the virus behind the disease moves between humans and pigs could help to reduce infections and ensure vaccines stay effective. Swine flu is the common name for a condition that originated in pigs. It is caused by a type of influenza A, known as H1N1, of which a variant called pdm09 led to an outbreak in people in 2009. Since then, the variant has lingered in pigs and infected a small number of people, with some recorded cases of transmission between the two. Read more:A quarter of all pigs have died this year due to African swine fever Advertisement Tavis Anderson at the US Department of Agriculture and his colleagues wanted to investigate how pdm09 has spread since 2009. They analysed genetic sequences of all the H1N1 virus samples collected in people and pigs in the US between 2009 and 2021. Of these, 12,823 human and 1112 swine samples were of the pdm09 strain. Viruses evolve quickly in a host’s body and often develop specific traits in different species, says Anderson. To assess which of these samples were a result of transmission between the two species, the researchers looked at how similar the samples were to each other. If one version of the virus in a person looked reasonably different to versions in other people, they assumed it was passed by a pig. Conversely, if a version of the virus in a pig looked different to those in other pigs, they assumed it was passed by a person. From this, the researchers estimated there were 370 cases of human-to-swine transmission and 17 cases of swine-to-human transmission over the study’s 12-year period, with most of these probably occurring due to farming. However, the true number may be higher as not all infections lead to ill health and can therefore go unreported, says Anderson. Sign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter The virus also appeared to evolve particularly rapidly in pigs and continued to circulate in these animals. Vaccines against swine flu can become less effective due to these evolutionary changes, says Anderson. Between 2020 and 2021, during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, cases of pdm09 fell in people but continued to circulate in pigs as a carryover from infections in these animals from previous years. This suggests it is possible to reduce the interspecies transmission of swine flu if proper control measures are taken, says Rebecca Jane Cox Brokstad at the University of Bergen, Norway. “We have to understand all the components associated with the transmission of the viruses between different hosts,” says Anderson. “Hopefully if we do that, we could improve animal health and human health.” Journal reference:PLoS Pathogens DOI: doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011476 Topics:swine flu Advertisement Sign up to our weekly newsletter Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!

The number of flu cases and deaths changes yearly, depending on the severity of the virus. By Claire Gillespie Claire Gillespie Claire Gillespie is an experienced health and wellness writer.

The CDC estimated 20,000 flu-related deaths during the 2019–2020 flu season. The flu is not a reportable disease in most states. Experts develop estimates based on rates of lab-confirmed, flu-associated hospitalizations. Still, only some people who have the flu see a healthcare provider. An estimated 35 million flu-related illnesses occurred during the 2019–2020 flu season. That included 16 million medical visits and 380,000 hospitalizations. In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic dominated the United States, flu cases were at an all-time low: The CDC reported 748 flu-related deaths during the 2020–2021 flu season. Read on to learn how many people die from the flu yearly on average, what infectious disease experts look for to gauge upcoming flu seasons, and how to protect yourself. Cecilie_Arcurs / Getty Images How Many People Die of the Flu Each Year on Average? According to data collected by the CDC from 2010–2020, the flu caused about 12,000–52,000 deaths annually. The flu caused nine million to 41 million illnesses and 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations during that time. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 290,000–650,000 flu-related deaths annually. Those numbers vary widely because "the flu" is not one specific virus. Different flu virus strains that circulate through communities cause illness. "Sometimes, there are years where there are big genetic shifts, and we can see a very different virus," Cassandra Pierre, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Boston Medical Center, told Health. Flu viruses may change gradually over time as they infect people and replicate. Other times, there are sudden changes in flu viruses. That typically occurs if a flu virus from animals “jumps” to and infects the human population. For example, a flu virus, H1N1, originated in swine and caused massive human outbreaks. The dominant strain is constantly changing, and some can be more severe than others. "[Sometimes], it can be a nastier strain," Robert L. Murphy, MD, a professor of infectious diseases at the Northwestern Medicine Feinberg School of Medicine, told Health. "It goes up and down." What To Know About Flu Tests—When You Need One, and What To Do if You Test Positive What Information Helps Predict the Severity of Upcoming Flu Seasons? The CDC uses factors called intensity threshold (IT) values to determine flu severity. IT values include: Flu-associated hospitalization ratesOutpatient visit percentages for flu-like illnessesPneumonia or flu death percentages Information related to those values plays a part in flu forecasting. Other researchers beyond those within the CDC submit data to prepare and take preventative measures. Preparation and preventative measures may include: Community action guidance (e.g., organization closures)Healthcare provider and treatment distribution and placementPotential hospitalization influxesVaccinations The low number of flu cases during the COVID-19 pandemic may have left the United States "relatively immunologically naive," James H. Conway, MD, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Global Health Institute, told Health. Lower-than-usual rates of flu cases and vaccinations may have gotten rid of any leftover immunity from the 2019–2020 flu season. Paired with relaxed COVID-19 preventative measures, experts used that information to predict a severe 2022–2023 flu season. From October 1, 2022, to April 30, 2023, the CDC estimated 27 million to 54 million cases, which may be higher than the 2019–2020 flu season. Vaccine Preparedness The number of flu cases and deaths partly depends on "how accurately researchers were able to predict what should go into the flu vaccine and how many people are vaccinated," Anjali Mahoney, MD, chief medical officer at Venice Family Clinic, told Health. Data from other countries can help prepare flu vaccines. For example, in 2021, Australia—which has its winter during summertime in the United States—did not have a flu season. That might have been good news for a less severe season in the United States. Still, a lack of information about the dominant strain spelled trouble for vaccine formulation. "Usually, when the powers that be are trying to figure out which strains to put in the vaccine, they are basing it on what circulated in the southern hemisphere during summer," said Dr. Conway. "[Australia] didn't have any flu season, so the powers that be couldn't figure out prevalent flu strains." How Can You Protect Yourself From the Flu? The straightforward answer here is to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The CDC advises everyone 6 months and older to get an annual flu vaccine. Vaccination is the first and most essential step to protect against the flu and its complications. "The only protection people can get is getting vaccinated and being careful about respiratory viruses," said Dr. Conway. Certain people are more likely to develop flu complications than others, such as: Adults older than 65 Children younger than 5 People with chronic illnesses (e.g., asthma, diabetes, and heart disease) Pregnant people Experts strongly encourage those people to receive a flu vaccine to prevent severe illness. There's not enough research to support whether a high-dose flu vaccine protects people with heart disease more than the standard option. Consult a healthcare provider about what option is best for you. What To Know About the High-Dose Flu Vaccine Research has found that preventative measures for COVID-19 help protect against the flu, such as: Avoiding crowded places Proper handwashing Social distancing Wearing masks "Everybody masking during winter months could help a lot with preventing flu deaths," noted Dr. Conway. "That's done pretty regularly in some areas of the world. That may be as much a part of our major protection as major vaccines." It's essential to remain vigilant about staying home from work and school when they are ill, added Dr. Conway. A Quick Review There's no exact number of how many people die from the flu every year. Flu severity changes yearly, depending on the severity of the virus. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, proper handwashing and wearing masks helped decrease the number of flu cases and deaths from the previous year. Experts in the United States use data from other countries and previous years to predict flu severity. That data helps prepare vaccines, one of the most effective ways to protect against the flu.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 27-Jul-2023 “Swine flu” strain has passed from humans to swine nearly 400 times since 2009 Analysis provides further support for managing influenza A infection in people who work with swine Peer-Reviewed Publication PLOS image: Dr. Giovana Ciacci Zanella swabbing a pig snout to gather samples to test for influenza A virus view more Credit: M.Marti and A.Grimes, USDA (CC-BY 2.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ A new study of the strain of influenza A responsible for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic—pdm09—shows that the virus has passed from humans to swine about 370 times since 2009, and subsequent circulation in swine has resulted in the evolution of pdm09 variants that then jumped from swine to humans. Alexey Markin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS Pathogens. Influenza A can cause the flu in humans, birds, swine, and some other mammals. In 2009 and 2010, a pandemic caused by pdm09 resulted in thousands of human deaths around the world. Since then, as demonstrated in prior studies, pdm09 has repeatedly passed from humans to swine, and circulation of the virus among swine leads to evolutionary changes in pdm09 that could make it more likely to cross back and infect humans. To better understand this risk, Markin and colleagues analyzed pdm09 transmission data between 2009 and 2021. They also investigated how these interspecies events may have affected the genetic diversity of the virus in swine and the risk of subsequent human infection. The analysis showed that, since 2009, pdm09 has crossed from humans to swine about 370 separate times, with most of these events occurring when pdm09 burden was highest among humans. In 2020 and 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, pdm09 circulation among humans dropped, but pdm09 circulation persisted in swine as a result of about 150 human-to-swine transmissions between 2018 and 2020. The researchers found that most human-to-swine transmission events were isolated, but a few led to sustained circulation of different pdm09 genetic lineages among swine in the U.S. These swine-circulating variants appeared to be genetically poor matches for human seasonal vaccines, suggesting that the vaccines would have provided scant protection against them. The analysis also showed that persistent pdm09 circulation among swine was associated with at least five instances of swine-to-human transmission. These findings add to mounting evidence that managing influenza A infection in people who work with swine can help prevent transmission to pigs, and subsequently reduce the risk of spread back to humans. The authors add: "“Controlling influenza A virus infection in humans can minimize spillover of viruses into pigs and reduce the diversity of viruses circulating in swine populations. Limiting virus diversity in pigs can minimize the emergence of novel viruses and the potential for swine-to-human transmission of influenza A virus.” ############ In your coverage, please use this URL to provide access to the freely available article in PLOS Pathogens: http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011476 Citation: Markin A, Ciacci Zanella G, Arendsee ZW, Zhang J, Krueger KM, Gauger PC, et al.

In 2009 and 2010, a pandemic caused by the pdm09 strain—popularly called 'swine flu' because it contained genetic sequences from avian, swine, and human influenza—caused thousands of human deaths worldwide. Since then, this lineage has crossed over 370 times from humans to pigs in the United States, according to a study published in PLOS Pathogens. The research also indicates that the circulation of the virus among pigs may cause further evolutionary changes in this lineage, which would increase the risk of the virus passing back to humans.

Expert reactions Elisa Pérez - gripe porcina EN Elisa Pérez Veterinary virologist at the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA - CSIC) National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC) Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) Science Media Centre Spain This study is a great example of the importance of reverse zoonoses, that is, the transmission of pathogens from humans to animals (in this case, pigs). Historically, little attention has been paid to this type of animal-human contagion, largely due to our anthropocentric vision of health, in which we tend to consider humans as victims of contagion, but never as its origin. The H1N1 pandemic influenza virus is a zoonotic virus that arose on a pig farm in Mexico from a combination of genetic material from avian, swine and human influenza viruses. The virus managed to jump from pigs to humans and then fully adapt to its new host, effectively transmitting from person to person around the world. Just one month after the pandemic H1N1 virus had reached a worldwide distribution, the first cases of human-to-animal transmission were detected. The first outbreak occurred on a pig farm in Canada and since then the virus has jumped from humans to pigs hundreds of times, as confirmed by this study. The main risk of these reverse zoonoses is that the animal host ends up becoming a reservoir of the pathogen in question. In other words, the virus adapts to the pig and continues to evolve in it, so that it can accumulate mutations that end up giving rise to a more dangerous virus, either because the seasonal flu human vaccines are less effective against it or because the Pre-existing human immunity against the parent strain does not protect against variants originating in pigs. It is well known that the pig is a key species in the emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses. In fact, it is considered the main “shaker species”, since it is susceptible to swine, human and bird flu viruses. If a swine cell is infected at the same time by influenza viruses of various origins, a rearrangement of genetic segments may occur, giving rise to a new subtype capable of infecting various species. This is what happened with the H1N1 strain in 2009 and what could happen again at any time, especially in the current situation in which we are suffering from the largest avian flu epidemic in history, caused by the H5N1 subtype, which we know is it can also infect the pig. The pig has been the species most affected by these reverse transmissions of the H1N1 virus, but it has not been the only one. Human-animal contagion has been confirmed in other livestock species such as turkey, in pets such as dogs, cats, and ferrets, in zoo animals, and in mink on fur farms. It is likely that all these species remind you of something. Indeed, all of them, except the turkeys, have recently been infected with another pandemic virus: SARS-CoV-2. In fact, there are many similarities between the two viruses, especially in the spectrum of species that they can infect and in the risk of the appearance of animal reservoirs that greatly complicate the control of the disease at a global level. Both examples remind us that zoonoses are transmitted in two directions and that ignoring this fact can have very serious consequences for our health and that of the planet. To fight against these viruses, it is essential that animal health and public health professionals work in coordination, accepting that everything is connected and that health will be global or it will not be.

The vast majority of these infections occurred during the years since the pandemic, when the virus circulated in humans with its highest incidence, but transmission events have not stopped since then. This study describes the frequency of these human-to-pig transmission episodes in the US from the emergence of the 2009 pandemic to the present. The introduction and establishment of new viruses of human origin in pigs increases the heterogeneity of the viruses in this species and increases the chances of the origin of swine flu strains capable of inverse transmission to humans and causing new pandemics. Similarly, a study carried out in our INIA-CSIC laboratory demonstrated the existence of at least three genetically different lines of the human H1N1pdm2009 virus in our pig herd, the result of independent transmissions of viruses of human origin. Once introduced into swine, the new H1N1pdm2009 viruses evolved independently from their human relatives through mutation and genetic exchange with other swine influenza viruses, giving rise to a wide diversity of influenza A viruses in our swine herd. Human influenza vaccines may partially protect against some of these swine viral variants depending on the degree of antigenic similarity. Prior to the 2009 pandemic, there were also several cases of reverse zoonoses that contributed to shaping the genetic makeup of contemporary swine influenza viruses. This evolutionary closeness between swine and human influenza viruses explains the relative ease of reciprocal transmission of viruses between the two species. For this reason, close and constant surveillance of influenza viruses in both species is absolutely necessary to anticipate possible emergencies of swine flu viruses with pandemic potential and the reissue of another pandemic similar to or with worse consequences than the one suffered in 2009. Special surveillance should be carried out on those people who, for professional reasons, have close and frequent contact with pigs: farmers, veterinarians, butchers, transporters, etc. The author has not responded to our request to declare conflicts of interest Language EN Publications Reverse-zoonoses of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A viruses and evolution in United States swine results in viruses with zoonotic potential Research articlePeer reviewedExperimental studyPeopleAnimals Reverse-zoonoses of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A viruses and evolution in United States swine results in viruses with zoonotic potential Research articlePeer reviewedExperimental studyPeopleAnimals Journal PLoS Pathogens Publication date 27/07/2023 Authors Alexey Markin et al.

However, it remains poorly understood how FluPol switches between its transcription and replication states, especially given that the structural bases of these two functions are fundamentally different. Here we propose a mechanism by which FluPol achieves functional switching between these two states through a previously unstudied conformation, termed an ‘intermediate state’. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained a structure of the intermediate state of H5N1 FluPol at 3.7 Å, which is characterized by a blocked cap-binding domain and a contracted core region. Structural analysis results suggest that the intermediate state may allow FluPol to transition smoothly into either the transcription or replication state. Furthermore, we show that the formation of the intermediate state is required for both the transcription and replication activities of FluPol, leading us to conclude that the transcription and replication cycles of FluPol are regulated via this intermediate state.

FluPol is shown as a cartoon representation colored the same as in Fig. 1a. The 424-loop in the cap-binding domain and the PB2 helix α11 and hinge are colored in blue and black, respectively, for clarity. The transition from the intermediate FluPol to replicase is stabilized by newly synthesized FluPol (called encapsidating FluPol after replicase assembly) through interactions with the hinge region. After the rotation of the whole PB2-C, ANP32A induces the 627 domain to further rotate to an exposed position with host-specific residue 627 being highly accessible, thereby finishing the assembly of replicase. The trajectory of intermediate conformations was calculated by UCSF Chimera.Supplementary Video 2Transition from the intermediate conformation to transcriptase. FluPol is shown as a cartoon representation colored the same as in Fig. 1a. The 424-loop in the cap-binding domain and the PB2 helix α11 and hinge are colored in blue and black, respectively, for clarity. The transition from the intermediate FluPol to transcriptase is stabilized by the Pol II CTD peptide binding on the polymerase surface. Pol II CTD binding triggers conformational changes of the 627 domain, thereby releasing the cap-binding domain and activating the polymerase for ‘cap-snatching’ toward the transcription preinitiation state. The trajectory of intermediate conformations was calculated by UCSF Chimera.Source dataSource Data Fig. 2Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 2Uncropped gel.Source Data Fig. 3Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 3Uncropped gel.Source Data Fig. 5Statistical source data.Source Data Fig. 5Uncropped gel.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 4Uncropped gel and unprocessed western blots.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 6Statistical source data.Source Data Extended Data Fig. 7Statistical source data.Rights and permissionsSpringer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.Reprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleLi, H., Wu, Y., Li, M. et al.

A cat shelter in South Korea has been put under quarantine after two of the felines tested positive for H5N1 bird flu in the capital city of Seoul.The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday that this was the first time that this bird flu had been detected in cats in the country since 2016, as reported by Reuters.The positive-testing cats were two of 38 cats that had recently died at the same shelter. Workers at the shelter are being monitored, although none are exhibiting symptoms of the condition. From left, a stock image of a chicken in a cage and a sick cat.

Two dead cats at an animal shelter in South Korea have been found to have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu. More ISTOCK / GETTY IMAGES PLUS H5N1 bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a highly infectious viral disease that usually spreads between birds, but can also jump species to mammals, and occasionally, humans. Cases of the H5N1 strain of the virus have seen a worldwide outbreak since 2021, being detected in birds around the globe.Avian influenza comes in both "low pathogenic" and "highly pathogenic" forms, with low pathogenic strains only causing minor symptoms in birds, and highly pathogenic strains posing a greater threat.Nearly 59 million poultry birds across the country have been affected by the outbreak, with around 7,000 wild birds testing positive for H5N1, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data. Stock image of a chicken and a vial of H5N1 bird flu. Stock image of a chicken and a vial of H5N1 bird flu. ISTOCK / GETTY IMAGES PLUS The South Korean deaths come only days after 34 cats in Poland were found to have been infected by the virus, many of which showed neurological symptoms like paralysis, with some later dying."This virus needs to be taken seriously," Wendla Beyer, policy coordinator for international animal welfare nonprofit Four Paws, said in a statement on July 17 regarding the Polish cat outbreak. "Following on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the largest avian influenza outbreak worldwide, with devastating effects on animals, trade and the livelihoods of farmers. Infections in mammals spark fears of viral mutations that could become transmissible between humans, igniting a new pandemic. And now, as we have seen, house cats are dying from the virus."Other cases of mammals being infected by the virus include grizzly bears, foxes, skunks and raccoons, and a variety of domestic mammals like dogs, cats, pigs and horses. Stock image of cats in a shelter. Stock image of cats in a shelter. ISTOCK / GETTY IMAGES PLUS Only one person has tested positive for the infection in the U.S., which occurred in April this year in someone directly involved with culling poultry infected with the virus. The virus has been circulating for several decades, however, infecting over 700 people since 2003. Around half of the people infected died from the virus.There is a very low risk of humans being infected by H5N1, both from birds and other humans, due to the low success of the virus spreading between people, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO). No cases of a person catching the virus from cats has ever been recorded, with most cases stemming from working in close contact with poultry. Read more Can H3N8 bird flu spread between humans?

Mystery sparked by rare whale species found on Massachusetts beach Montana Grizzly bears acting strangely from highly pathogenic virus killed There is concern that the virus may mutate into a strain more infectious to humans, which would be a major worldwide issue."The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans," Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on February 24. "WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries."Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

Towhey July 24, 2023 Share › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share by Email Print Credit: Patricio Nahuelhual/Getty Images Nursing homes that conduct rapid, on-site testing of residents who exhibit flu-like symptoms can lead to earlier detection of outbreaks and reduce hospitalization rates, according to new research. Facilities using the rapid tests became more adept at “spotting and halting” outbreaks that flu cases fell from 22% in the first year of the study to 3% in the final year, said the researchers from the University of Wisconsin School and Medicine and Public Health. Emergency room visits at facilities that conducted rapid testing dropped by 22%, hospitalizations fell 21%, and the length of hospital stays plummeted 36%, the research said. “This study demonstrates the profound effect of early detection of influenza in long-term care facilities,’’ said lead author Jonathan Temte, MD, PhD, professor of family medicine and community health at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. “Nursing homes are collections of very vulnerable individuals, so anything we can do to protect them is very important.” The study took place in 20 nursing homes in Wisconsin over the course of three flu seasons from 2016 to 2019. Half of the facilities followed their normal flu protocols of testing patients whose symptoms meet the standard definition of influenza. Nasal swabs were sent to off-site labs for analysis, which could take up to three days to communicate results, resulting in a delay of administering antivirals to residents. The remaining facilities used a broader definition of symptoms — sometimes as minor as a new runny nose without an accompanying fever — and used rapid, on-site tests that could yield results in as fast as 15 minutes. The study noted that fevers and other symptoms tend not to present in older patients. “The quicker results helped stamp out flu outbreaks,” Temte said. “Time is of the essence for managing influenza because the virus proliferates very quickly.” Nine of the 10 nursing homes that used the on-site, rapid test wanted to continue with that process after the research ended. The test kits cost approximately $12 each compared to $2,883, which is the cost of an average, per-day hospital stay. Protecting patients through surveillance could be a critical tool for nursing homes. While almost all US hospitals mandate flu vaccination for their healthcare workers, comparatively few nursing homes do. Previous studies have shown the long-term care workforce has the lowest share of workers vaccinated against influenza. Pressure is ratcheting up to ensure coverage, with a new Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service rule requiring reporting of staff doses received annually between Oct. 1 and March 31. The Influenza Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel measure was added to the Quality Reporting Program as part of the FY 2023 SNF PPS Final Rule.The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association.

HealthManya SinghUpdated: July 26, 2023 1:20 pm ISTInfluenza can cause cold like symptoms and disrupt your routineInfluenza, commonly known as the flu, is a viral respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It typically affects the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. Symptoms of influenza can include fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, body aches, fatigue, and headaches.Regarding the risk of catching influenza in the monsoon season, it primarily depends on the region and climate. In general, influenza tends to be more prevalent during cold weather or winter seasons rather than the monsoon season. However, certain factors during the monsoon season may contribute to an increased risk. Keep reading as we list some of these factors.4 Main factors which increase the risk of influenza in monsoon:1. Crowded indoor spacesDuring the monsoon season, people often stay indoors due to heavy rainfall. Close proximity in crowded spaces can enhance the transmission of influenza viruses.2. Weakened immunityChanges in temperature and humidity levels during the monsoon season may weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections.3. Waterborne diseasesThe monsoon season is associated with an increased incidence of waterborne illnesses, such as gastroenteritis. These illnesses can weaken the body's immune system, making individuals more susceptible to contracting respiratory infections like influenza.4. Lack of ventilationDue to continuous rainfall and high humidity, houses and buildings may have limited ventilation during the monsoon season. Poor ventilation may enhance the survival and transmission of influenza viruses.Now that we understand what causes influenza, we can take steps to reduce our risk of catching it.Strategies to lower the risk of influenza during monsoon:1. Proper hand hygieneWash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing or sneezing.2. Use hand sanitizerWhen soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to kill any flu viruses on your hands.3. Avoid close contact with sick individualsStay away from people who are sick or showing flu-like symptoms, as the influenza virus can spread through respiratory droplets.4. Wear a maskConsider wearing a mask, especially if you are in close proximity to infected individuals or crowded places, to reduce the risk of inhaling respiratory droplets.5. Practice respiratory etiquetteCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of flu droplets.6. Maintain good overall healthStrengthen your immune system by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting adequate sleep, and managing stress.7. Stay hydratedDrink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal tea, and soups, to keep your body hydrated, which helps in maintaining a healthy immune system.8. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfacesRegularly clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces in your home, such as doorknobs, light switches, and countertops, to reduce the risk of contamination.9. Avoid crowded placesDuring the monsoon season, try to avoid crowded areas where the risk of exposure to the influenza virus is higher.10. Get vaccinatedConsult with your healthcare provider about getting a seasonal flu vaccine, as it is the most effective way to protect yourself from influenza.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comIt is important to maintain good hygiene practices like regular handwashing, covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoiding close contact with individuals who have flu-like symptoms.Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

ADVERTISEMENTThe strain of virus responsible for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has passed from humans to swine nearly 400 times, according to a new study.The US-based team tracked the swine flu strain pdm09 between the years 2009 and 2021 to offer insights into its transmission.After being passed from humans to pigs, the circulation of pdm09 among swine resulted in some variants that then jumped back to humans, the study showed.“Controlling influenza A virus infection in humans can minimise spillover of viruses into pigs and reduce the diversity of viruses circulating in swine populations,” the authors said.What is swine flu?Swine flu or H1N1 is a subtype of the influenza A virus Influenza A can cause the flu in humans, birds, swine and some other mammals.The virus can cause symptoms such as cough, high temperature, headache, runny nose, and joint and muscle pain.The swine flu was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in June 2009. The virus had jumped from pigs to humans, spreading rapidly.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 people worldwide died from the virus in the initial year of the pandemic.What does this new study say?The new analysis of swine flu transmission, published in the PLOS Pathogens review, revealed the pdm09 strain crossed from humans to swine about 370 times.Researchers, led by Alexey Markin of the US Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, also observed 17 cases of swine-to-human transmission.A few instances of human-to-pig transmission led to circulation of “different pdm09 genetic lineages” among pigs in the US.The researchers said the variants were “genetically and antigenetically different from human seasonal vaccine strains”, suggesting that vaccines would offer little protection against them.The findings add to mounting evidence that managing influenza A infection in people who work with swine can help prevent transmission to pigs, the authors said, and reduce the risk of spread back to humans.Zoonotic disease outbreaks could increaseScientists and policymakers are increasingly recognising the interconnectedness between environmental changes, human activities, and the spread of infectious diseases from animals to humans.With climate change altering ecosystems and affecting the distribution of animal species, the likelihood of zoonotic disease outbreaks may increase in the coming years.ADVERTISEMENTThe World Health Organization estimates that there are over 200 known types of zoonoses.There is also growing recognition of the need to address the complex challenges posed by zoonotic diseases, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.Authorities are increasingly focusing on adopting a One Health approach that integrates human, animal, and environmental health considerations.Go to accessibility shortcutsShare this articleComments You might also like Now playing Next Europe News Swine fever threatens Italy's prized prosciutto production Now playing Next Green News Monkeypox: What are the dangers of zoonotic diseases?

Advertisement Across the world, scientists worked at record speed to develop a successful vaccine for the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 760 million people and killed over 6.9 million as of July 2023.In the US, vaccine development undergoes a specific set of steps that includes exploratory phases, pre-clinical trials, a new drug application, four phases of vaccine trials, and thorough vetting from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.All of that combined could take multiple years, and even then, it might not be as effective as hoped. But because of the severity of the pandemic, manufacturers and leading scientists were able to expedite the process to yield results as quickly as possible. Advertisement To gain some perspective on the complexities of vaccine development, here's how long it took to develop vaccines for other infectious diseases throughout history. Advertisement Smallpox A teenage boy is vaccinated against smallpox by a school doctor and a county health nurse, Gasport, New York, 15th March 1938. Harry Chamberlain/FPG/Hulton Archive/Getty Images The eradication of smallpox through vaccination is seen as one of the biggest achievements in public health history — but it took several centuries to get there.The origins of smallpox are unknown, though scientists believe it dates all the way back to the Egyptian Empire at least 3,000 years ago. By the 18th century, colonization spread the disease across the globe. It had a devastating mortality rate of up to 30%.In 1796, Edward Jenner in the UK created the first successful smallpox vaccine, but it wasn't until the 1950s that vaccine treatments began to effectively eradicate the disease in some parts of the world.Then, in 1967, a global effort that provided a higher level of vaccine production and advancement in needle technology eventually led to the eradication of the disease by 1980.To date, smallpox is only one of two diseases to have been completely eliminated around the world through vaccination efforts. Advertisement Plague People praying for relief from the bubonic plague, circa 1350. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Plague is one of the world's oldest and most lethal diseases, culminating in an estimated 75-200 million deaths in the few years around 1348. But to date, no licensed vaccine is available.Plague is perhaps most notorious for killing millions of people during the Middle Ages, but the disease is still active in areas around the world. As recent as 2020, a plague outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo attracted international attention.However, since plague is a disease spread by bacteria, the advent of modern antibiotics can be used as treatment. Even so, researchers believe that vaccination development is the most viable option to prevent the spread of disease in the long term.Many failed attempts have been made to create a plague vaccine in the past – including one that was made in the US to inoculate soldiers during the Vietnam War.But in 2018, the WHO created a Plague vaccine Target Product Profile, which listed 17 possible candidates for vaccine approval. Advertisement Typhoid Fever Mary Mallon (1870?-1938), known as "Typhoid Mary", in New York City. She was the first person identified as a carrier of typhoid bacilli in the United States. Getty Images Typhoid fever is a deadly disease that can be spread widely through food and water. Though relatively uncommon in industrialized areas, it remains a significant threat in developing nations throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, according to the WHO.Two vaccines are commercially available to prevent typhoid fever. After the bacteria responsible for the disease was discovered in 1880, German and British scientists put forth preliminary vaccines in 1896.In 1909, US Army physician Frederick F. Russell developed the first US typhoid vaccination. By 1911, it was mandatory for all military personnel to get the vaccine. Today, Typhoid fever is uncommon in the US and vaccinations are not commonly recommended for routine use. Advertisement Yellow Fever A nurse prepares a vaccine against yellow fever at an outpatient clinic in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on January 12, 2018. MIGUEL SCHINCARIOL/AFP via Getty Images In 1951, Max Theiler became the first and only scientist to receive a Nobel Prize for the development of a vaccine. His efforts to control yellow fever are widely praised by the scientific community, and he helped to correct years of misled research.Yellow fever has caused deadly epidemics throughout human history for more than 500 years. By the end of the 19th century, it was a well known threat around the world. But little was known about the disease itself, and early vaccination efforts at the close of the century mistakenly focused on bacterial transmission when it's actually caused by a virus.In 1918, researchers working for the Rockefeller Institute developed what they thought was the first successful yellow fever vaccination — but in 1926 Theiler proved otherwise and the faulty vaccine ceased production.Over a decade later, in 1937, Theiler and colleagues created the first safe and effective yellow fever vaccination, which has since become the universal standard. Advertisement Influenza Interior View, Ward A. Influenza, U.S. Army Camp Hospital No.70, St. Florent Le Vieil, France, 1914-1918 Universal History Archive / Getty Images Influenza has a long, tragic history of killing millions of people worldwide. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, there were no known cures or vaccinations for the virus.Starting in the 1930s, it took decades of research to understand the complexities of the influenza virus, and it wasn't until 1945 that the first vaccine was approved for use in the US.In 1942, researchers realized that two main types of influenza viruses occur — influenza A and influenza B, along with multiple new strains of the virus each year. But just two years later, in 1947, researchers concluded that the vaccines they already had weren't effective due to seasonal changes in the composition of the virus. Because of this, scientists have to tweak the influenza vaccine every year.Today, seasonal flu vaccines are designed by the WHO using data gathered from influenza surveillance centers to develop a new vaccination based on the three or four strains most likely to circulate in the upcoming season. Advertisement Polio A boy receives polio vaccine drops, during an anti-polio campaign, in a low-income neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, on April 9, 2018. Reuters While polio has likely affected human populations for thousands of years, it wasn't until the late 1800s that the disease reached epidemic proportions. At the turn of the 20th century, polio tore through the US, leaving many infected patients paralyzed and disabled for life.Research to understand polio was gradual for the first few decades. In 1935, a vaccination was attempted, first on monkeys and then on children in California. Though this vaccine yielded poor results, two more decades of research paved the way for the development of vaccines by Jonas Salk in 1953, and Albert Sabin in 1956.After a trial of more than 1.6 million children, Salk's vaccine was adopted in the US by 1955. Continuous research through the 1980s made way for an even more effective and efficient production of vaccines, and by 1994 polio was eliminated in the Americas.As recently as 1988, 350,000 people had been paralyzed by the debilitating disease, which mainly affects children. In 2022, there were only 30 cases of polio in the whole world, not including vaccine vaccine-derived cases.One study estimated that the polio vaccine prevented 24 million people from getting the disease from 1988 to 2022.Polio could become the third human disease we wipe from the planet. But we've still got a while to go, experts say.

The technician is part of a team that decontaminated the scene of an Anthrax outbreak in July 2006. REUTERS/David Moir Anthrax is thought to have been around since 700 BC, but the first clinical account of the disease was recorded in the 1700s, per the CDC.Throughout the 1800s, scientists conducted a series of studies to determine the disease's origin, how long the bacteria could survive, and how the disease was transmitted through animals. Their conclusions paved the way for the first attempts at a vaccine in 1881. In 1937, scientist Max Sterne created a successful anthrax vaccination to be used in livestock, a version of which is still used today, in order to reduce transmission from animals to humans. Then, in the 1950s, the first human vaccine was created and made available for people working in animal processing mills in the United States.An updated anthrax vaccine was developed in 1970, which is largely what's used to prevent the disease in humans today. Advertisement Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) A nurse displays vials of measles vaccine at the Orange County Health Department on May 6, 2019 in Orlando, Florida. NurPhoto/Paul Hennessy via Getty Images Measles, mumps, and rubella are viral infections that have each caused widespread, deadly disease outbreaks. Throughout the 1960s, individual vaccines were developed for each of them, but a decade later, they were combined into one.Measles was the first of the three to receive its own vaccine in 1963, followed by mumps in 1967, and rubella in 1969. Two years later, in 1971, Maurice Hilleman of the Merck Institute of Therapeutic Research developed a combined vaccination that would provide immunity for all three viruses. "One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella," the CDC states on its website. "Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps."The CDC recommends children get two doses of the MMR vaccine — the first dose between 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose from 4 to 6 years.

Gregory Rec/Portland Portland Press Herald via Getty Images Primary varicella infection, commonly known as chickenpox, was misdiagnosed as smallpox until the end of the 1800s.In the 1950s, scientists distinguished varicella from herpes zoster (shingles), and subsequent research led to the development of the first vaccine for chickenpox in Japan in the 1970s.The vaccine was licensed for use in the US in 1995. Advertisement Shingles (herpes zoster) Frank Bienewald/LightRocket via Getty Images Shingles, or herpes zoster, stems from the same virus that causes chickenpox. The only two ways shingles can develop is after an initial infection of chickenpox, or (uncommonly) exposure to a chickenpox vaccination, according to The College of Physicians of PhiladelphiaThe connection between shingles and chickenpox was first observed in 1954. Throughout the 1960s, studies indicated that shingles was more common in older populations. But it wasn't until 2006 that the first commercially available vaccine was licensed in the US.In 2017, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices started to recommend that adults age 50 or older should be vaccinated for the disease.

Carlos Chavez/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Hepatitis B was discovered by Dr. Baruch Blumberg in the latter half of the 1960s. Just a few years later, he created the first hepatitis B vaccine.Then, in 1981, the FDA approved the first commercially available hepatitis B vaccination, which involved blood samples from infected donors.Then, in 1986, a new synthetically prepared vaccine that doesn't use blood-based products replaced the original model. Since Hepatitis B can cause liver cancer, the vaccine was also considered the first anti-cancer vaccine. Advertisement Human papillomavirus (HPV) Pediatrician Richard K.

Keith Bedford/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US, and studies show that more than 80% of women will contract at least one type of the virus at some point in their lives.HPV is thought to cause more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers, according to the CDC. This can result in thousands of deaths each year. The link between HPV and cervical cancer was first made in 1980's, and over two decades of research followed before a viable vaccine hit the market.The first HPV vaccine was recommended in the US in 2006, and subsequent research has led to the development of two more vaccines since. The CDC said these efforts dropped HPV infections by 81% in young adult women.Today, recommendations for vaccine dosage depend largely on age. Advertisement COVID-19 Pfizer, along with BioNTech, used breakthrough mRNA technology to create its COVID-19 vaccine. The potential of this new tech could transform science, leaders at the company said. Vincent Kalut / Photonews via Getty Images The COVID-19 outbreak caused billions of people worldwide to go on lockdown — disrupting everyday life — to curb the spread of the highly contagious virus.The coronavirus resulted in overcrowded hospitals, stressed healthcare workers, and pressure on officials who were pushed to create a vaccine to end the pandemic.During the early stages of the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the then Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in front of Congress that a vaccine could be developed by the end of 2020 and available for use in 2021.In December 2020, Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse, became the first person in the US to receive the jab outside clinical trials."As a minority, I wanted to instill confidence in my people that look like me to say that it is safe, be guided by science, don't be afraid," Lindsay told Insider at the time.As of July 2023, four vaccines have been greenlit in the US: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, and Novavax. More than 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, including 676 million in the US. Read next coronavirus Vaccine Science More...

Posted July 26, 2023 Print SHARE Change in Influenza epidemiology depicts increased risk for children and young adults. Influenza notifications are increasing with high local activity in the Hunter New England and Central Coast area (1). When compared to previous influenza seasons, a peak in August is anticipated (2). Children and young adults are considered a major driver of transmission, especially as they have high levels of socialising in schools and early learning facilities, and then may transmit the virus to vulnerable family members. At the beginning of the 2023 influenza season, the majority of notifications were Influenza type A (1). However, this trend has been shifting and the proportion of Influenza B cases in NSW has been increasing much earlier than in previous years, overtaking numbers of Influenza A notifications in June. Source: NSW Respiratory Surveillance Report, week ending 15.07.2023 Influenza B is known to impact younger populations more heavily causing more severe disease (3, 4, 5). The increased prevalence of Influenza B cases increases the risk of children to contract Influenza B and therefore, subjecting them to a higher risk of developing severe influenza, and increasing the risk of hospitalisation and adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, there have been reports of influenza associated deaths in children recently, including one case from the Central Coast. The 2023 Influenza Vaccination gap It is not too late to get vaccinated against Influenza, as the Influenza season usually last through to October. As a spike in cases is expected in the next month, it is particularly important to promote Influenza vaccinations now. The PHN has launched videos on social media to promote influenza vaccinations to the public. 2023 vaccination rates for influenza among children, alike all other age groups, are lower than in previous years and it is vital that providers support access and timely vaccination efforts to close the gap. ATAGI recommends influenza vaccination for all children over 6 months of age, and vaccination is considered the most effective measure to prevent influenza. Influenza vaccination is free for children between 6 months and five years of age (6). The influenza vaccine is also free for First Nations people over 6 months of age, as well as all individuals aged 5 years or older with medical risk factors, pregnant women and people aged 65 and over (6). 2023 influenza vaccine efficacy and matching While it is too early to assess vaccine effectiveness for this season, the good news is that of 1,915 samples referred to the WHOCC in the year-to-date, 97.4% of influenza A(H1N1) isolates, 82.8% of influenza A(H3N2) isolates, and 99.0% of influenza B/Victoria isolates characterised were antigenically similar to the corresponding vaccine components. This means that there is a high level of vaccine match (2), and therefor, a high likelihood that the influenza vaccine is very effective. Sources: NSW Health, 2023.

Edited By: Health Desk New Delhi Published on: July 26, 2023 13:58 IST URL copied Follow us on Image Source : FREEPIK Know the causes, symptoms and tips for the prevention of influenza during monsoon. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by a variety of influenza viruses. It affects people of all ages but is especially dangerous for young children and the elderly. The monsoon season is an especially important time to be aware of the threat of influenza, as changes in temperature and humidity make it easier for the virus to spread. Here we will look at the causes of influenza during monsoon season, the symptoms to watch out for, and tips for prevention. By arming yourself with this knowledge, you can help protect yourself and your family during the monsoons. Causes of Influenza During Monsoon Season Influenza viruses are spread through droplets in the air when someone who is infected coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can travel up to 6 feet and can linger in the air for a few hours at a time. This means that if you’re in close contact with someone who has the flu, you are more likely to become infected too. During the monsoon season, the risk of influenza rises for a few reasons. Firstly, increased rainfall and humidity can cause more people to spend time indoors, where there is less ventilation and air circulation. This makes it easier for droplets containing the virus to spread from person to person. Additionally, cold weather can weaken the immune system and make it harder for your body to fight off viruses like influenza. Symptoms of Influenza During Monsoon Season The symptoms of influenza can start suddenly and include: Fever Chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue Vomiting and diarrhoea (in some cases) If you experience any of these symptoms during monsoon season, it’s important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Influenza can quickly become serious if not treated promptly. Tips for Preventing Influenza During Monsoon Season Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of contracting influenza during monsoon season. Firstly, make sure you get an annual flu shot. This will help protect your body against the most common strains of influenza viruses. Additionally, practice good hygiene by washing your hands often with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. This will help prevent the spread of viruses from person to person. It’s also important to avoid close contact with people who have flu-like symptoms. If someone in your household comes down with the flu, make sure they wear a mask or stay in a separate room if possible. Lastly, try to keep your immune system strong by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly, and managing stress levels. All of these measures can help reduce your risk of catching the flu during monsoon season.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Desk Updated Jul 26, 2023, 6:26 PM IST Health experts have recommended considering flu shots due to a surge in cases observed in various cities SUMMARY Health experts are hesitant about the necessity of a fourth dose. The reason behind this hesitation is that Covid-19 cases in India have significantly decreased, with only 23 new cases reported in the last 24 hours. Health experts have recommended considering flu shots due to a surge in cases observed in various cities. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC)confirms that flu shots safeguard against the four influenza viruses, comprising two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B The public health experts have sidelined the notion of administering a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, they are instead recommending flu vaccinations due to an increase in flu cases in multiple cities within the country, according to a report by The Economic Times (ET). The fourth Covid-19 vaccine shot can act as a layer of protection against the virus. This is especially important considering that only 220 million individuals have received the third vaccine dose so far, and a considerable amount of time has passed since the second dose was given. The low uptake of the third Covid-19 vaccine dose suggests a potential decline in immunity against the virus. Despite this, health experts are hesitant about the necessity of a fourth dose. The reason behind this hesitation is that Covid-19 cases in India have significantly decreased, with only 23 new cases reported in the last 24 hours. This is the lowest daily infection count since March 2020. A government official told the newspaper, the participation or response for receiving the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine has been extremely low. Additionally, hospital chains such as Max Healthcare and Fortis Healthcare have refrained from placing orders for Covid-19 vaccines for a long time. Health experts have recommended considering flu shots due to a surge in cases observed in various cities. The expert emphasized that vulnerable individuals, in particular, should seriously consider getting vaccinated. Sandeep Budhiraja, the Group Medical Director at Max Healthcare, highlighted in the report that seasonal vaccines should be taken annually. "In North India, the good time to take it is in August, September. A quadrivalent vaccine is available which gives protection against two types of influenza A and influenza B which should be taken by everyone especially those who are at a higher risk of developing complicated flu," Budhiraja told ET. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed that flu shots safeguard against the four influenza viruses, comprising two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B. Given the surge in flu cases, flu shots are being sold for prices ranging from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Nonetheless, users should be prepared for potential side effects post-vaccination, which may include headache, muscle pain, slight fever, shivering, and dizziness .

YonhapTwo cats at an animal shelter in Seoul were confirmed to have been infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain, marking the first infections of the virus in mammals in seven years, the agriculture ministry has said.Cats have been found dead at the shelter in Yongsan, central Seoul, since last month, and tests confirmed that two of them died of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza (AI), according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on Tuesday.It is the first time since 2016 that the country confirmed highly pathogenic AI cases in mammals.Upon the report, the authorities cordoned off the facility and have implemented quarantine measures.People who have had contact with the cats have not shown any symptoms, and there has not been a human AI infection through cats or other mammals.But the health authorities are closely monitoring them, as the incubation period for human AI cases is known to be 10 days, the ministry said.

But here’s a quick fix. Children may now be the most frequent victims of influenza, which can cause serious illness and which is currently filling our children’s hospitals. Some of the hospitalised children have predisposing comorbidities, but many do not, including some of those admitted to intensive care units and some who have died from complications. We are seeing daily reports of this in the news, with health authorities urging parents and carers of children to have them vaccinated now against influenza. National guidelines have advised since 2013 that everybody over six months old should receive influenza vaccine. In 2019 the vaccine was funded by six state and territory governments for all children aged six months to five years. In 2020 it was added to the National Immunisation Program schedule for that age group. Influenza vaccination will be included in new printings of the state-based baby books, which will reinforce its importance to parents and carers. Yet despite all current strategies, rates of influenza vaccination of children remain low: Most clinical software packages automatically prompt users about a range of preventive and other care that is or that is likely to be indicated for the patient, based on their recorded health history, and which has not been performed within the recommended time frame. The prompts cover a range of vaccinations, including influenza for older adults. The preventive care prompts currently available in clinical software are likely to have improved the quality of care that GPs provide. It was a surprise to learn that neither of the two most widely used clinical software packages generates automated prompts to vaccinate all children against influenza. Related covid vaccine Make covid vax status instantly visible General Practice GPs can do more on preventive care MedicalDirector allows users to choose to have onscreen prompts to GPs and practice nurses generated for influenza vaccination for some children. The three categories of children that can be included are those who might be at highest risk. These children constitute only a small minority of all children. No influenza vaccination prompts are available for the majority of children. The Best Practice clinical software package does not generate any prompts for influenza vaccine for children. No information is available from Best Practice about for which types of patients its influenza vaccination prompts are generated. If accreditation of clinical software as fit for purpose is ever introduced, all software packages that lack this basic prompt might fail to be accredited. I have asked MedicalDirector and Best Practice to improve their automated prompts to include influenza vaccination in everybody over six months old. It should be a user-selectable option. In the meantime, how can we address this deficiency in GPs’ clinical software packages? We know that personal advice from one’s GP has the greatest influence on uptake of preventive care. As a part-time researcher in general practice at the University of Adelaide, I have worked with our GP colleague Dr Anton Knieriemen, the author of the Doctors Control Panel software, to create a function in that system that automatically sends personalised targeted text messages to patients about care that is recommended for them based on their recorded clinical history and that is due to be provided. The messages advise the patient to ask about this at their imminent appointment. Currently the messages are sent shortly before booked appointments, which we have found to have the best effect. We have used these reminders successfully in research trials to increase vaccination against invasive pneumococcal disease and against influenza in adults whose chronic condition(s) put(s) them at higher risk. Dr Knieriemen and I have created an automated SMS to be sent before consultations to parents or carers of children over six months old whose clinical record does not include the current influenza vaccination. Some of my GP colleagues and I are currently piloting this strategy with our patients. A combination of four features makes this reminder system unique: it is fully automated;the reminders are sent only to patients who have already made an appointment;the messages are sent to the patient rather than being presented only to the GP or practice nurse; and,the reminders are sent when the patient can act on the advice immediately and receive the recommended care with a minimum of additional time, effort or cost. This opportunistic approach has limitations in rapidly improving influenza vaccination of all children, because most children who are usually healthy attend relatively infrequently. To address this limitation, we can complement the opportunistic SMS messages by using clinical audit software to generate a list of children who have not yet received this year’s influenza vaccine, and send a message to the parents or carers of those children advising them to make an appointment for the child to receive the vaccine. This process requires human intervention to create the clinical audit and initiate the sending of the reminders, and it has to be repeated at least annually. My experience is that asking patients to make appointments for some specific purpose has a low yield of them actually doing so. In addition, some of these “recall” messages are wasted because the patient no longer needs the care, has moved to another practice or has died. The most effective approach might be: when the current year’s influenza vaccine becomes available conduct a clinical audit to create a list of children who are current patients;use that list to send an SMS message to their parents or carers advising them to make an appointment for their child to be vaccinated; and,reinforce that message by automated opportunistic SMS messages before subsequent consultations during the rest of the year, until the child has received the vaccine, or the child’s ineligibility or the parents’ or carers’ refusal has been recorded. The function in the Doctors Control Panel software to generate SMS messages to parents or carers of children unvaccinated against influenza is available now to all current and new users of the Doctors Control Panel software.

All you need to knowSeveral cats have died in Poland, with over half of them testing positive for bird flu or H5N1. There is no evidence of cat-to-cat transmission or illness in humans exposed to infected felines. Measures to prevent future outbreaks are crucial. LivemintPublished26 Jul 2023, 03:02 PM ISTThirty-four domestic cats in eight Polish provinces tested positive for avian influenza(AFP)In a bizarre development, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an that several cats have died in regions in Poland in the past few days. Over half of them tested positive for bird flu or H5N1 or avian influenza. Thirty-four domestic cats in eight Polish provinces tested positive for avian influenza. And this marks the first instance of such a widespread infection in cats within a country, the WHO citedHowever, there's no evidence of cat-to-cat transmission or any reported illnesses in people who were exposed to the infected felines.What are the symptoms and causes of sudden rise in cases?The infected cats displayed neurological signs, such as paralysis and seizures, becoming severely ill. Notably, avian influenza rarely affects domestic animals, but cases in cats have been associated with consuming raw sick or dead wild birds or being in contaminated environments.The World Health Organization (WHO) assured that the virus did not appear to be spreading from cat-to-cat, and there were no reports of illness in cat owners or individuals exposed to the infected felines. The majority of infected cats lived indoors with partial outdoor access, while others were primarily outdoor cats exposed to wild birds, potentially explaining their infection.Some of the infected cats were fed raw poultry or poultry parts, which could have contributed to their exposure to the virus. Of the 34 infected cats, 11 died from the infection, and 14 were euthanized to prevent further spread.Fortunately, human contacts with the infected cats showed no symptoms, and the surveillance period for those individuals is now complete. This suggests a limited risk of transmission from cats to humans in this specific outbreak. Public health measures, including avoiding the feeding of raw poultry to cats and promptly reporting any unusual animal illnesses, remain crucial to prevent and control such outbreaks in the future.Apart from Poland, strain of bird flu in two cats in a feline shelter in South Korea. Meanwhile, a BBC report said, said the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of the virus is devastating Irish seabird colonies.What did WHO say?The WHO, on July 13, expressed concern about the surge in bird flu outbreaks among mammals, potentially facilitating easier transmission to humans. Avian influenza viruses typically remain within bird populations, but the rising number of H5N1 avian influenza cases in mammals is alarming. Since 2022, around 10 countries on three continents have reported outbreaks in mammals to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).

The outbreak in the private Seoul facility, which has been placed in quarantine, comes after at least 29 sick cats across Poland tested positive for H5N1, with European health officials urging pet-owners to keep their cats indoors to reduce their exposure to the deadly virus. It is the first time since 2016 that avian influenza infections have been found in cats in South Korea, the government said, and no humans who came into contact with the animals have so far shown signs of symptoms. Surveillance is being ramped up within a six mile radius of the animal shelter. The source of the outbreak remains unknown. Although only two dead cats have so far tested positive, authorities are racing to test samples from another 36 felines who died between June 24 and July 26, according to Daesub Song, a professor at Seoul National University’s department of Veterinary Medicine which initially investigated the outbreak. “In my lab, two samples from dead cats were identified as H5N1 positive,” he told the Telegraph on Thursday. “The other 36 cats were dead with [the] same symptoms. “However, most of them were submitted to the Korea government’s diagnostic lab. Within this week, I expect that the government [will] announce the data. This case has [a] big impact due to the massive cat mortality rate and spillover from avian to mammal cases, as observed in Poland and some European countries.”Increased vigilanceSince late 2021, bird flu has killed millions of birds across the globe, with 67 countries in five continents reporting highly pathogenic H5N1 outbreaks last year. More than 131 million domestic poultry have also died or been culled in affected areas. But the rising number of infections in mammals – outbreaks have been reported in 26 species, including farmed mink in Spain, otters in the UK, and sea lions in Peru – has generated particular alarm, raising concerns that opportunities for the virus to evolve to better infect people are growing. “The increase of [highly pathogenic] H5N1 cases in mammals, including cats, warrants more vigilance,” Gaël Lamielle, a regional surveillance coordinator at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s regional office for Asia and the Pacific, told the Telegraph. But he added: “Based on the current knowledge, no human cases of influenza avian H5N1 have been attributed to contact with cats”. Instead, human infections with H5N1 have been historically linked to close contact with sick birds or their environment, and it does not appear to be able to transmit easily from person to person. Yet in April, the virus was found to “efficiently” spread between ferrets in a laboratory – the first study confirming that the virus can spread from mammal to mammal. There are fears that the wider the spread in animals, the greater the potential for the pathogen to gain the mutations needed to spread more efficiently in people.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024Avian flu warning to tourists as birds face 'catastrophe' - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeIsrael-Gaza warWar in UkraineClimateVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechMoreScienceEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesBBC VerifyNewsbeatScienceAvian flu warning to tourists as birds face 'catastrophe'Published28 July 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park AuthorityImage caption, Hundreds of seabirds are being washed up on the Pembrokeshire coastBy Malcolm PriorBBC News Rural Affairs producerHolidaymakers are being warned to stay away from sick or dead birds washed up on the UK's beaches as avian flu continues to ravage wild populations.Thousands of infected seabirds have been found along the UK coastline as the largest outbreak of the normally-seasonal virus continues into summer.The RSPB has warned the spread among seabird populations is a "crisis that could become a catastrophe".The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the risk to humans is 'very low'.But beachgoers are being urged to stay away from dead or sick birds, keep dogs on the lead and to report birds to the authorities. In the past month alone, hundreds of dead birds suspected to have been infected with avian flu have been found washed up on beaches across the UK, including along the Sefton Coast, on beaches near Blackpool, at Stonehaven Beach in Aberdeenshire, on the Isle of Man and along the south Pembrokeshire coast.Rhian Sula, general manager for the National Trust, which owns about a quarter of the Pembrokeshire coastline, said its staff were out and about on beaches warning visitors of bird flu.She said that while local people had a good awareness of the virus "not all visitors do"."As much as we have placed warning signs out, they may not see them or they may ignore them so we are having to have those conversations about why it is important to keep dogs on the lead and keep away from the birds," she added.While human infections are extremely rare, bird flu can be spread through close contact with infected birds and their droppings.James Parkin, director of nature and tourism for the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, said local rangers have so far collected around 700 to 800 birds - mostly guillemots but also razorbills and gannets.Image source, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park AuthorityImage caption, Beachgoers are being warned to stay away from the birds and report them.He said confirmation that the area was seeing its second wave of bird flu "was about as devastating news as we could have received".Across the UK, the current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has seen 190 confirmed cases since October 2022, leading to the culling of millions of poultry. It is said to have killed at least 50,000 wild birds - but that is generally accepted to be an underestimate.The RSPB is currently carrying out seabird population counts across the UK to see how badly colonies have been affected. It is thought numbers of great skuas, a seabird badly hit by HPAI, are down 90% in some areas and around 30,000 adult black-headed gulls - 10% of the UK breeding population - has been lost since mid-April. In total, 21 of the UK's 25 breeding seabird species have now tested positive for the virus since 2021.Jeff Knott, the RSPB's director of policy and advocacy, said there had been an "unprecedentedly large number" of seabird deaths.Image source, Malcolm Prior/BBCImage caption, The RSPB says the outbreak is a 'crisis that could become a catastrophe'He told the BBC: "Tens of thousands of birds are washing up around our coastline but that could represent hundreds of thousands, potentially millions, of birds. "Obviously, seabirds spend most of their time out at sea - so the chances of them washing up on a beach are fairly low so we can't know the actual number."Mr Knott added that, coupled with threats posed by environmental and climate change, the impact of wind farms and bycatch by fishing vessels, "bird flu could be the straw that broke the camel's back" for rarer seabirds, posing a risk of local extinction."This is a genuine crisis that could become a catastrophe," he added.The RSPB is now calling on the UK's devolved governments to bring in new seabird conservation strategies.The UK's home nation administrations said they were monitoring the situation and the long-term impact of bird flu on wild bird populations.The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss added: "More widely, the government has taken wider measures to support seabirds through the marine wildlife bycatch mitigation initiative and will publish an English seabird Conservation and recovery pathway that will assess seabird vulnerabilities and the actions needed to address them."A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it would be consulting on a seabird conservation strategy next year.She said: "It will identify opportunities to enhance our seabird populations' resilience to pressures such as avian flu, as well as the climate and nature emergencies."A Scottish government spokesperson said its seabird conservation strategy was "in development" and it would "consult on the plan in due course".Related topicsSeabirdsMore on this storyAvian flu confirmed in dead Manx seabirdsPublished18 July 2023Bird flu investigation after seabird deathsPublished18 July 2023More than 300 dead birds found on beachPublished10 July 2023Bird flu hits seabird colony at peak of breedingPublished10 July 2023Top storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished3 hours agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished4 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

Symptoms include high-grade fever, body aches, cold, joint pain, cough, and weakness. Children and senior citizens with comorbidities are the most affected. Many people are being treated on a symptomatic basis due to the cost of testing. Mumbai: After about a month of heavy rainfall, city doctors witness a 50% rise in the number of patients with high-grade fever, body aches and cold. According to them, several people are down with these symptoms and most of them are testing positive for H3N2- a subtype of influenza A virus. Symptoms of the illness also include joint pain, cough, and weakness, which can last for up to two weeks. HT Image Dr Mihir Shah, internal medicine consultant, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai said there is almost a 50% rise in H3N2 cases in the last two weeks in the outpatient department. “Most of them are managed on an OPD basis. Children and senior citizens with comorbidities are affected more and taking to recover,” he said. Marketing executive Pinal Solanky, 28, a resident of Malad and her parents are recuperating from high-grade fever, body ache and cold. “It all started with my mother getting a sore throat. It was followed by a fever,” said Solanky, who added, “Within two days, my father and I also got the symptoms. Most of the people in our neighbourhood have the same symptoms,” she said. The Solanky family was prescribed oseltamivir- an antiviral medication for influenza. “I was told the H3N2 strain is in circulation. We did not do the test since it was costly. We started the course on Monday and felt better. However, the cough still persists,” she said. Dr Umang Agarwal, an infectious disease expert, PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said, “We are seeing H3N2 cases quite commonly. I have not seen H1N1 cases so far. Whenever we get a patient with suspected flu and have an influenza PCR test done, it is almost positive for H3N2.” He added hospitalisations are seen only in some cases where the patient has comorbidities like diabetes or hypertension. While the BMC has only released H1N1 data showing only 61 cases in July, doctors say H3N2 are more and because of the cost factor, many do not get tested and are being treated on a symptomatic basis. The state health data on influenza too shows H3N2 domination. According to the state epidemiology cell report, in July this 111 H1N1 cases were reported and 294 H3N2 cases were registered. Dr Hemalata Arora, senior consultant, Internal Medicine, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital-Vile Parle said they are observing 5-6 daily cases of Influenza A—H3N2. “A significant number of these cases are among young college students and the working demographic, suggesting rapid transmission in educational institutions and workplaces. In most patients, the average incubation period of this infection is approximately two days following exposure. Subsequently, affected individuals experience fever and body pain for about three to four days,” she said. Dr Arora emphasised early medical consultation. “Ideally within two days of symptom onset, antiviral treatment should be started. A balanced diet complemented by adequate fluid intake helps in early recovery. It’s essential for individuals with pre-existing conditions like bronchitis, chronic pneumonia, or asthma to exercise caution. They might face heightened symptoms if infected,” she added.
