Here we present Dante, a multiscale influenza forecasting model that learns rather than prescribes spatial, temporal, and surveillance data structure and generates coherent forecasts across state, regional, and national scales. We retrospectively compare Dante’s short-term and seasonal forecasts for previous flu seasons to the Dynamic Bayesian Model (DBM), a leading competitor. Dante outperformed DBM for nearly all spatial units, flu seasons, geographic scales, and forecasting targets. Dante’s sharper and more accurate forecasts also suggest greater public health utility. Dante placed 1st in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s prospective 2018/19 FluSight challenge in both the national and regional competition and the state competition. The methodology underpinning Dante can be used in other seasonal disease forecasting contexts having nested geographic scales of interest.

Influenza (flu) related activity is monitored in the US by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through numerous surveillance efforts. One such effort is the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet collects weekly data on influenza-like illness (ILI) from over 2000 healthcare providers from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. ILI is defined as a temperature greater or equal to 100 °F, a cough or sore throat, and no other known cause, representing symptoms consistent with influenza. ILINet constitutes a significant and necessary effort to understanding the spread and prevalence of flu-like illness in the US in near real-time.With mature ILI surveillance infrastructure in place in the US, attention has turned in recent years to ILI prediction. The ability to predict the spread of ILI poses a substantial public health opportunity if able to be done accurately, confidently, and with actionable lead times at geographic and temporal scales amenable to public health responsiveness. Since 2013, the CDC has hosted an influenza forecasting challenge called the FluSight challenge to gauge the feasibility of forecasting targets of public health interest in real-time, to galvanize the flu forecasting community around common goals, and to foster innovation and improvement through collaboration and competition2,3,4. The FluSight challenge has been a leading driver of recent model development and flu forecasting advancements5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.Up until the 2016 flu season (i.e., the flu season starting in the fall of 2016 and ending in the spring of 2017), the FluSight challenge’s scope encompassed probabilistic forecasting of short-term (1 to 4 week ahead) and seasonal (season onset, peak timing, and peak intensity) targets at two geographic scales: nationally and regionally, where regions correspond to Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. Probabilistic forecasting is carried out by binning the support of the targets (e.g., binning the peak timing target into weeks of the season) and assigning a probability to each bin, representing the probability the eventual outcome will fall in each bin. Probabilistic forecasts are a crucially important component of the FluSight challenge, as it demands not only information on what the forecasting models thinks will happen, but also how confident the forecasting model is in its own prediction. National and regional forecasts give a high-level view of flu activity across the US. Those forecasts provide value to national and regional public health officials, but offer only coarse information for state and local public health practitioners. Thus, starting with the 2017 flu season, the FluSight challenge expanded to a third geographic scale: states and territories (referred to as states). This expansion to a finer geographic scale presents an opportunity to move forecasting to geographic scales better aligned with public health response infrastructure and decision making. It also presents an opportunity to develop and advance methodological forecasting frameworks that can share information across geographic locations, flu seasons, and geographic scales coherently in ways that geographically isolated forecasting models cannot.Multiscale forecasting in the US requires careful consideration as it presents numerous challenges. For instance, Fig. 1 (as well as Supplementary Fig. 3) shows appreciable state-to-state ILI variability. As an example, Montana’s average ILI is about 20% the national average, while the District of Columbia’s and Puerto Rico’s average ILI is about 250% the national average. Figure 1 also shows evidence of spatial correlation, with states near the Gulf of Mexico having higher than average ILI while most Midwest and Mountain West states have lower than average ILI. Attempts to model the spatial relationships of flu and flu-like illnesses include using network models and US commuter data5, network models based on Euclidean distance19, and empirically derived network relationships21,22. Though these approaches consider spatial relationships differently, they all support the conclusion that sharing information across geographical units can improve forecasting.Fig. 1: State-to-state influenza-like illness variability.a Average state influenza-like illness (ILI) relative to average national weighted ILI (wILI). States bordering the Gulf of Mexico tend to have higher ILI than the national average. The geographical sizes of Alaska (AK), Hawaii (HI), Puerto Rico (PR), the US Virgin Islands (VI), New York City (NYC), and the District of Columbia (DC) are not to scale. Data for Florida is unavailable. Averages are based on 2010 through 2017 data. b ILI by season (colored lines) for select states. Black line is national average wILI for reference. Appreciable season-to-season and state-to-state ILI variability exists.Full size imageFigure 2 (and Supplementary Fig. 4) shows season-to-season variability, illustrating the common directional effect a flu season can have on nearly all states. 2015, for instance, was a mild flu season in the US with 42 out of 53 states experiencing ILI activity below their state-specific averages (the 53 states are all 50 states, minus Florida with no available data, plus Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, New York City, and the District of Columbia). In contrast, 2017 was an intense flu season with 47 out of 53 states experiencing ILI activity above their state-specific averages. Supplementary Fig. 5 visualizes this information with six intensity levels rather than an above/below average binary. Similar to the findings that sharing information across geographical units can improve flu forecasting, previous work has found that sharing information across seasons can also improve flu forecasting13. Similarly positive findings have been identified in other disease modeling contexts using latent random walks23,24.Fig. 2: Seasonal influenza-like illness variability.a Dark green states denote states with ILI less than their state-specific averages while pink states are states with ILI above their state-specific averages. 2015 was a mild flu season for the majority of states relative to their state-specific average ILI, while 2017 was an intense flu season for the majority of states, indicating that season-to-season effects can affect most of the country. Data unavailable for Florida. States displayed outside of the contiguous US are geographically not to scale. b State detrended ILI for the 2015 and 2017 flu seasons, where state detrended ILI is ILI for a state/season minus ILI for that state averaged over all seasons. Positiveegative state detrended ILI means ILI for that season was above/below the state-specific average, respectively. Black line is season-specific national average wILI for reference.Full size imageFigure 3 shows the average standardized week-to-week volatility across geographic scales (see Supplementary Note 3 for details). Standardized volatility measures how much ILI (states) and wILI (regions and nationally) varies from week-to-week, where wILI is weighted ILI—a state-population weighted version of ILI used to characterize ILI regionally and nationally. High volatility poses a challenge to forecasting as increased volatility can swamp the signal in the (w)ILI data. Figure 3 makes clear that extending forecasts down to the state scale, a more actionable scale for public health officials, comes at the cost of increased volatility. The level of volatility is largely driven by the number of patients seen weekly, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Developing multiscale flu forecasting models that account for decreasing volatility with coarsening geographic scales will be crucial. Some multiscale forecasting models have been developed in the context of norovirus gastroenteritis prediction25. In that work25, showed that modeling at the finest available data scale and aggregating up to coarser scales generally had better predictive performance than models directly operating at the aggregated scales. To our knowledge, such models have not been developed and operationalized for ILI forecasting.Fig. 3: Standardized volatility by geographic scale.a Average standardized week-to-week influenza-like illness (ILI—states) and weighted ILI (wILI—HHS regions and nationally) volatility for three geographic scales. Volatility decreases as the scales coarsen. Boxplots present median (center line), interquartile range (boxes), 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers), and outliers (points) based on n = 53, 10, and 1 observations for states, HHS regions, and the nation respectively. b Average standardized week-to-week (w)ILI volatility versus the average number of weekly patients on a log scale for each state, HHS region, and nationally. Volatility decreases as the number of weekly patients seen increases, suggesting that volatility is in part a product of ILINet participation.Full size imageIt is in the context of appreciable state-to-state and season-to-season variability, uneven ILINet surveillance participation, and the need to render short-term and seasonal probabilistic forecasts at nested geographic scales that Dante, a probabilistic, multiscale flu forecasting model, was developed. While efforts have been made to address each of these challenges in isolation, no one has yet to tackle all of these challenges simultaneously in the context of influenza forecasting. Jointly addressing all these challenges is the main contribution of this paper.Dante is composed of two submodels: a fine-scale model for the state scale and an aggregation model for the regional and national scales. The state submodel includes both a data model and a process model. The data model is where Dante learns information about the level of volatility in the ILI time series. The process model is where Dante captures common and specific structure in the data, including a term common to all states and seasons, a state-specific term, a season-specific term, and a state-season specific interaction term. The common term can be thought of as the average profile of the ILI data across space and time, whereas the interaction term captures deviations from common, state-, and season-specific baselines. The aggregation model builds regional and national forecasts using the state forecasts as population weighted building blocks, leading to forecasts that are coherent across geographic scales. Full details of both submodels are provided in the Methods section.ResultsDante is compared to a leading flu forecasting model, the Dynamic Bayesian Model (DBM)13. Like Dante, DBM models ILI data as the sum of component trajectories. DBM’s components include a seasonegion-specific susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) compartmental model, a region-specific statistical discrepancy component capturing deviations from the SIR component common across seasons (e.g., holiday effects), and a regularized seasonegion-specific discrepancy component to capture ILI structure unable to be captured by the other two components. DBM is fit to each geographic unit separately, thus does not share information across geographic units or geographic scales, but does share information across flu seasons. In contrast, Dante shares information across geographic units, geographic scales, and flu seasons. DBM was the fourth place model and a component model in the second place ensemble model18 in the prospective national and regional 2017/18 FluSight challenge out of 29 participating models. Dante was the first place model in the 2018/19 national and regional FluSight challenge out of 33 participating models. Dante also came in first out of 14 competing models in the 2018/19 state challenge.We compare Dante and DBM using forecast skill following the scoring rules of the CDC’s FluSight challenge (details in Supplementary Note 8), noting both that this scoring rule is improper18,26,27 and that a proper scoring rule has been implemented in the FluSight challenge starting with the 2019/20 season. In this paper, forecast skill is defined as the exponentiated average over forecast scores and ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best possible forecast skill. Put another way, skill here is the geometric average probability assigned to the observed outcome or, in the case of the CDC’s multibin score, values reasonably close to the observed outcome. This differs from the definition of skill in28 defining an average over forecast scores in relation to a reference forecast. Conceptually, skill is a function of both accuracy (a measure of a point summary of a distributional forecast) and sharpness (a measure of concentration of the distributional forecast). We also score both models using a proper log scoring rule (details in Supplementary Note 8.3). We will show how Dante compares to DBM broadly in terms of skill, and also in terms of its component pieces. Both models were fit in a leave-one-season out fashion, where the data for all seasons not being forecasted along with the data for the season being forecasted up to the forecast date were used for training.Table 1 shows that Dante outperformed DBM in forecast skill at all geographic scales as calculated by both the improper CDC scoring rule and a proper log scoring rule. Dante also outperformed DBM in terms of accuracy, as measured by mean squared error (MSE) of point predictions (posterior means), at all geographic scales. For both models, forecast skill improves and average MSE decreases as geographic scales coarsen, suggesting that both forecast skill and accuracy degrade as we move to finer scales where volatility is greater. See Supplementary Note 12 for further details and figures comparing the MSE of Dante and DBM.Table 1 Comparison of forecast performance between Dante and DBM.Full size tableFigure 4 shows the ratio of forecast skill of Dante to that of DBM for each state, region, and nationally. Dante outperformed DBM for the majority of geographic regions, with the exception of HHS Region 7 and the states Wyoming, Puerto Rico, and Kentucky.Fig. 4: Dante’s forecast skill relative to DBM’s by geographic region.Ratio of forecast skill of Dante to that of DBM, for all states, regions, and nationally. Dante had higher forecast skill for all geographic regions except for HHS Region 7, Kentucky, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico.Full size imageFigure 5 shows forecast skill broken down by targets (left) and flu seasons (right) for each geographic scale. Dante outperformed DBM for all scales and targets, except for peak intensity regionally and onset nationally. Improvement over DBM is largest for the 1-week ahead forecast target. For context, in the 2018/19 FluSight national and regional challenge, Dante placed first for all short-term targets, season onset, and peak intensity (PI), while placing ninth for peak timing (PT). In the state challenge, Dante placed first in all short-term targets and PT, while placing second for PI. Dante also outperformed DBM for all scales and flu seasons, except for 2017 nationally. While forecast skill for DBM and Dante are close for all seasons nationally (sans 2016), Dante consistently and appreciably outperformed DBM for all seasons at the regional and state scales.Fig. 5: Dante’s and DBM’s forecast skill by target and season.a Average forecast skill by scales and targets. PI and PT stand for peak intensity and peak timing, respectively. Dante outperformed DBM for all scales and targets, except for onset nationally and for PI regionally. b Average forecast skill by scales and flu seasons. Dante outperformed DBM for all scales and targets, except for 2017 nationally.Full size imageFigure 6a provides context as to how Dante is outperforming DBM. Figure 6a displays the ratio of forecast skills at each scale for all short-term forecasts against the difference in the 90% highest posterior density (HPD) predictive interval widths for each of the short-term target’s posterior predictive distributions. See Supplementary Note 9 for calculation details. HPD predictive intervals are similar to equal-tailed predictive intervals as they capture the range of probability concentration, but are more appropriate than equal-tailed predictive intervals for distributions that are not unimodal and symmetric. Figure 6a shows that for all scales and short-term forecasts, Dante has smaller HPD interval widths, indicating that Dante’s forecasts are more concentrated (ı.e., sharper) than DBM. Dante’s increased forecast sharpness resulted in higher forecast skill than DBM. This is a promising finding, as sharper forecasts, if well-calibrated, provide more information to public health decision makers.Fig. 6: Dante’s and DBM’s short-term forecast skill and sharpness by geographic scale.a Ratio of average forecast skills versus difference in 90% highest posterior density (HPD) interval widths for short-term forecasting targets. For all short-term forecasting targets and geographic scales, Dante produced sharper (i.e., smaller 90% HPD interval widths) and higher scoring forecasts than DBM. b Average 90% highest posterior density (HPD) interval widths for the short-term forecasting targets. Both Dante and DBM produce sharper (i.e., smaller 90% HPD interval widths) forecasts for coarser geographic resolutions. For all short-term forecasting targets and geographic scales, Dante produced sharper forecasts than DBM.Full size imageFigure 6b shows that Dante’s forecasts are sharper than DBM’s for all short-term targets at all geographic scales. For each short-term target, forecasts for both DBM and Dante become sharper as the geographic scale coarsens. DBM makes sharper short-term forecasts because the (w)ILI DBM is modeling less volatile, i.e., because (w)ILI becomes less volatile as geographic scales coarsen. Dante makes sharper short-term forecasts at coarsening geographic scales as a result of the aggregation model. Dante’s 3-week-ahead 90% HPD interval widths nationally and regionally are 1.4 and 2.1%, respectively, about the same as Dante’s 1-week-ahead 90% HPD interval widths are regionally and at the state-level, respectively. Said another way, Dante loses about 2 weeks of sharpness in its short-term forecasts for each disaggregating geographic scale.Though Dante won the 2018/19 FluSight challenge and outperformed a leading flu forecasting model, DBM, in a retrospective comparison, Dante is still a work in progress. Figure 7 shows Dante’s 90% empirical coverages for short-term targets and represents an opportunity for future Dante improvement. Overall, empirical coverages for states are close to their nominal coverages. Those empirical coverages drop, however, as geographic scales coarsen. Furthermore, empirical coverages drop with a growing forecast window. The right of Fig. 7 breaks down empirical coverages into the stages relative to the season peak. Empirical coverages are generally good in the post-peak stage of the flu season, arguably when forecasts are least useful. Fig. 7 makes clear that while Dante represents the state of the art, flu forecasting is a field ripe for improvement, advancement, and innovation.Fig. 7: Dante’s empirical coverage.Dante’s 90% empirical coverages for short-term targets, broken down by geographic scales. b Empirical coverages by target averaged over all seasons, geographic units within scale, and stages of flu season. a Empirical coverages broken out by stages of flu season. The “Around Peak” stage is defined as the peak week, plus/minus 2 weeks inclusively. Generally, empirical coverages degrade as the forecast window increases, as geographic scales coarsen, and as we get earlier in the flu season. The disagreement between empirical and nominal coverage for Dante represents an opportunity for iteration and improvement.Full size imageDiscussionThe plot of skill score (Fig. 5) and total patients seen and volatility (Fig. 3) suggests that Dante (and DBM) can forecast geographic regions better when the forecasted estimate is based on more data than less. This result suggests that expanded ILI surveillance participation plays a role in improving model forecasts, not just improvements to the models themselves. This idea is not surprising. Disease forecasting has been compared to weather forecasting29, a field that has continued to make consistent progress through parallel efforts of improved modeling and data collection.We found that Dante made sharper forecasts, as measured by smaller 90% HPD interval widths than DBM, a model that fits aggregate data directly. Similar findings were noted by25 when comparing models fit to norovirus data in Berlin stratified by regions and age groups—models fit to the finest scales and subsequently upscaled had sharper predictions than models fit to the aggregated scales directly. This suggests that continued stratification of ILI, such as partitioning state-level ILI by age groups, by flu strain type, or county-level, may provide further sharpening of forecasts at aggregate scales.Dante’s first place finish in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge may come as a surprise given that it is a purely statistical model and uses only ILINet data, while many of its competitors are based in full or in part on mechanistic disease transmission models and/or are augmented with alternative data sources (e.g., Google search data). Dante’s superior performance suggests that these mechanistic components or alternative data sources may be integrated into those models in a way that is improperly aligned with the truth. For example, DBM includes an SIR model component via a season-specific “I” term but a given season may have multiple circulating influenza strains responsible for the “true” flu component in the ILI data, thus rendering the use of a single “I” term inappropriate.Revisions made to ILI data after its initial release are referred to as backfill and constitute a meaningful source of uncertainty when prospectively forecasting ILI. In this work, backfill was ignored for the forecasting of both Dante and DBM. As a result, the forecasting results for Dante and DBM are directly comparable to each other in this paper but are not directly comparable to previous FluSight challenge results. The reason backfill was ignored in this paper is because Dante uses state-level ILI data directly, and state-level backfill data is only available starting for the 2017/18 season. Though backfill was not addressed in this paper, Dante’s winning 2018/19 FluSight challenge entry did include a backfill model to account for the revision process of real-time ILI data.Linking understandable processes to observed patterns in the data via models while maintaining high performance is the next frontier in ILI modeling. To do so will require a fuller consideration of the “ILI data generating process.” This process non-exhaustively includes a disease transmission process(es) (e.g., things often modeled with a compartmental model(s)), a healthcare visitation process (i.e., a set of processes related to who interacts with the healthcare system and when), an ILINet participation process (i.e., certain providers participate in ILINet while others do not, and the composition of provider networks varies temporally and spatially), and a reporting process (e.g., backfill).Further stratification is a promising direction for incorporating known facets of the ILI data generating process into Dante in a flexible way. For example, if provider-level ILINet data were available state-level models could be decomposed into models for emergency department (ED) ILI and non-ED ILI. We hypothesize that a systematic difference exists between patients visiting ED and non-ED providers, specifically that the proportion of ED patients with ILI is higher than that of non-ED patients. If so, then provider composition could help explain some state-level variation in ILI magnitude (we expect states with more ED providers have higher reported ILI). It could also explain part of the holiday-specific spikes in observed ILI (we expect that spikes in ILI activity on holidays are partially due to the provider composition in ILINet changes for that week—more clinics are closed and thus ED providers have a relatively higher contribution).Modeling across geographic scales in a single, unified model ensures forecasts are simultaneously coherent, a feature that is not present in many FluSight submissions. Ongoing work by our team will provide a model-agnostic tool by which users can modify outputs from a non-unified model so as to attain coherency30. Our team is also working to incorporate internet data sources (i.e., nowcasting) into future iterations of Dante. When internet data sources were incorporated into DBM the performance increased, which leads us to be hopeful that Dante will also be improved by the thoughtful incorporation of internet data.While Dante has utility forecasting seasonal influenza, it would not be particularly useful for forecasting in an emerging outbreak setting. At its core, Dante is learning exploitable structure from data of historical flu seasons. An emerging outbreak, on the other hand, would by its very nature not have sufficient training data from which to learn about expected baseline trajectories. Swapping out the common process model term (\({\mu }_{t}^{\,\text{all}\,}\)– see the Methods section) for something resembling the infectious compartment of an SIR model might be one way to steer Dante towards emerging outbreak settings, but Dante’s core strength is its ability to exploit historical data.MethodsDante is a probabilistic, Bayesian flu forecasting model that is decomposed into two submodels: the fine-scale model (i.e., the state model) and the aggregation model (i.e., the regional and national model).Dante’s fine-scale modelDante’s fine-scale model is itself described in two parts: the data model and the process model.Dante’s data modelLet yrst ∈ (0, 1) be ILI/100 for state r = 1, 2, …, R in flu season s = 1, 2, …, S, for epidemic week t = 1, 2, …, T = 35, where t = 1 corresponds to epidemic week 40, roughly the first week of October and T = 35 most often corresponds to late May. Dante models the observed proportion yrst with a Beta distribution as follows:$${y}_{{\mathrm{rst}}}| {\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}},{\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}} \sim \,\text{Beta}\,({\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}}{\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}},{\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}}(1-{\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}})),$$ (1) where$$\,\text{E}\,({y}_{{\mathrm{rst}}}| {\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}},{\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}})={\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}},$$ (2) $$\,\text{Var}\,({y}_{{\mathrm{rst}}}| {\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}},{\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}})=\frac{{\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}(1-{\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}})}{1+{\lambda }_{{\mathrm{r}}}}.$$ (3) In Dante, θrst is the unobserved true proportion of visits for ILI in state r for season s during week t and λr > 0 is a state-specific parameter that captures the level of noise in the ILINet surveillance system and thus the level of volatility in the ILI time series. In Dante, yrst is modeled as unbiased for the latent state θrst. The observation yrst, however, is not equal to θrst due to variability in the measurement surveillance process (i.e., the true proportion of ILI in state r for season s during week t is not going to be perfectly captured by ILINet surveillance). Motivated by Fig. 3, λr is likely to be related to ILINet participation as measured by the total number of patients seen weekly in state r. As λr increases, the variance of yrst decreases and observations will tend to be closer to θrst. Because we do not know the relationship between patient count and λr a priori, we model λr hierarchically, allowing them to be learned from data (details in Supplementary Note 1.1). Specifically, each λr is given a central, non-standardized t-distribution prior with support in the interval [0, ∞) and a shared precision parameter that itself has a weakly informative Gamma prior.Figure 8 shows the posterior mean of λr versus the average number of patients seen weekly by each state. A clear linear relationship is observed on a log-log scale, where the variance of yrst goes down (i.e., λr increases) as the total weekly seen patients increases. What is particularly striking about Fig. 8 is that Dante has no knowledge of the number of patients seen each week as it is not an input to Dante, illustrating how structure can be learned rather than prescribed with a flexible, hierarchical model, provided sufficient training data.Fig. 8: Dante’s posterior means for λr.The posterior mean for λr versus the average number of patients seen weekly by each state. Both axes are on a log scale. A clear linear relationship is observed. Dante learns this relationship, as it has no explicit knowledge of the average number of patients.Full size imageDante’s Process ModelDante’s process model models the unobserved true proportion of ILI, θrst ∈ (0, 1), as a function of four components:$${\theta }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}={\text{logit}}^{-1}({\pi }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}),$$ (4) $${\pi }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}={\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}}+{\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\text{state}}+{\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\text{season}}+{\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\text{interaction}\,}.$$ (5) The two season independent terms in Eq. (5), \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) and \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\), are modeled as random walks, and the two season dependent terms, \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\) and \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\), are modeled as reverse-random walks. Random and reverse-random walks allow patterns in the process model to be flexibly learned while capturing week-to-week correlation. Standard random walk priors are used for \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) and \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\), with the latter being specified hierarchically. This specification involves placing a mean-0 normal prior on the first week of the flu season, and assuming a priori that subsequent weeks are normally distributed and centered at the previous week’s value. The reverse random walk term \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\) requires a prior specification for the value in the final week of the flu season rather than the first week of the season, which allows the forecasting extrapolation problem to become an interpolation problem. The state-season specific term \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) is the most challenging for Dante to learn because it is only directly informed by state r and season s, and for forecasting purposes there is either no or partial information available from season s. For that reason, an autoregressive term is included in the hierarchical reverse random walk prior specification to help regularize \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) towards 0. Prior choice is an aspect of the model which could still be improved, and it is possible that alternative prior specifications may yield improved performance. More details are available in Supplementary Note 1.2.Figure 9 illustrates the fits for all model components for Alabama and Iowa for the 2015 and 2017 flu seasons. The component \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) is common to every state and season and acts as the anchor for the process model. The shape of \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) is similar to the national average ILI trajectory of Fig. 1, capturing the profile for a typical state and season. The component \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\) captures the state-specific deviation from \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) and is common to every season for a given state, but is distinct for each state. As can be see in Fig. 1, Alabama typically sees ILI above the national average, hence why \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\) for Alabama is learned to be greater than zero. Iowa, however, typically sees ILI below the national average, explaining why \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\) is learned to be less than zero for Iowa. The component \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\) captures the season-specific deviation from \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\) and is common to every state for a given season, but is distinct for each season. This component captures the fact that seasons can have effects that are shared by nearly all states, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The shape of \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\) for 2015 and 2017 has a similar shape to the average residuals for 2015 and 2017, respectively, in Fig. 2. Finally, \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) captures the remaining signal in πrst that cannot be accounted for by \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\), \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\), and \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\). The term \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) is distinct for each state and season.Fig. 9: Posterior summaries of Dante’s process model.Posterior summaries for select components, seasons, and states of Dante, fit to seasons 2010 through 2017. Rows, from top to bottom, correspond to Alabama in 2015, Iowa in 2015, Alabama in 2017, and Iowa in 2017. Columns, from left to right, correspond to μall, μstate, μseason, μinteraction, π (all from Equation (5)), and θ (Equation (4)). The π column is the sum of the μall, μstate, μseason, and μinteraction columns, accounting for posterior covariances. The θ column is the inverse logit of the π column and is back on the scale of the data. The μall component is the most structured component, as it is common for all states and seasons (i.e., the same for all rows). The components μstate and μseason are the next most structured components. They describe the state-specific and season-specific deviations from μall, respectively, and are common for all seasons within a state (μstate) and all states within a season (μseason). The component μinteraction is the least structured component of Dante, as it is specific to each season/state (i.e., it is different for each row). Solid lines are posterior means. Ribbons are 95% posterior intervals. In the θ column, points are data, y.Full size imageDante’s process model is purposely over-specified. If our interest were purely to fit ILI data, the term \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) alone would suffice. However, there is not enough structure to forecast effectively with only \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\). On the other hand, the non-interaction terms in the decomposition of πrst (\({\mu }_{{\mathrm{t}}}^{\,\text{all}\,}\), \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rt}}}^{\,\text{state}\,}\), and \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{st}}}^{\,\text{season}\,}\)) provide structure for forecasting but not enough flexibility to capture all the signal in the ILI data. Thus, the \({\mu }_{{\mathrm{rst}}}^{\,\text{interaction}\,}\) term provides the flexibility needed to fit the data, but is specified so that it plays as minimal a role as possible so that signal is captured in the non-interaction terms and can drive the shape of forecasts.Inference for unobserved components of Dante, as well as state-level forecasts of yet-to-be-observed yrst are generated by sampling from the posterior distribution with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), resulting in a sample of M draws that summarize the posterior distribution (details in Supplementary Note 2). We use the software JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)31, as called by the R package rjags32 within the programming language R33 to perform the MCMC sampling. We denote each MCMC draw by the index m. Notationally, we denote the mth sample for a yet-to-be-observed yrst as yrstm.Dante’s aggregation modelDante’s regional and national forecasts are computed as linear combinations of state forecasts, where weights are proportional to 2010 US Census population estimates (Supplementary Fig. 6). Let wr ∈ [0, 1] be the population of state r divided by the US population such that \(\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{r = 1}^{R}{w}_{r}=1\). For each MCMC draw m, we compute the ILI forecast for aggregated region ρ (indexing all ten HHS regions and nationally) as:$${y}_{\rho {\mathrm{stm}}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{r=1}^{R}{w}_{{\mathrm{r}}}^{(\rho)}{y}_{{\mathrm{rstm}}}.$$ (6) For ρ = region X (e.g., ρ = HHS Region 1), \({w}_{r}^{(\rho)}=0\) if state r is not a member of region X and$${w}_{r}^{(\rho)}=\frac{{w}_{r}\,\text{I}\,(r\in \,\text{region X}\,)}{\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{r = 1}^{R}{w}_{r}\,\text{I}\,(r\in \,\text{region X}\,)}$$ (7) and I(r ∈ region X) is an indicator function equal to 1 if state r is in region X and 0 otherwise. By construction, \(\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{r = 1}^{R}{w}_{r}^{(\rho)}=1\) for any ρ. The aggregation model constitutes a bottom-up forecasting procedure and ensures forecasts are coherent across scales. An example of resulting aggregated forecasts can be found in Supplementary Note 7.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

HLA-A*24:02 allele, highly prevalent in Indigenous populations, is associated with influenza-induced mortality, although the basis for this association is unclear. Here, we define CD8+ T-cell immune landscapes against influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses in HLA-A*24:02-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals, human tissues, influenza-infected patients and HLA-A*24:02-transgenic mice. We identify immunodominant protective CD8+ T-cell epitopes, one towards IAV and six towards IBV, with A24/PB2550–558-specific CD8+ T cells being cross-reactive between IAV and IBV. Memory CD8+ T cells towards these specificities are present in blood (CD27+CD45RA− phenotype) and tissues (CD103+CD69+ phenotype) of healthy individuals, and effector CD27−CD45RA−PD-1+CD38+CD8+ T cells in IAV/IBV patients. Our data show influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in Indigenous Australians, and advocate for T-cell-mediated vaccines that target and boost the breadth of IAV/IBV-specific CD8+ T cells to protect high-risk HLA-A*24:02-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations from severe influenza disease.

Influenza A viruses (IAV) can cause sporadic pandemics when a virus reassorts and rapidly spreads across continents, causing millions of infections and deaths1. Additionally, seasonal epidemics caused by co-circulating IAV and influenza B viruses (IBV) result in 3–5 million cases of severe disease and 290,000–650,000 deaths annually2,3. Severe illness and death from seasonal and pandemic influenza occur disproportionately in high-risk individuals, including Indigenous populations. This is most evident when unpredicted seasonal or pandemic viruses emerge in human circulation. During the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, 100% of Alaskan adults died in some isolated villages, while only school-aged children survived4. Western Samoa was the hardest hit with a total population loss of 19–22%5. As many as 10–20% of Indigenous Australians died from pandemic influenza in 19196 in comparison to <1% of other Australians, with some reports showing up to 50% mortality in Indigenous Australian communities7.During the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, Indigenous populations worldwide were more susceptible to influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Hospitalization and morbidity rates were markedly increased in Indigenous Australians8,9, with 16% of hospitalized pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) patients in Australia being Indigenous. The relative risk for Indigenous Australians compared to non-Indigenous Australians for hospitalization, ICU admission, or death was 6.6, 6.2, or 5.2 times higher, respectively10. This was mirrored in Indigenous populations globally, including American Indians and Alaskan Native people (4-fold higher mortality rate compared to non-Indigenous Americans)11, native Brazilians (2-fold higher hospitalization rate)12, New Zealand Maori (5-fold higher hospitalization rate), and Pacific Islanders (7-fold higher hospitalization rate)13,14. Although the impact of influenza pandemics is more pronounced in Indigenous populations globally, these disproportionate hospitalization rates also occur during seasonal infections. During 2010–2013, Indigenous Australians had increased influenza-related hospitalizations across all age groups (1.2–4.3-fold higher compared to non-Indigenous)15. Indigenous populations, especially Australians and Alaskans, are also predicted to be at greater risk from severe disease caused by the avian-derived H7N9 influenza virus, with mortality rates being >30% and hospitalization >99% in China16. While higher influenza infection rates could relate to overcrowded living conditions, increased severity and prolonged hospitalization most likely reflect differences in pre-existing immunity that facilitates recovery. However, the underlying immunological and host factors that account for severe influenza disease in Indigenous individuals are far from clear.Antibody-based vaccines towards variable surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), are an effective way to combat seasonal infections, yet they fail to provide effective protection when a new, antigenically different IAV emerges17. In the absence of antibodies, recall of pre-existing cross-protective memory CD8+ T-cells minimizes the effects of a novel IAV, leading to a milder disease after infection with distinct strains18,19,20,21,22,23. Such pre-existing memory CD8+ T-cells provide broadly heterotypic or cross-reactive protection and can recognize numerous IAV, IBV, and influenza C viruses capable of infecting humans24, promoting rapid host recovery. During the 2013 H7N9 IAV outbreak in China, recovery from severe H7N9 disease was associated with early CD8+ T-cell responses21,25. Patients discharged early after hospitalization had early (day 10) robust H7N9-specific CD8+ T-cells responses, while those with prolonged hospital stays showed late (day 19) recruitment of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. Thus, with the continuing threat of unpredicted influenza strains, there is a need for targeting cellular immunity that provides effective, long-lasting, and cross-strain protective immunity, especially for high-risk groups such as Indigenous populations. However, despite the heavy burden of disease in Indigenous communities, there is scant data on immunity to influenza viruses in Indigenous populations from around the world.As CD8+ T-cell recognition is determined by the spectrum of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) expressed in any individual, and HLA profiles differ across ethnic groups, defining T-cell epitopes restricted by HLAs predominant in some Indigenous populations is necessary to understand pre-existing CD8+ T-cell immunity to influenza. We previously analyzed the HLA allele repertoire in Indigenous Australians26 and found that HLA-A*24:02 (referred to as HLA-A24 hereafter), an HLA associated with influenza-induced mortality during the 2009-pH1N1 outbreak27, is the second most prominent HLA in Indigenous Australians26,28. HLA-A24 is also common to other Indigenous populations highly affected by influenza16. Thus, analysis of prominent influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell responses restricted by HLA-A24 is needed to understand the relationship between this allele and disease susceptibility. These specificities will also inform strategies to prime effective T-cell immunity in vulnerable communities.Here, we define CD8+ T-cell immune landscapes against IAV and IBV, restricted by the mortality-associated HLA-A24 allomorph. We identify IAV- and IBV-specific HLA-A24 immunopeptidomes and screen immunogenicity of novel peptides in HLA-A24-expressing mice, peripheral blood of Indigenous and non-Indigenous HLA-A24+ healthy and influenza-infected individuals, and human tissues. Our studies provide evidence of the breadth of influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell specificities restricted by a mortality-associated risk allomorph HLA-A24. These findings have implications for the incorporation of key CD8+ T-cell targets in a T-cell-mediated vaccine to protect Indigenous people globally from unpredicted influenza viruses.ResultsHigh prevalence of HLA-A24 expression in Indigenous populationsAs HLA-A24 has been linked to pH1N1-related mortality27, we first determined HLA-A24 distribution in Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations worldwide using the published allele frequency database. Compared to the 10% global distribution of HLA-A24, the detected frequencies of HLA-A24 were the highest in Oceania (37%), North-East Asia (32.9%), Australia (21.4%), and Central and South America (20.6%) (Fig. 1a). This was mainly due to a particularly high HLA-A24 prevalence in Indigenous populations in those regions, especially in the Pacific. HLA-A24 was highly prevalent in Indigenous Taiwan Paiwan (96.1%), Papa New Guinea Karimui Plateau Pawaia (74.4%), New Caledonia (60.7%), Alaskan Yupik (58.1%), New Zealand Maori (38%), American Samoans (33%), Chile Easter Island (35.8%), and some Australian Indigenous people (24%) (Fig. 1a), which highlights its key importance in shaping CD8+ T-cell immunity in Indigenous populations.Fig. 1: HLA-A24 expression and characterization of published IAV epitopes.a Allele frequency of HLA-A*24:02 according to geographic region (left panel) and Indigenous population in the pacific region (right panel) (source www.allelefrequencies.net accessed 20/01/2020). b Co-expression of HLA-A, B and C alleles with the HLA-A*24:02 allele in the LIFT cohort, where Circos plot is shown for HLA-A and pie charts are shown for HLA-C and B alleles that are co-expressed with the HLA-A*24:02 allele. c Screening of previously identified IAV HLA-A*24:02 peptides via IFN-γ-ICS assay following peptide expansion of PBMCs from 5 non-Indigenous individuals (median bar graphs are shown). d Representative FACS plots of cytokine expression for immunogenic peptides. e A24/PB1498–505-tetramer staining of peptide-expanded T-cell lines (top panels) and after ex vivo TAME from non-LIFT 3 donor (bottom panels) showing the TAME-enriched population and phenotype.Full size imageTo define influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in Indigenous Australians, we recruited 127 participants from the Northern Territory, Australia into the LIFT (Looking Into influenza T-cell immunity) cohort26. The mean age of the participants was 39 years, with a standard deviation of 14 years and 58% of female participants. 36% of the LIFT donors expressed at least one HLA-A24 allele, with 33% of those being HLA-A24 homozygous (Table 1). Notably, HLA-A24 was most commonly expressed with HLA-A*11:01, -A*34:01, -B*13:01, -B*15:21, -B*40:01, -B*40:02, -B*56:01, -C*04:03, -C*03:03, -C*04:01, and -C*04:03 in Indigenous Australians and were less expressed with alleles common in Caucasian populations, such as HLA-A*01:01, -A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -B*08:01 (Fig. 1b).Table 1 Summary LIFT cohort.Full size tableCD8+ T-cell responses towards published IAV-specific HLA-A24-epitopesA handful of IAV-specific HLA-A24-restricted epitopes have been described29,30,31,32 (Table 2). We aimed to validate the immunogenicity of these epitopes by probing memory CD8+ T-cells within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy non-Indigenous HLA-A24-expressing donors (Supplementary Table 1) using an in vitro peptide stimulation assay (Fig. 1c–e). Only 3 out of 12 peptides (PB1498–505, PB1496–505, PA130–138) induced CD8+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ/TNF production in a limited number of donors (3/5, 3/5, and 1/5, respectively) (Fig. 1c, d). We deduced that the minimal epitope for PB1496–505 responses came from the PB1498–505 epitope. The specificity of PB1498–505-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, observed in multiple donors, was further verified by A24/PB1498–505 tetramer staining on both in vitro-cultured A24/PB1498–505 CD8+ T-cell lines and A24/PB1498–505+CD8+ T-cells detected directly ex vivo by tetramer enrichment (Fig. 1e). Thus, while 3 of the previously published peptides elicited IFN-γ responses in a selected number of HLA-A24-expressing individuals, we sought to determine whether as yet unidentified epitopes might provide more robust IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in HLA-A24-expressing individuals.Table 2 Published immunogenic A*24:02-restricted IAV peptides.Full size tableIdentification of novel HLA-A24-restricted IAV and IBV epitopesTo identify new A24/influenza-derived epitopes, we utilized an immunopeptidomics approach to sequence HLA-bound peptides on influenza-infected cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)24. Experiments were performed with the class I-reduced C1R B-lymphoblastoid cell line (minimal HLA-B*35:03 surface expression but normal levels of HLA-C*04:01 expression33) and an HLA-A*24:02-transfected C1R cell line (C1R.A24)34. Initial experiments were performed in both cell lines at 16 h post-infection with and without the HKx31 IAV virus, isolating peptide-bound HLA-I molecules post-lysis utilizing the pan HLA-I antibody W6/32 (Supplementary Data 1). In subsequent experiments, to improve the confidence of assignment of binding to HLA-A24, HLA-C*04:01 depletion of the lysates was performed with the HLA-C-specific antibody DT9 prior to isolation of the remaining HLA-I (A*24:02»B*35:03) with W6/32 antibody. Utilizing this workflow35, we assessed peptide presentation in C1R.A24 cells at 2, 4, 8, and 12 h post-infection with either A/HKx31 or B/Malaysia/2506/2004 viruses. Analyses were restricted to up to 12 h post-infection due to observations of marked HLA-I downregulation at 16 h post-infection36.In total, 12 immunopeptidome data sets containing HLA-A24-restricted peptides were generated including 3 from uninfected C1R.A24 cells, 5 from HKx31-infected, and 4 from B/Malaysia-infected C1R.A24 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 1). An additional 3 data sets for endogenous HLA-I of C1R cells (C1R W6/32 isolation of HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01 after 16 h HKx31 infection; C1R.A24 - DT9 isolation of HLA-C*04:01 from uninfected cells and after 12 h HKx31 infection) and 2 data sets for endogenous HLA-II (C1R.A24: HLA-DR12, -DPB1*04:01,04:02 and -DQ7 from uninfected and 12 h HKx31 infection) were also generated as comparators to help establish true HLA-A24 binders (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). Comparisons to previously identified B/Malaysia-derived HLA ligands for C1R were also used24 to distinguish HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01 binding peptides from those binding to HLA-A*24:02. Across the 12 HLA-A24 data sets, a total of 9051 non-redundant peptide sequences were assigned to the human proteome at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). As expected for HLA-I ligands, the majority of peptides were 9–11 amino acids in length but dominated by 9mers (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the HLA-A24 peptide-binding motif generated by NetMHC4.037,38 motif viewer, enrichment of Tyr/Phe at P2 and Phe/Leu/Ile at P9 were observed (Fig. 2b). Peptides binding the endogenous HLA-I of C1R were not removed in this analysis due to the similar preference of HLA-C*04:01 for 9mer peptides possessing Phe/Tyr at P2 and Phe/Leu at P9, which may result in shared ligands (Supplementary Fig. 1d). To maximize the identification of potential virus-derived peptides, assignments to the viral proteome or 6-frame translation of the viral genome were considered without an FDR cut-off. Instead, lack of appearance in uninfected data sets and predicted binding affinity (NetMHCpan4.039,40,41) for HLA-A24 were used to determine likely candidate epitopes. Thus, 52 HKx31-derived and 48 B/Malaysia-derived peptides were identified as potential HLA-A24-restricted epitopes (Fig. 2c), of which 26 IAV-derived and 29 IBV-derived peptides were identified at a 5% FDR (Supplementary Data 1). The identified peptides spanned the viral proteomes including frame-shift proteins, representing 6 IAV proteins and 9 IBV proteins (Fig. 2d, e). Interestingly, most HKx31-derived ligands mapped to PB2 > PB1 > HA viral proteins and none were observed from NA or M1, while B/Malaysia-derived ligands predominantly mapped to NP/HA > NA. During the time course analyses, broadest peptide identification was achieved for both viruses between 8 and 12 h post-infection, while no influenza-derived peptides were identified at 2 h post-infection, and those identified at 4 h were of lower confidence (Fig. 2f, g and Supplementary Data 1). 10 potential HKx31-derived ligands were also identified for each of HLA-B*35:03 and HLA-C*04:01 based on predicted binding and/or appearance in control data sets (Supplementary Fig. 1e and Supplementary Data 1). Furthermore, analysis of the peptides presented by HLA-II molecules showed domination of the virus-derived immunopeptidome by HA (Supplementary Fig. 1f and Supplementary Data 1), as previously observed for IBV24. A selection of 48 IAV and 41 IBV peptides were synthesized for subsequent screening (Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and Supplementary Data 1). Notably, most synthetic peptides showed highly similar fragmentation patterns and retention times to the discovery data, supporting the original identifications (Supplementary Data 1).Fig. 2: LC–MS/MS analyses of immunopeptidome from HLA-A*24:02+ influenza-infected cells.a Length distribution of human proteome-derived HLA-I ligands of C1R.A24 isolated using the pan HLA-I antibody W6/32.

In all panels, n = number of peptides.Full size imageCD8+ T-cells in IAV/HLA-A24 mice are biased toward polymerase-derived peptidesTo determine the immunogenicity of novel IAV- and IBV-derived peptides during primary and secondary influenza virus infection in vivo, we utilized HLA-A24-expressing transgenic (HHD-A24) mice42. These mice are not confounded by prior exposure to infections nor co-expression of other competing major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) molecules, and thus provide a valuable tool for screening peptide antigens in vivo. For primary IAV analyses, 6–10-week-old mice were intranasally (i.n.) infected with 200 pfu of H3N2 HKx31 virus, while secondary experiments were performed by an i.n. heterologous challenge with 200 pfu H1N1 PR8 6–8 weeks after the primary HKx31 infection. At day (d) 10 post-infection, spleen and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL, combined from 4–5 mice) were stimulated with 54 peptides; including 48 novel peptides identified by mass spectrometry and the previously published PB1496–505, M199–109, M1108–117, M1239–248, NP39–47 & NP419–429 peptides (Supplementary Table 2). The responses were detected by 5-h ex vivo peptide stimulation and measurement of IFN-γ production by ICS (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our data revealed that A24/IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were immunodominant (>5% IFN-γ+ of CD8+ T-cells) towards 2 PB1- and 3 PB2-derived peptides: PB1216–224 (mean of 10.2% IFNγ+ of CD8+ cells in spleen, 16.5% in BAL), the published PB1498–505 (14.8% spleen, 23.3% BAL), PB2549–557 (10.1% spleen, 24.9% BAL), PB2549–559 (11.1% spleen, 24.4% BAL) and PB2463–471 (6% spleen, 9.3% BAL) (Fig. 3a). Two additional subdominant (1% < IFN-γ+ of CD8+ T-cells < 5%) CD8+ T-cell responses were directed towards PB2322–320 (3.9% spleen, 7.7% BAL) and previously published NP39–47 (2.1% spleen, 7.7% BAL), while marginal CD8+ T-cell responses were detected, mainly in BAL, towards 6 other peptides (HA248–259, PA47–60, PA130–138, PB12–10, PB1500–505, PB2703–710). Several key determinants can orchestrate the main target and therefore the immunodominance of CD8+ T cells. These include the affinity of the peptide to the HLA I molecule, the affinity of the CD8+ T cells for an epitope, as well as the number of naive epitope-specific CD8+ T cells (as reviewed in ref. 43).Fig. 3: Screening of immunogenic IAV and IBV peptides in HHD-A24 mice.a, c Frequencies of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cells in the spleen (individual mice) and BAL (pooled mice) after primary infection with either IAV (100 pfu/30 μL i.n. A/HKx31) or IBV (200 pfu/30 μL i.n. B/Malaysia/2506/04), respectively, from 6 to 10 week-old HLA-A24-expressing mice. Cells from spleen and BAL were isolated 10 days post-infection and restimulated with individual peptides (a, n = 10 mice from 2 independent experiments, except PB2591–600, PB2117–125 5 mice from 1 experiment) (c, n = 14 mice from 3 experiments; except NA209–217 n = 13 from 3 independent experiments; NS28–37, NP399–408, NS178–190, NA1–12, NP338–345, NP181–191, n = 12 mice from 3 experiments; HA370–380, NA + 3480–489 n = 10 mice 2 experiments; NP218–228, PA146–156, NS1211219,NA32–39, HA339–346, NA458–466, NS1211–218 n = 9 mice from 3 experiments). b, d IFN-γ+ frequencies following a secondary heterologous challenge with IAV (200 pfu/30 μL of A/PR8) and IBV (400 pfu/30 μL of B/Phuket/3073/2013), 6 weeks after primary infection, respectively. Cells were isolated 8 days post-infection for ICS assay (b, n = 5 mice from 1 experiment) (d, n = 4 mice from 1 experiment). a–d Bars indicate mean + SD for spleen and BAL for c only. Pie charts depict the protein origin of immunogenic peptides and the average contribution to the total IFN-γ response in the spleen for each primary and secondary IAV/IBV responses. Colored bars below the bar chart indicate the protein origin of characterized peptides. Representative concatenated FACS plots from splenocytes of immunodominant and subdominant responses compared to DMSO background control are shown in the top-right panels.Full size imageDuring the acute phase (d8) of secondary challenge, CD8+ T-cell responses were similarly directed at 6 immunogenic peptides found in the primary infection (PB1216–224, PB1498–505, PB2322–330, PB2463–471, PB2549–557 and PB2549–559) (Fig. 3b). CD8+ T-cell responses towards the marginal epitopes observed in the primary infection were no longer detected. While the reason for the loss of HA248–259 could be explained by sequence variation between HKx31 and PR8 (IYWTIVKPGDVL vs. YYWTLVKPGDTI) all internal proteins are shared between both viruses. Analysis of influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers showed significant reductions in epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells for 9 out of 11 specificities (NP39–47, PA130–138, PB12–10, PB1216–224, PB1496–505, PB1498–505, PB2322–330, PB2703–710 and PB2549–559) following secondary infection (Supplementary Fig. 3). Changes in immunodominance after heterologous influenza virus infection have been studied previously, especially in B6 mice. Immunodominance hierarchy and cross-protective capacity of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells depend greatly on the first influenza encounter and presentation of viral epitopes by different cell types (reviewed in ref. 44).Thus, our in vivo screening in HHD-A24 mice identified 6 IAV-derived immunogenic peptides during primary and secondary IAV infection, with prominent CD8+ T-cell responses being heavily biased towards PB1- and PB2-derived peptides (Supplementary Table 2). This is of key importance as the current T-cell vaccines in clinical trials focus mainly on internal proteins like NP and M145,46,47,48,49, which may be poorly immunogenic in HLA-A24-expressing individuals at risk of severe influenza disease.Prominent A24/CD8+ T-cell specificities in IBV infectionWhile the CD8+ T-cell responses towards IBV have been studied in detail for HLA-A*02:01-expressing individuals24, there remains a lack of known CD8+ T-cell epitopes for other HLAs. Here, we determined the immunogenicity of newly identified IBV-derived peptides using primary and secondary infection in HHD-A24 mice. HHD-A24 mice were i.n. infected with 200 pfu B/Malaysia/2506/2004. On d10, spleen and BAL were restimulated with individual peptides (Supplementary Table 3) to measure the corresponding CD8+ T-cell responses. Novel immunodominant IFN-γ-producing A24/CD8+ T-cell specificities were found against a range of IBV peptides including NP164–173 (mean of 13.1% in the spleen, 31.15% in BAL), the shorter NP165–173 (12.6% spleen, 38.4% BAL) and NA32–40 (5.2% spleen, 17.3% BAL), while subdominant A24/CD8+ T-cell responses were detected towards an additional four IBV-derived peptides (NA213–221, NP392–400, PB2245–253, PB2550–558) (Fig. 3c).To define IBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses following the secondary challenge, B/Malaysia/2506/2004-infected mice were challenged i.n. after 6–8 weeks with 400 pfu B/Phuket/3073/2013. At d8 after challenge, IBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses resembled those after primary IBV infection (Fig. 3d), but were focussed more towards the immunodominant epitopes, similar to IAV-specific A24/CD8+ T-cell responses following secondary challenge. Although the B/Phuket virus differs in one amino acid in the NP164–173/NP165–173 and NA213–222 restimulating with the B/Malaysia variants showed cross-reactivity of CD8+ T-cells between both variants. All other immunogenic epitopes were conserved between both strains. In contrast to IAV infection, the total number of epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells for all immunogenic epitopes after secondary challenge remained comparable in the spleen (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, our data identified prominent A24/CD8+ T-cell responses directed toward IBV during primary and secondary influenza virus infection in HHD-A24 mice (Supplementary Table 3).IAV/CD8+ T-cells in HLA-A24+ Indigenous and non-Indigenous individualsHaving identified prominent IAV-derived CD8+ T-cell epitopes towards the primary and secondary infection in HHD-A24 mice, it was of key importance to define immunodominant CD8+ T-cell sets in HLA-A24-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals. For humans, different influenza strains of the same subtype are often co-circulating and mutating to create different variants of the same epitope region. In addition to our identified panel of HLA-A24-binding peptides, we searched the Influenza research database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Databaseph-select.cgi?go=database) to include the most frequent virus strains circulating in South-East Asia and Australia and identified naturally occurring variants of our HLA-A24 binding peptides utilizing the “Identify short peptides in proteins” analysis from the Influenza research database (fludb.org) (n = 61–3877 sequences dependent on protein) to include in epitope mapping (Supplementary Table 4). We probed memory CD8+ T-cell populations, by firstly stimulating PBMCs from healthy Indigenous HLA-A24-expressing donors with 5 IAV peptide pools for 13 days. Each pool contained 7–13 peptides (Supplementary Table 2), of which each variant (Supplementary Table 4) was always included in the same pool as the wildtype peptide identified in the immunopeptidome studies. We observed CD8+ T-cell responses towards pools 1 and 2 via an IFN-γ/TNF ICS assay (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4), and subsequently, cell cultures from those pools were restimulated with individual peptides (+variants) to map the immunogenic epitopes. In 5/5 Indigenous donors tested, CD8+ T-cell responses were dominated by PB1498–505 (median of 0.93% IFN-γ of CD8+ T-cells; also immunodominant in mice Fig. 3a, b), its longer 10mer version PB1496–505 (median of 0.64%; detected marginally after 1° IAV infection in mice), PA649–658 (median of 0.73%; not detected in mice) and NP39–47 (median 0.16%, immunogenic following 1° IAV infection in mice). Another 6 subdominant HLA-A24-restricted epitopes were identified in a select number of donors (PB2110–119 in 4/5 donors, NS298–106 in 3/5, PB1216–224 in 3/5, PB2549–557 in 1/5, HA176–184 in 3/5 and PB2703–710 in 3/5), of which PB1216–224, PB2549–557 and PB2703–710 were also detected in HHD-A24 mice. Interestingly, only 2/4 immunodominant epitopes observed in the Indigenous donors elicited comparably robust responses in 5 non-Indigenous donors screened (published epitopes: PB1498–505 median 0.93% vs 1.1%, PB1496–505 median 0.64% vs 0.8%), while the other two epitopes, PA649–658 and NP39–47 were poorly immunogenic in non-Indigenous donors who instead responded well to the PB2549–557 epitope, absent in 4/5 Indigenous donors. Such differential epitope preference and immunodominance hierarchies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous donors is perhaps influenced by different HLA co-expression backgrounds or infection history.Fig. 4: In vitro screening for immunogenicity of IAV and IBV epitopes in human PBMC.a, b Frequencies of IFN-γ+CD8+ T-cells after PBMCs were expanded with IAV (a) or IBV (b) peptide pools for 13 days and restimulated with C1R.A24 cells pulsed with the corresponding peptide pools (left panel; IAV n = 5 biologically independent samples, IBV n = 4 biologically independent samples).

In accordance with the HHD-A24 mouse data, we found broad A24/CD8+ T-cell responses directed towards pool 10, which mapped to 6 major immunogenic epitopes spanning 5 different proteins (NP164–173/NP165–173, NA32–40, PB2550–558, PA457–465, HA552–560 and PB1503–511) (Fig. 4b and Table 3). CD8+ T-cell responses to these peptides were found in 7/9, 8/9, 6/9, 6/9, 5/9, and 5/9 of Indigenous and 5/5, 5/5, 4/5, 5/5, and 4/5 of non-Indigenous donors, respectively, with comparable IFNγ+CD8+ T-cell frequencies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous donors. The diversity of CD8+ T cell epitopes was comparable between Indigenous (LIFT) and non-Indigenous (non-LIFT) PBMCs.Table 3 Human immunodominant A24 epitopes.Full size tableAs our experiments examined the immunogenicity of A24/CD8+ T-cells following in vitro peptide-driven expansion, we further verified these novel IBV epitopes in non-Indigenous donors by incubating HLA-A24+ PBMCs with IBV-infected (B/Malaysia/2505/2004) C1R.A24 target-cells for 15 days before dissecting individual peptide (+variant) responses from IBV pool 10. This confirmed the immunogenicity of at least 3 epitopes previously detected by peptide-driven expansions (NP164–173/NP165–173, NA32–40, and PB2550–558) (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the same epitopes were observed in HHD-A24 mice after IBV infection (Fig. 3c, d).Collectively, out of 41 HLA-A24-binding IBV epitopes newly identified by immunopeptidomics, we confirmed a total of 9 (22%) immunogenic epitopes after screening HLA-A24-expressing mice and humans. Of these, 3 were found in both humans and mice (NP164–173/NP165–173, NA32–40, PB2550–558), 3 were only found in humans (HA552–560, PA457–465 and PB1503–511), and the remaining 3 were only found in mice (PB2245–253, NA213–221 and NP392–400).A24/CD8+ T-cell cross-reactivity between IAV and IBV to PB2 epitopesThe B/Malaysia/2505/2004 virus used here is from the Victoria (Vic) lineage, however, there is another IBV lineage that commonly co-circulates and infects humans called the Yamagata (Yam) lineage. To determine the potential for HLA-A24/CD8+ T-cell cross-reactivity across both IBV lineages, B/Malaysia/2505/2004 (Vic) virus-expanded CD8+ T-cells were restimulated with IBV peptide variants from the alternate Yam lineage. Cross-reactivity was demonstrated towards the NP165–173 epitope (YFSPIRVTF variant 1 (Vic only)), in which B/Malaysia/2505/2004-expanded CD8+ T-cells responded towards the Yam variant (YFSPIRITF v2 (Yam only)) following ICS assay (Fig. 4d). Likewise, cross-reactivity between Vic lineage and a variant found in the Yam lineage was also observed with the PB2550–558 variants (TYQWVLKNL (variant 1, both Vic and Yam); TYQWVMKNL (variant 2, Yam only)) in the virus-expansion system, but 3/4 donors did only respond to v1 after peptide expansion (Fig. 4d).Koutsakos et al. have previously reported cross-reactivity towards IAV and IBV (as well as ICV) in the HLA-A2 model with a single epitope sequence24. Here, none of the identified HLA-A24 IAV and IBV epitopes showed 100% sequence identity between strains. Instead, we identified a potential HLA-A24-restricted IAV/IBV cross-reactive candidate, the immunogenic IAV PB2549–557 TYQWIIRNW epitope. This epitope shares 55% amino acid identity with the cross-reactive IBV PB2550–558 variants. Indeed, virus-expansion with IAV/HKx31-infected C1R.A24 cells induced cognate IAV/PB2549–557+ (A/PB2549–557) CD8+ T-cell responses in 2/4 donors as well as cross-reactive responses to the IBV PB2550–558v1 (B/PB2550–558v1) variant and the B/PB2550–558v2 variant (Fig. 4e). The superiority of IBV at inducing cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells in contrast to IAV was validated with the reverse experiment, where virus-expansion with B/Malaysia/2506/2004-infected C1R.A24 cells induced highly robust CD8+ T-cell responses in 4/4 donors, capable of cross-recognizing all three different epitopes (Fig. 4e).As we observed T-cell cross-reactivity between the A/PB2549–557 and B/PB2550–558 (Fig. 4e) as well as T-cell reactivity in transgenic mice for the overlapping peptide A/PB2549–559, we next determined the impact of those variations within the PB2-derived peptides. We solved the structures of A/PB2549–557, the overlapping A/PB2549–559, and B/PB2550–558 peptides in complex with the HLA-A24 molecules at a resolution of 2.90, 2.95, and 2.16 Å, respectively (Supplementary Table 5) with clear electron density for each peptide (Supplementary Fig. 5a–f).The 9mer A/PB2549–557 peptide adopted a canonical extended conformation within the cleft of HLA-A24, with anchor residues at P2-Tyr and P9-Trp, and a secondary anchor residue at P5-Ile. Solvent exposed residues were at P4-Trp, P6-Ile, P7-Arg, and P8-Asn, representing a large surface accessible for TCR interaction. The P9-Trp of the peptide formed a network of interactions with HLA-A24 tyrosine residues at positions 116, 118, and 123 as well as the Leu95 (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c), likely assisting with stabilizing the complex reflected in the higher stability observed for the HLA-A24-A/PB2549–557 complex than with other peptides (Supplementary Table 5).The B/PB2550–558 peptide differed from the A/PB2549–557 peptide at positions 5 (Ile to Val), 6 (Ile to Leu), 7 (Arg to Lys), and 9 (Trp to Leu) (Fig. 4f). Both peptides shared the same anchor residue at P2-Tyr and similar solvent-exposed residues (except for P7-Lys) but differed at PΩ (P9). As Leu possessed a shorter side chain than Tyr at PΩ, the IBV peptide was not buried as deeply into the F pocket, which may explain the lower stability observed for the B/PB2550–558 peptide (Tm of 57 °C) compared to A/PB2549–557 (Tm of 62 °C) (Supplementary Table 5). Structural overlay of HLA-A24 presenting the A/PB2549–557 and B/PB2550–558 peptides showed that the antigen-binding cleft and both peptides adopted a similar conformation with an average root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.31 and 0.37 Å, respectively (for Cα atoms) (Fig. 4f), consistent with T-cell cross-reactivity observed towards these two peptides.Although the 11mer A/PB2549–559 generated similar responses to the 9mer A/PB2549–557 in HHD-A24 mice (Fig. 3a, b), it was not immunogenic in peptide-pool screening in humans (Supplementary Table 2 Pool 4) (Fig. 4a) as perhaps the minimal 9mer epitope was not exposed for T-cell recognition, due to the two additional C-terminal residues (P10-Glu and P11-Thr) (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Similar to the 9mer peptide conformation P2-Tyr and P9-Trp of the 11mer PB2549–559 act as primary anchor residues buried in the HLA-A24 antigen-binding cleft with the structural overlay of the peptides showing a r.m.s.d. of 0.48 Å (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). Strikingly, the extra P10-Glu and P11-Thr residues of the 11mer extended outside the antigen-binding cleft, creating an unusual conformation that disturbed the interaction between the peptide and the HLA-A24 Lys146 at the C-terminal of the cleft. The Lys146 residue is a conserved residue in HLA molecules that helps stabilize the pHLA complex50. In the 9mer PB2549–557 peptide, Lys146 interacts with the carboxylic group of the PΩ residue (Supplementary Fig. 6d), however, this interaction is lost in the 11mer due to the presence of the extra two residues P10-Glu and P11-Thr (Supplementary Fig. 6e), thereby likely decreasing the pHLA stability compared to the shorter A/PB2549–557 peptide (Supplementary Table 5). Thus, the bulged conformation of the extra residues in the A/PB2549–559 may represent a challenge for TCRs interacting with the C-terminal end of the peptide. In compliance with the in vitro data, the structural data support the potential cross-reactivity of CD8+ T-cells between the A/PB2549–557 and the B/PB2550–558, verifying our previous findings of broad CD8+ T-cell immunity against influenza virus infections.HLA-A24 presents overlapping NP164 – 173 and NP165 – 173 in different conformationsWe observed robust comparable mouse (Fig. 3c, d) and human (Fig. 4b) responses to the overlapping IBV NP164–173 and NP165–173 peptides. This suggested that the 9mer NP165–173 peptide would be the minimal epitope and both peptides might present a similar core confirmation recognized by T-cells. To determine this possibility, we solved the structures of the overlapping B/NP164–173 and B/NP165–173 peptides in complex with HLA-A24 at a resolution of 2.75 and 1.51 Å, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5g–j, 7 and Supplementary Table 5). The B/NP164–173 and B/NP165–173 peptides adopted a canonical extended conformation in the cleft of HLA-A24 molecule (Supplementary Fig. 7). P2-Phe and P9-Phe anchor residues of the 9mer B/NP165–173 were buried deep inside the hydrophobic B and F pockets of the HLA (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Three residues were exposed to the solvent for possible TCR recognition (P1-Tyr, P6-Arg, P8-Thr). The P5-Ile and P7-Val of this 9mer peptide were partially buried (Supplementary Fig. 7e).Structural overlay of 9mer and 10mer B/NP peptides were different due to the 10mer’s extra residue at the N-terminus (r.m.s.d. of 1.36 Å), which shifted the anchor residues (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). The substitution of P2-Tyr (NP164–173) for P2-Phe (NP165–173) occurred without major structural rearrangement, as both residues were large aromatic residues filling the B pocket (Supplementary Fig. 7f). However, the additional residue changed the secondary anchor residue at P3 from a small P3-Ser (NP165–173) to a large P3-Phe (NP164–173) (Supplementary Fig. 7g). The larger P3-Phe might stabilize the B pocket of the HLA-A24 better than the small P3-Ser, and therefore could explain the 7 °C higher Tm observed for the NP164–173 than the NP165–173 in complex with HLA-A24 (Supplementary Table 5), which could also reflect the immunogenicity of this peptide. The largest structural difference between the two peptides was observed at the center of the peptide (P6/7-Arg) with a maximum displacement of 3.9 Å for the Cα atom (Supplementary Fig. 7d). The P7-Arg of the NP164–173 peptide sat higher than the backbone of the NP165–173 peptide (Supplementary Fig. 7c) and was a prominent feature for potential TCR interaction of the 10mer peptide, contrasting with the hydrophobic nature of the 9mer NP165–173 peptide. Thus, the structures of HLA-A24 presenting the two NP peptides showed that, despite being overlapping peptides that differ only by one residue, the NP164–173 and NP165–173 peptides adopt different structural conformations. As a result, both peptides exposed different residues to the solvent, and hence would most likely be recognized by different TCRαβ repertoires.Protective capacity of novel HLA-A24 IBV-epitope in HHD-A24 miceTo determine the protective capacity of the novel CD8+ T cell epitopes in HHD-A24 mice, we performed a proof of principle experiment and vaccinated mice with 3 immunogenic IBV peptides (NP164, NP392, NA32) using a well-established prime/boost approach24, then infected mice i.n. with 1 × 103 pfu B/Malaysia (Fig. 5a). Vaccination with HLA-A24-restricted peptides resulted in significant protection against IBV. This was shown by decreased disease severity on d4, d5, and d6 after IBV infection as measured by the bodyweight loss (Fig. 5b; p < 0.05, unpaired two-tailed t-test) as well as a significant ~89% reduction in viral titers in the lung on d7 after IBV infection when compared to the mock-immunized group (p = 0.001, unpaired two-tailed t-test) (Fig. 5c). Additionally, there was a significant decrease (p < 0.05, unpaired two-tailed t-test) in the levels of inflammatory cytokines (MIP-1β, MIP-1a, RANTES) in d7 BAL of peptide-vaccinated mice in comparison to the mock-immunized animals (Fig. 5d). Thus, CD8+ T cells directed at our novel HLA-A24-restricted IBV-specific epitopes provide a substantial level of protection against influenza disease, as they can markedly decrease body weight loss, accelerate viral clearance and reduce the cytokine storm at the site of infection.Fig. 5: Protection of HDD.24 mice by vaccination with immunogenic A24 peptides.a Mice were vaccinated with 3 immunogenic IBV peptides (NP164, NP392, NA32) in adjuvant CFA or CFA alone (control). 14 days post-priming, immune responses were boosted with peptides/IFA or IFA alone. 7 days after the boost, mice were challenged with a high dose of 1 × 103 pfu B/Malaysia. Bronchoalveolar lavage and lungs were collected on days 6 and 7 post infection. b % bodyweight of mice after virus challenge at different days after infection. c Virus titer from homogenized lungs on days 6 and 7 post challenge. d Cytokine levels in BAL on day 6 and 7. Colored stars indicate significant differences between control and peptide-vaccinated groups. b–d Statistical significance was calculated using an unpaired two-tailed t-test with *p < 0.05 (n = 5 animals per group, 1 experiment). Mean values are shown with ±SD (b, c) or +SD (d).Full size imageA24/CD8+ T-cells in influenza patient blood and healthy human tissuesHaving identified the prominent IAV and IBV CD8+ T-cell specificities for Indigenous and non-Indigenous HLA-A24+-individuals, we sought to determine whether CD8+ T-cells specific for our newly identified epitopes were recruited and activated during acute influenza virus infection. We generated peptide/HLA-A24-tetramers to the most immunogenic IAV (A/PB1498–505) and newly characterized IBV epitopes (NP165–173 and NA32–40). These reagents allowed direct ex vivo detection of IAV- and IBV-specific CD8+ T-cells using tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment (TAME)51 in both healthy and influenza-infected individuals (Fig. 6a, left panels and Supplementary Fig. 8). In healthy non-Indigenous and Indigenous donors, ex vivo mean precursor frequencies for A/PB1498–505+ and B/NP165–173+ CD8+ T-cells, were 4 × 10−5 and 1 × 10−5 of CD8+ T-cells, respectively (Fig. 6b). Non-Indigenous B/NA32+ frequencies were 1.8–9 × 10−5 of CD8+ T-cells. All tetramer+ frequencies fell within the range of previously published frequencies for memory IAV- or EBV-specific CD8+ T-cells51,52.Fig. 6: Ex vivo IAV- and IBV-specific CD8+ T-cells detected in HLA-A24+ PBMCs and tissues.a Tetramer-positive cells of three different specificities (A/PB1498–505, B/NP165–173, B/NA32–40) were enriched in human blood and tissues. Representative FACS plots of enriched fractions are shown for healthy donors, acute influenza-infected patients, and tissues from deceased organ donors. b Tetramer+ precursor frequencies in the blood of healthy LIFT and non-LIFT, and influenza-infected donors where acute and convalescent time-points are shown together (IBV-inf).

However, despite similar frequencies, their activation profiles varied greatly, as assessed directly ex vivo by expression of the activation markers CD71, HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1, and phenotypic markers CD27 and CD45RA (Fig. 6c, d). In patients acutely (within 10 days post disease onset) infected with IAV and IBV, tetramer+CD8+ T-cells displayed cells were expressing activation markers in significantly (p < 0.05, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) higher frequencies, especially CD38+PD-1+ (18.7% vs. 0.8%), CD71+PD-1+ and CD38+ (14.6% vs. 0.1%), CD38+CD71+PD-1+ (6.7% vs 0.0%) and CD38+CD71+ (6.3% vs. 0.0%), in comparison to epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells of healthy donors (Fig. 6c). In convalescent donors (30 days post disease onset), the dominant activation factor expressed in the epitope-specific CD8+ T cells was PD-1 (44.2% in convalescent vs. 18.4% in healthy). Phenotypic analysis of CD45RA, CD27, and CD95 expression confirmed these results and showed higher frequencies of CD45RA−CD27− effector memory-like T-cells in IAV- and IBV-infected patients (mean of 25.9% vs. 12.2% in healthy, p = 0.04, Mann–Whitney test), higher (but not significant) frequency of CD45RA−CD27+ central memory-like T-cells (49.1% vs. 38.5% in healthy, p = 0.24, Mann–Whitney test), and less naive T-cells (5.4% vs. 29.7% in healthy, p = 0.004, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) compared to healthy individuals within the pooled IAV/IBV tetramer specificities (Fig. 6d). Comparing all healthy donors, we observed a lower frequency of CD45RA+CD27− TEMRA-like T-cells in epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells from Indigenous- compared to non-Indigenous donors (5.0% vs 20.0% in non-Indigenous, p < 0.05, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 6d). This difference was not observed in the total non-specific CD8+ T-cell population.Importantly, HLA-A24-restricted influenza-specific CD8+ T-cells against A/PB1498 and A/NP165 were detected in multiple healthy human tissues directly ex vivo (Fig. 6a, right panels and Supplementary Fig. 9). A/PB1498-specific CD8+ T-cells were detected in the lung, spleen, and tonsil at frequencies ranging from 1.5 × 10−7 to 4.5 × 10−5 of total CD8+ T-cells (n = 6 data points) but were not detected in the pancreatic lymph node (panLN) of one donor that had detectable A/PB1498–505-specific CD8+ T-cells in the spleen (Fig. 6e). B/NP165-specific CD8+ T-cells were found across all the tissues (lung, spleen, tonsil, panLN, n = 7 data points) at frequencies between 1.1 × 10−6 and 1.7 × 10−4. In human lung, IAV/IBV-specific CD8+ T-cells had large populations of CD69−CD103+ and CD69+CD103+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) T-cells (A/PB1498–505: 75% and 21%, B/NP165–173: 41% and 47% of tetramer-specific CD8+ T-cells, respectively) (Fig. 6f). Secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) were predominantly CD69−CD103− circulating effector memory cells (range 23.8–85.7%).Our findings demonstrate the presence of highly activated influenza-specific CD8+ T-cells against the published A/PB1498 epitope and the IBV epitopes identified here in HLA-A24+ patients with acute influenza infection and memory pools across different human tissues, highly relevant to the Indigenous population.Distinct HLA-A24 pMHC tetramer staining patterns reflect KIR3DL1 bindingIt was apparent from the tetramer-enrichment assays that some healthy donors contained large populations of HLA-A24-tetramer-binding CD8+ T-cells prior to enrichment (up to 6% of CD8+ T-cells) (Fig. 7a). This appeared to be donor-dependent but not entirely CD8+ T-cell specificity-dependent. We found such oversized (0.32–6.73% in unenriched PBMCs) tetramer+CD8+ T-cell populations for A/PB1498 in 10 out of 23 donors and in 14 out of 26 donors for B/NP165 tetramers, but not for B/NA32 (0/4 donors), which was further enriched with TAME (Fig. 7a, b). Ex vivo peptide stimulation and ICS performed with PBMCs from Non-LIFT 8 donor showed minimal IFNγ/TNF response (Supplementary Fig. 10), despite the high frequency of tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells, indicating that these high frequency, low-affinity tetramer-binding ex vivo populations were not peptide-specific. Thus, it is important to note that our tetramer analyses in Fig. 5 excluded this oversized low-intensity staining tetramer-binding CD8+ T-cell population. Such oversized tetramer-binding CD8+ T-cell population could potentially be a unique HLA-A24-tetramer-binding phenomenon occurring in selected donors and hence potentially impair TCR-specific CD8+ T-cell binding. Therefore, we sought to better understand HLA-A24-tetramer-binding in donors with conventional and largely oversized HLA-A24-tetramer CD8+ T-cell populations.Fig. 7: Comparison of conventional and KIR-binding CD8+ T-cells.a Staining pattern of donors with conventional-size tetramer staining and donors with oversized tetramer+CD8+ T cell populations for the A/PB1498–505 and B/NP165–173 tetramers pre- and post-enrichment. b Presence (+) or absence (−) of conventional (blue) and oversized tetramer+CD8+ T cell populations (red) populations across all samples tested. c Phenotypic analysis of tetramer-enriched CD8+ T-cells from conventional-size and oversized populations for both A/PB1498–505 and B/NP165–173 tetramers (conventional A/PB1498-binding cells n = 7 biologically independent samples; pre-TAME A/PB1498-binding cells n = 6 biologically independent samples, conventional B/NP165-binding cells n = 9 biologically independent samples, pre-Tame B/NP165-binding cells n = 7 biologically independent samples).

To determine factors underlying this phenomenon, we performed scRNA-seq on single-cell-sorted TAME-enriched A/PB1498–505+CD8+ T-cell populations from two donors with oversized populations (non-LIFT 8 and 12) and two donors with conventional-size populations (non-LIFT 14 and 10) (Fig. 7d). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three gene clusters (Fig. 7e). Highly expressed genes from Cluster 1 were associated with A/PB1498+CD8+ TNaive cells predominantly from donor 14. Most notably, A/PB1498+CD8+ TEMRA cells from donors 8 and 12 (oversized population) were grouped together and highly expressed genes from Cluster 2, characterized by high levels of T-cell effector genes NKG7, GNLY, CCL5, and granzymes B and H (GZMB and GZMH) but not K (GZMK), found in Cluster 3. In contrast, A/PB1498–505+CD8+ TEMRA cells from donors 14 and 8 were grouped with highly expressed genes from Cluster 1 and 3, but not Cluster 2 except for CCL5 and IFITM1 genes, revealing distinct characteristics of A/PB1498+CD8+ TEMRA cells within the two tetramer-binding populations.NKG7 (natural killer cell granule protein 7) and GNLY (granulysin) are key CD8+ T-cell effector genes53 located on the same immunoregion locus containing all the natural killer-receptor genes including the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), within the leukocyte receptor complex (1 Mb, chromosome 19q13.4)54. Since NKG7 and GNLY were the top-hit genes associated with A/PB1498+CD8+ TEMRA cells from donors 8 and 12, we hypothesized that a KIR was interacting with the peptide/HLA-A24 complex. KIR are expressed by a proportion of CD8+ T-cells55 and KIR3DL1, in particular, has been previously shown to bind some but not all A24 pMHC tetramers56 implying a degree of selectivity in the interaction. Staining for KIR3DL1 revealed its expression on CD27−CD8+ T-cells, with the highest frequency of KIR3DL1+ cells detected in the TEMRA population in a donor that exhibited strong Pre-TAME tetramer-binding (Fig. 7f). Co-staining with the A/PB1498–505 tetramer showed that all tetramer-binding CD8+ T-cells were positive for KIR3DL1, indicating that KIR3DL1 could potentially be binding to the tetramers (Fig. 7f). Blocking of KIR3DL1 prior to tetramer-staining markedly reduced the oversized population after TAME enrichment, to the levels of conventional tetramer+CD8+ T cell pools, revealing the true A24/PB1498-specific CD8+ T-cell population (Fig. 7g). Thus, much of the oversized population comprises tetramer-binding KIR3DL1+CD8+ T-cells with other TCR specificities. Future studies are needed to understand whether KIR3DL1 binding of peptide-HLA-A24 complexes are competing with TCR interactions to mount robust peptide-HLA-A24-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, thus impacting influenza-specific immunity in Indigenous and non-Indigenous HLA-A24-expressing people at risk of severe influenza disease.DiscussionIndigenous populations worldwide are highly affected by pandemic and, to a lesser degree, seasonal influenza disease. In line with previous studies57,58,59,60, our results show a high frequency of HLA-A24 allele expression in Indigenous populations in the Pacific region, an allele identified as an influenza mortality-associated allomorph27. In our cohort of Indigenous Australians, 36% of individuals expressed at least one HLA-A24 allele. With little understood about the nature of the HLA-A24-restricted influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell response, there was a need to identify the breadth of influenza CD8+ T-cell epitopes for this at-risk population. Our analysis of previously published epitopes revealed a small number of HLA-A24-restricted IAV epitopes reported as immunogenic targets, while no IBV targets for HLA-A24 were known. Our in-depth mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics approach defined the breadth of peptides presented by HLA-A*24:02 during IAV and IBV infection (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) and provided important insights into the characteristics of the associated CD8+ T-cell responses that could predispose to more severe influenza disease. It should be noted that the peptidomes identified by our approach are characteristic of C1R cells (derived from EBV-transformed B cells33), which constitutively express immunoproteasomes. Although the presence of reactive T cells confirms the relevance of identified peptides, there is a possibility that some immunogenic peptides may be missing from our analysis due to tissue-specific processing. Of the 52 peptides presented by HLA-A*24:02 during IAV infection, most mapped to PB2 (18 peptides, 35%) and PB1 (14 peptides, 27%) viral proteins, with no peptides originating from NA or M1. Consistent with this preference for PB2 and PB1 peptides, the CD8+ T-cell response in IAV-infected HHD-A24 mice focused mostly on four epitopes from PB1 (PB1216–222 and PB1498–505; 36% primary splenic response) and PB2 (PB2549–557 and PB2549–559; 31% primary splenic response). In HLA-A*24:02+ donors, memory responses to overlapping peptides PB1496/498–505 were consistently observed, while interesting differences were seen in the hierarchy of other epitope-specific responses, with Indigenous donors responding to PA649–658 and NP39–47, and non-Indigenous donors instead responding to the PB2549–557 peptide. Such differential response characteristics, possibly related to HLA co-expression or infection history, are important considerations for the design of T-cell vaccines for high-risk Indigenous populations. Importantly, CD8+ T-cells specific for the dominant A/PB1498–505 peptide were identified with an activated phenotype in the blood of patients with acute IAV infection and across different human tissues, including a population of TRM cells in the lung, providing evidence of their involvement in the influenza-specific response.Hertz et al. previously showed that HLA-A24 has a low targeting efficiency for conserved regions of the pH1N1 virus, which was indicative of low cross-reactive memory responses that may have contributed to the impaired pH1N1 CD8+ T-cell immunity observed in HLA-A24+ individuals during the 2009 pandemic27. Our data reveal that HLA-A24 presents a breadth of peptide ligands (52 peptides) derived from 6/8 IAV proteins. Notably, the variable HA and NA viral glycoproteins play a minimal role in HLA-A24-restricted CD8+ T-cell immunity to IAV. Instead, the focus on epitopes from PB1 and PB2 that are well conserved across virus strains circulating in South-East Asia and Australia suggests that the prominent HLA-A24-restricted CD8+ T-cell responses are likely to confer broad cross-reactive immunity to IAV. This is of key importance as the current T-cell vaccines in clinical trials focus mainly on structural proteins like NP, M1, and M2, and would therefore not elicit cross-protective CD8+ T-cell responses in HLA-A24+ individuals at risk of severe influenza disease.In contrast to IAV, the protein origins of IBV peptides presented by HLA-A24 differed greatly. From 48 IBV-derived presented peptides, the majority originated from NP (10, 21% of total), as well as HA (11, 23% of total) and NA (9, 19% of total with a total of 42% for surface glycoproteins). In terms of immunogenicity, our data from transgenic mice showed that the immunogenic HLA-A24-binding peptides were predominantly derived from NP (40% of response) and NA (40% of the response). More importantly, numbers of CD8+ T-cells directed towards our novel epitopes were preserved during the secondary IBV challenge, indicating optimal memory establishment and recall, which contrasted with the situation for the secondary IAV challenge. As in mice, HLA-A24-restricted influenza-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in Indigenous and non-Indigenous human donors were also targeted towards NP, with NP165–173 and NP164–173 being prominent CD8+ T-cell specificities alongside CD8+ T-cell epitopes derived from NA, HA, PB2, and PA (Table 3). The breadth of the HLA-A24-restricted IBV response highlights the power of identifying epitopes with our mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics approach and might explain, at least partially, why Indigenous populations have not been reported to be at risk from severe IBV disease. As for IAV, IBV epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells were activated during acute IBV infection in HLA-A24+ individuals and were found distributed across tissues including the lung in non-infected individuals.Broadly cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell responses that provide universal immunity across multiple strains or subtypes of influenza viruses have a crucial role in protection from severe influenza disease24. Here we demonstrate cross-reactive responses between IBV lineages for the B/NP165–173 peptide, as well as cross-reactive IAV/IBV responses between the A/PB2549–557 peptide and IBV PB2550–558 variants in HHD-A24 transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. 11) and humans. The A/PB2549–557 peptide is conserved between H3N2 and H1N1 IAVs61, and shares 55% amino acid identity with the cross-reactive IBV PB2550–558 variants. Structures of HLA-A24 with A/PB2549–557 and B/PB2550–558 showed that the antigen-binding cleft and both peptides adopted a similar conformation, providing a structural basis for T-cell cross-reactivity between these epitopes. Interestingly, IBV was more effective than IAV at expanding cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells, suggesting that infection history may play a role in determining patterns of cross-reactivity and that selection of peptide sequences that promote the greatest cross-reactivity is a consideration for universal influenza T-cell vaccines.Structural analysis of the overlapping peptides A/PB2549–557/559 and B/NP164/165–173 showed that despite the difference of only two or one amino acids in length respectively, these peptides each adopted different conformations with HLA-A24 and are likely to induce distinct TCR repertoires. In the case of B/NP164/165–173, responses to both peptides are equivalently immunodominant in HLA-A24+ individuals, providing breadth to the overall CD8+ T-cell response. However, only the A/PB2549–557 epitope showed immunogenicity in HLA-A24+ individuals, with the instability and bulged conformation of the longer A/PB2549–559 epitope potentially proving challenging for TCR recognition. Such intricacies in epitope presentation and CD8+ T-cell recognition offer opportunities to either maximize or tailor responses through vaccination.Our present study not only provides comprehensive data on generating CD8+ T-cell immunity against severe influenza disease in HLA-A24-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous people worldwide but also unravels three potential reasons why HLA-A24 has a role in disease susceptibility: (i) The antigenic origin of HLA-A24 IAV epitopes. The majority (62%) of IAV peptides presented by HLA-A24 are derived from PB1 and PB2, which is in stark contrast to previous studies in humans52,62,63,64 and mice65 showing that immunodominant peptides for other HLAs are derived predominantly from NP, PA, or M1. This is problematic for the current vaccine candidates in clinical trials which do not have a PB1 or PB2 component48,66,67, and also raises the question of whether PB1 or PB2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are equivalently robust and protective compared to immunodominant responses derived from NP, PA or M1 presented by other HLAs. (ii) Qualitative deficiencies in the HLA-A24 IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell response. In HHD-A24 mice, the magnitude and breadth of IAV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were greatly reduced during secondary IAV (but not IBV) challenge compared to primary infection, implicating possible functional defects at memory establishment or recall levels. (iii) Non-epitope-specific binding of peptide/HLA-A24 complexes to KIR. This can possibly limit TCR recognition and thus TCR-specific activation of influenza-specific CD8+ T-cells and could also provide an explanation for increased susceptibility to other infectious diseases such as sepsis and tuberculosis observed in Indigenous populations14,15. The above observations provide a platform for further investigations to understand the mechanisms driving a greater risk of severe influenza disease in HLA-A24+ individuals.Our findings provide important insights into the design of new T-cell-targeted vaccines and immunotherapy protocols to reduce influenza disease mortality and morbidity in Indigenous people globally. Current seasonal influenza vaccines are effective at inducing antibody responses to the currently circulating strains, however, they do not protect against newly emerging pandemic viruses68,69. It was shown previously that the inactivated influenza vaccines do not induce CD8+ T-cell immunity70. Given the potential that CD8+ T cells have to protect against pandemic influenza viruses18,20, vaccinations are clearly not harnessing the full power of the immune system, especially against pandemic viruses to which Indigenous populations are highly susceptible. Development of a vaccine that induces long-lasting broadly cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell immunity would provide at least some level of protection against distinct influenza variants, even strains with pandemic potential. Such a vaccine would minimize influenza-related deaths in global populations, especially high-risk groups, which includes HLA-A24-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. HHD-A24 transgenic mice are a valuable tool for identifying immunogenic epitopes following virus infection in an animal system in vivo. However, as there are limitations to using mono-chain HLA-transgenic mice, our study infers the immunogenic epitopes in the context of HLA-A24 allele in mice. These CD8+ T cells were, however, further screened and validated in human PBMCs across several peptides presented by all HLA molecules from a number of different HLA-A24+ donors. Thus, our comprehensive analysis of peptide presentation and immunogenicity defines the candidate IBV and IAV peptides needed for a CD8+ T-cell-targeting vaccine that is effective in HLA-A24+ individuals. Understanding how best to augment these key responses to confer stronger protective immunity is the next step.MethodsHuman blood and tissue samplesHuman experimental work was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and according to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice. All blood and tonsil donors provided written consent prior to study participation. Lung tissues, lymph node, and spleen samples were obtained from deceased organ donors after receiving written informed consent from next-of-kin. Lungs were sourced from the Alfred Hospital’s Lung Tissue Biobank. Lymph node and spleen were provided by DonateLife Victoria. Buffy packs were sourced from the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (West Melbourne, Australia). Human experimental work was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Ethics Committee (ID 1955465.2, 1443389.4, 1441452.1 and 1954302.1), the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood Ethics Committee (ID 2015#8), the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee (ID 280/14), Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (ID HREC/15/MonH/64, RMH local reference number 2016/196), HREC of Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research (ID 2012-1928) and Tasmanian Health and Medical HREC (ID H0017479). Human PBMCs and cells from tissues were isolated and cryopreserved as previously described70. Indigenous donors (LIFT) were recruited as described before26.HLA typing and analysis of human PBMCsNGS HLA typing for HLA class I and class II on genomic DNA isolated from granulocytes were performed by the Victorian Transplant and Immunogenetics Service (West Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Co-expression Circos plots were generated using R V.4.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), RStudio: Integrated Development for R (RStudio, Inc., Boston, USA), and the cyclize package71.Cell lines, viruses, and peptidesClass I-reduced (C1R) B-LCL express low levels of HLA-A and B, but normal levels HLA-C*04:0133,72. C1R.A24 cells were generated by transfecting C1R cells with HLA-A*24:02 in the pcDNA3.1(+)-hygro vector34. Cells were maintained in RF10 medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 55 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM HEPES buffer solution, 1 mM MEM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM l-glutamine, 100 U mL−1 penicillin, and 100 mg mL−1 streptomycin (purchased from Gibco/ThermoFisher Scientific)) with the addition of 0.3 mg mL−1 hygromycin-B (Life Technologies) for C1R.A24 cells. Influenza A (A/HKx31 & A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR8)) and B viruses (human, non-mouse adapted isolates; B/Malaysia/2506/04 & B/Phuket/3073/2013) were grown for 3 days at 35 °C in the allantoic cavity of 10 day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Viral titers were determined by performing semisolid overlay plaque assay on MDCK cells (ATCC). Influenza B viruses were kindly provided by Steve Rockman (Seqirus, Australia). Influenza peptides were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) with a purity > 80% and reconstituted at 1 mM in 100% DMSO. Cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma by PCR (Supplementary Table 7).Expansion of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T-cells from human PBMCCryopreserved PBMCs (3.3–5 × 106) from healthy non-LIFT and LIFT donors were used to expand antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells modified from Koutsakos et al.24. In brief, one-third of PBMCs were pulsed with a pool of up to 31 peptides (including circulating variants, Supplementary Table 4) at a total concentration of 10 µM at 37 °C in RPMI. After 1 h, cells were washed twice with RPMI and mixed with the remaining autologous PBMCs. To expand virus-specific CD8+ T-cells, infected C1R.A24 cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI to remove excess FCS and infected with A/HKx31 or B/Malaysia/2560/2004 at a MOI of 5 and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, RF10 was added and cells were incubated for further 11 h at 37 °C before cells were placed at 4 °C for 14 h. Infected C1R.A24 cells were washed twice to remove any residual virus and added at a 1:10 ratio to PBMCs. For additional stimulation, virus-expanded PBMCs were restimulated by the addition of virus-infected C1R.A24 cells on day 8 at a 1:10 ratio. Cells were then incubated for a total of 10–15 days in RF10 media with 10 U mL−1 of recombinant human IL-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) being added on day 4 and half-media changes every 1–2 days onwards.T-cell restimulation and intracellular cytokine stainingTo identify epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells that expanded after stimulation, cells from days 10–15 cultures (2 × 105 cells/well) of peptide-expanded PBMCs were mixed with peptide-pulsed C1R.A24 at a 1:3 ratio while virus-expanded PBMCs were restimulated by direct peptide addition (1 μM). Cells were incubated for 5 h in the presence of Brefeldin A (BD Golgi Plug), Monensin (BD Golgi Stop) and anti-CD107a FITC at 37 °C. Cells were stained with panel 2 (Supplementary Table 6) and analyzed using flow cytometry (BD Fortessa) and FlowJo v10 (BD).Large-scale infection for immunopeptidome analysisFor large-scale infections, C1R or C1R.A24 were cultured to high density in RF10 media slowly rotating in 17 dm2 filter-capped roller bottles (Corning) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were harvested and infected with influenza A or B virus at a MOI of 5 in RPMI at a density of 1 × 107 cells mL−1 in 50 mL tubes for 1 h at 37 °C with slow rotation. Infected cells were returned to roller bottles with the addition of 1:1 conditioned media:RF10 to a final density of 1.4 × 106 cells mL−1 and incubated a further 1–15 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, slow rotation). HLA expression and infection efficacy were validated by surface staining ~106 cells with anti-HLA class I PE-Cy7 (1:200 in PBS; clone w6/32, Biolegend, Cat# 311430; 30 min, 4 °C), prior to washing in PBS, fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde (ProSciTech) in PBS (20 min, room temperature), and intracellular staining with anti-NP FITC for influenza A (Clone 1331, GeneTex Cat# GTX36902) or influenza B (Clone H89B, ThermoFisher Cat# MA1- 7306) (1:200 in 0.3% saponin [Sigma] in PBS, 30 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed in PBS and acquired by flow cytometry using a BD LSRII flow cytometer running BD FACSDiva software, and analyzed using FlowJo_v10 (BD). The remaining cells were harvested by centrifugation in 500 mL V-bottom flasks (3283 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed in PBS, snap-frozen as cell pellets in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Uninfected cells were harvested and snap-frozen as for infected cells.LC–MS/MS analysis of HLA-bound peptidesCell pellets of 0.7–1.3 × 109 C1R or C1R.A24 were lysed via cryogenic milling (Retsch Mixer Mill MM 400), resuspension in 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with slow rotation. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation and HLA isolated by immunoaffinity purification using protein-A-agarose-bound antibodies as described35,73. Antibodies were either w6/32 (pan class I) alone or sequential DT9 (HLA-C specific), w6/32 (pan class I), and mixed class II (equal amounts LB3.1, SPV-L3 and B721, capturing HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP, respectively).Peptide/MHC complexes were dissociated and fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) as described24,35,74. 500 µL fractions were collected throughout the gradient, and the peptide containing fractions combined into 9 pools, vacuum-concentrated, and reconstituted in 15 µL 0.1% formic acid (Honeywell) in Optima™ LC-MS water. Reconstituted fraction pools were analyzed by LC–MS/MS using a SCIEX 5600+ TripleTOF mass spectrometer equipped with a Nanospray III ion source as previously described74.LC–MS/MS data analysisSpectra were searched against a proteome database consisting of the human proteome (UniProt/Swiss-Prot v2016_04), and either the A/X31 or the B/Malaysia/2506/2004 proteome plus a 6-reading frame translation of the viral genome, using ProteinPilot software (version 5.0, SCIEX), considering biological modifications and employing a decoy database to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR). Subsequent analyses were based on the best hypothesis for distinct peptides. Sequence motifs were generated utilizing peptides assigned at confidences greater than that required for a 5% FDR using Seq2logo2.075 (default settings). Likely HLA-A*24:02 binders were determined based on appearance across the experiments/antibodies and predicted binding (netMHCpan4.039,40,41). For peptides identified in their native form (and lacking Cys residues) that were synthesized for functional analysis, fragmentation patterns and retention times of representative spectra were compared to the synthetic and the quality of the match described (Supplementary Data 1).HLA-A*24:02 HHD mouse studiesAll mouse studies were overseen by the University of Melbourne Ethics Committee (#171408). HHD-A24 mice were generated by François Lemonnier as described previously42. These mice express a chimeric MHC-I that consists of the murine α3 and transmembrane domain and the human α1 and α2 domain covalently linked the human β2m. For mouse infections, 6–12 week-old mice were infected intranasally using a positive displacement pipette with 30 µL of either 100 pfu of A/X-31 or 200 pfu of B/Malaysia/2506/2004 in PBS under isoflurane anesthesia. For the secondary challenge, mice were infected 6–8 weeks after primary infection with 200 pfu of A/PR8 or 400 pfu B/Phuket/3073/2013. To identify immunogenic peptides, spleen and bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) were isolated on day 10 or day 8 for secondary infection, respectively. Spleen single-cell suspensions were prepared and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Affinipure Goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch)-coated panning plates to deplete B cell populations. BAL was combined from 3 to 5 mice to achieve sufficient T-cell numbers. Single-cell suspensions were then stimulated with peptide pools or single peptides at 1 µM in the presence of Brefeldin A (BD Golgi plug) for 5 h at 37 °C in RF10 with 10 U mL−1 IL-2 followed by staining with panel 1 (Supplementary Table 6). Cells were analyzed using BD Fortessa and FlowJo v10 (BD). For immunization studies, mice were vaccinated with 30 nmol of NA32–40, NP392–400 and NP165–173 emulsified in complete (Prime) or incomplete (Boost) Freund’s adjuvant. 50 μL vaccine was injected on both sides at the base of the tail. Control mice were injected emulsified adjuvant without peptides. Two weeks after prime, mice were boosted and challenged with 1 × 103 pfu B/Malaysia/2506/2004 intranasally 7 days after boost. On days 6 and 7, after infection lungs were isolated to determine viral load with a plaque assay as described before76.Detection of cytokines in BAL using a cytometric bead arrayCytokine concentrations in the BAL were detected using the BD Cytometric Bead Array Mouse enhanced sensitivity master buffer kit (Cat#: 562248) as per the manufacturer’s instruction. Data were acquired using BD FACS Canto II and analyzed by FCAP Array software (Soft Flow Inc. Pecs, Hungary).Protein expression, purification, and crystallizationSoluble HLA-A*24:02 heterodimers containing either A/PB2549–557, A/PB2549–559, B/PB2549–557, B/NP165–173, or B/NP164–173 peptide were prepared as follows. A truncated HLA-A*24:02 construct encompassing the extracellular part of the HLA molecule (residues 1–276), and human beta-microglobulin (β2 m) were expressed separately in a BL21-pLyS Escherichia coli strain as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were subsequently extracted, washed, and resuspended into a solution containing 6 M guanidine. Each pHLA complex was then refolded into a cold refolding solution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 mM Na-EDTA, 400 mM l-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5 mM reduced glutathione) by adding 30 mg of HLA heavy chain, 20 mg of β2 m and 4 mg of peptide. The refolding solution was then dialyzed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and the protein was purified by a succession of affinity column chromatography.Crystallization, data collection, and structure determinationCrystals of the pHLA-A*24:02 complexes were grown by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method at 20 °C with a proteineservoir drop ratio of 1:1 with seeding at a concentration of 6 mg mL−1 in the following with conditions: A/PB2549–557: 20% PEG3350, 0.2 M Na acetate; PB2549–559: 24% PEG8K, 0.1 HEPES pH 7.5, 5% v/v Ethyl acetate; B/PB2549–557: 24% PEG8K, 0.1 HEPES pH 7.5, 2% isopropanol, 5% w/v PolyvinylpyrrolidoneK15; B/NP165–173: 19% 3350, 0.2 MgCl2; NP164–173: 20% PEG8K, 0.2 MgCl2, 0.1 Tris-HCl pH 8.5. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing mother liquor solution with the PEG concentration increased to 30% (w/v) and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The data were collected on the MX1 and MX2 beamlines77. Manual model building was conducted using the Coot software78 followed by maximum-likelihood refinement with the Buster program79. The final models were validated using the Protein Data Bank validation website and the final refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. The final models were deposited in the PDB with the accession codes: 7JYU (HLA-A*A2402-NP 164-173); 6XQA (HLA-A*24:02-PB2549-557B); 7JYV (HLA-A*A2402-NP 165-173); 7JYW (HLA-A*24:02-PB2549-557); 7JYX (HLA-A*24:02-PB2549-559). All molecular graphics representations were created using PyMol80.Thermal stability assayThermal shift assays were performed to determine the stability of each pHLA-A*24:02 complex using fluorescent dye Sypro orange to monitor protein unfolding. The thermal stability assay was performed in the Real Time Detection system (Corbett RotorGene 3000), originally designed for PCR. Each pHLA complex was in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, at two concentrations (5 and 10 mM) in duplicate, was heated from 25 to 95 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 555 nm. The Tm, or thermal melt point, represents the temperature for which 50% of the protein is unfolded.Tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment in humansTAME was performed on PBMCs (7.5 × 106–2.7 × 108) of healthy, IAV- or IBV-infected donors, as well as lymphocytes isolated from tonsils, lung, and pancreatic lymph nodes (panLN) to detect CD8+ T-cells specific for IAV and IBV. pMHC-I monomers were made in-house81 and conjugated at an 8:1 molar ratio to PE- or APC-labeled streptavidin (SA) to generate tetramers. Cells were FcR-blocked for 15 min on ice and stained with APC or PE-conjugated tetramers at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h at RT, washed twice then incubated with anti-PE and anti-APC MicroBeads (Milenty Biotec). Unenriched, flow-through, and enriched fractions were surface stained with panel 3 (PBMC) or 4 (SLO and lung) (Supplementary Table 6). After 30 min staining on ice, cells were fixed for 20 min in 1% PFA and acquired by flow cytometry. In some experiments, KIR3DL1 blocking was achieved by the addition of anti-human NKB1 antibody (clone DX9, Cat 555964, BD Pharmingen) at 1:50 during the FcR-blocking step.Single-cell mRNAseqA/PB1498–505+ CD8+ T-cells were single-cell sorted into 96 well plates containing lysis buffer (1 µL RNase inhibitor and 19 µL Triton X-100) after TAME on a BD Aria III sorter. Libraries were generated as described previously24. A Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit was used for the generation of sequencing libraries and sequencing performed on a NextSeq500 platform with 150-base par high-output paired-end chemistry for 30 tetramer+ cells/donor (120 cells total).Bioinformatical analysisThe quality of scRNA-seq was assessed with FastQC. TopHat2 with default parameters was used to align sequences to the Ensembl GRCh38 reference genome. A total of 112 out of 120 analyzed cells passed quality control and was used for further analysis. Gene expression was quantified utilizing Cufflinks suit (v 2.2.1) where FPKM was assessed using CuffQuant and values normalized based on total mRNA content with CuffNorm. Clustering was performed utilizing SC382. Each gene has been assessed for the accuracy of predicting the 3 clusters using its expression level. The accuracy of the prediction has been measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Furthermore, a p-value has been calculated using the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Pheatmap in R was used to visualize Heatmaps.Statistical analysesStatistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism (v8.4.2, Graphpad, USA). Non-parametric unpaired data was analyzed performing Mann–Whitney test whereas paired data was analyzed with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Two-tailed analysis was performed with p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**) indicated.Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.

The study evaluated the community burden and transmission of influenza (flu) from 2017 to 2018 in a rural and an urban South Africa community.Approximately 100 households, randomly selected from a rural and an urban setting in South Africa, were enrolled each year and observed for a period of 10 months. The data was collected through systematic twice-weekly nasopharyngeal sampling of all household members and samples were tested for the presence of influenza by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 81,430 samples were collected from 1,116 participants in 225 households, of which, 917 (1%) tested positive for influenza and 79% of households (178/225) had ≥1 influenza-positive individual.The study revealed that the burden of laboratory-confirmed flu was high in a rural and an urban African setting, with over three-quarters of households and more than one in three individuals experiencing at least one flu infection each year. It is important to note that the flu incidence risk was similar between the rural and urban areas who participated in the study. Interestingly, repeated flu infections within the same annual flu epidemic, particularly in children, were a common occurrence in more than 15% of those infected. With young children also experiencing the highest burden of flu infection and symptomatic illness. This group was more likely to spread the flu to others in their household, in comparison to other age groups.The study furthermore revealed that just over half of the flu infections were symptomatic, indicating that a high number of asymptomatic flu infections were present. Asymptomatic individuals were also able to spread flu, transmitting the flu to approximately 6% of household contacts. For this reason, authors of the study believe asymptomatic infections to be an important driver of flu transmission.Medically attended influenza-associated influenza like illness (ILI), defined as a fever and cough as captured by the World Health Organization-recommended flu surveillance programs, suggest that the flu disease burden in the community may be substantially higher than that observed through facility-based surveillance. Understanding the community burden and transmission of seasonal influenza is critical to guide vaccination programmes and non-pharmaceutical interventions, not to mention informing pandemic preparedness.In conclusion, the study provides important data on the community burden of flu and transmission thereof in an African setting, a topic that hasn’t been adequately explored. It also contributes important findings relating to symptomatic and asymptomatic flu transmissions, and has implications for the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination strategies that target children.A similar study to examine the burden and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the same communities including the role of asymptomatic infections in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was initiated in July 2020 and results of this study are expected in the coming months.READ FULL STUDY HERE For more information, contact Professor Cheryl Cohen: CherylC@nicd.ac.za Diseases A-Z Index A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U W V X Y Z RECENT POSTS National HIV Drug Resistance Surveillance Among Adults with Viral Non-Suppression in South Africa November 5, 2024 Countries have meticulously designed and implemented antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs to control the human Read More » Mosquito Season in Southern Africa: Tonic Water and Vitamins Won’t Protect You but Knowing Where the Hotspots are Will November 5, 2024 While the emergence of colourful butterflies is a welcome sign of summer, the constant Read More » Measles and Rubella Monthly Surveillance Report (Oct 2024) October 23, 2024 From epidemiological week 1 to week 41 of 2024, 339 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles Read More » SHARE Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on linkedin Facebook Instagram Linkedin Twitter Youtube Quick Links M&E Dashboard Publications Vacancies Researcher Directory Terms and Conditions Download NMC Android App Huawei App Web Portal Apple App Connect with our Researchers Contact Us © NICD 2023.

Avian influenza (AI) outbreaks occur most years in the winter months. These vary in pathogenicity and in species affected according to the type of influenza virus in each outbreak. Wild birds are often vectors or reservoirs for these influenza strains and so represent a constant potential source of virus to captive birds and people. Disease control centres primarily on preventing such transmission. Therefore falconry can be seen as a potentially significant route in that it is a planned interaction between captive and wild birds and close contact between raptor and human is also present. How significant is the risk? Falconry is listed by UNESCO as part of our intangible culture as it has been practised worldwide for many centuries. In this practice it has been performed as both sport and as a means of hunting for the pot. It involves the training of a raptor to perform its natural hunting skills under the “control” of a falconer while also working with other members of the “team”- dogs, ferrets, etc. The type of game taken by the bird will be set by the type of raptor: falcons take aerial prey while hawks and eagles will more often be used for ground prey. AI is a problem in the UK most winters; the virus prefers cold, damp conditions and there is a reservoir of, mainly low-pathogenic, strains in the wild birds, especially gulls and waterfowl. This reservoir allows transmission of virus between areas as birds migrate, as well as a mixing pot of virus potentially allowing evolution/ mutation of the strains. And, of course, different strains will have differing pathogenicities in different species. Therefore falconry birds are at risk of being infected if used for hunting or if fed infected birds. This is borne out by wild studies showing more seroconversion in wild falcons, hunting gulls and waterfowl than in smaller species that hunt songbirds (where AI is less prevalent). However, these birds clearly survive infection and, in general raptors are fairly resistant to many strains of AI (this is not always the case- in recent years one strain seemed to particularly affect wild raptors and corvids rather than its usual host range). Some evidence for this is shown by a study in Germany during a recent outbreak of highly pathogenic AI. This showed that although a reasonable number of caught birds were seropositive for AI, none of the raptors were and, importantly, none of the falconers. In other words, though the birds contacted AI-positive prey they did not vector it or suffer overt disease. However, sampling was done immediately after capture and the falcons did not feed on the carcases. There may just not have been sufficient interaction to contract infection! Could feeding result in infection? Falcons tend to be whole-carcase feeders and the wild raptor study described earlier did show raptors are infected feeding on infected prey. So if a falcon is flown at gulls, waterfowl or other susceptible species, it is probably best not to let it feed on the carcase after the kill. In addition, feeding of wild carcases to raptors is still a relatively common practice: not just captured prey, but wild birds that have been shot by the falconer or collected roadkill. This represents clear risk of disease and not just AI: Chlamydia, herpesvirus, mycobacteria, E coli and a variety of parasites may be ingested from eating apparently well birds. Some may be inactivated by freezing carcases before feeding (this is also a common practice) but many are not including AI which is capable of surviving over a year in frozen tissues! Weighing up the risks So, overall, the risk of disease in captive raptors is low but definitely present: also present is the risk of exposing the virus to a new host immune system and encouraging development of new strains while in close contact with falconers. While feeding of wild carcases may seem cost-effective and enriching for the bird, it may be there is too high a potential for disaster; boring food may be better food, and it is well worth avoiding potential carriers of AI when it is known to be present in the country.

The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing influenza burden imposed on intensive care units (ICUs) in a catchment population during recent influenza seasons. From 2008 to 2013, all adult patients admitted with a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection to one of the ICUs in the catchment area were prospectively included. A total of 201 patients (mean age: 63 ± 16, sex-ratio: 1.1) were included. The influenza-related ICU-bed occupancy rate averaged 4.3% over the five influenza seasons, with the highest mean occupancy rate (16.9%) observed during the 2012 winter. In-hospital mortality for the whole cohort was 26%. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm infections (pdm in the mentioned nomenclature refers to Pandemic Disease Mexico 2009), encountered in 51% of cases, were significantly associated with neither longer length of stay nor higher mortality (ICU and hospital) when compared to infections with other virus subtypes. SOFA score (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29) was the only independent factor significantly associated with a prolonged hospitalization. These results highlight both the frequency and the severity of influenza-associated critical illness, leading to a sustained activity in ICUs. Severity of the disease, but not A(H1N1)pdm virus, appears to be a major determinant of ICU burden related to influenza.

Young people, elderly or those with an underlying medical condition are more likely to develop serious forms of the disease2. Influenza infections cause exacerbations of chronic diseases as well as specific complications such as severe viral pneumonia, leading to substantial increase in hospital admission and deaths2,3,4.In addition to annual winter epidemics, influenza viruses also cause recurring and unpredictable pandemics2,5. The 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic specifically affected young populations without major comorbidity and therefore attracted much attention from the public and policy-makers6. Abundant medical literature has borne witness to this newsworthy 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. As a consequence, considerable human, economic and scientific resources were mobilized13. Bed-occupancy rate was a sensitive topic, including in the intensive care units (ICUs) which were in the front line for the management of severe influenza-infected patients. However, since the end of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, reports on the impact of influenza in ICUs during subsequent outbreaks remain scarce.Here, we present a multicenter prospective study of critically ill influenza-infected patients in a catchment population between 2008 and 2013, i.e. before, during and after the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Thus, the aim of the present work was to report the reality of influenza-associated critical illness and to identify factors associated with influenza burden in ICUs.MethodsThe study was performed in compliance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and according to French laws. The ethics committee, Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est II, approved this multicentric prospective non-interventional study (Reference number: CAL N° 2012–024). This Institutional Review board waived the need for informed consent given the observational nature of the study.Study designThis study was conducted from December 2008 to April 2013 in the large Lyon catchment area in France (534 km2; 1.3 million inhabitants). Unspecialized medical and surgical ICUs of the 12 centers (154 beds) that usually receive influenza patients in this area participated in the study. Five periods were defined based on the five influenza winter epidemics of the Northern hemisphere, according to the French surveillance network (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) in the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region. Prospective inclusions started from the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic while data from winter 2008 were retrospectively collected.All adult patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to the ICU with influenza infection were included. Virological diagnoses of influenza were made using specific Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed on either nasopharyngeal swab specimens (for non-intubated patients) or bronchoalveolar lavage samples (for intubated patients). RT-PCR was also used for virus subtyping. By default, serological analysis using hemagglutination inhibition and complement fixation tests could be performed to confirm influenza infection.Data collectionFor each patient, the following characteristics were recorded: demographics, vaccination for influenza (within the current year), life-expectancy using the McCabe and Jackson scale 14. Severe obesity was defined as a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2. The time course of the acute illness and the reason for hospitalization were both collected upon ICU admission. Severity of illness was assessed using both the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and the highest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score during ICU stay15,16. The SOFA score at ICU admission was also used to compare patients’ characteristics according to in-hospital length of stay. Organ supports were also recorded; diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was made in accordance with the 1994 American-European consensus-conference17.Mortality was evaluated at day-28, and at both ICU and hospital discharge. Lengths of stay in the ICU and in-hospital were also collected. The ICU bed occupancy rate by Influenza-infected patients was computed as the number of beds occupied by influenza-infected patients divided by the total number of beds available in the participating centers.Statistical analysisValues are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or number (%), as appropriate. Univariate comparisons were performed using Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data and Chi-2 or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical data, as appropriate. The independent contribution of parameters available at time of admission and during ICU stay to the in-hospital length of stay was analyzed using a backward stepwise multivariate analysis in a logistic regression model. In-hospital length of stay was dichotomized according to the median value. Following univariate analysis, all variables with p ≤ 0.10, as well as age, sex and A(H1N1)pdm viral subtype, were included in the logistic regression model. Potentially confounding factors were eliminated if p values were > 0.10. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Statistical calculations were performed using Medcalc Statistical Software version 12.1.2 for windows (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsDuring the study period, 201 patients met the inclusion criteria. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the patients for the five influenza seasons. In this population, 124 (62%) patients were over 60 years old. The whole cohort included 29 (14%) obese patients, two (1.0%) health care workers and two (1.0%) pregnant women. Patients were significantly younger in 2009 than those hospitalized during other influenza seasons (54 ± 14 versus 65 ± 16 years old, respectively, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with ARDS was constant over time, with resort to Extra-Corporeal Membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during 2009 and 2010 winters only (Table 1). Also, no significant difference in the severity of patients’ illness was observed over the study period.Table 1 Patients’ characteristics.Full size tableIn agreement with the French influenza surveillance system, a wide majority of influenza infections were caused by type A influenza virus (171/201, 85%), with half of all patients infected by A(H1N1)pdm subtype (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm virus, in comparison with those infected by other virus subtypes, were more often males (sex-ratio 1.6 versus 0.8, respectively) and a younger population. These two subgroups of patients didn’t significantly differ according to the severity of the illness (Table 3) or the use of organ supports (data not shown).Table 2 Virological data.Full size tableTable 3 Clinical data and outcomes according to virus subtype.Full size tableOutcomes are presented over time (Table 1), as well as according to virus subtype (Table 3). In total, 148 (74%) patients were discharged alive from hospital. Both mortality rates and lengths of stay were not significantly different when 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic was compared to other influenza seasons (Table 1). Also, there was no influence of virus subtype regarding in-hospital outcomes (Table 3).Throughout the study period, overall incidence of influenza-related ICU admission averaged 3.1 cases per 100,000 person-years. The curve of weekly ICU bed-occupancy by influenza-infected patients almost matched with the epidemic periods (Fig. 1). ICU bed-occupancy rate for these patients averaged 4.3% over the five influenza seasons. The highest mean occupancy rate (16.9%), observed during 2012 winter, was significantly higher than those noticed during previous epidemics (p < 0.05). Interestingly, for the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic, the peak of ICU bed-occupancy didn’t exceed 9.9%. Of note, from 2008 to 2012, the weekly peak incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of emergency room visits for influenza-like illness in France was 615, 868, 754, 452 and 770, respectively (www.sentiweb.fr). When regarding factors influencing in-hospital length of stay (Table 4), only the SOFA score was independently associated with a prolonged hospitalization (OR per point, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29; p = 0.005).Figure 1Weekly rate of ICU bed occupancy by Influenza-infected patients. At the peak of ICU activity, bed occupancy by Influenza-infected patients stayed below 10% during each epidemic period (blue bar), except during 2012 winter.Full size imageTable 4 Patients’ characteristics according to in-hospital length of stay.Full size tableDiscussionThe present study, conducted over five recent influenza seasons in a specific territory, reports the reality of ICU exposition to influenza disease. Our data emphasize the gravity of severe forms of the disease, responsible for a sustained activity in ICUs during epidemic periods. Organ failures, but not A(H1N1)pdm virus, appear to be major determinants of ICU burden related to influenza.Influenza is the most common cause of acute infectious respiratory illness affecting between 2 and 3 million people worldwide each year2. Influenza-associated critical illness hospitalizations (between 5 and 19% of all hospitalizations for flu) have significantly increased over the past decades, including the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic3,4. Since this pandemic, the reality for patients with severe forms of influenza remains poorly documented. Thus, we designed the present study to provide current information on influenza disease in ICUs in the real-life setting of a specific territory. The incidence for influenza-associated hospitalizations in ICUs observed over a five-year period (3.1 per 100,000 person-years) was of the same magnitude as those also exhaustively reported in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 and 2010: 3.5 and 1.1 admissions in ICU per 100,000 persons-years, respectively 13. ICU bed-occupancy rate by Influenza-infected patients is another parameter of interest in our comprehensive study, with a mean occupancy rate of 4.3% over the study period. The peak of ICU activity in 2009 winter only reached 9.9%. This proportion is well under the 15% critical threshold sometimes used to consider modifications in hospital admission policy, bed availability and/or cancellation of scheduled surgical activities18.The occurrence of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic has turned the spotlight on the influenza disease. In response to the high level of media attention attracted by this pandemic, medical attitudes and practices towards influenza virus infections have changed12. This work is in line with this renewed interest for influenza and gives a snapshot of the influenza disease in ICUs by providing data before, during and after the pandemic. With so few influenza-infected patients during the 2008 winter, our study confirms the unrecognized burden of influenza-associated critical illness before the pandemic. Rapid influenza testing, such as RT-PCR, now helps physicians to reduce the number of undiagnosed forms of the disease19. Strikingly, our longitudinal study gives an original view on the last pandemic, which did not appear to be any different from other influenza seasons with regards to ICU activity, patient characteristics (except for age) and illness severity and outcomes. Only a few studies have previously compared the 2009 pandemic to other seasonal outbreaks13,20,21,22,23. Among them, the only one conducted in ICUs from Australia and New Zealand was coherent with our results, with no difference in outcome when the 2009 pandemic was compared to the 2010 influenza season13. With regards to the influence of virus type, our study does not confirm the negative impact of A(H1N1)pdm virus subtype on patients’ outcomes or specific workload in ICU. This results is in apparent discrepancy with reports that showed an association between A(H1N1)pdm infections and an increased risk of complications or deaths20,21,23,24. This finding might be partly explained by a lowered virulence of the subtype in the years following the pandemic25. In summary, the present study supports the idea of a relatively mild pandemic, with limited impact on influenza-related ICU activity.Our study does present some limitations. First, data were only prospectively collected starting from the 2009 pandemic. We, however, chose to include data from the winter of 2008 in order to highlight the enhanced awareness towards influenza since the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic. Second, the comprehensiveness of our work could be argued. Indeed, it cannot be excluded that some influenza-infected patients were not accounted for during inter-epidemic seasons. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the number of these patients is probably negligible during these periods26. Third, our work focused on the short-term burden of critically ill influenza-infected patients although it is well established that such severe patients require resources over a prolonged period, which exceed initial hospitalization. Thus, further studies are needed to determinate the long-term workload of critically-ill influenza infected patients, especially among elderly people. Also, the too small samples’ size to perform multivariable analyses with mortality as outcome remains a lack in the study. Finally, our results only reflect the reality of influenza-associated critical burden in the Lyon catchment area; any transposition to another territory remains uncertain. In this way, the relatively small size of the study may question the representativeness of the sample and whether the study was sufficiently powered to detect meaningful differences between influenza seasons. Larger national or international data analyses are probably needed to definitely address this question.ConclusionsThis real-life study focuses on influenza-associated critical illness over five seasons. In a French catchment population, the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic does not appear to have a greater influence on influenza-related ICU activity and patients’ outcomes than subsequent seasons. Since the last pandemic, ICU bed-occupancy by influenza-infected patients during outbreaks have remained high, most likely due to an enhanced awareness towards influenza disease. Severity of the disease, but not A(H1N1)pdm virus, seems to have a key role in the ICU burden related to influenza.

How to cocoon your newborn babyFor nine months, give or take a week or two, protecting a baby from influenza germs is easy. Snug and safely sealed off in his cozy uterine cocoon, your little one can’t catch the flu from coughers at the market or the mall, or from family members who try to grab those tiny hands before they’ve washed their own — in fact, he can’t even catch it from you.Fast forward to your baby’s life outside the womb — especially the first six months, before he can be safely immunized against the flu — and that can be a different story, and a bit of a scary one. Once he takes in those first breaths of air, or touches those first surfaces, or has those tiny hands squeezed and kissed by visitors who come bearing germs along with their gifts, flowers and balloons, your baby is vulnerable to the flu and other viruses.And due to his brand new, still-untested immune system, he’s especially vulnerable to serious complications from the flu, which can be life-threatening.There may be times when you’ll wish you could keep your brand new baby in a bubble (or pop him back into your belly for safe-keeping), particularly during flu season. But happily, there’s another, more practical and effective way to protect your precious bundle from the flu, starting even before he’s born: cocooning.What is cocooning?Cocooning simply means surrounding your newborn baby in a circle of protection against illness and diseases. When everyone in your baby’s “circle” is up-to-date on their own vaccinations, they form a cocoon that helps keep your little one protected from vaccine-preventable infections like the flu, whooping cough and others, as well as COVID-19.How to cocoon your newborn babyGet a flu shot for twoThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) strongly recommend that all pregnant women receive a flu vaccine as early in the flu season as possible, for a few very compelling reasons. Continue Reading Below Read This Next How to Potty Train Your Baby Video: Better Sleep for Baby 5 Things We All Need to Unlearn About Maternity Leave How to Potty Train Your Baby Video: Better Sleep for Baby 5 Things We All Need to Unlearn About Maternity Leave First of all, your immune system changes during pregnancy, putting you at greater risk of catching the flu — and a more serious case of it at that. Pregnancy also puts you at increased risk of complications from flu, including pneumonia and dehydration, and can lead to hospitalization and even preterm labor and delivery. A high fever, common with the flu, is also especially dangerous during pregnancy.Happily, a flu shot makes it much less likely that you’ll come down with the flu and far less likely that you’ll develop complications if you do end up catching it.Another significant perk of the flu shot for two? Studies show that babies whose moms received the flu shot during pregnancy may be half as likely to catch the flu once they’re born, and that the protection may last several months. Plus, the flu shot is considered safe for mom and baby during pregnancy. (If for some reason you didn’t get the flu shot during pregnancy, get one during the first two weeks postpartum — not only to make sure you don’t catch flu and pass it on to your baby, but to protect against flu complications you’ll still be susceptible to.)Get a flu shot for the whole crew, tooEveryone over 6 months old who will be spending time around your baby on a regular basis — and preferably those who will be stopping by for a quick snuggle, too — should get the flu shot. That goes for parents, of course, but also siblings, grandparents and other family members, as well as babysitters and other caregivers.Since it takes two weeks for the flu shot to become protective, make sure everyone plans to roll up their sleeves ahead of baby’s arrival.Add an extra layer of protection with preventionThe flu shot is very effective, but doesn’t prevent every case of flu (though vaccinated people who do end up getting the flu usually get a mild case). So it’s important to include other tried-and-true methods of protecting your baby (and yourself) against the flu and other illnesses, including the following:Washing your hands frequently and having others around your baby do so too (particularly important before holding your new arrival)Using tissues to blow noses and catch sneezes, throwing used tissues in the trash immediately and following up with handwashingAvoiding super crowded places (more important than ever during the pandemic), especially during cold and flu seasonPracticing social distancingWearing a face mask when out in public. To improve the fit of your mask and prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC now recommends double-masking, such as by wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask.Keeping anyone you suspect might have a cold or the flu away from your newbornIf you think you might have caught the flu while you’re pregnant or as a new parent, or if your baby seems to have flu-like symptoms, call the doctor right away to get a proper diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.Boost baby’s immune system by breastfeeding if you canBreastfeeding itself doesn’t prevent flu and isn’t a substitute for a flu vaccine (or any vaccine). But it can boost a baby’s immune system — reducing the risk of catching bugs of all kinds and possibly lowering the chances of complications when a baby does get sick. By the way, the flu shot is considered safe for breastfeeding moms and babies.Get baby a flu shot once he's old enoughOnce your baby has reached the 6-month mark, he should get his first dose of flu vaccine as early in flu season as possible. He (like all children 8 and under getting their first flu shot) will need a second dose four weeks after the first dose.The flu shot is one of the best ways to “cocoon” your baby in a circle of protection, helping keep him safe and healthy right from the beginning — in fact, even before the beginning. If you have any questions or concerns, check in with your pediatrician.

However, the influence of these viruses on disease outcome when both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 are present in the host remains unclear. Using a mammalian model, sequential infection was performed in ferrets and in K18-hACE2 mice, with SARS-CoV-2 infection following H1N1. We found that co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 extended the duration of clinical manifestation of COVID-19, and enhanced pulmonary damage, but reduced viral shedding of throat swabs and viral loads in the lungs of ferrets. Moreover, mortality was increased in sequentially infected mice compared with single-infection mice. Compared with single-vaccine inoculation, co-inoculation of PiCoVacc (a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) and the flu vaccine showed no significant differences in neutralizing antibody titers or virus-specific immune responses. Combined immunization effectively protected K18-hACE2 mice against both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings indicated the development of systematic models of co-infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, which together notably enhanced pneumonia in ferrets and mice, as well as demonstrated that simultaneous vaccination against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective prevention strategy for the coming winter.

Furthermore, the pathogenesis and receptors of these two viruses responsible for causing pneumonia are different4; the influenza infection affects the in upper respiratory tract while the SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily attacks the lower respiratory tract. Hence, there is no receptor competition, and sequential viral infection occurs without any difficulty. However, there is still no information about the consequences and mechanism of this sequential infection.5,6,7,8,9,10Respiratory viruses are highly prevalent during the winter. Sequential infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A, particularly the H1N1 virus, aggravates the patient’s condition, resulting in enormous difficulty in preventing and controlling the epidemic.5,6,7,9 This issue had attracted widespread attention. The key is to establish appropriate animal models for evaluating the possibility of sequential infection, investigate the consequences of sequential infection, and identify effective preventive measures.In this study, ferrets and K18-hACE2 mice, which are susceptible to both influenza and SARS-CoV-2,11,12 were used to establish animal models of sequential infection to investigate the consequences and pathogenesis of sequential infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Further investigation and evaluation were conducted on K18-hACE2 mice to determine the effectiveness of PiCoVacc (a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine),13 the flu vaccine, and a combined vaccine, and to validate the immune interference response in mice with combination immunization. A study on effective immunization strategy would provide foundational insights for the prevention and control of an epidemic.ResultsInitial infection with H1N1 aggravates pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in ferretsTo investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection following the initial H1N1 infection, 18 adult ferrets were randomly divided into three groups. Six ferrets (F/FC1~6) were inoculated intranasally with H1N1 stock virus at 106 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 at the same dose at 5 days post-primary infection (dpi). Six ferrets were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (F/C1~6) at 106 TCID50, and six ferrets were inoculated with H1N1 (F/F1~6) at 106 TCID50 as single-infection control groups. The maximum weight loss (Fig. 1b) was 9.98% at 5 dpi, and the highest body temperature (Fig. 1c) was 41.85 °C at 3 dpi in the F/F group. The changes in body temperature and weight loss of F/C ferrets fluctuated within the normal range. However, in the F/FC group, body temperature fluctuated between 37.80 and 41.81 °C, and the maximum weight loss was 9.08% at 8 dpi (3 days post reinfection (dpr)), significantly different compared to the F/C group (Fig. 1b, c). The highest clinical score among F/F ferrets reached a peak value of 3, at 5–6 dpi, though the F/C ferrets did not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms (Fig. 1d). Notably, the highest clinical score in the F/FC group lasted for 3 days, between 6 and 8 dpi (1–3 dpr). The duration of clinical signs in the F/FC group was significantly increased compared with the F/C groups (Fig. 1d, right panel).Fig. 1Clinical findings of co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets. a Experimental design and sample collection. Eighteen ferrets were used in this study. Six ferrets were inoculated intranasally with H1N1 (1 × 106 TCID50) and rechallenged intranasally with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 (F/FC group, n = 6). The remaining ferrets were intranasally challenged with H1N1 (F/F group, n = 6) or SARS-CoV-2 (F/C group, n = 6) as control groups. Infected ferrets were observed for changes in body weight (b), body temperature (c), and clinical symptoms (d) at the indicated time points. Significant differences are indicated with asterisks (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01; Student’s t test)Full size imageWe next determined the viral RNA loads in the throat swabs during the 10 days after infection. H1N1 viral RNA in throat swabs reached the highest levels (106.71 copies/ml) at 3 dpi. Viral shedding was detected at 8 dpi in F/F ferrets; however, viral shedding from throat swabs of two ferrets in the F/FC group lasted until 10 dpi (Fig. 2a). In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding in the throat swabs of one F/C group ferret lasted until 8 dpi (viral loads:103.83 copies/ml); however, there were no SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA loads detected at 8 dpr in the F/FC group, indicating that F/FC ferrets had reduced duration of viral shedding from throat swabs compared with the F/C group (Fig. 2b). At 5 dpi, four ferrets from these three groups were randomly euthanized for viral RNA detection and histopathological observation. Average SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were observed in lung tissue in the F/C ferrets (103.63 copies/ml in the upper left lobe and 103.69 copies/ml in the upper right lobe, on average); however, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the upper left lobe of the F/FC animals was 103.28 copies/ml on average, and no viral RNA in the upper right lobe was detected from the F/FC animals (Fig. 2c, left panel); moreover, the average viral load in the entire lung in the F/FC animals was significantly decreased compared with that in the F/C group (Fig. 2c, right panel), suggesting that sequential H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibited the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets. Histopathological analyses revealed enlargement of the alveolar septum and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissues in both the F/F and F/C groups. Important differences included a greater broadening of the alveolar septum in the F/C group (Fig. 3a, middle panel), and more fulminant necrotizing and hemorrhagic pneumonia in the F/F group (Fig. 3a, left panel). However, lung tissues showed more severe necrotizing pneumonia, especially in the epithelial cells of the bronchi, greater inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar interstitium, and fibrin exudation in the alveolar cavities at 5 dpi in the F/FC ferrets, indicating that co-infection enhanced the development of pneumonia (Fig. 3a, right panel). Immunofluorescence staining for SARS-CoV-2 S protein and H1N1 HA protein demonstrated that a few alveolar epithelial cells were infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 3b, middle panel) and some aggregated alveolar epithelial cells were infected by the H1N1 virus (Fig. 3b, left panel), respectively. Consistent with the pathological observation, at 5 dpi(r) in the F/FC ferrets, the expression of both viruses was observed in the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3b, right panel).Fig. 2Viral characteristics following co-infection with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets. a Viral RNA loads of H1N1 from throat swabs were detected by qRT–PCR (n = 6). b Viral RNA loads of SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs were detected by qRT–PCR (n = 6). c Viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was measured in individual lung lobes of infected ferrets (n = 4).

Black bar = 100 μm, white bar = 50 μmFull size imageCo-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 accelerated mortality in K18-hACE2 miceTo further investigate the effect of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection on SARS-CoV-2-sensitive humans, K18-hACE2 mice were used in this study.12 Study design and longitudinal sampling schedule are shown in Fig. 4a. After inoculation with the H1N1 virus (K18/F group) at 103 TCID50, weight loss was observed from 1 to 9 dpi. One mouse recovered by ~9 dpi, the peak H1N1 RNA loads in the lungs of infected mice was 107.13 copies/ml at 7 dpi (Fig. 4b, left panel; Fig. 4c). All mice inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (K18/C group) exhibited weight loss after 3 dpi, and none of these mice survived until the end of the observation period. The peak loads of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were 105.74 copies/ml in the lungs of the infected mice (n = 1) (Fig. 4c). However, sequential infection with H1N1 followed by SARS-CoV-2 in mice (K18/FC group) quickened the rate of mortality, as all mice died within 7 dpi (2 days after co-infection). The average survival time of the co-infected mice (K18/FC) was 7 days, which was the shortest of the three groups (Fig. 4b, right panel; Fig. 4c). The peak viral loads of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the lungs of co-infected mice from the K18/FC group were 107.53 copies/ml and 104.99 copies/ml, respectively. These results confirmed that co-infection accelerated death in K18-hACE2 mice that were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, histopathological observation in the K18-hACE2 mice was consistent with the results in ferrets. Lung tissues showed more severe inflammation in the alveolar interstitium, necrosis in the epithelial cells of the bronchi, and hemorrhage in the alveolar cavities in the K18/FC group, indicating that co-infection aggravated pneumonia in mice (Fig. 4d). Interestingly, compared with the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 4e, middle panel) in the K18/C group, the expression of H1N1 virus was abundant on the swollen and degenerated epithelial cells of the bronchi (Fig. 4e, left panel). After co-infection, the expression of both viruses was observed in pulmonary tissue (Fig. 4e, right panel).Fig. 4Co-infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice. a Experimental design and sample collection in K18-hACE2 mice. b Changes in body weight and percent survival were recorded at the indicated time points in H1N1-infected K18-hACE2 mice (K18/F), SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice (K18/C), and co-infected K18-hACE2 mice (K18/FC) (n = 6). c Pathogenesis of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 in K18/F, K18/C, and K18/FC mice. d Histopathological changes in K18/F, K18/C, and K18/FC dying mice. e Immunofluorescence analysis of K18/F, K18/C, and K18/FC mice.

To evaluate the effectiveness of combined immunization, K18-hACE2 mice were randomly divided into three groups and immunized intraperitoneally with the PiCoVacc (SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 3 μg/dose) and/or flu (3 μg/dose) vaccine (K18/CV, K18/FV, and K18/FCV groups). PBS-immunized K18-hACE2 mice served as a control group (K18/CM, K18/FM).Mice from each group were euthanized at day 21 post immunization, and serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). We found that NAb to SARS-CoV-2 was induced, ranging from 644 to 1287 in K18/CV mice. In the combined immunization group (K18/FCV), the NAb titers to SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 644 to 724 higher than the controls. Moreover, the NAb to H1N1 were raised equally in both individual immunization (K18/FV, 362–1024) and combined immunization groups (K18/FCV, 362–1448) (Fig. 5b). In addition, to investigate any immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 or flu vaccines, T-cell responses were observed in immunized mice. Hematological and biochemical analysis of CD4+ or CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets and Th1/Th2 ratio showed no notable changes in the K18/FCV group compared with individual immunization groups and nonvaccinated groups (Fig. 5c), suggesting no significant cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1 antigens in mice.Fig. 5Comparison of cellular and humoral immunity among flu-vaccinated, SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated, or simultaneously immunized K18-hACE2 mice. a Flu vaccine immunized mice (K18/FV), PiCoVacc (whole SARS-CoV-2-inactivated vaccine) immunized mice (K18/CV), and simultaneously immunized mice (K18/FCV). H1N1-infected K18-hACE2 mice (K18/FM) and SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice (K18/CM) were used as infected controls. b Neutralizing antibody titers were measured in immunized K18-hACE2 mice (n = 3). c Percentages of memory CD4+/CD8+ T-cell subsets from peripheral blood in co-infected mice (n = 4). d Changes in body weight and percent survival of mice immunized against SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1 infection at the indicated time points (n = 6, left panel).

Significant differences are indicated with asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; Student’s t test)Full size imageTo further investigate the protective efficacy of combined immunization upon virus infection, the immunized mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5d, K18/CV, K18/FCV, and PBS-immunized K18/CM mice were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 at a dosage of 102 TCID50. Meantime, the K18/FV- and K18/FCV-immunized mice and K18/FM mice were infected with H1N1 at 103 TCID50. Weight loss and mortality were monitored daily up to 14 days post inoculation. Mice of both the FV and FCV groups showed full protection against SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1 infection, as the mice both survived and maintained body weight (Fig. 5d, left panel). The NAb titers to SARS-CoV-2 from K18/CV (3259–8192) and K18/FCV (3259–8192) were remarkably increased by approximately fourfold compared to the levels before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the NAb titers against H1N1 from K18/FV (2048–5149) and K18/FCV (1287–6517) were significantly enhanced after H1N1 infection, also approximately fourfold higher than before infection (Fig. 5d, right panel). In addition, no H1N1 or SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in the lungs of immunized mice after virus infection (Fig. 5d, middle panel), suggesting that combined immunization can offer full protective efficacy against the double insults of influenza and COVID-19. These results showed that combined immunization did neither interfere with the immune effect nor with the protective effect of the vaccine.DiscussionUpon sequential infection of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was seen to be aggravated. The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 substantially varies largely due to natural host immunity, from asymptomatic or mild symptoms in immunocompetent hosts, to progressive pneumonia or even death in immunocompromised hosts.15,16 The initial infection of H1N1, which may reduce the immune competence of the hosts, can then aggravate experienced pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets are mild, a ferret is a suitable animal for the study of sequential infection. It is much easier to observe whether H1N1 infection will impair the immune surveillance for the entry of SARS-CoV-2, or sequentially aggravate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. We found that the mild pneumonia was obviously aggravated in sequential H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets; however, the duration of viral shedding and the viral replication in lung tissue was also reduced in the ferrets. These results are consistent with other reports which stated that prior H1N1 infection followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection led to reduced SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary viral loads and enhanced lung damage in golden Syrian hamsters.8 The K18-hACE2 mouse model, a susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection, further confirmed the aggravation of pneumonia by H1N1-SARS-CoV-2 sequential infection. Secondary pneumonia following H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection was robustly intensified. Using these two mammal models, our results demonstrated that host immunity-dependent COVID-19 symptoms could be aggravated by prior H1N1 infection.Combined vaccination is commonly used for different viruses; however, the relevant data on co-vaccination against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 have not been reported. Using co-vaccination of H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibodies against H1N1 or SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously induced and completely protected K18-hACE2 mice against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Compared to a single vaccination, there was no significant difference in the titers of neutralizing antibodies. All the vaccinated mice survived after H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5d); in addition, no antibody-dependent enhancement was observed. Further studies may explore the cross-reactivity of antibodies in combined vaccination.In summary, vaccination is a priority to protect susceptible hosts from aggravation of COVID-19 symptoms. Co-vaccination against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 may be an effective system to protect against epidemic-related pneumonia in the coming winter.Materials and methodsEthics statementAll animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking Union Medical College (ILAS, PUMC) (No. BLL20010). All experiments were performed in an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facility with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered isolators.VirusThe SARS-CoV-2 virus designated as SARS-CoV-2/WH-09/human/2020/CHN (GenBank: MT093631.2) and the seasonal influenza A virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) were provided by ILAS, PUMC, China. To identify the stocks of the virus, the plaque purified viral isolate was amplified as described previously.4 Titers for SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 were determined using a median TCID50 assay.Ferret experimentsEighteen specific pathogen-free castrated adult ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) aged 6–12 months that were serologically negative for the currently circulating influenza viruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV by hemagglutinin inhibition assay were used. Animals were randomly divided into three groups. Twelve ferrets (F/F1 to F/F6 and F/FC1 to F/FC6) were inoculated intranasally with H1N1 stock virus at 106 TCID50. Following H1N1 infection, ferrets F/FC1 to F/FC6 were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 106 TCID50. Six ferrets (F/C1 to F/C6) were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 at 106 TCID50, as a SARS-CoV-2 challenge control. All animals were observed for clinical signs and weighed daily as an indicator of disease. Nasal and throat swabs were collected on days 3, 5, 8, and 10 post infection. Four randomly selected animals were euthanized at 5 days post-H1N1 challenge and 5 days post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge to collect lung tissue for detecting viral loads and observing histopathological changes (n = 4). Study design and longitudinal sampling schedule are shown in Fig. 1a.Mice experimentsEight–10-week-old female Tg (K18-hACE2) mice were provided by GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. Six transgenic mice (K18/FC group) were re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 1 × 102 TCID50 at 5 days post-H1N1 infection at a dosage of 103 TCID50. Six mice were challenged with H1N1 alone (K18/F group) at 103 TCID50, and six mice were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 alone (K18/C group) at 102 TCID50. Infected animals were monitored and body weight, clinical symptoms, and responsiveness to external stimuli were recorded. Lung tissue was collected to screen virus loads and histopathological changes from the moribund mice infected with viruses.Vaccine immunogenicity analysisEight–10-week-old female Tg (K18-hACE2) mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the PiCoVacc (K18/CV, 3 μg/dose, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sinovac Biotech Ltd), the flu vaccine (K18/FV, 3 μg/dose, Sinovac Biotech Ltd), or their combination (co-vaccination with both (K18/FCV)). PiCovacc-vaccinated animals were immunized two times (at day 0 and 14), and flu-vaccinated animals were immunized once (at day 0). The control group consisted of K18-hACE2 mice immunized with PBS (K18/FM or K18/CM). To evaluate cellular immunity, four mice from each group were euthanized on day 21 post immunization. CD4+ or CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets from blood were analyzed as follows: CD3+CD4+/CD8+CD62L+CCR7+CD44− for naive T cells, CD3+CD4+/CD8+ CD62L+CCR7+CD44+ for central memory T cells, CD3+CD4+/CD8+CD62L−CCR7−CD44+ for effective memory T cells, CD3+CD4+IFNγ+ for Th1 cells, and CD3+CD4+IL-4+ for Th2 cells. Serum samples were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies by cytopathic effect (CPE) (n = 3). At day 21 post immunization, the K18/CV, K18/FCV, and K18/CM mice (n = 12) were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 at a dosage of 102 TCID50, and the K18/FV, K18/FCV, and K18/FM mice (n = 12) mice were infected with H1N1 at 103 TCID50. Weight loss and mortality were monitored daily up to 14 days post inoculation (n = 6). Lung tissues were collected to quantitatively detect viral RNA loads at 5 days post infection (n = 6), and serum samples were collected to measure the titers of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1 at 7 dpi.Quantification RT–PCRThe total RNA was extracted and reverse transcription was performed as described previously.4 Briefly, qRT–PCR was carried out using the following cycling protocol and primers: 50 °C for 2 min, then 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s, and final incubations at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 45 s. The following primers were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1: SARS-CoV-2: forward primer, 5′-TCGTTTCGGAAGAGACAGGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCGCAGTAAGGATGGCTAGT-3′. H1N1: forward primer, 5′-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3′.Statistical analysisAll data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc). Comparisons among groups were performed by the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. The level of statistical significance was determined as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

Photo: Supplied/Food For Mzansi Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Yes, it is still safe to eat poultry meat, says the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) following the recent outbreak of avian influenza at different farms across the country. Dr Lucia Anelich, a Pretoria-based microbiologist, also assures the public that the H5N1 influenza virus will not affect humans. Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is described as a highly pathogenic viral respiratory disease affecting birds. In the past few weeks, it has been detected on farms in Gauteng, North West and the Western Cape. Pretoria-based food-safety expert Dr Lucia Anelich. Photo: Supplied/Food For Mzansi “Avian influenza is a virus that affects the animal. It therefore has an impact on only the bird and is not transmitted to humans. Some viruses can be transmitted to humans from animals, but avian influenza is not one of them. “Therefore, consuming properly cooked chicken and chicken products during the outbreak is perfectly safe,” says Anelich. Izaak Breitenbach, general manager of SAPA’s broiler organisation, further clarifies that avian influenza is a “chicken disease” and not a human disease. Breitenbach too affirms that it is perfectly safe to consume poultry products amid the outbreak. “There are no concerns in terms of food safety from a high pathogenic influenza point of view. We have got an early warning system where we monitor more than 900 farms. So, even if the mortality rate on a farm starts to increase, we isolate that farm.” ALSO READ: 5 tips to save your poultry business How does the virus work? According to Breitenbach the H5N1 virus is present in the faeces of infected birds and discharge from their noses, mouth, and eyes. Domestic birds, including chickens, are at risk of being infected through faecal contamination of the environment from wild waterbirds or by indirect contact with infected poultry on other premises. “If that farm is then tested positive, nothing can move from that farm. No eggs, no meat, nothing. If the farm tests positive, all those products and birds are disposed of on sight. It never enters the food chain,” says Breitenbach. Mzansi in the safe zone A 2017 outbreak nearly decimated South Africa’s poultry industry as producers lost R1.6 billion worth of produce, says Breitenbach. “It wiped out 50% of our small farmers at that point in time. Izaak Breitenbach, general manager of SAPA’s Broiler Organisation. Photo: Supplied/Food For Mzansi “What we have found up until now is that the infections that took place were infections from wild birds to chickens. That is a difficult one to control. “If we look at the outbreak so far, the number of outbreaks from chicken to chicken, we couldn’t confirm any of those yet. That is showing us that we are containing the outbreak on our farms very well, but we are at risk because of the wild birds.” Anelich is confident that SAPA has learned many lessons from the 2017 outbreak. “The poultry industry has been aware of avian influenza now for many years. They do have biosecurity measures in place. “I do understand the fear or the concern from the consumer because they have been pelted in South Africa with quite a few things since 2018. It was the listeriosis crisis, and then, with this pandemic, influenza and the fear around the spread from potential surfaces.” There’s enough to eat At present, the disease has not affected the supply of food. “We still have enough commercial eggs to eat and there is still enough chicken meat,” adds Breitenbach. “I will be disappointed if we can’t have less infected flocks than 2017. We now have systems in place that we did not have in 2017. That was the first time we isolated that virus in South Africa. We have put plans in place preventatively since 2017 to control the disease better.” ALSO READ: Avian flu: Poultry industry hustling to save exports Related Posts This week’s agri events: 11 – 15 November 11th November 2024 Get maximum benefits with effective livestock marketing 10th November 2024 Small-scale farmers show the way to sustainable agriculture SA agri-businesses target Asian market at China expo News SA agri-businesses target Asian market at China expo by Tiisetso Manoko 9th November 2024 South African businesses are eyeing expansion into the Asian market through the China International Import Expo, backed by new trade...

Health and body Conditions Cough cold flu cough cold and flu treatments Cough cold flu Overview Buying guide How to buy the best cough, cold and flu treatments Some remedies work better than others, depending on your symptoms and their ingredients. Karina Bray Last updated: 20 May 2021 Fact-checked Fact-checkedChecked for accuracy by our qualified fact-checkers, verifiers and subject experts. Find out more about fact-checking at CHOICE. If your cold hasn't already befuddled your head, being confronted by a gazillion different remedies on the pharmacy shelves could just take you over the line. More than $250 million worth of cold, cough and flu remedies are sold in Australia every year. For many products there's not much convincing evidence that they work – but nor is there much evidence they don't work. Confused? We sift through the options and guide you on what – if anything – is worth buying for different symptoms. The better news is that you might be able to skip the pharmacy spree with some simple home remedies. Cold, flu and COVID-19: It's very difficult to distinguish between the symptoms of COVID-19, influenza and a cold. If you have symptoms such as a sore throat, headache, fever, shortness of breath, muscle aches, cough or runny nose, you may need to self-isolate and to be assessed by a medical professional. You may also need testing for COVID-19.

Many products are combos treating more than one symptom, so try to buy only those that address the symptoms you actually have. How to treat a loose, chesty cough Consider "chesty cough" liquids that contain expectorants and/or mucolytics. Expectorants, including guaiphenesin, ammonia and senega, are meant to help make coughing out secretions easier, while bromhexine, a mucolytic, acts by thinning mucus in the lungs. There's little evidence for any of them. How to treat a dry cough Consider suppressants. "Dry cough" liquids, as well as many combination cold and flu tablets, contain suppressants such as codeine, pholcodine and dextromethorphan. However, the effect is little better – if at all – than that of a placebo, with dextromethorphan the best bet. Use them only for painful, dry and persistent coughs – using suppressants for chesty coughs could delay recovery. How to treat a blocked nose Consider decongestants, which reduce the "stuffed up" feeling and mucus formation. They're not always effective, so you may or may not experience any noticeable difference. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, but it's kept behind the counter because it can be used to make methamphetamine. If you want to buy it, you will have to ask the pharmacist for it and show ID. Phenylephrine (look for PE on product labels – e.g. Sudafed PE) has been marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine, but is not as effective. If you have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or thyroid conditions, check with your doctor before taking decongestants Side effects of decongestants may include increased blood pressure, sleeplessness, anxiety and dizziness. If you have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or thyroid conditions, check with your doctor before taking them. Spray (topical) decongestants, including oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, are faster-acting than oral decongestants and have fewer side effects. They should be used sparingly – continual use can make congestion worse. How to treat a runny nose Consider an anticholinergic spray. Atrovent nasal spray contains ipratropium bromide (which is an anticholinergic), which can help dry up a runny nose and is also recommended for allergies. There's not much evidence oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, brompheniramine, doxylamine and chlorpheniramine help dry up a runny nose caused by colds. But they may make sleeping easier by countering the stimulating effects of decongestants. Side effects include dry eyes and mouth, and daytime drowsiness – these effects are usually, but not always, found in night-time products, so check the label. People with narrow-angle glaucoma or an enlarged prostate should avoid using them. How to treat a stuffy and runny nose Consider anticholinergic/decongestant combo spray. Otrivin Plus nasal spray contains ipratropium bromide, as well as a decongestant (xylometazoline) to reduce stuffiness. How to treat aches and pains Consider paracetamol or ibuprofen. Some cough and cold medicines contain paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief and to reduce fever, so check the ingredients before use to avoid the risk of overdose if you're also taking painkillers separately. How to treat fever Consider leaving it! Fever can help fight infection, so unless it's really uncomfortable, it might be best to ride it out. See a doctor if it's higher than 39.5°C for three days and doesn't respond to medication such as paracetamol. Home remedies for cold and flu Help may be at hand in your home already. Fight the virus by resting up in the first few days when you're most affected and most contagious. Loosen congestion and prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. A warm honey and lemon drink soothes your throat. Avoid dehydrating caffeine drinks and alcohol. Ease nasal congestion and help prevent bacterial infection by flushing your nose with saline nose drops twice a day. Saline liquid doesn't cause the rebound effect of nasal decongestants, and is safe for children. Relieve swelling in the throat by gargling with salt water (half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water). Ease a dry, sore throat and reduce tickling that causes dry coughing with sugar-free throat lozenges. Medicated lozenges aren't necessary, although menthol or eucalyptus may help your head feel clearer. Suppress a dry cough with one or two teaspoons of honey – a useful remedy for children over the age of one. Vitamin C, zinc and echinacea have all been promoted as aids for reducing the severity and duration of colds, and the likelihood of catching one. Some studies have found some benefit, but findings are inconsistent and reported effects could come down to the quality of the study or the particular preparation used. Looking for personal thermometers? We've tested to find you the best. Read personal thermometers review Treating children for cold and flu Children under the age of six should not be given medicines to treat cough and cold symptoms. For children aged six to 11, do so only on the advice of a doctor, pharmacist, or nurse practitioner. If a child has a temperature above 40°C, or a lower temperature that lasts three days or more and doesn't respond to medication, take them to see a doctor. Aspirin should not be taken by children or teenagers, as it could possibly cause a serious illness called Reye's syndrome. Cost You may be able to save money with generic products – look for the pharmacy's own brand, for example. The active ingredients are the same as big name products, but other ingredients may not be, so check there's nothing you're sensitive to.
