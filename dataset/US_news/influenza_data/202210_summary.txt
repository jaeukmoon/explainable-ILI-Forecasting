Infection Control Measures: The CDC provides interim guidance for healthcare settings on infection control when caring for confirmed cases, probable cases, and cases under investigation for novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease. This guidance aims to prevent the spread of the virus within healthcare facilities and protect healthcare workers and patients.

Use of Antiviral Medications: The CDC offers interim guidance on the use of antiviral medications for the treatment and prophylaxis of human infections with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease. These medications can help reduce the severity of illness and prevent further spread.

Considerations for Veterinarians: The CDC provides guidance for veterinarians on evaluating and handling cats potentially exposed to highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. This guidance is crucial for protecting both animals and humans from the virus.

Specimen Collection and Testing: The CDC offers interim guidance on specimen collection and testing for patients with suspected infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease or with the potential to cause severe disease in humans. Proper testing and diagnosis are essential for timely and accurate identification of the virus.

Follow-up of Close Contacts: The CDC provides interim guidance for the follow-up of close contacts of persons infected with novel influenza A viruses and the use of antiviral medications for chemoprophylaxis. This guidance aims to prevent the spread of the virus to individuals who may have been exposed.

Current Situation: The CDC provides updates on the current situation regarding bird flu, including information on monitoring, prevention, and public health strategies. This information helps healthcare professionals and the public stay informed about the latest developments and take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

These facts highlight important measures and guidance provided by the CDC to control the spread of novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease. It emphasizes the importance of infection control, antiviral medications, and proper testing and follow-up procedures.
