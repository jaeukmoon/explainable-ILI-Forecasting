Avian influenza vaccination:
- Avian influenza has resulted in the loss of over 500 million birds globally since 2005.
- The disease threatens livelihoods, food security, and public health.
- The disease has spread to new regions and caused die-offs in wild birds.
- Changes in the disease's patterns of spread require a review of prevention and control strategies.
- Vaccination should be considered as a tool to contain the disease, protect the poultry industry, and reduce pandemic risks.
- Stricter biosecurity measures and mass culling may no longer be sufficient to control the disease.
- Countries should be prepared for increased outbreaks and consider vaccination in line with international animal health and welfare standards.
