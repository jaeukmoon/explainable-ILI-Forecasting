Three influenza A (H5N1/bird flu) virus particles (rod-shaped). Note: Layout incorporates two CDC transmission electron micrographs that have been inverted, repositioned, and colorized by NIAID. Scale has been modified. NIAID What he National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has released its plan for advancing H5N1 influenza basic research and translating those findings into strategies and interventions that can benefit people. The research agenda focuses on four key objectives: increasing understanding of the biology of H5N1 viruses and the factors that influence their ability to transmit and cause disease; developing and evaluating prevention strategies, such as vaccines; advancing existing and novel treatments, including antivirals and monoclonal antibodies; and supporting strategies for detecting H5N1 virus. The NIAID Research Agenda for 2024 H5N1 Influenza – May 2024 aligns with the NIAID role in the federal public health response to the U.S. outbreak of H5N1 influenza in people, dairy cows and other animals. Since 2003, H5N1 influenza viruses have circulated in 23 countries, primarily affecting wild birds and poultry resulting in nearly 900 reported human cases, primarily among people who have had close contact with infected birds. In the past few years, however, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 has spread to infect more than 50 animal species. In late March 2024, an HPAI H5N1 outbreak was reported among dairy cows in Texas. Although the virus so far has not shown genetic evidence of acquiring the ability to spread from person-to-person, public health officials are closely monitoring the outbreak as part of overarching pandemic preparedness efforts. The NIAID H5N1 research agenda builds on the institute’s longstanding influenza research efforts. It addresses the current outbreak in U.S. dairy cows including potential human-to-human transmission of H5N1 influenza viruses. NIAID will leverage both its domestic and international research infrastructures to achieve the plan’s objectives. NIAID Research Agenda for 2024 H5N1 Influenza – May 2024 Who NIAID Director Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., M.P.H., is available to discuss the research agenda. NIAID conducts and supports research—at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide—to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

Most virus particles enter cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). However, it is unclear how viral binding signals are transmitted through the plasma membrane triggering CME. Here we found that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGluR2) and potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 (KCa1.1) are involved in the initiation and completion of CME of influenza virus using an siRNA screen approach. Influenza virus HA directly interacted with mGluR2 and used it as an endocytic receptor to initiate CME. mGluR2 interacted and activated KCa1.1, leading to polymerization of F-actin, maturation of clathrin-coated pits and completion of the CME of influenza virus. Importantly, mGluR2-knockout mice were significantly more resistant to different influenza subtypes than the wild type. Therefore, blocking HA and mGluR2 interaction could be a promising host-directed antiviral strategy.

H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses have caused four pandemics with over 50 million fatalities1,2. H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses have caused over 2,600 human cases with over 1,000 deaths globally3, and numerous disease outbreaks in birds, with the loss of at least 422 million domestic poultry since 20054.Influenza virus infection is initiated by the viral HA binding to a sialic acid receptor that presents as a glycoprotein or glycolipid on the host cell surface. A previous study suggested that glycolipids facilitate attachment but are not involved in internalization, and influenza virus specifically requires N-linked glycoprotein for entry5. Other studies reported that the binding of influenza virus to sialylated cell surface proteins does not always result in virus internalization6,7, suggesting that only certain glycoproteins mediate viral internalization.Influenza virus internalizes into host cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME)8,9,10, clathrin-independent endocytosis11,12 and macropinocytosis13. Most influenza virus particles enter cells via CME8,9,10, which is a receptor-mediated, signal-regulated process that transports various transmembrane proteins (that is, receptors) and their extracellular ligands from the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells into the cytoplasm14. Although many host factors involved in influenza virus infection have been identified8,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22, it remains unclear which transmembrane protein is used by influenza virus to transduce the signal of viral binding across the plasma membrane to initiate CME. In this study, we found two membrane proteins––potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 (KCa1.1) encoded by KCNMA1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) encoded by GRM2––that are crucial for initiating and completing the CME of influenza virus. Our findings open a new door for the development of host-directed strategies against influenza virus.ResultsIdentification of K+ channel KCa1.1Ion channels play key roles during virus infection23. The L-type calcium channel was reported to affect influenza virus entry, although it is not clear which step of viral entry the channel affects17. To screen for more ion channels involved in influenza virus infection, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) assay in A549 cells with 1,014 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting 338 human genes. The cells were transfected with corresponding siRNA, and 72 h later, they were infected with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1)21 (hereafter referred to as H1N1 virus) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Non-targeting scramble siRNA (siControl) and siRNA targeting H1N1 nucleoprotein (siNP) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of viruses in the supernatants were titrated at 24 h post-infection (p.i.) in Madin-Daby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a). A gene was selected as a positive hit if (1) the viral titre was reduced at least tenfold compared with siControl-transfected cells, (2) the P value was lower than 0.05 and (3) at least two of three siRNAs fulfilled criteria (1) and (2). Using these criteria, 37 genes (Supplementary Table 1)—16 genes related to potassium channels (Fig. 1a,b), 12 genes related to calcium channels or calcium-regulated unselected cation channels, 3 genes encoded ATPases, 1 gene related to sodium channels and 5 genes predicted to have ion channel activity24 (Extended Data Fig. 1b)—were identified as positive hits, and 6 of them, KCNE2, CACNA1C, GRIN3A, CHRNA1, ATP6V1B2 and KCNMA1, were previously identified by others25,26. These results suggest that different ion channels are involved in influenza virus infection.Fig. 1: KCa1.1 plays an important role in influenza virus internalization.a, Potassium channels involved in influenza virus replication were identified by screening siRNA libraries of human ion channels. b, Viral titres in different potassium channel-knockdown A549 cells. The data were summarized from the screen by combining the results from different siRNAs presented in a. c, The mRNA level of KCa1.1 in KCa1.1-knockdown A549 cells was significantly lower than that in control cells. d, KCa1.1 knockdown significantly reduced H1N1 virus replication in A549 cells. e, Paxilline treatment did not affect the viability of A549 cells. f, Paxilline treatment significantly reduced H1N1 virus replication in A549 cells. g, Paxilline affected the early stage of influenza infection. h, KCa1.1-knockdown and paxilline treatment did not affect the attachment of H1N1 virus to A549 cells. i, KCa1.1-knockdown or paxilline treatment affected the internalization of H1N1 virus into A549 cells. j, KCa1.1-knockdown affected the internalization of H1N1 virus confirmed by a three-dimensional microscopy-based assay under permeabilized and unpermeabilized conditions with z-stacks and a membrane marker.

Among the 16 identified genes related to potassium channels, we found that the downregulation of KCa1.1 had the greatest effect on the replication of H1N1 virus in A549 cells (Fig. 1b–d). To further confirm this observation, we performed drug inhibition assays with paxilline, a functional antagonist of KCa1.1 (ref. 27), in A549 cells. We found that paxilline treatment had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 1e), but significantly inhibited the replication of H1N1 virus in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1f). These results show that KCa1.1 plays an important role in influenza virus infection.KCa1.1 regulates influenza virus entryTo investigate which stage of influenza virus replication is affected by KCa1.1, we performed a time-of-addition assay in A549 cells. The relative viral RNA (vRNA) levels in cell lysates were quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 6 h p.i. We found that paxilline treatment performed at −1 h or 0 h p.i. significantly reduced vRNA levels in cells compared with control cells, but treatment performed at 1 h, 2 h or 3 h p.i. showed no difference in vRNA levels compared with control cells (Fig. 1g), indicating that KCa1.1 plays a key role in the early steps of influenza virus infection.The early steps of influenza virus infection involve attaching to sialic acid receptors at the cell surface and internalization into the cell. To investigate whether KCa1.1 affects influenza virus attachment in cells with different treatments, the vRNA levels of attached viruses were quantified by qPCR. We found that NA treatment significantly reduced virus binding, whereas KCa1.1 silencing or paxilline treatment did not (Fig. 1h), indicating that KCa1.1 has no effect on influenza virus binding.To investigate whether KCa1.1 is involved in the internalization step, the vRNA levels of internalized viruses in cells with different treatments were quantified by qPCR. The vRNA levels inside the paxilline-treated cells or KCa1.1-silenced cells were significantly lower than those of control cells (Fig. 1i), indicating that activated KCa1.1 is important for the influenza virus internalization, which was confirmed by a microscopy-based assay with z-stacks18 that quantitatively detects antibody-labelled viruses that are retained on cell membranes after an internalization period under unpermeabilized conditions (Fig. 1j,k). However, the vRNA level inside KCa1.1-overexpressing cells was comparable to that of control cells (Fig. 1l). To test whether the HA of influenza virus interacts with KCa1.1, we constructed a recombinant H1N1 HA with a six-histidine tag (HA–His)17 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). The HA–His purified from eukaryotic cells was mixed with KCa1.1–Myc-transfected HEK293 cell lysates for a pull-down assay. We found that KCa1.1 did not interact with HA–His (Extended Data Fig. 2c), implying that other host factors may be cooperating with KCa1.1 during this process.Cooperation between mGluR2 and KCa1.1A previous study identified a series of host factors that interact with KCa1.1 (ref. 28); we found that seven of these host factors—mGluR2, CPNE9, ADCY5, NTSR2, GABRA5, SCN8A and MPDZ—are cellular transmembrane proteins expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and may activate KCa1.1 (ref. 29). To evaluate their effect on influenza virus replication, two specific siRNAs were designed for each of these seven candidates for RNAi assays. We found that knockdown of four genes—mGluR2, CPNE9, ADCY5 and NTSR2—led to a decrease in viral titres in A549 cells, whereas knockdown of the other three genes had no effect on influenza virus replication (Fig. 2a). We next evaluated the effect of these four genes on influenza virus binding and internalization. We found that none of these host factors affected influenza virus binding, and only mGluR2 affected influenza virus internalization (Fig. 2b), which was further confirmed with the microscopy-based assay (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2: mGluR2 plays an important role in influenza virus internalization.a, Effect of seven different membrane proteins that interact with KCa1.1 on influenza virus replication evaluated using an RNAi assay. b, mGluR2 knockdown reduced the internalization of H1N1 virus into A549 cells. c, mGluR2 knockdown reduced the internalization of H1N1 virus into A549 cells, as confirmed using a microscopy-based assay.

(n = 3 biologically independent experiments).

Exact P values are available in the Source Data.Source dataFull size imageTo investigate whether KCa1.1 and mGluR2 work through an interdependent process or independently, we compared the H1N1 virus replication in paxilline-treated A549 cells, mGluR2-silenced A549 cells and paxilline-treated mGluR2-silenced A549 cells. We found that simultaneous blocking of KCa1.1 and mGluR2 had no additive effect on the reduction of viral titres (Fig. 2d), ruling out the possibility of independent operation.To investigate whether KCa1.1 and mGluR2 cooperate to facilitate the internalization of influenza virus, we validated their interaction by performing a co-immunoprecipitation assay in plasmid-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2e), and then compared the vRNA levels of H1N1 virus attached and internalized in A549 cells, which endogenously express KCa1.1 and mGluR2, that were transfected with the mGluR2-expression plasmid alone or co-transfected with the KCa1.1-expression plasmid. We found that overexpression of mGluR2 alone did not increase vRNA levels of attached and internalized viruses, whereas overexpression of both KCa1.1 and mGluR2 did not increase vRNA levels of attached viruses, but significantly increased vRNA levels of internalized viruses (Fig. 2f). These results suggest that KCa1.1 and mGluR2 jointly promote the internalization of influenza viruses.mGluR2 internalizes with influenza virusTo investigate whether KCa1.1 and mGluR2 are internalized with influenza virus, we quantified the abundance of KCa1.1 and mGluR2 on the cellular membrane before and after H1N1 virus internalization using a microscopy-based assay. The fluorescence intensity of KCa1.1 on the membrane of H1N1-virus-internalized cells was comparable to that of the uninfected control A549 cells or H1N1-virus-bound cells (Fig. 2g), but the fluorescence intensity of mGluR2 on the membrane of H1N1-virus-internalized cells was significantly lower than that of the uninfected control A549 cells or H1N1-virus-bound cells (Fig. 2h), indicating that mGluR2, but not KCa1.1, internalizes with influenza virus. Of note, in the KCa1.1-silenced cells, the fluorescence intensity of mGluR2 on the membrane of H1N1-virus-internalized cells was comparable to that of the control A549 cells and the virus-bound cells (Fig. 2i), indicating that KCa1.1 is required for the internalization of mGluR2.mGluR2 serves as an endocytic receptorIn addition to CME, influenza virus also exploits caveolin-mediated endocytosis11,12 and macropinocytosis13 to enter cells. Clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), caveolin 1 (CAV1) and Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1) are key molecules involved in CME, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis30, respectively. To investigate which pathway in influenza virus internalization involves mGluR2, we first performed microscopy-based assays to evaluate the abundance of mGluR2 on the membrane of CLTC-, CAV1- and RAC1-silenced A549 cells as well as control A549 cells after H1N1 virus internalized. The fluorescence intensity of mGluR2 on the membrane of CLTC-silenced cells was significantly higher than that on the control cells, whereas the fluorescence intensity of mGluR2 on the membrane of CAV1- or RAC1-silenced cells was comparable to that on the control cells (Fig. 3a), indicating that mGluR2 is involved in the CME of influenza virus.Fig. 3: Influenza virus uses mGluR2 as an endocytic receptor for its CME.a, Knockdown of CLTC significantly prevented mGluR2 internalization in H1N1-virus-internalized A549 cells.

Scale bar, 100 nm. e,g, mGluR2–GST (e) or mGluR2–ma (g) did not affect the viability of A549 cells. f,h, mGluR2–GST (f) or mGluR2–ma (h) treatment significantly reduced H1N1 virus replication but did not reduce adenovirus type 5 replication in A549 cells. i, Internalization of transferrin was affected by chlorpromazine (a CME inhibitor) but not by mGluR2-GST or mGluR2-ma. The microscopy-based assay shown in a and i was performed under unpermeabilized conditions and that shown in c was performed under permeabilized conditions. The solid line represents median and dashed lines represent quartiles of the data in the violin graphs of a and i. The images in a–d and i are representative of three independent experiments.

Exact P values are available in Source Data.Source dataFull size imagemGluR2, a seven-transmembrane N-linked glycoprotein of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily31, is widely expressed in human tissues (BioGPS database)32 (Extended Data Fig. 3). mGluR2 is activated by extracellular ligands and transduces intracellular signals via interactions with G proteins33,34,35. As mGluR2 does not affect influenza virus binding but is required for influenza virus internalization, we speculated that mGluR2 may serve as an endocytic receptor and transduce the signal of viral binding across the plasma membrane to initiate CME. To test this hypothesis, we first tested the interaction of HA and mGluR2, and found that the HA–His was successfully pulled down by mGluR2 (Fig. 3b). This was further confirmed using stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy, which showed that mGluR2 and H1N1 virus particles co-localized in A549 cells during viral internalization (Fig. 3c). Moreover, by use of immunoelectron microscopy, we detected mGluR2 on the cell membrane of different stages of influenza virus endocytosis, including the cell membrane of influenza-virus-containing invagination pits and the cell membrane of matured endocytic vesicles, which are consistent with those of the clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) and clathrin-coated vehicles (CCVs)36 (Fig. 3d).To investigate whether the interaction between mGluR2 and HA is important for influenza virus internalization, we performed an infectivity neutralization assay with the purified ectodomain of mGluR2 with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag (mGluR2–GST). The mGluR2–GST did not affect the cell viability at the highest concentration used (Fig. 3e); it inhibited H1N1 virus infection in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells (Fig. 3f). We further performed an antibody blocking assay with a monoclonal antibody against the ectodomain of mGluR2 (mGluR2–ma), and found that mGluR2–ma inhibited H1N1 virus infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3g,h). These results show that mGluR2 directly interacts with the HA protein and serves as an endocytic receptor for the CME of influenza virus. mGluR2 did not affect the endocytosis of adenovirus type 5 or transferrin (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Fig. 3f,h,i), although they also enter cells by CME37,38, suggesting that mGluR2-mediated CME is cargo specific.KCa1.1 regulates F-actin polymerizationKCa1.1 neither interacts with the HA of influenza virus nor internalizes with the virus, suggesting that KCa1.1 may regulate other factors involved in the CME of influenza virus. KCa1.1 channels could be activated by Ca2+, membrane potential or membrane stretch39,40,41. Stretch sensitivity of smooth muscle KCa1.1 channels involves interactions with F-actin39,41, and F-actin dynamics are essential for efficient completion of CCPs42. Therefore, we speculated that changes in Ca2+ or membrane stretching induced by influenza virus binding may activate KCa1.1 and thus regulate F-actin polymerization. To test this concept, we evaluated F-actin polymerization in A549 control cells; A549 cells treated with paxilline or cytochalasin D (cyto D), an inhibitor of actin polymerization43; and KCa1.1-knockdown A549 cells, following H1N1 virus internalization. The F-actin dye phalloidin-488 staining revealed reduced fluorescence intensity of phalloidin in the KCa1.1-knockdown cells, paxilline-treated cells and cyto-D-treated cells compared with A549 control cells (Fig. 4a). Moreover, like knockdown of KCa1.1, cyto D treatment also abolished the internalization of mGluR2 (Fig. 4b) and thereby prevented influenza virus internalization (Fig. 4c). These results show that the activation of KCa1.1 positively affects F-actin polymerization and thereby facilitates the CME of influenza virus.Fig. 4: KCa1.1 facilitates influenza virus internalization by regulating F-actin polymerization.a, KCa1.1-knockdown, cyto D or paxilline treatment significantly reduced F-actin polymerization in H1N1-virus-internalized A549 cells.

We found that 51.5%, 17.5%, 20.2% and 2.5% of the viral particles that attached to the membrane of the control cells, KCa1.1-knockdown cells, mGluR2-knockdown cells and chlorpromazine-treated cells, respectively, formed clear CCPs at 1 min p.b. (Fig. 4d), and 91.7%, 33.8%, 44.4% and 8.0% of the viral particles that attached to the membrane of the control cells, KCa1.1-knockdown cells, mGluR2-knockdown cells and chlorpromazine-treated cells, respectively, formed clear CCPs at 6 min p.b. (Fig. 4d). Notably, KCa1.1, but not mGluR2, knockdown also reduced CCP formation of adenovirus type 5 (Extended Data Fig. 4b). These results show that KCa1.1 and mGluR2 play important roles in the CME of influenza virus. Taken together, our findings allow us to propose a model of the roles and collaboration of KCa1.1 and mGluR2 in the CME of influenza virus (Fig. 4e).Role of mGluR2 for H5 and H7 virusesOur studies showed that H1N1 virus uses mGluR2 as an endocytic receptor for its CME and that this mGluR2-mediated CME is regulated by KCa1.1. It is unclear whether viruses of other subtypes also internalize cells through this mechanism. We therefore evaluated the role of KCa1.1 and mGluR2 on H5 and H7 virus internalization using the viruses A/duck/Guangdong/S1330/2016 (H5N6) (ref. 44) and A/chicken/Guangdong/SD008/2017 (H7N9)-PB2/627K (ref. 45) (hereafter referred to as H5N6 virus and H7N9 virus, respectively). We found that knockdown of KCa1.1 or mGluR2 significantly suppressed the infection and internalization of both viruses (Extended Data Fig. 5a–d and Extended Data Fig. 6a–d). We showed that mGluR2 interacts with the HA gene of H5N6 and H7N9 viruses, and that the soluble protein mGluR2–GST or mGluR2–ma inhibited infection of both viruses (Extended Data Fig. 6e–j). Together, these results suggest that CME with mGluR2 as an endocytic receptor and regulated by KCa1.1 may be a common mechanism for influenza virus internalization.Studies in mGluR2-knockout miceOur in vitro studies show that mGluR2 plays a direct role in the CME of influenza virus. To investigate whether mGluR2 affects influenza virus infection in vivo, we evaluated the replication and lethality of different influenza viruses in wild-type and mGluR2-knockout (mGluR2−/−) mice. Groups of 16 wild-type C57BL/6J mice and mGluR2−/− mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of the indicated influenza virus. Three mice in each group were euthanized on days 3 and 5 p.i., and their organs, including the nasal turbinates, lungs, brain, kidneys and spleens, were collected for virus titration. The remaining 10 mice in each group were monitored for body weight changes and survival for 2 weeks.H1N1 virus was detected in the nasal turbinates, lungs and kidneys of all wild-type mice on days 3 and 5 p.i., and in the spleen of one mouse on day 5 p.i. (Fig. 5a). However, the virus was detected only in the nasal turbinates and lungs of mGluR2−/− mice, with titres being notably or significantly lower than those in the wild-type mice (Fig. 5a). The wild-type mice lost nearly 29% of their body weight and all died on day 9 p.i. (Fig. 5b,c). The mGluR2−/− mice had a similar weight loss, but 60% of them survived (Fig. 5b,c).Fig. 5: Replication and virulence of different influenza viruses in wild-type C57BL/6J and mGluR2−/− mice.a–i, Groups of 16 wild-type C57BL/6J mice and mGluR2−/− mice were intranasally inoculated with 10 MLD50 of H1N1 virus (a,b,c), H5N6 virus (d,e,f) or H7N9 virus (g,h,i). a,d,g, Three mice in each group were euthanized on days 3 and 5 p.i., respectively, and their organs indicated were collected for virus titration in cells. b,c,e,f,h,i, The remaining 10 mice in each group were evaluated for body weight change (b,e,h) and survival (c,f,i) for 2 weeks. Error bar in panels a, b, d, e, g and h indicates the standard deviation. Data in a, d and g are means ± s.d. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test. The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used to analyse the statistical difference in survival rates between the wild-type and mGluR2−/− mice. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. PFU, plaque-forming unit; EID50, 50% egg infectious dose. Exact P values are available in Source Data.Source dataFull size imageH5N6 virus was detected in all five test organs of wild-type mice and in four test organs (not the brain) of mGluR2−/− mice, and the titres in the organs of mGluR2−/− mice were significantly lower than those of wild-type mice (Fig. 5d). The wild-type mice lost nearly 23% of their body weight, and all died within 12 days p.i. (Fig. 5e,f). However, the mGluR2−/− mice lost about 12% body weight and had a survival rate of 70% (Fig. 5e,f).H7N9 virus was detected in four of the five tested organs (not the spleen) of wild-type mice and in only the nasal turbinates and lungs of mGluR2−/− mice. The titres in the mGluR2−/− mice were significantly lower than those of wild-type mice (Fig. 5g). The wild-type mice lost nearly 19% of their body weight, and all died within 11 days p.i., whereas the mGluR2−/− mice lost about 8% of their body weight and had a survival rate of 70% (Fig. 5h,i). These studies show that mGluR2 knockout significantly weakened the replication of influenza viruses in the nasal turbinates and lungs of mice, and prevented the replication of H5 and H7 viruses in the brain of mice.Immunohistological study and dual staining analysis indicated that viral-antigen-positive cells (MUC1+ type II alveolar epithelial cells, AQP5+ type I epithelial cells and S100A9+ macrophages) in the lungs of mGluR2−/− mice were notably less than those in the wild-type mice (Fig. 6 and Extended Data Fig. 7), suggesting that mGluR2 knockout reduces the overall replication level of influenza virus, but does not affect viral cell tropism.Fig. 6: Identification of cell types in the lungs of wild-type and mGluR2−/− mice infected by influenza virus.a–c, Dual staining was performed on the lung sections of mice infected with H1N1 virus (a), H5N6 virus (b) or H7N9 virus (c) to identify the type II alveolar epithelial cells (MUC1-positive cells), type I alveolar epithelial cells (AQP5-positive cells) and macrophages (S100A9-positive cells) that were viral antigen positive. Cell nucleus, grey; viral NP, red; MUC1/AQP5/S100A9, turquoise. The images in a–c are representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we identified two proteins, KCa1.1 and mGluR2, important for the CME of influenza virus. mGluR2 interacts with HA and serves as an endocytic receptor for the CME of influenza virus, and KCa1.1 facilitates this process by regulating the polymerization of F-actin, which is required for the maturation of CCPs of influenza virus and completion of the CME of influenza virus. Moreover, we found that mGluR2 knockout dramatically increases the resistance of mice to different subtypes of influenza viruses. Although influenza virus can enter cells through different ways, and other signalling pathways may also mediate the CME of influenza virus26, our study suggests that KCa1.1- and mGluR2-mediated CME is an important pathway for influenza virus internalization into cells.N-linked glycoprotein mGluR2 facilitates influenza virus CME, which is consistent with a previous report that influenza virus requires N-linked glycoprotein for entry5. However, it was not clear whether the endocytosis was dependent on the sialic acid of N-linked glycoprotein. There are five potential glycosylation sites (PGSs) in the ectodomain of mGluR2, and we proved that some of these sites are glycosylated because mGluR2 in which these PGSs were eliminated (mGluR2-mutant) moved faster than the wild type on western blotting (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c). Although we do not know whether the glycoprotein mGluR2 carries sialic acid, the elimination of PGSs does not affect the interaction of mGluR2 with influenza virus HA (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c), suggesting that their interaction could be independent of the sialic acid of mGluR2. Glycosylation is not a prerequisite for mGluR2 to initiate influenza virus endocytosis, but it is crucial for stabilizing and increasing cellular mGluR2 levels, as overexpressing of mGluR2-mutant did not completely restore influenza virus infection in mGluR2-knockdown cells owing to lower expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 8d–f). Our study suggests that influenza virus binding and endocytosis are mediated by different receptors, and that glycosylation is not a prerequisite for the N-linked glycoprotein to exert its endocytic receptor function.Several host factors have been reported to influence the influenza virus internalization8,15,16,17,18,19,20,22, but it is unclear which internalization pathway they are involved in except for FFAR2, which interacts with certain GPCR kinases and thereby influences the CME of influenza virus21. mGluR2 and KCa1.1 are both required for the CME of influenza virus. Due to the importance of KCa1.1 in cell biology, we were unable to generate KCa1.1-knockout mice and test its role in influenza virus replication in vivo. The mGluR2−/− mice can reproduce healthily and stably, suggesting that lack of mGluR2 may not affect the growth and development of animals. The pathogenicity of influenza viruses to humans is directly related to their extensive replication in the lungs46,47,48, and intracerebral replication is the main cause of mortality in avian species infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses49,50. Our study showed that mGluR2 knockout significantly reduces influenza virus replication in mouse lungs and prevents influenza virus replication in the mouse brain. Therefore, blocking the interaction between influenza virus HA and mGluR2 would be a promising host-directed antiviral strategy.MethodsEthics statementAnimal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China.

The siRNA-transfected A549 cells were maintained at 37 °C for 72 h before they were infected with influenza virus.The ion channel RNAi screening assay was performed in 96-well plates as described above. The siRNA-transfected A549 cells were maintained at 37 °C for 72 h before they were infected with H1N1 virus (MOI 0.01). The supernatants of the samples were collected for virus titration in MDCK cells at 24 h p.i. Wild-type A549 cells, non-targeting siControl-transfected cells and the siNP of H1N1-transfected cells were used as mock, negative and positive controls, respectively. The viral titres were normalized with those from siControl-transfected A549 cells.Drug inhibition assaysFor the paxilline inhibition assay, wild-type or siRNA-transfected A549 cells were pre-treated with drugs at different concentrations for 1 h before they were infected with influenza virus (MOI 5). At 24 h p.i., the supernatants were collected for virus titration in MDCK cells.For the paxilline-addition assay, A549 cells seeded in 6-well plates were treated with paxilline (25 μM) at −1, 0, 1, 2 or 3 h p.i. (MOI 5) and then cultured for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed to measure the vRNA level by qPCR.Viral binding assayFor the viral binding assay, the drug-treated and siRNA-transfected A549 cells in 6-well plates were infected with influenza virus (MOI 50) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with cold PBS and lysed to measure the vRNA levels by qPCR.Viral internalization assayFor the viral internalization assay, the drug-treated and siRNA-transfected A549 cells in 6-well plates were infected with influenza virus (MOI 50) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS and maintained at 37 °C for 2 h. Then, the cells were washed 8 times with cold acidic PBS (pH 1.3) to remove the virus retained on the surface of the plasma membrane. After that, the cells were lysed for the qPCR assay to analyse the vRNA in the cells. For the microscopy-based assay, virus-bound A549 cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS and maintained at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were fixed and the cell surface HA was analysed using the confocal laser scanning microscopy assay with the indicated antibodies.Microscopy-based assaysFor the three-dimensional confocal laser scanning microscopy assays, control A549 cells and KCa1.1-knockdown cells infected with H1N1 virus (MOI 50) were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After being washed 3 times with cold PBS, the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min and the cellular membrane was stained with DiD at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% saponion (this step was skipped for the unpermeabilized conditions). The permeabilized or unpermeabilized cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h and incubated with specific primary antibody for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with the indicated fluorophore-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with DAPI for 15 min to stain the cell nucleus. Images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope 980 (Carl Zeiss) and scanned with z-stacks of 40 layers.For the confocal laser scanning microscopy assays, A549 cells with different treatments were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and then treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min (the latter step was skipped for the unpermeabilized conditions). The permeabilized or unpermeabilized cells were then processed as described above except for staining the membrane with DiD. The fluorescence intensity of each cell was calculated using the ZEN software (Carl Zeiss).Western blottingThe plasmid-transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with Pierce IP Lysis Buffer containing Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and Benzonase for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,523 g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were then mixed with protein sample loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto a 4–12% ExpressPlus PAGE Gel and separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST buffer) and incubated with the indicated primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the indicated HRP secondary antibody. After the membrane was washed three times with PBST buffer, the target protein bands were visualized with Immobilon Crescendo Western HRP substrate using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor BioSciences). The intensities of bands were analysed using Image J software (version 1.53t).Co-immunoprecipitationFor the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the cells with different treatments were lysed as described for the western blotting assay and the supernatants of the cell lysates were mixed with 40 μl of protein G Agarose for 4 h at 4 °C on a flip shaker. The protein G beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected and mixed with anti-Flag-tag antibody-conjugated agarose beads or anti-Myc-tag antibody-conjugated agarose beads for 12 h at 4 °C on the flip shaker. After conjugation, the beads were washed five times with cold NP-40. The beads were re-suspended in PBS, mixed with protein sample loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and assessed by western blot analysis.Pull-down assayFor the pull-down assay, the recombinant HA–His protein expressed in eukaryotic cells was purified using FriendBio Technology. Plasmid overexpressing (Flag-tag) HEK293 cells were lysed, and the supernatants of the cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag antibody-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed with cold NP-40 and incubated with HA–His protein overnight. After conjugation, the beads were washed ten times with cold NP-40. The beads were re-suspended in PBS and mixed with protein sample loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and assessed by western blot analysis.STED super-resolution microscopyWe performed STED microscopy to observe the co-localization of HA and mGluR2 during viral internalization. Virus-internalized A549 cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above. The permeabilized cells were then incubated with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies, respectively. STED images were taken using an Abberior Instruments Stedycon equipped with an inverted IX83 microscope and a ×100/1.45 oil objective (Olympus). All acquisition operations were controlled using the Stedycon software (Abberior Instruments).Immunoelectron microscopy localization of mGluR2 and influenza virusThe mGluR2-Myc-overexpressing A549 cells were infected with H1N1 virus (MOI 200) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h; the bound virus was allowed to internalize at room temperature for 5 min after binding. The cells were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% PFA, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were dehydrated with 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% DMF, respectively, at 4 °C for 15 min; then, the samples were processed for embedding with UV irradiation polymerization at −20 °C for 10 days. Then, the samples were incubated with the primary antibody of Myc-tag for 40 min at room temperature. After abundant washes with distilled water, the samples were incubated with the secondary antibody of goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with gold (10 nm) for 40 min at room temperature. After abundant washes with distilled water, the samples were stained with uranyl acetate for 10 min, and images of the localization of mGluR2 and influenza virus were acquired by means of transmission electron microscopy.Antibody blocking assayA monoclonal antibody against mGluR2 (mGluR2-ma, 200 mg ml−1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CN sc271654) was used for the antibody blocking assay. A549 cells were incubated with 0.12 ml of opti-MEM containing different concentrations of mGluR2–ma (10 μg ml−1, 20 μg ml−1, 30 μg ml−1, 40 μg ml−1) or control isotype antibody IgG2a (40 μg ml−1) at 4 °C for 1 h, and then were washed three times with opti-MEM containing the corresponding antibodies. The cells were then infected with the antibody–virus mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After another round of three washes, the cells were incubated with 0.1 ml of opti-MEM containing the corresponding antibodies at 37 °C. At 48 h p.i., the supernatants of the samples were collected for virus titration in cells.Infectivity neutralization assayThe infectivity neutralization assay was performed on A549 cells with the soluble protein of mGluR2 (mGluR2–GST) that was expressed and purified using FriendBio Technology52. Viruses were mixed with different concentrations of mGluR2–GST (400 μg ml−1, 600 μg ml−1 or 800 μg ml−1) or control GST protein (800 μg ml−1) in 0.1 ml of opti-MEM at 4 °C for 1 h. A549 cells in 96-well plates were infected with the protein–virus mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with opti-MEM to remove the unbound viruses and were then maintained with 0.1 ml of opti-MEM medium containing the corresponding proteins at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatants of the samples were collected for virus titration in cells.Transferrin internalization assayA549 cells with different treatments were washed twice with PBS and maintained in opti-MEM for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were incubated with 5 µg ml−1 Alexa Fluor 488-labelled transferrin for 30 min. To stop the internalization, the cells were incubated with cold wash buffer (50 mM glycine, 100 mM NaCl, pH 3.0) for 2 min. Then, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min and the unpermeabilized cells were incubated with DAPI for 15 min to stain the cell nucleus. Images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope 980 (Carl Zeiss).F-actin polymerization assayThe viral internalization assay was performed in drug-treated or siRNA-transfected A549 cells; the cells were fixed and washed three times with PBS and incubated with Phalloidin iFlour 488 for 1 h. Then, the F-actin polymerization in the cells was analysed by performing a confocal laser scanning microscopy assay.Detection of CCPs during virus internalization using transmission electron microscopyThe process of influenza virus internalization was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Briefly, A549 cells treated with KCa1.1 knockdown, mGluR2 knockdown or chlorpromazine (30 μM) were infected with viruses (MOI 200) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The bound virus was allowed to internalize at room temperature for the indicated times; then, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 16 h. Ultrathin sections were prepared on carbon-coated 100-mesh copper grids and observed in a Hitachi-7650 transmission electron microscope at an operating voltage of 80 kV. The formation of viral particle CCPs was calculated.Mouse experimentGroups of 16 wild-type and mGluR2−/− mice were intranasally infected with 10 MLD50 of H1N1 virus, H5N6 virus or H7N9 virus. Three mice in each group were euthanized on days 3 and 5 p.i., and their organs were collected for virus titration in MDCK cells. The remaining 10 mice in each group were monitored for body weight changes and survival for 14 days.Groups of two wild-type and mGluR2−/− mice were intranasally infected with 10 MLD50 of H1N1 virus, H5N6 virus or H7N9 virus. The mice were euthanized on day 3 p.i., and their lungs were collected for immunohistochemistry study and cell type identification as described by others47. For immunohistochemistry study, mouse anti-nucleoprotein mAb antibody and horse anti-mouse IgG coupled with HRP were used as primary antibody and secondary antibody, respectively. For cell type identification, the lung sections of mice were first incubated with the mouse anti-nucleoprotein mAb antibody as the primary antibody and visualized using goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Cy3. The sections were then washed with TBS and incubated with either the rabbit anti-AQP5 mAb antibody, rabbit anti-MUC1 mAb antibody or rabbit anti-S100A9 mAb antibody. The cell markers (AQP5, MUC1 and S100A9) were visualized using goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with fluorescein. Sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed using the Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope.Infection restoration assayA549 cells or mGluR2-knockdown A549 cells were transfected with pCAGGS, pmGluR2 or pmGluR2 mutant for 24 h, respectively. Then, the cells were infected with H1N1 virus (MOI 0.01) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatants of the samples were collected for virus titration in cells.Membrane protein extractionA549 cells were transfected with pCAGGS, pmGluR2 or pmGluR2 mutant for 24 h. Membrane proteins were isolated from 3 × 108 cells using the Minute Plasma Membrane Protein Isolation and Cell Fractionation kit and following the manufacturer’s instructions. The plasma membrane proteins were analysed by western blotting.Flow cytometryA549 cells were transfected with pmGluR2 or pmGluR2 mutant for 24 h and collected in a 1.5 ml tube. Then, the cells were washed three times with FACS wash buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS) and fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min (this step was skipped for the unpermeabilized conditions). The permeabilized or unpermeabilized cells were incubated with mouse anti-mGluR2 mAb (1:100) as the primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000) as the secondary antibody. The cells were analysed using a FC-500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The fluorescence intensity of mGluR2 was analysed using FlowJo software.Statistics and reproducibilityFor all the bar and violin graphs, data are shown as the mean ± s.d. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software v.8.00 for the unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test as indicated in the figure legends. The log-rank (Mantel–Cox) method was used for survival analysis. Differences in means were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05, and significance levels are as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; and ****P < 0.0001; NS, not significant. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications17,20,21,51,52. Data collection was not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments, but analysis was blinded. No animals or data points were excluded from the analyses.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The scientists had also announced plans to use the H5 probe to test samples from all 190 WastewaterSCAN sites.The team emphasized that the test isn't specific to H5N1 and can pick up low-pathogenic H5 influenza viruses. Also, they cautioned that the test can't identify the species that shed the H5 virus or the source. Detections could be coming from dairy-processing discharge or from other animals or humans.Test results on the dashboard range from May 7 to May 30. Most of the positive detections are from sites in Michigan and Texas, two of the states hit hardest by H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows. A few detections were also reported from a testing site in Idaho, another state where H5N1 has infected dairy cows.The dashboard, however, also shows a few detections in states that haven't reported H5N1 in dairy cows—Iowa and Minnesota. Both states, though, have reported recent H5N1 outbreaks in commercial poultry. Minnesota reported detections at three different locations (Mankato, Red Wing, and St. Cloud), and Iowa reported a detection in Marshalltown.Iowa disaster proclamationGovernor Reynolds yesterday announced the disaster proclamation for highly pathogenic avian flu in Cherokee County, the same day the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm in the county.In her statement, Reynolds said the disaster proclamation allows state agency resources to assist with tracking and monitoring, rapid detection, containment, disposal, and disinfection. She also added that the declaration waives rules for commercial vehicles that respond to affected sites.In other avian flu developments:The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported 11 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, all from previously affected states, bringing the total to 80. They include Idaho, Michigan, and South Dakota.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently posted its strategy for enhanced flu surveillance over the summer, given ongoing activity in cows, poultry, and other animals, and sporadic detections in farmworkers.Scientists reporting preprint findings on a massive 2023 H5N1 outbreak in Argentina's elephant seals described more evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission, as well as 18 mutations possibly linked to increased virulence, transmission, or adaptation to mammals. Eleven of them were found in the H5N1 virus that had infected a person in Chile. The team also identified a marine-mammal–specific clade.

All Rights Reserved.ExpandJune 7, 2024By Chuck GillUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Multiple states since March 2024 have reported dairy herds displaying symptoms caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI. The H5N1 strain found in the cows is the same virus that, since 2022, has caused outbreaks in poultry across the country, leading to the loss of almost 97 million birds — mostly chickens and turkeys — including more than 4.7 million in Pennsylvania. Although there is little mortality associated with the disease in cattle, affected cows often exhibit a drop in feed intake and milk production, thickened abnormal milk and abnormal manure, among other symptoms. These outbreaks have raised questions about how the virus spreads, how producers can protect their animals, the risk of infection in people, the safety of milk and meat supplies, and other issues. Penn State News spoke with extension veterinarian Ernest Hovingh, clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences in the College of Agricultural Sciences and director of the college's Animal Diagnostic Laboratory, to answer these and other questions related to the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle. Q: How did dairy cows become infected with avian flu? Hovingh: Wild birds — especially waterfowl — which are natural carriers of avian influenza are believed to be the original source of infections in cattle. It appears that many, if not all, of the infections since an initial “spillover event” to cattle have been associated with the movement of cattle from an affected herd to another herd. How the virus is spreading is not yet completely understood, but there's evidence of cow-to-cow transfer. Some of that might be via fomites — objects or materials that can be contaminated with a pathogen — such as contaminated milk from a cow coming in contact with another cow, since milk from infected cows tends to have high levels of virus. Q: If avian flu virus can be present in cow milk, is the milk we buy at the store safe to drink? Hovingh: Milk from cows that are known to be sick is diverted from the milk supply, in accordance with Food and Drug Administration regulations. But even if viral or bacterial pathogens are present in raw milk, the milk sold for processing or retail sale in interstate commerce must be pasteurized by law, and pasteurization was developed to inactivate any harmful organisms. The FDA also has announced that, although HPAI virus fragments have been found in some pasteurized milk samples, the pasteurization process inactivates the virus so it is not a risk to consumers. Q: What about beef, poultry meat and eggs? Are those safe to consume? Hovingh: To verify the safety of the meat supply in the wake of the current avian flu outbreak, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has conducted three beef safety studies related to avian influenza in meat from dairy cattle. These studies suggested that beef purchased at retail outlets that is cooked to recommended temperatures is safe to eat. Penn State Extension food safety experts have said that consumers who follow proper food handling and cooking practices as highlighted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website can minimize the risk of foodborne pathogens, including HPAI. Q: Can avian flu infect people? Hovingh: Despite HPAI showing up recently in livestock and other mammals, federal authorities said that they have found no evidence that the virus has evolved to make it more transmissible to humans and between people. And while three cases of human infection appear to have occurred in farm workers who were in direct contact with infected cattle, they said they believe that the current risk to the public remains low. Regardless, experts recommend that people working with dairy cows on infected farms take precautions. If you have a herd that tests positive, since there is a good bit of virus in the milk, the CDC recommends eye protection, masks and gloves, among other protections for those in direct contact with cattle. Having personal protective equipment on hand can assure a farm is prepared should they suspect the disease. Q: How can dairy farmers keep their herds safe from HPAI? Hovingh: Penn State Extension offers biosecurity recommendations to help protect cattle and other animals from HPAI, such as avoiding bringing new animals onto the farm, especially lactating animals; limiting visitors to those essential to the farm; thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment if moved between premises; and developing a biosecurity plan, including premovement testing for any animals that must be brought onto the farm. Should this virus show up in dairy cattle in the commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture will require an HPAI-positive herd to have an approved biosecurity plan in place. Since the disease affects cows differently than it does poultry, animals would not be euthanized to control HPAI in dairy cattle. Q: How else is Penn State involved in addressing the current HPAI outbreak? Hovingh: The Animal Diagnostic Lab at Penn State, one of three facilities in the state-funded Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, is equipped to test milk and nasal swabs from cows that are suspected of being infected with the virus. In response to a federal order that requires testing of lactating cows before they can move across state lines, the lab already is testing such milk samples. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture also has placed testing requirements on the movement of dairy cattle into Pennsylvania. To identify pathogens and monitor their spread — including those that cause zoonotic illnesses that may jump to people — the lab also routinely conducts testing for HPAI and other diseases affecting poultry, livestock and other animals. These include serology tests, or blood-based tests that look for antibodies to a pathogen and indicate a prior infection, and PCR tests, or molecular tests that look for active infections. Penn State Extension is partnering with the Center for Dairy Excellence to provide Everyday Biosecurity Kits to dairy farms at no cost. The kits include a compilation of printed biosecurity resources from across the industry. In addition, Penn State Extension educators are available to assist farms in writing biosecurity plans. To identify an educator in their area who can assist, producers can contact Samantha Gehrett, dairy extension educator and Dairy Team co-leader, at smr5319@psu.edu or 717-240-6502. Q: Where can I find more information? Hovingh: Penn State Extension offers webinars, workshops, fact sheets and other resources to provide dairy and poultry producers with the latest information and recommendations. The USDA also provides information on avian flu in birds and livestock, and additional information — including how to report suspected cases of avian influenza in poultry or livestock — can be found on the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture website.

Lucey, MD, MPH, FIDSA 6/5/2024 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Influenza vaccine producer CSL Seqirus has been selected by the U.S. government to complete the fill and finish process for a “pre-pandemic vaccine that is well-matched to the H5 of the currently circulating H5N1 strain,” according to a May 30 press release from the company about the agreement. CSL Seqirus will deliver approximately 4.8 million doses of the vaccine as part of the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile program. The company’s manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina — built through a partnership established in 2019 with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — “is the largest cell-based influenza vaccine producer in the world and is the first such domestic facility,” the release said. Also on May 30, an MMWR article noted that the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at HHS is supporting the clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of an influenza A/Astrakhan/3212/2020–like virus vaccine. “The clinical study (NCT05874713) testing cell-based antigen combined with MF59 adjuvant … has completed enrollment,” according to the article. The official title of this fully enrolled CSL Seqirus study is “A Phase 2, Multi-Center, Randomized, Observer-Blind Study, to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of Homologous or Heterologous Priming and Booster Vaccinations With H5N8 or H5N6 MF59-adjuvanted, Cell Culture-derived Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Subjects ≥18 Years of Age.” Proactive and effective communication by the U.S. government with the public, health care providers, public health workers, journalists, politicians and others about the rationale for why this first candidate vaccine — using the Astrakhan H5 antigen, the MF59 adjuvant and cell-based (rather than egg-based) production — was chosen will be important.

Increasingly Adapting to Mammals Elephant Seal Outbreak Marks First Transnational Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Mammals by Kat Kerlin June 05, 2024 News Luciana Gallo of BIOMAR-CONICET and Marcela Uhart of UC Davis sample for highly pathogenic H5N1 among cormorants (by shore) and terns (in greenery) at Punta Leon in Argentina in November 2023. The tern colony later died from the virus. (Martin Brogger) Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses are becoming increasingly flexible and are adapting to mammals in new ways that could have global consequences for humans, wildlife and livestock, according to a new study of a massive outbreak among elephant seals in Argentina in 2023.The study, published as a preprint and co-led by University of California, Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) in Argentina, shows clear mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus. It states the outbreak is the first known, multinational transmission of the virus in mammals ever observed globally, with the same virus appearing in several pinniped species across different countries over a short period of time. The study’s genomic analysis showed the virus is now evolving into separate avian and marine mammal clades in South America, which is unprecedented. There is growing concern that H5N1 viruses adapted to mammal transmission could jump to other species, including people.“This is increased evidence that we should be alert, especially for marine mammals,” said co-leading author Marcela Uhart, a veterinarian with the UC Davis Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center and its Latin America Program. “The more it adapts to mammals the more important it becomes for humans.” A healthy elephant seal. Nearly all pups born at Península Valdés in Argentina died from H5N1 during the fall 2023 breeding season. (Valeria Falabella) Dead elephant seals and a bird carcass line the beach at Punta Delgada in Argentina on October 10, 2023, during the H5N1 outbreak. (Ralph Vanstreels, UC Davis) An outbreak unfoldsThe current variant of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b began to cause problems at a global scale in 2020. While humans confronted the COVID-19 pandemic, H5N1, or “avian influenza,” began killing tens of thousands of seabirds in Europe before moving to South Africa. In 2022, it entered the U.S. and Canada, threatening poultry and wild birds, and then spread to South America in late 2022.By February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in Argentina for the first time, affecting poultry primarily in inland central Argentina for five months. By August 2023, after two months of no outbreaks in poultry, the virus was found in sea lions at the tip of South America off the Atlantic coastline of Tierra del Fuego island. From there, it moved swiftly northward, with deadly results, first for marine mammals and later for seabirds.In October 2023, following outbreaks in sea lions, the study authors surveyed a breeding colony of elephant seals at Punta Delgada along the coast of Península Valdés, Argentina. They recorded unprecedented mass mortality — some 17,000 elephant seals were dead. By November, 96% of pups born that season would die. Test results confirmed that HPAI H5N1 was present in the seals as well as in several terns that died at the same time. This map of Argentina found in the study shows pathways of the spread of H5N1 HPAI (2.3.4.4b) viruses in South America, from 2022–2023. The virus’ separation into avian and marine mammal clades unfolded as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b — specifically genotype B3.2 — arrived on the continent through migratory birds before spilling over to mammals. It then separated from the avian clade virus to become its own, marine mammal-adapted virus. Concerningly, while the virus moves across pinnipeds, it can also still infect birds. That was evident in the study, where the virus found in terns was identical to that from elephant seals.“We’re showing the evolution of this marine mammal virus over time,” said virologist and co-leading author Agustina Rimondi of INTA. “This virus is capable of adapting to mammals, as we can see from the mutations that are consistently found in the viruses belonging to the mammalian clade.”Influenza viruses commonly mutate and exchange gene segments, enabling them to adapt to new hosts.Uhart and Rimondi said it is critically important that monitoring and investigation continue to better understand the consequences of the virus to human health, wildlife conservation and ecology.

When mice consumed infected raw milk, they showed signs of illness, suggesting that drinking raw milk may pose a risk of transmission to people. Heating milk in ways similar to pasteurization significantly reduced levels of the virus. An outbreak of H5N1 avian flu virus in dairy cows has been widespread this year. StockMediaSeller / Shutterstock Certain influenza viruses are found in wild and domestic birds, earning the disease they cause the name “bird flu.” Over the last two decades, about 900 people have been infected with an avian influenza virus called H5N1. Most of them have had close contact with infected birds. Past H5N1 strains have proven deadly for people, killing about half of those they’ve infected. However, to date, these H5N1 viruses haven’t spread effectively from person to person, limiting their potential to cause a pandemic. In the past few years, a highly pathogenic avian H5N1, called HPAI H5N1, has spread from birds to infect more than 50 other animal species, including many kinds of mammals. In late March of this year, the first outbreak of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cows in the U.S. was reported. Three infections of people working with dairy cows have been picked up by virus surveillance methods. So far, symptoms have been mild. HPAI H5N1 hasn’t yet gained the ability to spread directly between people. But researchers are concerned that infections could happen through the consumption of raw milk. Dairy milk purchased in the grocery store has been pasteurized—heated to a level high enough and long enough to kill most viruses or bacteria in the milk. However, 30 states in the U.S. allow the sale of raw dairy milk in some form. In a new NIH-funded study, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory used mice to test whether HPAI H5N1 found in raw milk can cause infections. Results were published on May 24, 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine. Three influenza A (H5N1/bird flu) virus particles (rod-shaped; purple). CDC and NIAID The researchers collected milk samples from cows in New Mexico that had been infected with HPAI H5N1. The samples contained a total of 8 different HPAI H5N1 viruses. The team first heated infected milk at 63°C (145°F) for 5, 10, 20 or 30 minutes. All these experiments reduced the virus to levels that couldn’t be detected by a standard test. When using higher heat—72°C (161°F)—for briefer periods of 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 seconds, levels of the virus were reduced but not eliminated. These temperatures mimicked those used in milk pasteurization. The experiments suggest that heat may be able to neutralize HPAI H5N1 in dairy milk. However, additional work is needed to directly test whether industrial pasteurization methods kill the virus. The researchers also stored raw milk infected with H5N1 in refrigerated conditions (4°C, or 39°F) for 5 weeks and found only a small decline in virus levels. This shows that the virus can likely remain infectious in raw milk when maintained at refrigerated temperatures. Finally, the scientists fed milk from a cow infected with an HPAI H5N1 strain to five mice. All animals showed signs of illness by 1 day after exposure to the milk. When the team examined the animals’ organs 4 days after infection, they found HPAI H5N1 throughout their bodies, including the nasal passages and lungs. The results suggest that consumption of raw milk may pose a risk for H5N1 infection. “We must emphasize that the conditions used in our laboratory study are not identical to the large-scale industrial treatment of raw milk,” notes lead researcher Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “It’s important to remember that our heat-treatment findings may not perfectly translate to real-world conditions.” However, to date, there hasn’t been evidence that commercially pasteurized milk poses an infection risk.Related LinksResearch in Context: Progress Toward Universal VaccinesUsing mRNA Technology for a Universal Flu VaccineStudy Suggests Way to Improve Flu VaccinesStrategy May Improve Seasonal Flu VaccinesFinding Factors That Protect Against FluIs It Flu, COVID-19, Allergies, or a Cold?Information on Bird Flu (CDC)InfluenzaPandemic PreparednessReferences: Cow's Milk Containing Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus - Heat Inactivation and Infectivity in Mice.

There are four different antiviral drugs that are recommended for use in the U.S. for the treatment of influenza: oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir. What to do if you get sick If you or your family members become sick with flu-like symptoms, take the following actions: Contact your health care provider and let them know about your symptoms and that you have been around pigs. Your doctor may prescribe treatment with flu antiviral medications and may want a nose and throat specimen collected from you for testing at your state health department. Antiviral treatment for flu works best when started soon after symptoms begin. Stay home from work and school, avoid travel, and avoid or limit contact with other people and pigs as much as possible until you know you do not have variant influenza virus infection. Take action to protect other people and healthy pigs from getting sick. Practice good respiratory and hand hygiene. This includes covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and putting used tissues in a waste basket. Always wash your hands before and after coughing or sneezing. This is to lower the risk of spreading whatever virus infection you have to others. Flu signs and symptoms‎ Flu signs and symptoms usually include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Keep Reading: Flu treatment Treatment for novel influenza virus infections Almost all flu cases in people are caused by human influenza viruses, not viruses from pigs. However, if you are infected with an influenza A virus of animal origin, the health department will want to talk with you about your illness and make sure that other people you live and work with are not sick with the same virus. If you do get sick with variant influenza, there are prescription antiviral medications that can treat your illness. Illnesses associated with variant influenza virus infection have been mostly mild with symptoms similar to those of human seasonal flu. However, serious illness can occur, especially in people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. It is important to contact your doctor right away and tell them if you develop flu symptoms and have had recent exposure to pigs or settings where pigs are kept. People at higher risk Certain people are at greater risk of serious flu-related complications (including young children, elderly persons, pregnant women and people with certain long-term medical conditions) and this is true both for seasonal flu and novel flu virus infections. (A full list of people at higher risk of flu related complications is available at People at High Risk of Developing Flu-Related Complications.) If these people develop flu-like symptoms, it's best for them to contact their doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs that can treat flu, including variant influenza virus infection. These drugs work better for treatment the sooner they are started. If you are prescribed antiviral drugs by your doctor, you should finish all of the medication, according to your doctor's instructions. Also, whenever you have flu symptoms and are seeing a health care provider, always remember to tell them if you have asthma, diabetes, heart disease, neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, are pregnant, or are older than 65 or younger than 5 years. These conditions and age factors put you at high risk of serious complications if you have the flu.

It furnishes practical tools needed to support governmental veterinary services in vaccination decision-making and implementing vaccination programs effectively in the field.HPAI is a severe and highly contagious disease that has severe impacts on animal and human health, livelihoods, and the economy. The disease has also spilled over to several mammalian species, and may result in severe ecological and biodiversity consequences."This course comes at the right time when there is an alarming spread of HPAI in poultry, wild animals and other mammals. Vaccination is one of the tools, increasingly being considered to prevent HPAI at source. However, vaccination must be planned with well defined objectives, applying good quality, safe and well-matched vaccines. This course provides countries with the guidance to do so " says Madhur Dhingra, FAO Senior animal health officer. In a span of four weeks, the course systematically covers avian influenza vaccine stewardship, addressing a variety of topics. These include selecting, procuring, and administering vaccines; identifying vaccine platforms; monitoring and surveillance of vaccinated flocks; vaccine failure; detecting and managing antigenic variant viruses; revising vaccination programs; and assessing the poultry value chain to mitigate HPAI risks."This innovative online course goes beyond theory, offering a deep dive into avian influenza vaccine stewardship. During the four weeks the training is open, participants have the opportunity to discuss and share experiences among themselves and with world’s leading subject matter experts " says Ms Maria DeLaPuenteArevalo, Virtual Learning Centers Coordinator. This course will be adapted, translated, and delivered across multiple FAO regions. Around 300 participants can take the course at the same time and it's compatible across multiple platforms, such as smartphones, computers, and tablets, and it is accessible upon registration on the FAO VLCs platform.

It’s deadly for poultry, but does it pose a significant risk to humans?Get more newsLiveonJune 6, 2024, 9:40 PM UTCBy Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Is there a new strain of bird flu to be worried about? On Wednesday, the World Health Organization reported the first confirmed human case of the H5N2 type of bird flu in a 59-year-old man in Mexico who died in April.The case adds to growing anxiety about the risk of bird flu spreading among people, especially because the man had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, according to WHO. The strain is different from the outbreak of bird flu virus, called H5N1, that is circulating among herds of dairy cows in the United States and has caused mild infection among three farm workers.What is H5N2?H5N2 is just one of several kinds of avian influenza viruses. Does it actually pose a significant health risk to humans?An exposure to H5 virus in Mexico isn’t surprising, said Dr. Troy Sutton, an assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State. H5 viruses have been circulating among poultry and wild birds in Mexico since the mid-1990s. However, unlike other avian influenza strains that have caused outbreaks in humans — such H1 and H3 viruses — H5 viruses rarely infect humans.Chickens in cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa, in 2009.Charlie Neibergall / AP fileThe viruses are classified based on two types of protein on their surfaces: hemagglutinin, or H, which plays a crucial role in allowing the virus to infect cells, and neuraminidase, or N, which helps the virus spread. Many different combinations of H and N proteins are possible.H5N2 belongs to a family of bird flu viruses called H5, which primarily infects wild birds. There are a total of nine known subtypes of H5 viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. H5N1, which was detected in dairy cows in the U.S. in March, also belongs to this family. It is commonly associated with highly contagious strains of H5 viruses called the “Goose Guangdong lineage” that have caused numerous outbreaks in poultry over the last 20 years and sporadic infections in humans, said Sutton. H5N1 has infected people in 23 countries since 1997, according to the CDC, resulting in severe pneumonia and death in about 50% of cases.“They are a separate lineage with a separate history and a separate sort of story around the disease they cause,” Sutton said of the H5N2 and H5N1 viruses.Should people be concerned? The patient in Mexico had been bedridden for several weeks prior to developing symptoms.According to WHO, on April 17, the man developed fever, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath and general malaise. A week later, on April 24, he was hospitalized and died that day. Sutton said that it’s important to note that the man had multiple underlying medication conditions, which likely exacerbated his infection.“The person may have already been quite sick,” Sutton said. “That changes the calculation a little bit more than, say, a healthy farm worker getting infected.”The WHO said no other cases were reported during its investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the patient died, one reported a runny nose.However, experts still don’t know how the man became infected with the virus, as he wasn’t exposed to poultry or to other animals. If he was infected by another human, that suggests that there could be additional unidentified cases. “It is concerning that a new virus subtype has infected a human,” Sutton said.Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, said human-to-human transmission is unlikely. “They likely picked it up from the same place.”Data shows that the H5N2 virus that infected the man is a low pathogenic virus, meaning it is unlikely to cause severe illness, said Osterholm. “There’s high path and low path, and the high path has certain genetic changes. It makes it much more likely to cause serious illness,” Osterholm said. “And the readily transmitted low path oftentimes can infect any number of animal species with little or no symptoms.”What scientists want to knowDr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the main question among experts is whether the H5N2 has mutated in some way that has made it easier to spread to humans.H5 viruses, in general, he said, struggle to infect people because the cell receptors they target in birds are much different than ours.That’s often why, he said, people become infected with H5 viruses through direct contact with birds and poultry, not other humans.H5N1, which has evolved to cause infections in humans infrequently, has never caused widespread human-to-human transmission, he added.“The fact that it is H5N2, as compared to H5N1, I don’t think is meaningful in terms of representing something that is more likely to be associated with a pandemic,” Offit said. “If the virus can’t reproduce itself well in the upper respiratory tract, it’s not going to be able to spread easily from human to human.”Sutton said that scientists still need to conduct further genetic sequencing of the H5N2 virus that infected the Mexican man before they’re able to determine whether it’s a risk to humans.“Until we have that information, it’s really hard to draw a lot of conclusions.”Osterholm said the H5N1 is really the one we need to be “laser focused” on. The H5N1 virus has taken off in dairy cows in the U.S., infecting at least 84 herds across nine states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, raising the possibility that it could acquire mutations that allow it to spill over in humans.

The key benefit of this approach is its ability to detect regime shifts from non-epidemic to epidemic states, which is particularly beneficial with the year-round presence of non-zero Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) data. This integration allows for the incorporation of external factors that trigger the onset of the influenza season-factors that mechanistic models alone might not adequately capture. Applied to ILI data collected in Korea from 2005 to 2020, our method demonstrated stable peak time predictions for seasonal influenza outbreaks, particularly in years characterized by unusual onset times or epidemic magnitudes.

Outbreak characteristics, such as peak time and intensity, also vary considerably year-to-year so that such differences make timely healthcare preparedness measures, including resource allocations, hospital staffing, and dissemination of alerts, challenging4. The ability to predict the influenza peak several weeks in advance can be helpful for timely preventive public health planning and responses to mitigate these outbreaks5,6, and flu forecasting can significantly reduce the disease burden on the population7,8,9,10.Several of the major approaches applied to modeling influenza transmission and dynamics have been applied to the forecasting of influenza outbreaks11. In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated a yearly nationwide influenza forecasting challenge6,12. The CDC has set predictive targets for public health decision-makers in the United States regarding the influenza season through real-time forecasting (1–4 weeks ahead). One particular emphasis of this consortium was not just simple all-or-nothing forecasts, but rather a probabilistic forecasting framework (i.e., estimating the likelihood of the influenza season reaching its peak within the next week or 2, etc.). The predictive outcomes encompass two types: temporal outcomes (e.g., peak time, duration of the epidemic) and intensity outcomes (e.g., peak magnitude, attack rates)13,14. A number of algorithms are developed in an attempt to forecast flu outbreaks15,16,17,18,19,20. Besides statistical approaches, many of those include compartmental models in their algorithms. In some studies, influenza is predicted using compartmental model with filtering method, which is a mathematical and statistical method that combines observation (data) and prior by the compartmental model to generate a posterior (new estimate)18,21,22.Influenza forecasting requires predictive models parameterized by influenza surveillance data18,23,24. Often we utilize ILI surveillance data25, which represents the number of patient visits related to influenza-like illness as a proportion of the total number of patient visits. ILI cases are observed year-round, posing challenges in pinpointing the onset of the season. Identifying season onset, from when cases begin to increase exponentially is crucial for estimating the epidemic’s growth rate. The season onset varies by region and from year to year, and it depends on external factors such as viral evolution or environmental and social factors26. Several algorithms are designed to trigger official alerts of season onset. In a flu alarm system, the threshold is typically derived from historical ILI data and represents a level above the baseline where increased disease activity is expected. For example, the regional onset time of an epidemic is defined as the first of two consecutive weeks during which the incidence rate of ILI surpasses 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants27. Alternatively, the onset of wintertime influenza is defined as the day when the observed excess P &I mortality rate, due to respiratory and influenza-related causes, exceeds the prescribed threshold level for the previous two weeks. For instance, setting the threshold at 0.01 deaths per 100, 000 people per day, the day when the mortality rate exceeds this threshold is considered the start of the influenza season28. More sophisticated methods, such as Bayesian Markov Switching Models-a type of regime shift model-have been suggested to detect epidemic onset29,30. This method divides a series of incidence data into epidemic and non-epidemic stages and then identifies the epidemic onset.When employing mechanistic models for flu forecasting, the estimation of model parameters is necessary. These parameters may exhibit year-to-year variations, particularly transmission rate may fluctuate based on factors such as the circulating flu strain in the season. For parameter estimation, real-time surveillance data reflecting the flu incidence is utilized. Determining the appropriate time window for training the model requires knowledge of the season onset, which currently lacks a standard method of determination. In most influenza predictions, the season onset is either fixed or determined based on an incidence threshold: Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this approach has not been utilized for peak prediction.In this study, we employ the existing Bayesian Markov Switching approach to identify the onset of influenza outbreaks from 2005 to 2020 in Korea. Using estimated yearly season onset and ILI surveillance data, we then predict influenza peaks by fitting the SIR model to a few weeks of data since the onset weeks we identified. The accuracy of our suggested approach in predicting peak time is compared with those obtained using different assumptions for the season onset.Material and methodsDataFor effective influenza forecasting, we utilize the data that can be collected in a timely manner. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) operates an influenza monitoring system year-round, from September to August of the following year, in anticipation of the winter epidemic. It involves a network of outpatient clinics, which report the number of patients they have treated for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) on a weekly basis. The weekly ILI consultation rate in Korea, defined as the number of patient visits for influenza-like illness per 1000 outpatient visits, is depicted in Figs. 1 and 2. Though the temporal trends of ILI incidence from 2005 to 2020 reveal a consistent pattern of winter-to-spring spread, the timing for the season onset and the annual epidemic peak vary across years. To estimate the onset and peak time of the epidemic, we utilize the weekly ILI data available in the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) website31,32.Figure 1Weekly ILI cases per 1000 outpatients in South Korea from week 36 of each year to week 35 of the subsequent year, covering the period from 2005 to 2020.Full size imageFigure 2Weekly ILI cases per 1000 outpatients in South Korea from week 36 of each year to week 35 of the subsequent year, covering the period from 2005 to 2020.Full size imageStep 1: Detection of the season onsetAs a preliminary step in our peak time prediction, we determine the onset of the seasonal outbreak in each year. For the comparative analysis of the accuracy of peak time prediction using different methods in the detection of the season onset, we present three different ways to detect season onset, namely Markov switching, threshold-based detection, and fixed-time detection. Fixed-time detection In detection approach, we follow the convention of using October 1 (week 40) as the onset time for each year. Threshold-based detection Although previous research has utilized threshold-based approaches to estimate the onset time of the flu season, there is no standard method for setting the threshold. In this study, the onset time is defined as the first week when the ILI rate exceeds a certain threshold value. Markov Switching In Ref.30, Hidden Markov models are utilized to distinguish between epidemic and non-epidemic phases. We adopt this approach to identify the season onset, which we define as the first week of regime shifts from non-epidemic to epidemic, starting from the beginning of the influenza season in a given year. For \(i \in \{1,\ldots ,52\}\) and \(j \in \{1,\ldots ,15 \}\), we define \(Y_{i,j}\) as the observed difference of the ILI rates between week \(i+1\) and week i in year j, and \(Z_{i,j}\) as an unobserved random variable that indicates the phase of the system: 1 for epidemic and 0 for non-epidemic. To infer the unobservable state \(Z_{i,j}\) using the observed data \(Y_{i,j}\), we consider a two-state Markov chain of order 1 with the transition probabilities defined as follows: \(k,l \in \{0,1\}\), \(P_{k,l}=P(Z_{i+1,j}=l|Z_{i,j}=k),\) where \(P_{k,0}+P_{k,1}=1\). The conditional distribution of \(Y_{i,j}\) is determined based on whether the system is in an epidemic or non-epidemic phase, noting that non-epidemic dynamics typically feature small random fluctuations around zero, while epidemic dynamics are characterized by larger and more correlated changes30. We model the conditional distribution of \(Y_{i,j}\) as follows: for \(i \in \{2,\ldots ,52\}\) and \(j \in \{1,\ldots ,15 \}\),$$ \begin{aligned} & Y_{{1,j}} |(Z_{{1,j}} = 0)\sim N(0,\sigma _{{0,j}}^{2} ), \\ & Y_{{1,j}} |(Z_{{1,j}} = 1)\sim N(0,\sigma _{{1,j}}^{2} ), \\ & Y_{{i,j}} |(Z_{{i,j}} = 0)\sim N(0,\sigma _{{0,j}}^{2} ), \\ & Y_{{i,j}} |(Z_{{i,j}} = 1)\sim N(\rho Y_{{i - 1,j}} ,\sigma _{{1,j}}^{2} ), \\ \end{aligned} $$where N denotes a normal distribution. Note that we only need to estimate \(\rho \), \(P_{0,0}\), \(P_{1,1}\) and \(\{{\sigma ^2_{0,j}, \sigma ^2_{1,j}: j = 1,\cdots ,15}\}\). To estimate the parameters of the model, we employ the Bayesian method with prior distributions$$ \rho \sim U( - 1,1),\quad P_{{0,0}} \sim B(0.5,0.5),\quad P_{{1,1}} \sim B(0.5,0.5). $$here, U denotes a uniform distribution and B denotes a Beta distribution. Additionally, considering that \(\sigma ^2_{0,j}\) should be lower than \(\sigma ^2_{1,j}\) because it only reflects random variations rather than the effects of an epidemic, we express our prior knowledge about \(\{{\sigma ^2_{0,j}, \sigma ^2_{1,j}: j = 1,\ldots , 15}\}\) via the following hierarchical structure:$$ \sigma _{{0,j}} \sim U(\theta _{{low}} ,\theta _{{mid1}} ),\quad \sigma _{{1,j}} \sim U(\theta _{{mid2}} ,\theta _{{\sup }} ), $$where \(\theta _{low} \sim U(a,b)\), \(\theta _{mid1} \sim U(\theta _{low},b)\), \(\theta _{mid2} \sim U(\theta _{mid1},b)\), \(\theta _{sup} \sim U(\theta _{mid2},b)\) with given numbers \(a=0.1\) and \(b=20\).JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is used for the parameter estimation and inference on the hidden states \(Z_{i,j}\). Note that we only used parts of ILI data (2005–2013) for the parameter estimation leaving the later parts (2014–2020) for the purpose of testing. Estimated parameters of the Markov Switching model are presented in Supplementary Table S1.Finally, the posterior probability of a given week being in the epidemic phase is determined by taking the average of the samples of epidemic states \(Z_{i,j}\) of that week. If the posterior probability is above 0.5, then the week is classified as the week in the epidemic phase. Otherwise, it is classified as non-epidemic phase. We define the season onset to be the first week that is identified to be in the epidemic phase starting from week 36 of that year. See Supplementary Fig. S1 for the comparison of ILI epidemic curve and the posterior probabilities of the epidemic phase.Step 2: Prediction of outbreaks peaksTo estimate the peak of a given influenza season, we feed weekly ILI data into SIR model, starting from the estimated week of season onset. The rationale behind this approach is that epidemic curves tend to exhibit exponential growth in the initial phase, and previously estimated season onset provides an estimate of when the exponential growth phase begins. By comparing the ILI curve starting from the season onset with the infection curve of the SIR model, we can parameterize the SIR model and obtain a model-simulated peak of the season.The SIR model describes the dynamics of Susceptible (S), Infectious (I) and Recovered (R) population with the following equations:$$ \frac{{dS}}{{dt}} = - \beta S\frac{I}{N},\quad \frac{{dI}}{{dt}} = \beta S\frac{I}{N} - \sigma I,\quad \frac{{dR}}{{dt}} = \sigma I, $$where \(N = S(t)+I(t)+R(t)\). We employ fixed values for the recovery rate \(\sigma =1/7\), based on the assumption that the typical duration of influenza illnesses is around 1 week19. Given that the ILI data represents the number of patients with influenza-like symptoms per 1000 outpatients, we let \(N=1000\) to ensure a direct comparison between the observed ILI data and the model simulation. To obtain estimates for the transmission rate \(\beta \) and the initial values \(I(t_0)\) and \(R(t_0)\) for a given year with an estimated time of season onset \(t_0\), the modeled incidence of the SIR model is fitted to 3–6 weeks of weekly ILI data starting from the onset week. This is done separately for each year with a distinct time of onset (\(t_0\)), using the least square method to obtain distinct values for \(\beta \), \(I(t_0)\), and \(R(t_0)\) in each year. The initial number of susceptible individuals is calculated as \(S(t_0)=N-I(t_0)-R(t_0)\). Using these estimated initial values and parameters, we then obtain the model-derived peak of the season through the numerical solution of I(t).ResultsFigure 3 presents a boxplot comparing the week of season onset and the ILI incidence at the detected onset using three methods: Markov switching, threshold-based detection, and fixed-time detection. A comparison of estimated season onset reveals that threshold-based detection yields the highest variance in season onset, while ILI at the estimated season onset exhibits low variance. On the other hand, the onsets detected with Markov Switching exhibit smaller variances in onsets but show higher variances in ILI at the onsets compared to the threshold-based detection method.Figure 3Boxplot for the season onset (left panel) and the ILI incidences at the season onset (right panel), using different distinct methods to estimate the season onset: fixed-time detection (fixed), Markov Switching (MS) and threshold-based detection (threshold).Full size imageThe left panel of Fig. 4 depicts the yearly onset of seasonal outbreaks estimated by three methods. Fixed-time detection yields the earliest estimated season onset in most of the years among the three methods. Onset weeks estimated by threshold-based detection exhibit higher variance compared to Markov Switching across the years due to substantial differences in epidemic sizes from year to year. Note that threshold-based detection sometimes detects the onset too close to the peak time, particularly in years with small epidemic sizes (e.g. seasons starting with years 2005 and 2006). This highlights the limitation of the threshold-based method in seasons with small epidemic sizes. Although the onset can be detected in earlier weeks with lower threshold values, this turned out to yield poor performance in peak time prediction, see Supplementary Fig. S2.Figure 4The left panel displays the yearly onset of seasonal outbreaks detected by Markov Switching (red dots), threshold-based detection (blue dots), and fixed-time detection (green dots). The y-axis indicates the beginning year of the influenza season. The black circles represent the peak times of the outbreaks in each season, defined as the maximum ILI value. For the threshold-based detection, 5.1 (per 1000) is used as the threshold ILI rate. The right panel shows the weekly ILI rate at the estimated season onset.Full size imageWith the estimated season onset, we fit SIR model to 3–6 weeks of weekly ILI data starting from the onset week to obtain the model-derived outbreak peak. We then evaluate the accuracy of the peak time prediction by calculating the difference between the model-derived peak time and the peak time observed in the data, which is the highest ILI value reported during each season.Figures 5 and 6 illustrates the accuracy of peak time prediction using various methods for estimating the season’s onset. We have adopted the labels ‘Method 1’, ‘Method 2’, and ‘Method 3’ to denote the peak time predictions based on fixed-time, Markov Switching, and threshold-based estimation of season onset, respectively. Method 2, which utilizes the onset estimated by Markov Switching, demonstrated the highest accuracy and the least variance in error, surpassing the other two methods. Each panel in the figures presents the results for different prediction times, with later predictions showing higher accuracy. When the prediction was made 6 weeks after the season onset, method 2 predicted the peak time with less than 2 weeks of error for most of the flu season.Figure 5Errors of peak time prediction with respect to different methods used to detect season onsets and at different times of prediction. The x-axis represents the starting year of the flu season onset. On the y-axis, the prediction error is depicted, which is determined by subtracting the estimated peak from the peak of the ILI curve. Labels ‘Method 1’, ‘Method 2’, and ‘Method 3’ denote the peak time predictions based on fixed-time, Markov Switching, and threshold-based estimation of season onset, respectively.Full size imageFigure 6Boxplot for the error of peak time prediction with respect to different methods used to detect season onsets and at different times of prediction. Labels ‘Method 1’, ‘Method 2’, and ‘Method 3’ denote the peak time predictions based on fixed-time, Markov Switching, and threshold-based estimation of season onset, respectively.Full size imageMoreover, we evaluated the performance of the threshold-based detection method using various threshold values ranging from 1 to 5 (per 1000), and the results are reported in Supplementary Fig. S2 in terms of the accuracy of peak time prediction. The optimal threshold value for the threshold-based detection method was found to be 5 ILI per 1000 population. Setting the threshold higher than 5 can result in delayed onset detection, leading the peak time predictions to be made after the actual peak.From the ANOVA table presented in Table 1, one can see that the group means of the absolute error of peak time prediction under different estimation methods are significantly different. The significance of the difference is more pronounced (with a p-value of less than 0.005) when the prediction is made earlier (i.e., 3–4 weeks from the onset to prediction).Table 1 ANOVA table for the absolute error of peak time prediction with different estimation methods for season onset.Full size tablePlots in Fig. 7 show the remaining time from the week of peak time prediction to the actual peak. A positive value indicates that the prediction was made before the peak time, while a negative value indicates that the prediction was made after the peak time. The fixed method (Method 1) naturally provides the earliest prediction. The threshold-based method (Method 3) has been found to yield a higher median compared to the Markov Switching-based method (Method 2), However, this method can lead to delayed predictions that occur after the peak has passed. On the other hand, the Method 2 exhibits the lowest variance in the remaining times from the week of prediction to the peaks, providing higher stability in the peak prediction. Specifically, when prediction is made 3 or 4 weeks after detected onset, it allows 2–5 weeks from the time of prediction to peak. When prediction is made 5 weeks after onset detection, there is a 75% chance that the prediction will be made before the peak, and when predictions is made 5 weeks after onset, more than 25% of the predictions are made after the peak.Figure 7Boxplot for the error of peak time prediction with respect to different methods used to detect season onsets and at different times of prediction. Labels ‘Method 1’, ‘Method 2’, and ‘Method 3’ denote the peak time predictions based on fixed-time, Markov Switching, and threshold-based estimation of season onset, respectively.Full size imageDiscussionAccurate and timely prediction of seasonal influenza peaks can help inform decisions about vaccination campaigns and other measures to control the spread of seasonal influenza. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines Bayesian Markov Switching and a mechanistic SIR transmission model to predict seasonal peaks using ILI incidence data. The underlying concept is to leverage Markov Switching, which identifies the transition from a non-epidemic phase to an epidemic phase, to detect the onset of the epidemic curve where exponential growth begins. The key benefit of the Markov Switching in our context lies in its ability to detect regime shifts from non-epidemic to epidemic states, which is particularly challenging with non-zero ILI data throughout the year. By this integration of Markov Switching with a disease dynamics, we allow the model to catch external drivers of influenza season onset which purely mechanistic models may overlook. We use this identification to determine the starting point for the SIR model simulations.By assessing the accuracy of various methods for estimating the peak time of seasonal influenza outbreaks, we find that peak time prediction utilizing the Markov Switching method outperforms the fixed-time method and the threshold-based method. The alternative methods exhibit limitations in providing stable predictions, particularly in cases where the onset occurs at an unusual time or the epidemic size deviates significantly. Specifically, when the prediction is made 3 or 4 weeks after the detected onset, the Markov Switching method typically allows for a 2–5 week period from the time of prediction to the peak. These findings align with previous studies that have demonstrated stable peak time forecasts 2–5 weeks before the actual peak18,33.As a limitation of our study, we did not provide uncertainty intervals for the predicted peaks, which are essential for effective communication with the public and public health officials. To address this limitation, alternative methods beyond least squares should be considered to estimate parameters for disease dynamics and provide uncertainty estimates for the predicted peaks. It’s important to note that we do not claim Markov Switching as the superior tool for season onset estimation or peak prediction. Instead, we demonstrate the utility of the regime shift approach in informing the initial time of disease dynamics, offering stable predictions for epidemic peaks. This was illustrated using ILI data from Korea and compared with other methods, including threshold-based and fixed-time approaches. It remains an avenue for future research to evaluate the applicability of our approach with ILI data from different regions. Additionally, the potential use of other methods for season onset detection, such as the moving epidemic method (MEM)34,35, as input for disease dynamics remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, we conclude that incorporating our proposed approach into existing ensemble models for peak time prediction has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy.

To do so, they heated the milk to 63°C [145°F] for at least 30 minutes and 72°C [162°F] for 15 seconds."In late 2023 an H5N1 lineage of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) began circulating in American dairy cattle," the authors noted in the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. "Concerningly, high titres of virus were detected in cows' milk, raising the concern that milk could be a route of human infection."Raw milk could contain flu viruses, other pathogens"At both 63°C and 72°C, the infectivity of all viruses was rapidly lost, dropping by orders of magnitude in seconds and falling below the limit of detection well in advance of the minimum times required for milk pasteurization," the team wrote.We conclude that industry standard pasteurisation conditions should effectively inactivate H5N1 HPAIV in cows' milk, but that unpasteurised milk could carry infectious influenza viruses.To test whether wild-type H5N1 AIV in particular is susceptible to pasteurization, the team added the virus to raw milk to ascertain its infectivity. After being subjected to heat, only genetic material—not infectious virus—was detected in the milk."We conclude that industry standard pasteurisation conditions should effectively inactivate H5N1 HPAIV in cows' milk, but that unpasteurised milk could carry infectious influenza viruses," the researchers concluded. "We therefore caution against the consumption of raw milk that could be contaminated with bovine IAV because of the risk of consuming infectious virus, in addition to its established risk for infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens." Study: Sepsis quality metrics may unfairly penalize safety-net hospitals News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Sepsis Zerbor / iStock A cohort study involving more than 2.5 million older patients with sepsis found that admission to safety-net hospitals was associated with higher in-hospital mortality than non–safety-net hospitals, researchers reported late last week in JAMA Network Open.The authors of the study say the findings may be tied to the greater use of hospice at non–safety-net hospitals, which shifts attribution of death from the index hospitalization to hospice care. The study, led by researchers at Boston University (BU) Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, examined medical record of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 66 years and older who were admitted with sepsis to an intensive care unit from January 2011 to December 2019. Co-primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality.No difference in 30-day mortalityMore than 2.5 million patients with sepsis (mean age, 78.8 years; 51.9% female; 83.8% White) were admitted to 666 safety-net hospitals and 1,924 non–safety-net hospitals during the study period. Admission to safety-net hospitals was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 to 1.13) but not 30-day mortality (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.04), which the authors say is a less biased measure of short-term mortality.Admission to safety-net hospitals was also associated with lower do-not-resuscitate rates (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.91), palliative care delivery rates (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.73), and hospice discharge (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.87) but not with discharge to postacute facilities (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.01).The authors say the findings are significant because while the differences between safety-net and non–safety-net hospitals were small, they were enough to affect hospital rankings. New York is among the states that uses in-hospital mortality to evaluate how hospitals perform on sepsis quality measures."Current or future state and federal quality measures that use in-hospital mortality as a quality metric may unfairly penalize safety-net hospitals," corresponding author Anica Law, MD, assistant professor of medicine at BU School of Medicine, said in a press release.Law and her colleagues say their findings can be used to guide selection of better outcome measures for publicly reported quality benchmarks. Early safety data on RSV vaccines show rare Guillain-Barre cases News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Guillain-Barre Syndrome Drazen Zigic / iStock Late last week in Mrbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers published the first clinical safety data on Arexvy and Abrysvo vaccines, the first approved respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, and found real-world data mimics what was seen in trials, including a very small increased risk in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).GBS is an immune system disorder that occurs when the immune system attacks nerves. It is characterized by numbness and tingling in the body, including paralysis. GBS can follow bacterial or viral infections, and, rarely, following vaccination.Arexvy and Abrysvo, made by GSK and Pfizer, respectively, were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2023 for use in adults 60 and older to prevent RSV infections. 28 cases of GBS reportedFrom August 4, 2023, to March 30, 2024, at least 10.6 million US adults aged 60 years and older received a recommended RSV vaccine. The study is based on reports made to both V-safe and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from May 3, 2023, through April 14, 2024."Among the 16,220 V-safe participants aged ≥60 years who reported receiving an RSV vaccine and completed one or more daily surveys, 39.0% reported at least one symptom after vaccination; 0.4% of participants reported receiving medical care," the authors said. Over ninety percent of events in VAERS were classified as nonserious. However, VAERS included 28 reports of GBS that met case definition, including 11 (39.3%) after Arexvy vaccine (1.5 reports per 1 million doses administered), and 17 (60.3%) after Abrysvo (5.0 reports per 1 million doses administered).CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and FDA are conducting active safety evaluations to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events of special interest after RSV vaccination."CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and FDA are conducting active safety evaluations to assess risks for GBS and other adverse events of special interest after RSV vaccination. Results of these studies will help guide future CDC RSV vaccine recommendations," the authors concluded.

Data to date show that, although many people have been monitored after exposure to H5N1 bird flu virus-infected poultry, wild birds, and confirmed human patients globally, very few human infections have been detected. At this time, CDC believes that the overall risk to the general public posed by this virus remains low; however, people should take precautions. Summary What CDC knows CDC has been tracking highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses ("H5N1 bird flu") globally for more than 26 years. A lot of data have been collected to inform ongoing risk assessments. Overall, human infections with H5N1 bird flu viruses have been relatively rare and sporadic, despite the fact that these viruses have spread widely in wild birds worldwide and caused poultry outbreaks in many regions. In addition to public health surveillance for new human cases, studies that look at the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to H5N1 bird flu viruses in people's blood can help inform the public health risk of these viruses. A review of these studies supports the fact that H5N1 bird flu viruses have not spread easily to infect people in the past. What CDC is doing CDC has been involved in studies over many years that have looked at how common neutralizing antibodies (a sign of prior infection) to H5N1 bird flu virus are among people with exposure to infected animals, as well as people with no such exposures. These studies can help inform ongoing public health risk assessments for H5N1 bird flu viruses. A review of these data supports the fact that human infections with H5N1 bird flu virus have been rare in the past, even among people with more extensive exposures. CDC is developing protocols for seroprevalence studies it hopes to conduct related to the H5N1 bird flu virus outbreak in dairy cattle. What to know Seroprevalence studies are studies that test blood for the presence of to a pathogen of interest, such as H5N1 bird flu virus. The body's immune response to a pathogen, like H5N1 bird flu virus, leads to the production of antibodies that work to diminish, obstruct, or neutralize the infection. Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that defend a cell from a pathogen by disrupting its ability to infect a cell. Detecting "neutralizing" antibodies specific to H5N1 bird flu viruses in blood could be evidence of prior infection with the virus. In an H5N1 bird flu virus antibody seroprevalence study, blood that tests positive for neutralizing antibodies to H5N1 bird flu virus is referred to as seropositive. The percentage of people in a study population who have neutralizing antibodies to a particular virus is called "seroprevalence." Data to date show that, although many people have been monitored after exposure to H5N1 bird flu virus-infected poultry, wild birds, and confirmed human patients globally, very few human infections have been detected. Seroprevalence data also show little to no evidence of prior H5N1 bird flu virus infections, even in populations exposed to infected poultry and wild birds without wearing any protective equipment, indicating that the virus has not spread well to or among people to date. Seroprevalence studies in people are included among the activities that CDC is planning related to the current H5N1 bird flu virus outbreak in dairy cows and other animals in the United States. The current assessment of the risk level to the general public is low. This is based on available epidemiologic and laboratory data to date. Although previous seroprevalence data are reassuring, because influenza viruses constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical. CDC is monitoring for any changes that may change the agency's risk assessment. Globally, Reported Human Infections with H5N1 Bird Flu Viruses Have Been Rare CDC has been tracking H5N1 bird flu viruses globally for more than 26 years. While H5N1 bird flu viruses have been spreading widely for many years in wild birds and causing poultry outbreaks, most notably in Asia, the number of resulting human infections with these viruses has been relatively low. There have been fewer than a thousand sporadic, reported infections in people from 24 countries from 2003 to 2024. There is always concern that cases may be missed in people with minor symptoms or who experience other barriers to testing, but serologic studies to date offer supporting evidence and indicate that infections with these viruses to date have been rare, even among people with higher-risk exposures. H5N1 Seroprevalence Studies Seroprevalence studies are helpful because knowing if there have been prior infections with a virus can show if and how commonly the virus is infecting people. Information gathered from seroprevalence studies can help inform the process of iterative, ongoing risk assessments. Studies that have tested the blood of people who work in poultry markets in Asia to look for H5N1 bird flu virus neutralizing antibodies (a sign of prior infection) have shown a low prevalence of infections. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 60 peer reviewed articles (from January 1, 1997-September 1, 2020) looked at H5N1 bird flu virus neutralizing antibody seroprevalence studies among people who had poultry exposures as well as people without specific exposures to poultry. Seroprevalence of H5N1 bird flu virus was higher among people with poultry exposures, compared with people who did not have exposure to poultry, but overall, neutralizing antibody levels were nonexistent or at very low frequencies among both groups of people. The findings suggest that H5N1 bird flu viruses have not caused a large number of human infections, even in people exposed to virus-infected animals, and overall, these viruses have not been well adapted to spread to and among people. Importantly, studies also found that human seropositivity has been lower with more recent clades of H5N1 bird flu viruses circulating in wild birds and causing poultry outbreaks than it was with earlier H5N1 bird flu viruses. However, the systematic review and meta-analysis study reaffirmed that risk does increase with exposure, and people who have close, prolonged contact with infected animals, their byproducts, or environments may be at increased risk of H5N1 bird flu virus infection. In the United States, a 2022 CDC study looked at the risk for symptomatic H5N1 bird flu virus infection in 4,000 people who had been exposed to H5N1 bird flu virus-infected poultry during February 7─September 3, 2022. Only one lab-confirmed human case of influenza H5N1 bird flu was detected. To assess whether asymptomatic or undetected cases had occurred, serologic testing was done among people with relevant exposures in two states. The serology testing did not show any evidence of people having neutralizing antibodies to A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, the predominant virus circulating in birds and other animals in the United States. While the number of participants with serologic specimens was small, the information is still suggestive that human infections with these viruses, even among exposed people, are rare. Seroprevalence Studies Moving Forward In the context of the multistate outbreak of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cows with three human infections in the United States, many people are asking whether human cases are being missed. CDC hopes to conduct a number of seroprevalence studies to further inform the public health risk assessment for this virus in its present iteration. These studies would look at serology data from people who have been exposed to dairy cows infected with H5N1 bird flu virus to determine if there is evidence of neutralizing antibodies to H5N1 bird flu virus, indicative of prior human infections. These data would inform if any human detections have been missed. Although seroprevalence data to date are reassuring, it is important for CDC to continually assess the public health risk of viruses that have pandemic potential, like H5N1 bird flu viruses. Viruses that have pandemic potential are of extra concern because of the impact they could have on public health if they were to gain the ability to spread easily from person to person and cause the next flu pandemic. While the three U.S. human cases of H5N1 bird flu had relatively mild illness, globally, H5N1 bird flu virus infections in people have ranged in severity from mild to deadly, with about a 50% fatality rate historically. Because influenza viruses constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical, and CDC is monitoring for any changes that may change the agency's risk assessment. CDC is beginning the process of conducting a pandemic risk assessment on the virus from the human infection in Texas (A/Texas/37/2024) using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), which is a multi-step process that can take months to complete. The current assessment of the risk level to the general public, which is based on available epidemiologic and laboratory data, is low. Recommended Prevention Measures At this time, CDC believes that the overall risk to the general public posed by this virus remains low; however, people should take precautions. People should avoid exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows), if possible. People should also avoid exposures to animal poop, bedding (litter), unpasteurized ("raw") milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed H5N1 bird flu virus, if possible. People who have job-related contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals should be aware of the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and should take proper precautions. People should wear appropriate and recommended personal protective equipment when exposed to an infected or potentially infected animal(s). CDC has recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). High levels of H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in unpasteurized (raw) milk from infected cows. CDC and FDA recommend against the consumption of raw milk or raw milk products. The risk of human infection from drinking raw milk containing live H5N1 bird flu virus specifically is unknown, but it could be dangerous.

It now also has two farmworkers with confirmed bird flu infections – transmitted to them by close contact with sick cows.Texas is the only other state where a person is known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from a cow, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That state has reported 15 cattle herd infections since March. Seven other states – Idaho, South Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and North Carolina – also have cow herds with known infections, the USDA reported.The reason Michigan's tally of livestock outbreaks and farmworkers with avian influenza is higher than other states is not because Michigan is especially ripe for viral activity or because there's something different about the state's cows or workers, said Dr. Arnold Monto, emeritus professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan and co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response."The main reason we're detecting more infection is because we're doing very good surveillance," Monto said. "Other states need to do the same. ... It's being missed."The CDC reported May 22 that 40 people had been tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza nationally. The same day, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Free Press that 35 Michigan farmworkers had undergone testing.That means only five people tested as of May 22 were from states other than Michigan. It also means the reach of the virus "is certainly more widespread" nationally than anyone currently knows, Monto said."The conclusions are pretty obvious when you hear things like that," said Monto. "If you don't look, you're not going to find it. What we need is to get serious about it in terms of how we handle surveillance because if you don't know it's there and don't have regulations in place ... it's going to spread even more."The CDC updated its testing and monitoring data Friday, saying 44 people have now been tested nationally for the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, and more than 390 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals.The agency said it is also stepping up national surveillanceesting by:Asking local labs to send more samples for subtyping to the CDC and state public health labs to test for the H5N1 virus. Extending reporting of flu-related hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. The CDC typically stops reporting influenza hospitalizations from May-September because it’s ordinarily such a seasonal virus. So far, the CDC said its surveillance systems show no indication of unusual flu activity in people.Increasing outreach through state and local health departments to health care providers and clinics about H5N1 symptoms so avian influenza is considered when patients with conjunctivitis or respiratory illness and a history of exposure to animals seek medical care.How the virus came to Michigan cow herdsThe outbreak of H5N1 virus in dairy cattle – with spillover to humans – began in Texas just a few months ago. It came to Michigan in late March, when infected cows crossed state lines, said Tim Boring, the director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development."We know that a farm in Montcalm County initially (had an outbreak) as a result of cattle movement," Boring said, "and we've seen an expansion of our cases out of that general area since then."Calling the H5N1 outbreak among poultry and cattle in Michigan an "extraordinary emergency," Boring issued an order May 1 that required all dairy and commercial poultry farms in Michigan to adopt biosecurity practices to slow the spread of the virus.Among the requirements: Farms must secure animal areas, establish a perimeter and limit access. They must name a biosecurity manager and train employees, and establish cleaning and disinfection practices for all with contact within the perimeter, including delivery drivers. They must keep log books tracking all who enter and leave.More: Avian flu has spread to cows, milk — and experts worry human outbreak could be nextThe order also prohibited all lactating dairy cattle, and those in the last two months of pregnancy, from being exhibited at fairs and festivals until there are no new cases of the virus statewide in dairy cattle for at least 60 consecutive days. Similarly, poultry also cannot be taken to exhibitions, fairs or festivals until no new cases of the virus have been detected in domestic poultry for at least 30 consecutive days.The state agriculture department also teamed up closely with state and local health departments to ensure people would be protected, Boring said."In Michigan, we're testing in animals and we're testing in people and we've seen really strong coordination between animal and human health components within the state level, the federal level and on the local level," he told the Free Press on Friday. "Part of the reason that we've seen good responses on testing is because of the involvement of local health departments. Those are trusted community partners. They are neighbors, not folks coming in from out of town. We're taking this really seriously. It's a proactive approach. This is both an animal and a public health concern, and we're managing it as such."Still, Boring said, there are many unanswered questions about this virus, including how it spreads."We likely have a multifactorial transmission matrix going on of how the virus spreads from dairy farm to dairy farm. ... We're getting a better handle on it every day, and we're continuing to lead across the country of what the response looks like."Human cases so far have been mildAll three people known to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. this year have had mild symptoms.The Texas farmworker and the first person in Michigan to get ill from exposure to infected cattle reported only conjunctivitis, or pink eye. In the second Michigan case, which was announced Thursday, a farmworker had upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge, the CDC reported.There is concern among scientists that the impact on people could change, as more animals get infected.The more the virus spreads in animals, the greater the likelihood of human exposures and transmission, Monto said, which also increases the odds that the virus could mutate in a way that would allow H5N1 to spread from person to person or cause more severe disease."That's why we really need to control it – not because we're sure that is going to happen, but because if that does happen, there's a chance it's going to be pretty bad," Monto said.The CDC is conducting genetic sequencing on the most recent human case in Michigan to determine what, if any changes, there might be.All three known human cases so far involved the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus that is nearly identical to the H5N1 viruses circulating in U.S. dairy cows, the CDC reported.In samples taken from the infected eye of the first Michigan farmworker, whose case was announced May 22, the CDC identified a mutation that allows mammals to be infected more easily. However, it did not contain changes that would likely make it easier for the virus to spread from human to human.And that's key, Monto said."We're lucky that there are receptor-binding issues that are preventing it from getting into humans easily," Monto said, "because if it were easy to transmit, with all of the workers that are on these farms handling the equipment, which is heavily contaminated, we would see more cases."The virus affects animals, people differentlyThe impact of the virus on animals so far has been extremely variable, said Timothy Cernak, an assistant professor of chemistry and medicinal chemistry at the University of Michigan."The virus behaves different in each species," said Cernak, whose work centers on developing new antiviral drugs that could be added to the arsenal of current antivirals to help stop a potential avian flu outbreak. "There are species that it gets into and they just don't seem to notice," while others get very sick and others see mass die-offs.The current H5N1 strain in the U.S. is extremely deadly in birds and cats, sea lions, raccoons and skunks.Dairy cows get sick from the virus but don't typically die. A report from Michigan State University suggests cows on one Michigan farm with an H5N1 outbreak had high fevers and dehydration. There was a drop in rumination as well, which turns the grass they eat into energy and milk. Milk production dropped dramatically, and some pregnant cows miscarried.Last week, the USDA reported that alpacas in Idaho also have contracted the virus. And mice became sick within a day of drinking raw milk from an infected cow. The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter from researchers at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory that showed the mice had high levels of virus in their organs. Levels also were high in the mammary glands of two mice – even though the mice were not lactating."In elephant seals it killed 96% of the pups from last year," Cernak said, adding that the virus also devastated the bald eagle population and affected horned owls. "It's entirely possible in wild populations, there are significant risks of extinction-level events happening."More: Michigan farmworker is second US case of H5N1bird flu likely transmitted from cow to humanFor humans, he said a different subtype of H5N1 avian influenza that spread in Cambodia from 2003 to 2023 caused severe illness and deaths."In Cambodia, the fatality rate in humans was really high, and that's the concerning thing," Cernak said. Of 64 people who contracted the other subtype of the virus, 41 died, according to the World Health Organization.Could respiratory symptoms signal easier human-to-human spread?For now, as the bird flu circulating in the U.S. has remained mild in the few human cases, Cernak said he is concerned about the potential for respiratory transmission to give this virus a boost."The biggest risk that we have is that it mutates toward respiratory transmission," he told the Free Press last week — before the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced that the state does now, in fact, have a farmworker with H5 infection and respiratory symptoms.It's unclear, however, whether having those symptoms will make it easier to spread the virus from person to person.Joe Coyle, deputy state epidemiologist and director of the MDHHS Bureau of Infectious Disease, said it's the first time respiratory symptoms have been associated with a human H5N1 influenza case following contact with sick cows."Generally speaking, with something like influenza and respiratory viruses, when you have respiratory symptoms, you're more likely to spread the virus than if it was just conjunctivitis like the previous case we had in Michigan and the one in Texas," Coyle said."It is a new presentation, and it's something that we'll definitely be looking at ... to see if this represents a different mutation of the virus that's causing these types of symptoms, or is it really the same virus but just a different route of transmission with respect to the human exposure."The CDC reported that the farmworker with respiratory symptoms was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, and is isolating at home. None of the person's contacts have developed symptoms and all are being monitored and offered antiviral medication.More outreach to farms neededDr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at U-M, said there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to the current U.S. H5N1 avian influenza outbreak."Often in the health field, we are maybe appropriately focused on the humans, but the wider the outbreak is in animals, the more risk there is of humans being infected because there are more potential contacts," he said."I think everyone's trying to understand different ways that it could be spreading among dairy cattle within a herd and also between herds or between farms, and I think that's an important thing that we need to really get a better understanding of."In terms of how far it has spread in humans, that is dependent on really being able to do good surveillance, which is challenging in this situation in that it depends on people coming to attention, reporting their symptoms, getting tested."Many farmworkers are undocumented migrant workers for whom English might not be a first language and who might be concerned about being deported if they say they are sick or seek medical care."A lot of these populations are hard to reach," Lauring said. "I know MDHHS has been doing outreach to try to do as best they can with surveillance for symptoms in people to try to catch anyone who could be infected, and also then to offer testing. That's how, for example, this (first) case in Michigan was identified was through this program."Michigan, he said, appears to have done a better job than many other states. It has created a daily text-message surveillance system, available in English and in Spanish, that asks workers to detail whether they have symptoms. Anyone who answers yes is then offered testing by local public health workers.Testing is encouraged, but not required, and the federal government now is reimbursing farms for some of the losses they have incurred from H5N1 outbreaks and testing."This is an ongoing, evolving situation and it's important to pay attention to that," Lauring said. "Fortunately, the risk to the general population is low, but we need to pay attention and reach out to farms and people working with the farms and work together to control the outbreak."'We're flying blind'Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and consultant for several health organizations including the CDC, wrote on a post on her substack, "Your Local Epidemiologist," that the H5N1 situation in the U.S. is far from controlled."We are flying blind," she said. "We don’t know how this virus is spreading, where it is spreading, and if it’s becoming better at infecting humans."Lack of trust in public health in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, farmworkers' fears of deportation and language barriers, along with farmers' concerns about the financial impact the H5N1 outbreaks all are affecting surveillance efforts."It shouldn’t be shocking that few are volunteering to test for H5N1," she wrote.Animal testing for avian influenza viruses in Michigan is done through MSU's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Positive results are sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for confirmatory testing, Boring said.If an animal's test result is positive, "we work closely with local and state health officials to make sure that local health is on farms, working with farmworkers, apprising them of everything they need to know about what this virus means and maintaining and tracking some human safety aspects there," he said.That includes ensuring personal protective gear – such as face shields or goggles, respirator masks, rubber coveralls and boots – are available to workers on farms with infected animals. Although wearing PPE is recommended, it isn't mandatory."We're doing everything we can to assist those human health partners to be getting equipment out to not only just farms, but within those CDC guidelines around processing plants as well."We've had a few farms take us up on that, but the base PPE that makes so much of a difference in these cases – eye protection, gloves – that is equipment a lot of farms have on hand already."Neither of the Michigan farmworkers who were infected by cows wore fully protective equipment, said Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive, in a statement issued Thursday. One was splashed in the eye with milk from an infected cow and the other had "direct exposure to an infected cow.""This tells us that direct exposure to infected livestock poses a risk to humans, and that PPE is an important tool in preventing spread among individuals who work on dairy and poultry farms," she said.For protection, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recommends that anyone who is within 6 feet of an infected cow should wear:Safety goggles or a face shieldDisposable glovesBoots or boot coversA respirator, such as an N95 maskFluid-resistant coverallsHead coveringMany questions about avian influenza remain unansweredThere remain many questions with wide implications, Monto said, when it comes to how this virus is behaving.Among them, he said: For how long is a cow infectious? Will infections be sustained on farms or will they be able to be rid of the virus over time? Why are lactating cows so susceptible and why are virus particles so concentrated in their milk?"What is going on in the mixed dairy-beef cattle farms? A cow is a cow," said Monto.He noted that in one out of 109 samples of beef tested in late May by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, H5N1 viral particles were detected in muscle tissue. In ground beef that was inoculated with high levels of virus, cooking it to at least 145 degrees (medium) or 160 degrees (well done) killed the H5N1 virus."Even cooking burgers to 120 (rare) degrees, which is well below the recommended temperature, substantially inactivated the virus," the USDA reported.And though similar testing of commercial milk found H5N1 viral fragments, those particles were inactivated by pasteurization and were unable to cause infection. Raw milk from infected cows, however, has been shown to be a risk for infection."We do know that raw milk is full of the virus," Monto said. "We know that we shouldn't be drinking unpasteurized milk and some people are (obsessed with) drinking unpasteurized milk."Monto said scientists still don't know whether the milk of other animals – or humans – is infectious when they contract avian influenza."This virus is now spreading wherever they shipped dairy cows. It's come all the way from Texas to Michigan. And it's come to a variety of other states," Monto said."We need to control the infection in cattle, and that will lower the probability of humans becoming infected."Contact Kristen Shamus: kshamus@freepress.com.

Widespread reluctance on the part of farmers to allow scientists — government or otherwise — onto their premises to study spread of the virus among infected cows has created a frustrating lack of understanding of the dynamics of this outbreak. U.S. Department of Agriculture incentives aimed at getting farmers to test their cows and take preventive measures to protect both animals and farmworkers do not seem to have solved the impasse, even as the outbreak has affected 82 herds in nine states.advertisement It’s not lost on many scientists, here and abroad, that the paucity of data coming out of the U.S. is not dissimilar to the limited information flow out of China in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic — a situation the U.S and other governments complained about loudly at the time. With the shoe on the other foot, however, there is no overt effort to make farmers cooperate. “A lot of criticism was leveled at China for their early response to Covid-19 — some of it reasonable, a lot of it extremely ignorant. Are we currently making some of those mistakes ourselves?” wondered Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist and a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Investigating outbreaks always takes time. But it is startling this far into this situation that so many questions appear to be no closer to answers.advertisement Related: Finland to offer bird flu vaccine to select groups of people, a possible global first To get a sense of what the key questions are, STAT asked scientists who have long worked on influenza or in veterinary medicine what they viewed as the most pressing questions. Sixteen answered individually; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention answered collectively for three flu experts within its ranks whose opinions we sought. The answers — their questions — roughly fit into three buckets: What’s happening on the farms among cows? What’s happening on farms among farmworkers? What’s happening to the virus and what does this all portend for H5N1, which for nearly three decades has danced around humans but has yet to take us on directly. The biggest bucket: What is happening with the cows? Ron Fouchier, a flu virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, summed up what underlies all of the cow-related questions with the single question he submitted. It was, effectively: How can spread in cows be stopped, and the sooner the better? “If this virus becomes enzootic” — endemic or entrenched — “in cows, it could well cause massive damage to human and animal health in the longer term,” Fouchier wrote. “I would find it unacceptable if authorities in the U.S.A. and/or the sector do not try to eradicate this new disease in cows a.s.a.p. If this is not deemed possible, I think the entire world would like to see the evidence and arguments.” Isabella Eckerle, a virologist at the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, expressed a similarly overarching sentiment. “What is the plan of farmers and health authorities to get rid of this virus in the cow population to prevent further spread and mutation, or worse, major spillover to humans?” Figuring out how to stop the spread of the virus in U.S. cattle herds requires far more information than exists in the public domain, however. Many of the experts we asked said what’s known about how the virus is spreading among cows cannot be the whole story. Related: In light of H5N1 outbreak, U.S. in talks with mRNA vaccine makers on bird flu Cow udders appear to be exquisitely sensitive to this virus; when dairy cattle are infected, their milk production decreases markedly and the milk they do produce is altered in color and viscosity. Milk from infected animals contains surprisingly high levels of virus. It’s believed that milking machines, which are not cleaned after each cow is milked, have been spreading the virus from infected to uninfected animals. But some cows reportedly have mild respiratory symptoms and nasal discharge, raising questions about whether cows are also spreading the virus more in the way humans spread flu. “There is a consensus building that this is most likely mechanical transmission through milking but I don’t think that answers a lot of questions/explains some of the weirdness,” said Thomas Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. “I don’t understand how if the virus is only transmitting through milk machines it got back into poultry (or alpacas!).” While it is believed that this outbreak was caused by a single “spillover” event, when H5N1-infected wild birds somehow passed the virus to a cow or cows, the virus that has been spreading in cows has since spilled back into wild birds. Farm cats, domestic poultry, the odd carnivore species, and a herd of alpacas in Idaho have also been infected with this strain of the virus. Six of 18 alpacas in the herd became infected; three that were pregnant had spontaneous abortions. There have also been three mild human infections associated with this outbreak; all have been in farmworkers. Related: USDA faulted for disclosing scant information about outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu in cattle Martin Beer, director of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Riems, Germany, lists a number of data points scientists need to know to try to figure out how to stop this outbreak. The number of cows in a herd that have been infected, which could be determined by looking for antibodies in their blood. The percentage of animals that shed virus — in other words, the portion that are infectious. Whether they emit virus from their muzzles or in their feces. How much virus is shed via those routes as compared to what is seen in milk? Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine who is working on an H5N1 vaccine, has a trio of intertwined questions. Do cows that are infected but have no symptoms emit virus? Would quarantining infected cows stop spread within a herd? And how long are infected cows infectious? “It will be easier to control this virus if the infectious period is short. But this might not be the case,” Hensley noted. Colleen Webb agreed that the specifics of spread in cattle need to be elucidated. “We know the basic epidemiological information for other avian influenza hosts, but not dairy cattle, and dairy cattle are different enough from these other hosts that we need dairy cattle-specific information,” said Webb, dean of the graduate school at Colorado State University, whose research focuses on data-driven modeling of disease and evaluation of preparedness and control strategies in livestock diseases. Lots of data from a number of affected farms would answer these questions. In the absence of it, experimental infections of cows in laboratories can start to generate crucial information. Jürgen Richt, a veterinarian and director of the Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases at Kansas State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, is currently doing just this type of research. So is Beer. Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, thinks it’s important to find out whether vaccinating cattle would stop transmission of the virus in herds — specifically whether vaccine doses created for people in the federal government’s stockpile could be used to tamp out spread. “Large scale vaccination in cows may be able to stop the outbreak,” he argued. There remains the question of how widespread the virus is in herds in the U.S. Given that H5 viral particles have been found in a substantial portion of commercially purchased milk — one in five samples bought in 38 states — the belief is that the herds that have been confirmed are a tip of the iceberg. But is that so? How far has this spread? Related: When should we start making H5N1 vaccine, and who will make that decision? In short, it’s complicated “We still don’t know how many farms are affected and that’s a big problem for containment. As long as undetected cases are out there, new infections can and will occur,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, in Saskatoon, Canada. Like Rasmussen, Diego Diel, a virologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., would like to know how far the virus has spread in cows. “Is the virus circulating in other countries … such as Mexico and Canada?” he wondered. So far Canadian authorities report they have not found the virus in cows. And work Rasmussen and an ad hoc team of researchers from across Canada have done looking for traces of H5N1 in store-bought milk has so far failed to turn up any positive results. Finally, there is the question of whether this virus is now on its way to being seeded in cattle in the United States — permanently circulating among cows and adapting to better infect them. Will cows who have recovered from the virus have the capacity to catch it again? Humans, after all, only develop transient immunity when they have a bout of flu. “What is going to happen when a recovered herd gets infected again? Maybe someone knows the answer to this already, but I don’t,” said Richard Webby, a flu virologist and director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals, located at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. “Will this disease burn out, or continue to circulate?” Webby wondered whether cows can be reinfected, and if so, whether subsequent infections differ from the initial one, with potentially different amounts of virus in the milk of infected cows, for instance. Though experimental infections might help to start generating an answer to this question, the best way to answer it would be to monitor farms that have been affected. Andersen worries what the consequences will be if we get to the point where this question can be answered. “We will eventually find out, however, this is a good example of ‘Let’s not,’” he said. “Let’s just focus on stopping the current epizootic in cattle.” What’s happening to farmworkers? Within days of the USDA’s confirmation that H5N1 was infecting cows in some herds in Texas, Kansas, and Michigan, a human infection was confirmed. A farmworker developed a florid case of conjunctivitis — pink eye. A swab of his eye contained the bird flu virus. Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Since then, two more bird flu cases have been detected in people, both in Michigan. One also had conjunctivitis, but more recently a farmworker developed more classical flu-like symptoms. There have also been many anecdotal reports of other cases of conjunctivitis on affected farms, and experts believe there have been more human cases than have been confirmed. In addition to the reluctance of farmers to cooperate with authorities trying to study the situation, many of these workers are migrants. Some are likely undocumented. Many may not have access to health care, and may be frightened about interacting with government officials. There is great interest in doing serology studies among farmworkers — drawing blood to look for antibodies to H5N1 to try to get a handle on how often the virus is infecting people on farms. Getting approval to do this work has been challenging. The Texas farmworker refused to give blood. Without better access to workers, it’s hard to assess where the risk is highest on dairy farms, and hard to put together practical, usable programs to protect them. “While we know that people with direct, unprotected exposure to animals infected with H5N1 are the most likely to get sick with the virus themselves, CDC is still working to determine how exactly that infection occurs,” the agency told STAT in its submitted questions. “Understanding and defining the specific risky behaviors is important so that we can then translate that into the best means of prevention.” Meghan Davis concurred. A dairy and mixed animal veterinarian who teaches in Johns Hopkins University’s department of environmental health and engineering and medical school, Davis said that understanding specifically how workers are being exposed on farms could lead to the identification of better ways to use personal protective equipment or even other protective approaches that don’t involve PPE. Farmworkers have been reluctant to wear masks and goggles; the heat in barns makes these tools impractical and even potentially dangerous, impeding their vision of what’s going on around them. Related: New evidence supports fear that drinking raw milk containing bird flu viruses may be dangerous “This would be done with exposure studies on positive farms that would involve sampling of a lot of pathways of exposure — air, water, waste — and would include what we call personal exposure assessment,” she said. Rasmussen would like to know whether the route of exposure to the virus — a splash of milk in the eye, say, versus inhalation of virus-laced particles — affects the type of infection an exposed individual develops, and the severity of the ensuing illness. What is happening to the virus? Since H5N1 was first isolated from a goose in China’s Guangdong province in 1996, the virus has undergone extensive evolution. There are now several clades — sub-families, if you will — of the virus circulating in various parts of the world, moved around by wild birds. The version responsible for the outbreak in cows is a virus identified as clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. While this clade also circulates in Europe, the B3.13 genotype has not been spotted there. Until this outbreak, cows were never thought to be susceptible to H5N1. Beer had shown calves could be infected in a lab, but in the real world, cows had never been part of the H5 story. Is this outbreak a sign that something about the virus changed? Or was it just a lightning strike? This is a question a number of the scientists had. “Are other 2.3.4.4b viruses with other gene constellations also able to infect cattle?” wondered Kanta Subbarao, a flu virologist at Laval University in Quebec City, Canada. Related: CDC asks states and cities to keep flu surveillance at peak levels because of bird flu threat Richt, the veterinarian from Kansas State University who is experimentally infecting dairy cattle, also wants to know whether this H5 virus is special, or if it just got lucky. “Nobody knows whether this ‘bovine H5N1’ is unique or not. Maybe regular ‘avian H5N1’ viruses are able to infect cattle too,” he said. Beer wants to know whether this version of the virus has changes that allow it to infect the mammary gland so efficiently, or whether other versions of 2.3.4.4b — ones circulating in Europe, say — could also do this if they got the opportunity. Yoshihiro Kawaoka put into words a question that worries many scientists watching this situation, the worry that underscored Fouchier’s insistence that this outbreak must be stopped as quickly as possible. “We do not know whether the bovine H5N1 virus will become established in cattle,” wrote Kawaoka, a flu virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “If it does, will it evolve to adapt more towards ‘mammalian-like’ influenza viruses? … Will it pose a risk to human health?” To date, the virus has not been seen to have the capacity to transmit efficiently among a mammalian species; any changes it acquires to allow it to do that could make H5N1 more adept at infecting humans. Eckerle wonders if we’d know it, in real time, if the virus starts to change in ways that might signal dangerous adaptations for mammal-to-mammal spread. The USDA has been uploading basic genetic data to an international database, but those sequences do not indicate when the virus was collected or in which part of the country. It has been slow to share more complete genetic sequences, to the deep frustration of the scientific community. With this approach, there might be a delay in recognizing the development. An intriguing curveball Malik Peiris, who has studied the H5N1 virus since it started to infect people back in 1997 in Hong Kong, raised an intriguing and potentially hopeful question. Peiris, who is chair of virology at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, wonders whether the risk that H5N1 poses to people has changed in the decades since H5 first started infecting humans. Over the years, close to 900 people in 24 countries are known to have been infected, and about half of them have died. Related: Wastewater testing specifically for bird flu virus will scale up nationally in coming weeks Peiris and colleagues wonder, though, whether the 2009 H1N1 pandemic lowered the risk H5N1 poses. The neuraminidase protein on the 2009 virus, the N1, is quite similar, genetically, to the neuraminidase in H5N1. His group in Hong Kong has tested the blood of people who likely had H1N1 — which has circulated in the years since the 2009 pandemic — and tested stored blood samples from before 2009, looking to see if, when exposed to H5N1 virus, cross-reactive antibodies that might kickstart an immune response to H5N1 are present. Their study is small, but suggestive that because of how similar the viruses are, some people may have antibodies that could help in the face of H5N1 exposure. It should be noted that in the years since 2009, there have been about 425 detected cases of H5N1 infection worldwide, of which about 180 were fatal. In the past decade, though, human cases have been less frequent and somewhat less likely to end in death. “We need to ascertain how much protection this cross-N1 antibody will provide against H5N1 infection, at least to mitigate disease severity,” Peiris said, adding that his group is continuing to work on this question. “The question is what biological protective effect will they exert, if any?” Andrew Joseph contributed reporting.

And, they are following protocol before moving any cattle between states, she said.There have only been a handful of human cases of the virus. Those individuals were in close contact with lactating cattle and are expected to recover. Thus, Ernst said he thinks the threat to humans remains low. Further, pasteurization has been effective in ensuring “the virus doesn’t enter the food supply,” he said.While the risk is low in Illinois, as a precautionary measure to further protect dairy farmers, IFB, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), local health departments and county Farm Bureaus are working together to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) upon request, to those who would like to take more precautions.“We will be sending out information soon about how to get that equipment,” Bunting said.Producers can also contact their local Farm Bureau offices to get more information, she said.To date, 67 dairy premises have reported virus outbreaks in nine states. Ernst attributes containment of the virus to those states, in part, to the federal requirements that lactating dairy cattle must be tested before moving them to another state. Both he and Bunting confirmed, as of May 30, no extra regulations have been added to restrict dairy movement during the upcoming fair season.“It’s an ever-evolving situation. There’s a lot we still don’t know about how this virus is spreading,” Ernst said. While it is known to spread from cow to cow on a farm, it also appears to move between farms on vehicle wheels and footwear.No beef cattle have been reported as being affected by the virus.

The vaccine campaign will be limited, with doses set to be available to groups including poultry farmers, veterinarians, scientists who study the virus, and people who work on fur farms housing animals like mink and fox and where there have been outbreaks.advertisement In an email, Mia Kontio, a health security official at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, told STAT the country was waiting for 20,000 doses to arrive, but planned to administer them “as soon as the vaccines are in the country.” The decision to start providing vaccines reflects fears that people in close contact with infected animals could contract the H5N1 virus themselves. The virus is, for now, not particularly adept at infecting humans or, more importantly, spreading among them. But scientists worry that as the virus infects more mammalian species, and if it encounters more human cells, then the higher the chances are that it evolves to become more of a threat to people. Related: These are the bird flu questions that influenza and animal scientists desperately want answered The Finnish campaign also comes as the U.S. faces an H5N1 outbreak among dairy cattle — previously a species scientists thought wasn’t susceptible to the virus. Three dairy workers have had confirmed infections tied to the outbreak, and although the infections were all mild and there were no signs of forward transmission to other people, the cases underscored the risk to people who have contact with infected animals.advertisement “The concern here is about the animal-human interface,” said Marc Lacey, the global executive director for pandemic at CSL Seqirus, the maker of several H5 vaccines, including the one Finland is planning on using. Other countries are discussing deploying H5 vaccines or are working to secure supplies, Lacey said. The U.S., for example, last week hired CSL Seqirus to build up the number of H5 flu vaccine doses it has available. But Finland was the first country he knew of that actually planned to use the vaccine, at least in recent years outside research studies. The vaccine to be administered in Finland is designed off a different avian influenza virus called H5N8, but researchers say the shot should still confer protection against H5N1. It’s the hemagglutinin component of the vaccine — the H part — that’s the main target. The vaccine also includes an adjuvant, a component that deepens the generated immune response.

Privacy Policy European regulators authorized the vaccine, which is known as Zoonotic influenza vaccine Seqirus, based on a number of studies showing that it elicited immune responses that scientists think would be protective against avian influenza. Researchers can’t run traditional efficacy trials with such products because the virus isn’t circulating among people, so they’re typically approved based on these immunogenicity studies. The immunization is approved as a two-dose vaccine, with doses given at least three weeks apart. Isabella Eckerle, a virologist at the Geneva Centre for Emerging Viral Diseases, said that vaccinating people at high risk of exposure to the virus could protect them, but she said the world should not rely on human vaccination to prevent the H5N1 situation from worsening. Instead, health officials should work to limit transmission broadly, including among animals. Such efforts could include improving the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE, on farms, she said. (In the U.S., health officials have made PPE available to dairy farms, but few have taken them up on the offer. Milking parlors can be hot and humid, meaning it’s not particularly pleasant to wear goggles, gowns, and masks.) “The most important thing would be not to have this virus circulating,” particularly in mammals, Eckerle said. She added that other flu vaccines can’t always halt transmission, even if they reduce the risk of serious illness. It’s possible then these vaccines will perform similarly. “They might prevent symptoms or disease, but we don’t know if they prevent infection,” she said. Related: Bird flu keeps rewriting the textbooks. It’s why scientists are unsettled by the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak Scientists have worried H5N1 could pose a pandemic threat since its discovery nearly 30 years ago. But in just the past few years, the virus has expanded its global footprint and its list of victims, spreading to just about every corner of the world and sickening and killing scores of wild and domesticated birds. It’s also found its way to an increasing number of mammals. The dairy cow outbreak — which thus far has only been seen in the U.S. — is the latest twist in its history. Finland, in particular, has been dealing with H5N1 outbreaks not just among birds, but on its fur farms, with at least 71 farms having cases last year. While most of the farms housed foxes, it’s the spread of the virus in mink in particular that heightens concerns. The receptors the virus uses to infiltrate their cells are thought to be similar to ours, possibly providing the virus with a training ground to become better at infecting our cells. Moreover, mink can be infected by avian and human flu viruses simultaneously, which could allow the viruses to swap genes and for the resulting pathogen to become more adept at spreading among people. Last month, Finnish authorities announced expanded surveillance measures for the virus on the country’s fur farms; those measures will be in place through the end of September, a stretch when officials said the risk of transmission to the farm animals from wild birds was at its highest. But officials noted that Europe has documented fewer infections in wild bird populations this year than have been seen in the recent past.

[+] 8, 2024. The milking process takes between 2 and 3 minutes. (Photo by Matthew Ludak for The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post via Getty Images A new strain of bird flu, H5N2, was just identified in Mexico City, following the death of a 59-year-old man. The strain, different from the H5N1 bird flu that has infected three dairy farm workers in the U.S., has not been previously seen in people. Part of the worry is that the man had been bedridden at home and had no known exposure to birds or animals. The man did have underlying diabetes and chronic kidney failure, both of which make people more susceptible to infections. He became ill on April 17 with fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea. He died on April 24. None of his contacts have had positive tests for flu A to date. However, El Universal reported that “12 contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the patient's residence” and that serology is pending. H5N2 has been known to be circulating in birds in the area. It’s confusing to keep all the names of the different flu types straight—H5N1, H5N2, bird flu, swine flu, flu A, flu B and more. The three main types of flu, A, B and C, are named after core proteins. We have annual outbreaks of influenza A, which is the most serious. Influenza A H1N1 caused the deadly 1918 outbreak. Flu B is usually less severe and causes infections every few years. Flu C hasn’t caused epidemics. The “H” and “N” in the names refer to surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which help the virus stick to and invade the cells. Sometimes, the strains mutate and swap genetic material, making it more infective. This happened when H1N1 and H2N2 combined and mutated in birds, resulting in a “bird flu” that could now infect people. This resulted in the 1957 influenza pandemic in Asia from H2N2, a novel (new to humans) strain. Strains are also divided into highly pathogenic avian influenza or low pathogenic. The biggest concern in recent months has been HPAI H5N1. The best illustration of the relationship between different flu strains in people and animals is that by David McCandless. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributorWho can catch which flu?David McCandless, Information is Beautiful H5N1 is the strain decimating some poultry flocks and dairy herds. We know it has spread to cause illness in a few people, but we don’t know the extent because only limited and inadequate testing is being done. “We’re making the same mistakes today that we made with COVID. And what do I mean by that? We’re not testing to really see how many people have been exposed and got asymptomatically infected,” Deborah Birx, former Covid-19 response coordinator, told CNN. “We could be pool testing every dairy worker. I do believe that there’s undetected cases in humans, because we’re once again only tracking people with symptoms. When we did that with COVID, the virus spread throughout the Northeast undetected.” Influenza specialist Andy Pekosz, Ph.D. echoed this, saying, “Right now, there should be extensive, perhaps weekly testing of all dairy farm workers coupled with increased availability and training of workers to use protective gear.” He added, “My understanding is that those programs have capacity, but because they are voluntary, they need agreement from farmers and farmer workers to participate. CDC cannot mandate testing, but they can provide it. I think increased testing and protective gear can be done in a way that is minimally disruptive to a dairy farm operation, but clearly there is reticence to take part in these voluntary programs.” With this Mexican patient, the consensus among experts is that this is likely an isolated “spillover” case, and the risk to the general population is very low. However, there is growing concern that this or the H5N1 virus in the U.S. will mutate and become more infectious. H5 viruses are reportedly more likely to infect people than other strains. There has been an ongoing outbreak of H5N1 in Asia with a much higher mortality. Pekosz said there has been “better documentation of the case-fatality rate there,” given their higher numbers. “The large number of cases in Asia are primarily due to increased human-poultry contact in that part of the world. If you limit things like live bird markets and provide poultry farm workers with some basic protective gear, you can drastically limit human H5N1 cases anywhere, but particularly in Southeast Asia.” The H5N1 virus is increasingly found in various wild animals, most recently cats and mice. Dr. Rick Bright, virologist, pandemic expert and former head of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, told The Telegraph, “This brings the virus closer to human homes. It increases the risk of direct exposure and infection.” It will make any control efforts far more difficult as the mice can quickly spread infection. Rodents are notorious for causing epidemics, from the Black Death (bubonic plague), to Lassa fever in Africa, to Hantavirus in the Southwest U.S. Another criticism of current control efforts is that there is a delay of weeks in making data public, and genetic sequencing to see similarities between strains is also not being made public. Bright noted, “Need to urgently see sequences to know if it was fully avian virus, or possible reassortant with human H3N2 virus.” People are also calling for vaccinations to be offered for dairy workers, which is being started in Finland. For now, your best safety precautions are to wear masks and goggles if in the vicinity of cows being milked and to avoid raw dairy products. I would also recommend avoiding 4H club shows or county fairs. If you can’t resist going, it would be safest to wear a mask and goggles, given what we currently know about transmission.

As outbreaks of H5N1—a dangerous strain of avian influenza—continue to affect cows in the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe, and Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on June 5 the first-ever case of a human infection with H5N2, a different strain of avian influenza. The infection was fatal.The case was first reported to the WHO on May 23 by health officials in Mexico City, where a 59-year-old man with several other health conditions was hospitalized. Before reporting shortness of breath, diarrhea, and nausea, the man had been bedridden for three weeks. Testing by the national lab showed that the man had H5N2, and further genetic sequencing confirmed the strain. Unlike the recent U.S. cases of H5N1 in people, the patient did not have any known exposure to infected animals. (However, outbreaks of H5N2 have recently been reported in poultry in Mexico.) The good news is that none of the patient’s close contacts or those caring for him in the hospital tested positive for the virus. What this means for peopleAvian influenza generally does not cause serious disease in people, and in previous cases of rare human infections, the virus did not spread easily from person to person. The first report of human infection with H5N2 “doesn’t really change anything in my mind,” says Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection control officer at Tufts Medicine Health System. “We’ve been seeing sporadic avian flu infection in humans for a long time, and it very rarely transmits to other humans. But like any avian flu, it bears watching to make sure it does not herald a new phenomenon.”Questions that urgently need answering Genetic sequencing of the virus from the Mexican patient will be important, as it could reveal from which animal it likely arose, or whether there are any concerning changes signaling that the virus is evolving to spread more easily among people.Sequencing will also be critical to potentially answering some questions about how the bird flu virus is jumping into more mammalian species. “There is likely a role here for different kinds of receptors in different species and in different tissues in those species,” says Doron, since the virus seems to preferentially infect respiratory tissues in birds, mammary tissues in cows, and the conjunctiva, or eyes, in people.Read More: What Animal Studies Are Revealing About Their Minds—and Ours“What is not clear is that in any new mammal infected, how the virus is introduced and how it is passing between them,” she says. “We still don’t definitely have an understanding of how the virus is transmitting from cow to cow, because there are especially high concentrations in the mammary glands but not in the respiratory tract. That throws a wrench into our entire spectrum of understanding.”The virus is inching closer to humansThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that H5N1 has been found in 11 house mice in New Mexico. Farms in the state have reported H5N1 outbreaks in cows, so it’s possible that the mice consumed unpasteurized milk from infected cows and became infected themselves. But that means the virus is inching closer to contact with people, since most people are more likely to encounter house mice than dairy cattle. “Any house, any home, any lodging or campground could bring humans in close contact with mice,” says Doron.In the U.S., health officials are monitoring for H5N1 in wastewater, which can provide an early signal for rises cases. Scientists with WastewaterSCAN—a collaboration between academic researchers and the health data company Verily that contributes data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—retested old samples from municipal sewage treatment plants and found H5N1 in the samples about a week before there were reports of a unknown illness in cows in Texas, where some of the first outbreaks occurred. “Had we had testing in real time then, it definitely would have provided a leading edge [on the outbreak],” says Marlene Wolfe, co-program director for WastewaterSCAN and an assistant professor of environmental health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Read More: Experts Can’t Agree If We’re Still in a PandemicThe group continues to monitor for H5N1 and will still do so into the fall and winter, when other influenza strains start to spread among people. That way, we'll be better able to determine if bird flu is having any impact on humans.Determining how big a threat avian influenza could be for people is a growing priority for health officials, and learning more about how the virus is moving from species to species is critical for making that assessment. For example, it’s not clear which tissue samples from the mice were positive, so it’s unknown whether the mice are transmitting the virus through urine or feces (which could pose a risk to people who might come into contact with them) or via other means. Cows, on the other hand, don’t seem to excrete much virus in their urine or feces, so even though the virus is circulating in mammals, “it’s not necessarily highly transmissible,” says Doron. “We could get lucky here.”Nonetheless, some farmers have been culling sick cows to avoid widespread cases and the potential of infected, unsellable milk. And “scientists should worry, since there is always potentially a first time that a genetic shift could mean more transmissibility in humans,” says Doron. A wake-up callThe H5N1 outbreaks and the first case of human H5N2 highlight the need for health officials to rethink how they monitor for flu. “We didn’t realize avian flu was circulating in cows for probably three months,” says Doron. “By the same token, there may be more H5N2 in Mexico in more species than birds—and we need to be doing more surveillance. We need to broaden our minds going forward to look for flu even in places where we don’t think we’ll find it.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

They were hospitalized on April 24 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City and died the same day.The World Health Organisation (WHO) at their headquarters in Geneva, Dec. 7, 2021.Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images, FILEThe patient's relatives said the person had underlying conditions and they had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons prior to contracting bird flu, the WHO said. On Wednesday night, Mexico's Health Ministry said the patient had "a history of chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes [and] long-term systemic arterial hypertension."Test results eventually revealed the patient was infected with bird flu subtype H5N2, which has never been documented in humans before.No further cases have been documented during health officials' investigation, according to the WHO. Of the 17 people the patient came into contact with at the hospital, one person reported a runny nose in late April. Samples taken from the contacts tested negative for flu and COVID-19.Twelve additional people the patient came into contact with -- seven with symptoms and five without -- were identified near the patient's residence. Nasal samples, throat samples and blood samples were taken from the contacts. The nose and throat samples tested negative for COVID-19 and results from the blood samples are ongoing.Mexico's Ministry of Health said in a statement Wednesday that "all samples from identified contacts have been negative" for H5N2.MORE: CDC preparing for 'possibility of increased risk to human health' from bird fluThe WHO said while a human infection with bird flu "has the potential for high public health impact," the global health agency said the current risk to the general population is low.Mexico's Ministry of Health echoed the WHO in its statement."The Ministry of Health informs that there is no risk of contagion for the population with the detection of the first human case of low pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N2) in Mexico, since there is no identified source of infection," the statement read.On Thursday, Mexican Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer said there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and reiterated that the patient had pre-existing health issues, including diabetes and kidney problems."There is no reason to avoid eating chicken and its products or to be worried about it," Alcocer said in public remarks.In the U.S., an outbreak of the H5N1 strain has been found to sicken millions of birds as well as older dairy cows. So far, three farmworkers have been sickened in the U.S., one in Texas and two in Michigan.All three had mild symptoms and have recovered or are recovering. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."While both H5N2 and H5N1 belong to the same family of influenza A viruses, H5N1 has been known to infect humans for years, whereas this is the first-ever reported case of H5N2 in humans," said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation office at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. "The good news is that neither H5N2 nor H5N1 have demonstrated human-to-human transmission so far. However, this first case is a wake-up call. It reminds us that influenza viruses can evolve, and continued surveillance of these viruses in both animals and humans is crucial."Related TopicsBird FluPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsMan who contracted H5N2 bird flu dies in Mexico, WHO says | World Health Organization News | Al Jazeera Skip linksSkip to Contentplay Live Show navigation menuNavigation menuNewsShow more news sectionsMiddle EastAfricaAsiaUS & CanadaLatin AmericaEuropeAsia PacificWar on GazaUS ElectionOpinionSportVideoMoreShow more sectionsFeaturesUkraine warEconomyClimate CrisisInvestigationsInteractivesIn PicturesScience & TechnologyPodcastsplay Live Click here to searchsearchNews|World Health OrganizationMan who contracted H5N2 bird flu dies in Mexico, WHO saysThe H5N2 strain has never before been found in a human, health agency says, but stresses risk remains low.A person holds a test tube labelled 'Bird Flu', in this picture illustration, January 14, 2023 [File: Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters]Published On 6 Jun 20246 Jun 2024A man in Mexico with prior health complications has died after contracting the A(H5N2) strain of bird flu, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced, cautioning that the risk to the general public by the virus remained low. The global health agency, in a statement on Wednesday, said the 59-year-old died in Mexico City in April after developing symptoms including a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea and nausea. The man’s relatives said he had already been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before the onset of his acute symptoms. Mexico’s public health department said in a statement that the man’s underlying ailments included chronic kidney failure, diabetes and high blood pressure. He sought hospital care on April 24 and died on the same day. Initial tests showed an unidentified type of flu that subsequent weeks of lab testing confirmed was A(H5N2), the WHO said. It was the “first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally”, the agency added. Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University in the United States, told the Reuters news agency that the man’s prior health conditions put him at “a risk of more severe influenza”. But how this individual got infected “is a big question mark”. The WHO said the source of exposure to the virus was unknown, although cases of A(H5N2) have been reported in poultry in Mexico. These include in a backyard chicken farm in Michoacan state, which borders Mexico State, where the man lived, but authorities have so far been unable to establish a connection. The WHO said no further human cases have been discovered despite testing people who came in contact with the deceased at home and in hospital. “Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low,” it said. Mexico’s Ministry of Health also said there was “no risk of contagion for the population,” noting that “all samples from identified contacts [of the patient] have been negative”. Authorities are monitoring farms near the victim’s home and have established a permanent monitoring system to detect other cases in wildlife in the area, the ministry added. A different variant of bird flu, A(H5N1), has been spreading for weeks among dairy cow herds in the US, with a small number of cases reported among humans. Other bird flu varieties have killed people across the world in previous years, including 18 people in China during an outbreak of A(H5N6) in 2021, according to a timeline of bird flu outbreaks from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pekosz said that since 1997, H5 viruses have continuously shown a propensity to infect mammals more than any other avian influenza virus. “So it continues to ring that warning bell that we should be very vigilant about monitoring for these infections because every spillover is an opportunity for that virus to try to accumulate those mutations that make it better infect humans,” Pekosz said.

Testing at Mexico's Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference confirmed that the person had H5N2. Daniel Becerril/Reuters CNN — Even as the United States grapples with an outbreak of H5N1 flu in dairy cattle, the World Health Organization has announced the first known human infection with a different strain, H5N2, in a person in Mexico who died of complications of their infection. Both of these strains of the influenza A virus have primarily affected farmed and wild birds, infecting flocks around the world. About 900 human cases of H5N1 have been reported since 1996, and about half of people known to be infected have died. On Wednesday, WHO said it had confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N2 in a 59-year-old resident of Mexico. This 2005 electron microscope image shows an avian influenza A H5N1 virion. On Wednesday, May 22, 2024, Michigan health officials said a farmworker has been diagnosed with bird flu, the second human case connected to an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via AP) Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC/AP Related article Third person in US tests positive for bird flu in connection to outbreak in dairy cattle The source of the person’s infection is unknown, although WHO noted that H5N2 viruses had been reported in poultry in Mexico. Because any new influenza A infection in people has the potential for high public health impact, it must be reported to WHO. The organization said that based on current knowledge, the risk to the general public from H5N2 is low, since other H5 subtypes are known to infect humans but none has been shown to cause sustained human-to-human spread. The person, who had multiple underlying medical conditions, had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before they developed new symptoms. In mid-April, they developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and weakness. On April 24, they sought medical attention and were hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City. The person died of complications that day. On May 8, a sample sent for specialized testing indicated that it was positive for H5N2, and the result was subsequently confirmed by a different lab.

Of 17 people at the hospital who’d been in contact with the patient, no further cases were identified. Twelve additional contacts were identified near the person’s residence, and seven of those had symptoms, but testing of samples from these cases didn’t identify Covid-19 or any type of flu. Scientists are now testing blood samples to see whether they can find antibodies that would point to past infections. In March, an H5N2 outbreak was reported in a backyard poultry farm in a neighboring state to the one where the person lived. According to WHO, it hasn’t been possible to establish whether this case is related to recent poultry outbreaks. Flu viruses normally circulate in birds but occasionally can jump to other species, including humans. People catch the viruses from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, type A flu strains can be classified as bird flu, swine flu or other types of animal influenza viruses. Bird flu infections in humans can cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. Eye infections like conjunctivitis, gut symptoms and brain swelling are also possible.

This avian influenza strain has killed millions of wild birds and caused sporadic outbreaks among poultry. Now there is a multistate outbreak among dairy cows in the U.S.While bird flu is rare in humans, three cases have been reported in the U.S. April marked the first report of a cow-to-human case of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in a dairy worker in Texas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a second human case of bird flu in late May in a dairy worker in Michigan, where the virus has also been identified in dairy cows. Both patients only reported eye symptoms associated with conjunctivitis. Advancing public health AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Learn More In a third case, another dairy worker in Michigan had eye symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms—congestion, sore throat, cough, fatigue, and “runny” and burning eyes—that are more typical of human influenza infections.Previously, the A(H5N1) virus was confirmed in a person in Colorado in 2022 from exposure to poultry . The patient reported fatigue as their only symptom and fully recovered.Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported that dairy cattle herds in nine states have confirmed cases of A(H5N1) virus infections. While A(H5N1) virus causes less severe illness in cattle than in poultry, the disease remains a concern for all livestock and also for humans who come into contact with infected animals.Here are some questions patients might have about A(H5N1) virus, along with the answers that physicians should be ready to share. Visit the AMA bird flu (H5N1) resource center to learn more. What is the A(H5N1) virus or H5 bird flu? What is the A(H5N1) virus or H5 bird flu? HPAI A(H5N1) virus is a type of influenza virus that causes highly infectious and severe respiratory disease in birds. That is why it is called avian influenza or bird flu. It is causing outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows in the U.S. And while the current public health risk for the general public is low, the CDC is carefully watching the situation and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures. What are the symptoms of A(H5N1) virus infection? What are the symptoms of A(H5N1) virus infection? They range from no symptoms to mild, flu-like illness to severe illness that requires hospitalization. For example, the dairy workers infected in the U.S. reported mild illness, with the main symptoms being conjunctivitis or eye infection.Some other common symptoms are consistent with the flu, according to the CDC, and include cough, sore throat, eye redness or discharge, fever or feeling feverish, runny nose, fatigue, muscle or joint pain and headache. For moderate to severe illness, symptoms can include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and altered mental state or seizures. How long after exposure do symptoms appear? How long after exposure do symptoms appear? People who are exposed should monitor themselves daily for signs and symptoms of new illness for up to 10 days after the last known exposure. The incubation period depends on the strain of the virus, the dose, the route of exposure and the species. Available data suggests that the estimated incubation period for human infection with A(H5N1) virus is generally three to five days, but has been reported to be as long as seven to 10 days. How is A(H5N1) bird flu diagnosed? How is A(H5N1) bird flu diagnosed? The A(H5N1) virus infection in people cannot be diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms alone. Laboratory testing is needed to confirm A(H5N1) virus infection in humans.Physicians and other health professionals should notify their state and local health departments to arrange testing for influenza A(H5N1) virus. They should also collect respiratory specimens from the patient to test for influenza A(H5N1) virus at the health department. If the exposed person has conjunctivitis, with or without respiratory symptoms, both a conjunctival swab and a nasopharyngeal swab should be collected for testing. Who is at risk of contracting A(H5N1) virus? Who is at risk of contracting A(H5N1) virus? The risk of A(H5N1) virus infection is low for the general public in the U.S. But people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. How is A(H5N1) virus transmitted to humans? How is A(H5N1) virus transmitted to humans? People rarely get A(H5N1) virus infections, but when they do, it is most often acquired through close, prolonged and unprotected contact—no gloves, protective wear, face masks, respirators or eye protection—with infected birds or other animals.Human infections with avian influenza A viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when the virus is in the air in droplets or dust and a person breathes it in or when a person touches something that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose, according to the CDC. What are infection prevention and control recommendations for A(H5N1)? What are infection prevention and control recommendations for A(H5N1)? Standard, contact and airborne precautions are recommended for patients presenting for medical care or evaluation who have illness consistent with influenza and recent exposure to birds or other animals potentially infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. If signs and symptoms compatible with avian flu are present, physicians should isolate the patient and follow infection-control recommendations, including the use of personal protective equipment.

What treatments are available for A(H5N1) virus infections? There is Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral treatment for seasonal flu that can be used for A(H5N1) virus infection. Antiviral treatment is recommended with oseltamivir as soon as possible for outpatients and hospitalized patients who are suspected, probable or confirmed cases of human infection with A(H5N1).Starting empiric antiviral treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir—twice daily for five days—is recommended regardless of time since onset of symptoms. Antiviral treatment should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory test results. And while there is currently no indication of the disease spreading further among humans, these patients should isolate to reduce risk of infecting others. How effective are antiviral medications against A(H5N1) virus? How effective are antiviral medications against A(H5N1) virus? Antiviral treatment works best when started early after symptoms begin. Antivirals can also be given soon after unprotected exposure—such as not using respiratory and eye protection—to prevent infection and illness. When influenza viruses evolve, it can make treatment less effective. The CDC regularly tests bird flu viruses for antiviral resistance. Is there a vaccine for the A(H5N1) virus? Is there a vaccine for the A(H5N1) virus? There are H5 candidate vaccine viruses that could be used to produce a vaccine. According to theU.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ assistant secretary for preparedness and response, officials are moving ahead with a plan to produce 4.8 million doses of H5N1 avian flu vaccine for pandemic preparedness. Active discussions are underway across federal agencies about what the key triggers would be for deploying H5N1 vaccine doses. What measures are being taken to control the spread of A(H5N1) virus? What measures are being taken to control the spread of A(H5N1) virus? Testing for the flu typically declines over the summer, but the CDC is working on a plan for enhanced nationwide monitoring to ensure that even rare cases of A(H5N1) virus in the community are detected. This includes increasing the number of influenza virus specimens that are tested and then subtyped in public health laboratories that can detect A(H5N1) virus.Additionally, the federal government is offering financial incentives to dairy-farm owners to encourage broader testing of cattle and expand biosecurity measures to control the growing outbreak. It is only available to farms with infected herds. Testing of cattle and farm workers is important to controlling this outbreak. What can I do to protect myself and my family from the A(H5N1) virus? What can I do to protect myself and my family from the A(H5N1) virus? Since the A(H5N1) virus is not spreading among humans, most people don’t need to worry about precautions. But the best prevention is to avoid sources of exposure. That means avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with, or suspected to be infected with, bird flu viruses. Notably, wild birds can be infected with avian influenza even if they don’t look sick.It is also important to avoid being near dead animals or surfaces contaminated with an animal’s feces or litter, raw milk, saliva, mucous or other byproducts when not wearing respiratory or eye protection. And, as always, people should not eat uncooked or undercooked food. They should avoid uncooked food products such as unpasteurized raw milk or cheeses from animals who have a suspected or confirmed infection, the CDC says. Is it OK to drink milk? Is it OK to drink milk? The FDA has been sampling retail milk and other dairy products. To date, they have not found live, infectious virus in the products.The CDC issued a Health Alert Network Health Advisory with recommendations that support consumption of only pasteurized milk and dairy products made from pasteurized milk. Most of the nutritional benefits of drinking milk are available from pasteurized milk. It is important not to consume unpasteurized “raw” milk or products made from unpasteurized milk because it can contain bacteria or viruses, such as A(H5N1) virus, that can cause serious illness, hospitalization or death. The CDC has developed advice for health care professionals on raw milk (PDF). Related Coverage What doctors wish patients knew about the flu Can I get A(H5N1) virus from eating poultry or eggs? Can I get A(H5N1) virus from eating poultry or eggs? There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared food. Cooking poultry, eggs and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross contamination between raw and cooked food are key to preventing any food safety hazard, including infection from the A(H5N1) virus, according to the FDA . What should I do if I find a dead bird? What should I do if I find a dead bird? It is important to avoid contact with wild or domestic birds that appear ill or have died. If you do encounter a sick or dead bird, call to report it because wildlife agencies regularly investigate reports of sick or dead animals. This type of reporting can help with early detection of illnesses such as the bird flu or West Nile virus, according to the CDC. Is it safe to travel to areas where cases of A(H5N1) virus have been reported? Is it safe to travel to areas where cases of A(H5N1) virus have been reported? The CDC does not have any travel restrictions related to the bird flu to states or countries affected by avian influenza in wild birds, poultry, other animals or people. But travelers to countries or states with bird-flu outbreaks in poultry or people should not visit poultry farms, bird markets or other places where live poultry are raised, kept or sold.When traveling—just as at home—do not eat raw or undercooked poultry products and wash your hands after touching uncooked poultry. Beyond that, practice good hygiene and visit a doctor if you become sick during or after travel. Table of Contents What is the A(H5N1) virus or H5 bird flu?

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Recent outbreaks of bird flu – in US dairy herds, poultry farms in Australia and elsewhere, and isolated cases in humans – have raised the issue of food safety. So can the virus transfer from infected farm animals to contaminate milk, meat or eggs? How likely is this? And what do we need to think about to minimise our risk when shopping for or preparing food? How safe is milk? Bird flu (or avian influenza) is a bird disease caused by specific types of influenza virus. But the virus can also infect cows. In the US, for instance, to date more than 80 dairy herds in at least nine states have been infected with the H5N1 version of the virus. Investigations are under way to confirm how this happened. But we do know infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and faeces. So bird flu can potentially contaminate animal-derived food products during processing and manufacturing. Indeed, fragments of bird flu genetic material (RNA) were found in cow’s milk from the dairy herds associated with infected US farmers. However, the spread of bird flu among cattle, and possibly to humans, is likely to have been caused through contact with contaminated milking equipment, not the milk itself. The test used to detect the virus in milk – which uses similar PCR technology to lab-based COVID tests – is also highly sensitive. This means it can detect very low levels of the bird flu RNA. But the test does not distinguish between live or inactivated virus, just that the RNA is present. So from this test alone, we cannot tell if the virus found in milk is infectious (and capable of infecting humans). It’s best to stick with pasteurised milk. Amnixia/Shutterstock Does that mean milk is safe to drink and won’t transmit bird flu? Yes and no. In Australia, where bird flu has not been reported in dairy cattle, the answer is yes. It is safe to drink milk and milk products made from Australian milk. In the US, the answer depends on whether the milk is pasteurised. We know pasteurisation is a common and reliable method of destroying concerning microbes, including influenza virus. Like most viruses, influenza virus (including bird flu virus) is inactivated by heat. Although there is little direct research on whether pasteurisation inactivates H5N1 in milk, we can extrapolate from what we know about heat inactivation of H5N1 in chicken and eggs. So we can be confident there is no risk of bird flu transmission via pasteurised milk or milk products. However, it’s another matter for unpasteurised or “raw” US milk or milk products. A recent study showed mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu developed signs of illness. So to be on the safe side, it would be advisable to avoid raw milk products. How about chicken? Bird flu has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide, including in Australia. In recent weeks, there have been three reported outbreaks in Victorian poultry farms (two with H7N3 bird flu, one with H7N9). There has been one reported outbreak in Western Australia (H9N2). The strains of bird flu identified in the Victorian and Western Australia outbreaks can cause human infection, although these are rare and typically result from close contact with infected live birds or contaminated environments. Therefore, the chance of bird flu transmission in chicken meat is remote. Nonetheless, it is timely to remind people to handle chicken meat with caution as many dangerous pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, can be found on chicken carcasses. Always handle chicken meat carefully when shopping, transporting it home and storing it in the kitchen. For instance, make sure no meat juices cross-contaminate other items, consider using a cool bag when transporting meat, and refrigerate or freeze the meat within two hours. Avoid washing your chicken before cooking to prevent the spread of disease-causing microbes around the kitchen. Finally, cook chicken thoroughly as viruses (including bird flu) cannot survive cooking temperatures. Are eggs safe? The recent Australian outbreaks have occurred in egg-laying or mixed poultry flocks, so concerns have been raised about bird flu transmission via contaminated chicken eggs. Can flu viruses contaminate chicken eggs and potentially spread bird flu? It appears so. A report from 2007 said it was feasible for influenza viruses to enter through the eggshell. This is because influenza virus particles are smaller (100 nanometres) than the pores in eggshells (at least 200 nm). So viruses could enter eggs and be protected from cleaning procedures designed to remove microbes from the egg surface. Therefore, like the advice about milk and meat, cooking eggs is best. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends cooking poultry, eggs and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food. In a nutshell If you consume pasteurised milk products and thoroughly cook your chicken and eggs, there is nothing to worry about as bird flu is inactivated by heat. The real fear is that the virus will evolve into highly pathogenic versions that can be transmitted from human to human. That scenario is much more frightening than any potential spread though food.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-flu-reports/surveillance-of-influenza-and-other-seasonal-respiratory-viruses-in-winter-2021-to-2022 This report describes surveillance findings for seasonal influenza, other seasonal respiratory viruses and the monitoring of human cases of avian influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In the 2021 to 2022 season (from week 40 of 2021 to the week 14 of 2022 reporting cut-off), low levels of influenza activity were seen across the UK, with most indicators remaining below baseline for the majority of the season. Although activity was generally higher than levels observed during the 2020 to 2021 season, it remained much lower than those in previous seasons. Through several indicators, low level increases in activity were observed first in 2021 before coronavirus (COVID-19) Omicron control measures from late November 2021 suppressed influenza transmission. Influenza subsequently increased in multiple indicators up to week 14 of 2022 (declining thereafter, data not shown), representing late-season activity. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype, with low-level influenza type B Victoria lineage in 2021 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections becoming more prominent in 2022 though still a small proportion of subtyped viruses. Of the genetically characterised influenza A(H3N2) detections, the majority were in the subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data reported from the various influenza surveillance systems should be interpreted with caution. Increases seen in some indicators may not accurately reflect influenza activity but rather COVID-19 activity, and that of other respiratory pathogens. Interpretation of influenza surveillance data should take into account the effect of public health messaging and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, as well as potential changes in health seeking behaviours due to COVID-19 activity. In primary care, GP influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates across the UK remained below baseline intensity levels for the duration of the 2021 to 2022 season. Rates were generally higher than those observed in the 2020 to 2021 season, however remained much lower than rates observed in seasons prior. In secondary care, both hospital and critical care (ICU or HDU) influenza admissions remained below the baseline threshold levels for the majority of the season, with hospital admissions rising slightly above the baseline in week 12 and week 14 of 2022. While rates were higher than those observed in 2020 to 2021, admissions were lower than those seen in previous seasons. Provisional end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5% to 43%) against all laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in adults aged 50 years and over. For children aged 1 to 17 years, VE was 73% (95% CI 53% to 84%). Adults aged 50 to 64 years old were again offered the flu vaccine in 2021 to 2022, after the supply-dependent extension of the programme to this cohort in 2020 to 2021. The childhood programme was also extended in secondary school children across the UK up to the school leaving age (the school year in which children turn 16 years of age). Vaccine uptake in England varied by cohort for the 2021 to 2022 season. Vaccine uptake in those aged 65 years and over was at 82.3% compared to 80.9% in 2020 to 2021. This is the highest uptake ever achieved in this cohort, and is likely to reflect the continued awareness of the protection from vaccination since the COVID-19 pandemic. For other cohorts, vaccine uptake was slightly below levels observed in 2020 to 2021, with uptake in 2 and 3 year olds at 50.1% compared to 56.7% in 2020 to 2021. Vaccine uptake in those aged 6 months to under 65 years clinically at-risk was similar to last season, at 52.9% compared to 53.0% in 2020 to 2021. Vaccine uptake in pregnant women in England in the 2021 to 2022 season was 37.9%, compared to 43.6% in 2020 to 2021. The 2021 to 2022 season saw 61.4% of all frontline HCWs with direct patient care (from all organisations submitting data) receiving the influenza vaccine in England, down from 76.8% in the 2020 to 2021 season. This is lower than the uptake observed in this cohort in the previous 5 seasons. The influenza vaccination programme in the UK for school-aged children was extended in secondary school aged children in 2021 to 2022. Vaccine uptake in all primary school age children in England (age 4 to 11 years old) was 57.4% compared to 62.5% in 2020 to 2021. Vaccine uptake in all secondary school age children in England (age 11 to 16 years old) was 43.6%. Activity from other circulating seasonal respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), was generally higher than levels observed in 2020 to 2021 but lower than levels in pre-pandemic seasons. RSV activity was relatively low between week 40, 2021 and week 14, 2022 after out-of-season increases in summer 2021. Novel and emerging respiratory viruses including MERS-CoV and avian-origin influenza viruses, have continued to result in human cases in affected countries. There have been multiple detections of avian influenza in avian species in the UK in 2021 to 2022 as reported by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The UK reported a first human case of influenza A(H5N1) in January 2022 in a person directly exposed to infected birds, with no evidence of onward transmission. Surveillance and public health measures are recommended in the UK for persons potentially exposed to infected birds and for severe respiratory disease among travellers returning from affected countries. Influenza in the UK Surveillance of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses in the UK is undertaken throughout the year and collated on behalf of the 4 nations of the UK by the Influenza Surveillance team at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). This is in collaboration with teams within UKHSA, Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW) and the Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern Ireland, who are each responsible for monitoring influenza activity for their respective countries. Surveillance is also carried out for novel respiratory viruses, including MERS-CoV which was first recognised in September 2012 and for human infections with avian influenza such as influenza A(H7N9) which emerged in China in 2013; influenza A(H5N1) which emerged in China in 2003 and influenza A(H5N6) which has been seen in China since 2013. Weekly outputs on influenza are normally published during the winter season between October (week 40) and May (week 20), the period when influenza typically circulates. From the 2020 to 2021 season, reports containing surveillance data on both influenza and COVID-19 have continued to be published on a weekly basis. A variety of data sources are collated to provide information on influenza activity and to provide rapid estimates of influenza-related burden within the community, on the health service and in excess all-cause mortality. In addition, in-season and end-of-season monitoring of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness is undertaken. This report describes influenza activity observed in the UK in the period from week 40, 2021 (week ending 10 October 2021) to week 14, 2022 (week ending 10 April 2022). This includes observations and commentary on influenza activity, activity of other seasonal and novel respiratory viruses and from the influenza vaccination programmes. It is important to note that flu activity continued beyond week 14 of 2022, representing late-season activity. Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses continues to be carried out, with further data published in the UKHSA weekly national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report. The moving epidemic method (MEM)(1) is used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to standardise reporting of influenza activity across Europe. It has been adopted by the UK and is presented for GP influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates for each UK scheme and for the hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions rate through the SARI Watch scheme. The current MEM thresholds have been applied to data since the 2019 to 2020 season in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the 2021 to 2022 season, the licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was offered to children aged 2 to 16 years. In England, LAIV was offered to 2 and 3 year olds through primary care and to all children in primary and secondary school (all children from reception to year 11, aged 4 to 16 years old) through schools this year. This is the first influenza season where all children up to the school leaving age in the UK have been offered vaccination through the schools’ programme. During the 2021 to 2022 season, influenza vaccination was again offered to individuals between 50 and 64 years old. Measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses. These measures included public health messaging, social and physical distancing measures, national lockdowns, the wearing of face coverings, hand hygiene and travel restrictions. Changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour also affect some influenza indicators. Although many of these restrictions and interventions were lifted by the 2021 to 2022 influenza season, these factors continue to be important to consider when interpreting the influenza surveillance indicators presented in this report. In particular, additional measures were introduced in late November 2021 to control the emerging Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and were eased incrementally from the second half of January 2022. Community surveillance Syndromic surveillance In England, national UKHSA real-time syndromic surveillance systems include GP in-hours (GPIH) consultations and GP out-of-hours (GPOOH) contacts, emergency department (ED) attendances (Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS)) and NHS 111 calls and online assessments. These systems monitor a range of indicators sensitive to community influenza activity, for example NHS 111 ‘cold or flu’ calls and GP in-hours consultations for ILI. COVID-19 activity caused an increase in the use of ILI codes and other similar codes in the late stages of the 2019 to 2020 season in England. COVID-19 specific clinical codes were released during 2021 and were thereby available for use from the 2020 to 2021 season onwards. ILI (and similar respiratory) codes will not have been used to record COVID-19-like attendances, and many consultations that would, in previous seasons, have been coded to ILI are likely to have been assigned to COVID-19 codes from this point onwards. This should be noted when comparing to the rates between seasons. Furthermore, healthcare-seeking behaviour has also been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic due to periods of national lockdown and changes in guidance on how the public should access healthcare services. Syndromic data over the last two winter seasons should therefore be interpreted with some caution. During winter 2021 to 2022, syndromic surveillance indicators for GPIH ILI consultation rates remained low throughout the season and much lower than seen in previous seasons. Similarly, GPIH pneumonia consultation rates remained at low levels throughout the season, at similar levels to those observed in 2020 to 2021 but lower than those seen in previous seasons (Figure 1). GPIH ILI consultation rates remained stable and lower than those observed in previous seasons. GPOOH contacts remained stable and generally lower than those observed in seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. GPOOH acute respiratory infection (ARI) contacts remained lower than that seen in pre-pandemic seasons, but higher than those observed in 2020 to 2021 (Figure 1d). Figure 1a. Weekly all age GP in-hours consultations for ILI Figure 1b. Weekly all age GP in-hours consultations for pneumonia Figure 1c. GPOOH contacts for ILI Figure 1d. Weekly all age GPOOH contacts for ARI for winter 2017 to 2021, England ED attendance data presented here represents 94 EDs that reported throughout the most recent 4 influenza seasons. Therefore, numbers may differ slightly from those presented in the 2020 to 2021 annual report where a different number of EDs were included. ARI ED attendances were higher at the beginning of the season than in the previous 3 seasons, with a particular decline observed in late 2021 likely to be in line with the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron wave (Figure 2). Pneumonia ED attendances followed a similar pattern, with attendances largely below those seen during pre-pandemic seasons (Figure 2). ILI ED attendances remained low throughout the season until week 8, when increases were observed (Figure 2). Figure 2a. Weekly all age Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS) acute respiratory infection (ARI) attendances Figure 2b. Weekly all age EDSSS pneumonia attendances for winter 2018 to 2021 Figure 2c. EDSSS ILI attendances for winter 2018 to 2021 The number of NHS 111 ‘cold or flu’ calls was generally higher than the numbers seen in the previous 4 seasons up to week 51 of 2021. Numbers declined and remained stable until week 8 2022 where increases were observed, in line with increasing influenza activity (Figure 3). Figure 3. Weekly all age England NHS 111 cold or flu calls for winter 2017 to 2021 In Wales, the weekly proportion of cold or flu calls made to NHS Direct Wales remained relatively low and stable throughout the season (Figure 4). In Scotland, the weekly proportion of all calls to NHS 24 which mention cold or flu, was slightly higher than those observed in 2020 to 2021 however remained low throughout the season and much lower than those seen in the 3 previous seasons (Figure 5). Figure 4. Proportion of calls for cold or flu (all ages) to NHS-Direct, Wales, 2017 to 2022 Figure 5. Proportion of calls for cold or flu (all ages) through NHS 24, Scotland, 2017 to 2022 FluSurvey (internet based surveillance) Flusurvey, run by UKHSA, provides internet-based surveillance of ILI and COVID-19 symptoms in the UK population. It is part of a European wide initiative (including 11 European countries). On registration, individuals aged 18 and over complete a baseline profile questionnaire which collects information on demographic, geographic, socioeconomic (household size and composition, occupation, education, and transportation), and health (vaccination, diet, pregnancy, smoking, and underlying medical conditions) data. Subsequently, participants are sent weekly reminders via email to report any symptoms relating to flu or COVID-19 that they may have experienced and their health-seeking behaviour as a result of their symptoms. This creates a fast, reliable and flexible real-time monitoring surveillance system. Recruitment of survey participants remained open throughout the 2021 to 2022 season as a result of the ongoing pandemic. A total of 2,887 participants were recruited and completed at least one survey. The average weekly particilation was 2,625 (90.9%), contributing 70,782 responses across the 2021 to 2022 season. There were more participants in the 46 to 64 year age group (42.9%) compared to other age groups (0 to 18 years (2.3%), 19 to 45 years (15.3%), 65 years and over (39.5%)). There was a higher proportion of female participants compared to male participants (66.0% vs 34.0%). The majority (2,581 or 89.7%) of participants were resident in England, 177 participants were from Scotland, 19 participants were from Northern Ireland and 92 from Wales. Any participant completing the symptoms questionnaire during the reporting week was included in the analysis. The ECDC ILI case definition of sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of: fever, malaise, headache or muscle pain and at least one of: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath was applied. The total number of self-reported ILI episodes was 1,505 (2.1%). Overall, self-reported ILI activity was higher than that observed in the previous season, with peaks in weeks 44, 1 and 13 (Figure 6). Social mixing patterns amongst participants showed variation in how participants were mixing and meeting contacts outside of their households during the survey period. Mixing activity reduced through December, coinciding with Omicron controls, with increases observable from mid-January. Further analysis of the 2021 to 2022 flu survey will be available on the FluSurvey website in the summer. Figure 6. Weekly ILI incidence per 1,000 by reported through FluSurvey Please note that in the 2019 to 2020 season, FluSurvey reporting began in week 46. Figure 7. FluSurvey participants’ self-reported number of social contacts outside the household FluDetector (internet based surveillance) UKHSA works with University College London (UCL) to assess the use of internet-based search queries as a surveillance method for ILI in England. This is part of work on early-warning surveillance systems for influenza, through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) project i-sense. Combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques, a non-linear Gaussian process model was developed by UCL (2) to produce real-time estimates of ILI. The supervised model, trained on historical data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) scheme (2005 to 2006 to 2016 to 2017 seasons at national level), produces daily ILI estimates based on the proportion of ILI related search queries within a 10% to 15% sample of all queries issued, and is extracted daily from Google’s Health Trends Application Programming Interface. Estimated rates of ILI remained very low throughout the 2021 to 2022 season and below the baseline threshold level of 19.6 per 100,000. Overall estimated rates were slightly higher than those seen in 2020 to 2021, but lower than prior seasons (Figure 8). Figure 8. Daily estimated ILI Google search query rates per 100,000 population Outbreak reporting Incidents are suspected outbreaks of acute respiratory infections linked to a particular setting. Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, a total of 29,625 incidents in closed settings were reported in the UK, the majority of which were SARS-CoV-2. The 2021 to 2022 season saw an increase in the number of incidents of influenza and other respiratory viruses compared to the 2020 to 2021 season, however levels remained low compared to pre-pandemic seasons. England In England, there were a total of 22,536 confirmed ARI incidents in closed settings reported between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022. Of these, 13,139 (58.3%) were reported from care homes, 3,772 (16.7%) from educational settings, 1,139 (5.1%) from hospital settings and 4,486 (19.9%) from other settings. Where information on virological testing results were available, 15,434 were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2, followed by 30 influenza A incidents, 24 rhinovirus incidents, 13 RSV and 6 other viruses (Table 1). Table 1. The number of incidents in England by institution and virus type between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022 Setting Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Other respiratory viruses No organism reported Care home 21 9,770 38 3,310 Hospital 6 613 3 517 Educational settings 3 2,010 1 1,758 Prison 0 122 0 31 Workplace settings 0 520 0 127 Food outlet or restaurant 0 8 0 6 Other 0 2,391 1 1,280 Total 30 15,434 43 7,029 There were a total of 30 influenza incidents reported in this period, all of which were confirmed as influenza A (not subtyped). The majority of these occurred in care home settings, with the highest number in a week observed during week 14 (Figure 9). Figure 9. The number of influenza A outbreaks by week and setting, 2021 to 2022 Scotland In Scotland, there were a total of 4,806 ARI outbreaks reported between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022. An outbreak is defined as at least 2 cases (laboratory confirmed and or suspected) of any acute respiratory illness within 48 hours in any setting. Of these, 1,911 (39.8%) were reported from care homes, 1,411 (29.4%) from educational settings and 1,484 from other settings (30.8%). Virological results indicate 4,591 outbreaks were SARS-CoV-2, 6 influenza (not subtyped), 4 influenza A, 3 RSV and one each of enterovirus and rhinovirus. Outbreaks captured through the Outbreak Management tool (OBM) and HPZone are reported, therefore the total number of outbreaks may be an underestimate. Non-SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are only reported through HPZone. De-duplication processes are applied to outbreaks in both OBM and HPZone, however there is potential for double counting. Please note that the denominator for different settings will vary significantly, as does the propensity to report outbreaks between different settings. For these reasons, comparisons between settings are not advised. Wales In Wales, there were 1,225 outbreaks of acute respiratory infection reported to the Public Health Wales Health Protection teams between week 40, 2021 and week 14, 2022, compared to 2,869 between week 40 and week 14 during the 2020 to 2021 season. The majority were reported from care homes (87.7%), followed by community and other setting (9.6%), hospitals (2.0%) and school and nursery settings (0.7%). Virological results were available for 1,220 confirmed respiratory outbreaks, of which one was influenza A(not subtyped) and 1,219 were SARS-CoV-2. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, there were a total of 1,058 confirmed ARI outbreaks reported to the Public Health Agency between week 40, 2021 and week 14, 2022, compared to a total of 1,025 confirmed ARI outbreaks in the 2020 to 2021 season and 201 confirmed ARI outbreaks in the 2019 to 2020 season. Of these, 607 (57.4%) were reported from care homes, 310 (29.3%) from hospitals and 141 (13.3%) from other settings. Virological results were available for 1,058 confirmed respiratory outbreaks of which 1,049 were SARS-CoV-2, 4 were influenza A(not subtyped), 3 influenza (not subtyped) and 2 human parainfluenza viruses. Further information on ARI incidents during the 2021 to 2022 season is available in the weekly influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report and information on ARI incidents occurring in previous seasons is available in previous annual flu reports. Primary care consultations England Weekly rates of GP consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) through the RCGP scheme remained below the 2021 to 2022 season MEM baseline threshold of 12.2 per 100,000 for the duration of the influenza season (Figure 10). The ILI rate for 2021 to 2022 remained low and below baseline threshold up to week 14. The ILI rate was higher than that observed in the 2020 to 2021 season, however remained much lower than rates observed in seasons prior. In 2019 to 2020, 2018 to 2019 and 2017 to 2018 the ILI rates were above the MEM baseline threshold levels for 6, 8 and 14 weeks respectively (Figure 10). Figure 10. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2021 to 2022 and past seasons, England (RCGP) Scotland Weekly GP consultations for ILI remained below the baseline MEM threshold of 19.8 per 100,000 throughout the season in Scotland. Overall seasonal ILI activity was higher than levels observed in 2020 to 2021 however remained at much lower intensity compared to previous seasons (Figure 11). Figure 11. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2021 to 2022 and past seasons, Scotland Wales Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Wales remained below the baseline MEM threshold of 10.97 per 100,000 for the duration of the 2021 to 2022 season. Overall seasonal ILI activity was higher than levels observed in 2020 to 2021 however remained at much lower intensity compared to previous seasons (Figure 12). Figure 12. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2021 to 2022 and past seasons, Wales Northern Ireland Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Northern Ireland remained below the baseline MEM threshold of 11.3 per 100,000 for the duration of the season. Rates remained similar to those observed in 2020 to 2021 and at much lower intensity than seen in previous seasons (Figure 13). Figure 13. Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2021 to 2022 and past seasons, Northern Ireland Secondary care surveillance The Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch surveillance system was established in 2020 to report the number of laboratory confirmed influenza, COVID-19 and RSV cases admitted to hospital and critical care units (ICU or HDU) in NHS acute trusts across England. This has replaced the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance System (USISS) mandatory and sentinel data collections for influenza surveillance used in previous seasons, and the COVID-19 hospitalisations in England surveillance system (CHESS) collections for COVID-19 surveillance. The weekly rate of new admissions of influenza cases is based on the catchment population of those NHS Trusts who made a return in that week. The MEM method has been applied to the SARI Watch hospital and ICU or HDU admissions for confirmed influenza to assess the effect of influenza activity throughout the season. The MEM thresholds are calculated based on the 2014 to 2015 to the 2018 to 2019 seasons (data from 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 were excluded due to the COVID-19 pandemic). These thresholds have been applied to data from the 2019 to 2020 season onwards. Hospitalisations Through SARI Watch, a total of 1,015 hospitalised confirmed influenza cases were reported from 41 participating sentinel NHS acute trusts across England from week 40 2021 to week 14 2022. This compares to a season total of 40 cases from 56 participating Trusts in 2020 to 2021, 4,916 cases from 22 participating trusts in 2019 to 2020, 5,675 cases from 24 participating trusts in 2018 to 2019, and 10,221 cases from 25 participating trusts in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 14). The cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 14 was 5.84 per 100,000 trust catchment population in 2021 to 2022. This compares to a cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 14 of 0.18 per 100,000 in 2020 to 2021, 44.03 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 45.33 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 76.20 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. Hospital admission rates for confirmed influenza remained below the baseline threshold level (0.99 per 100,000 trust catchment population) for the majority of the 2021 to 2022 influenza season, rising slightly above the baseline in weeks 12 and 14 of 2022 (to 1.05 per 100,000 and 1.15 per 100,000 respectively). This represents a late-season rise in influenza hospitalisation activity. While rates were generally higher this season than during the 2020 to 2021 season, rates have remained considerably lower than those observed in seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 14). Of the 1,015 influenza hospital admissions reported up to week 14 2022, 46 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 269 were influenza A(H3N2), 635 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 65 were influenza B (Figure 15). Weekly confirmed influenza hospitalisation rates to sentinel hospital trusts in England since winter 2010 are shown in figure 16. Figure 14. Weekly overall influenza hospital admission rates per 100,000 trust catchment population (with thresholds) and number of influenza hospital admissions to sentinel Trusts, SARI Watch, England It should be noted that in some surveillance systems the high proportion of influenza A that is unsubytped may reflect increase in the use of rapid nucleic acid amplification tests used at the point of care. Hospital trusts are encouraged to perform influenza subtyping locally where possible or regionally and to integrate results into local information information systems. The subtyping data is used for public health surveillance and allows a more complete picture of circulating subtypes affecting severe cases in particular. Figure 15.

Weekly all-age rate and number of confirmed influenza hospital admissions to sentinel Trusts, 2010 to 2022, England ICU or HDU admissions Through SARI Watch, a total of 142 critical care (ICU or HDU) confirmed influenza admissions were reported from 115 NHS acute trusts across England from week 40 2021 to week 14 2022. This compares to a season total of 9 cases in 2020 to 2021, 1,671 cases in 2019 to 2020, 3,017 cases in 2018 to 2019 and 3,245 cases in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 17). ICU or HDU admission rates for confirmed influenza remained below the baseline threshold level (0.11 per 100,000 trust catchment population) for the duration of the influenza season up to week 14 of 2022, peaking in week 13 at 0.05 admissions per 100,000 (Figure 17). While rates were higher this season than during the 2020 to 2021 season, rates have remained considerably lower than those observed in seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 142 influenza ICU or HDU admissions reported up to week 14 2022, 11 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 14 were influenza A(H3N2), 101 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 16 were influenza B (Figure 18). Weekly confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admission rates in England since winter 2011 are shown in figure 19). Figure 17.

Cumulative number of influenza ICU or HDU admissions by influenza type, SARI Watch, England, week 40 2021 to week 14 2022 Figure 19. Weekly all-age rate and number of confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admissions, 2011 to 2022, England Scotland There were 14 confirmed influenza admissions to ICU or HDU in Scotland between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022. Among these there were 6 influenza A(H3N2), 7 influenza A(not subtyped) and 1 influenza B (Figure 20). Patients admitted to ICU or HDU with recently confirmed influenza are identified from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group that collects detailed patient level data on all patients in ICU or HDU across Scotland. Additional information on patients with laboratory confirmed influenza is collected through ICU enhanced surveillance forms. All patients that are admitted to ICU or HDU with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before the ICU or HDU admission and the ICU or HDU discharge date are included. Where the discharge date is missing, any patient with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before ICU or HDU admission and 7 days after ICU or HDU admission are included. Figure 20. Weekly number of laboratory confirmed influenza ICU or HDU cases with crude rate of admissions, Scotland Wales Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022 there were 4 influenza admissions to ICU or HDU in Wales, with 1 case in weeks 44, 10, 12 and 13. Of these, 3 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 1 was an influenza A(H3N2). Northern Ireland Between week 40 2021 and week 48 2021 there were no new admissions to ICU or HDU in Northern Ireland with confirmed influenza. Critical care data for week 49 2021 to week 14 2022 is not available. ECMO admissions The UKHSA collects data on every patient admitted to a severe respiratory failure (SRF) centre, for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or other advanced respiratory support, whether or not the primary cause is known to be infection-related. There are 6 SRF centres in the UK (5 in England and 1 in Scotland) participating in the UKHSA ECMO surveillance module. Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022 there were no laboratory confirmed influenza admissions to SRF centres in the UK. Influenza admissions to ECMO were last detected in the 2019 to 2020 season. Microbiological surveillance Influenza The Respiratory Datamart system began during the 2009 influenza pandemic to collate all laboratory testing information in England. It is now used as a sentinel laboratory surveillance tool, monitoring all major respiratory viruses in England. Seventeen laboratories in England reported data for this season. Overall influenza positivity remained low between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022, with positivity higher than in the 2020 to 2021 season but lower than that observed in pre-pandemic seasons. The majority of detections were influenza A, with some detections of influenza B observed. Of the detected influenza A viruses that were subtyped, the majority were influenza A(H3N2). An increase in influenza positivity was observed from week 47 of 2021, rising to 1.1% in week 50 of 2022 before declining. This coincides with the introduction of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Overall influenza positivity began to increase again from week 6 of 2022 and at week 14 of 2022 was at 5.3%, representing a late-season increase in influenza activity. Comparatively, in 2020 to 2021 detections of influenza through Respiratory DataMart were extremely low, never reaching more than 0.2% of samples tested. This compares to peak positivity of 25.3% in 2019 to 2020 and 28.6% in 2018 to 2019 (Figure 21). Figure 21. Weekly influenza swab percentage positivity and number of influenza A and B detections through Respiratory Datamart sentinel laboratories in England, 2021 to 2022 The weekly count of confirmed cases by each major type or subtype of influenza through Respiratory DataMart from winter 2010 onwards is shown in figure 22. Figure 22. Weekly number of influenza detections by subtype through Respiratory Datamart in England, with overall percentage positivity, 2010 to 2022 In Scotland, overall influenza positivity is reported through non-sentinel sources via Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS). There have been low numbers of influenza diagnoses recorded to date this season with a total of 1,144 samples testing positive for influenza between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022. Overall influenza positivity peaked at 2.4% in week 9 of 2022, after which point some late-season activity continued to be observed (Figure 23). Figure 23. Weekly ECOSS influenza positivity (percentage and number positive) by influenza subtype from week 40 of 2021 to week 14 of 2022, Scotland Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) From week 40 2021 to week 14 2022, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detections reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system largely remained relatively low and below usual seasonally expected levels. Positivity was higher than that observed during the 2020 to 2021 season, however was generally lower than that of previous seasons. Importantly, out-of-season increases in RSV were observed during the summer of 2021 as COVID-19 control measures eased, with RSV swab positivity peaking in week 30 of 2021 at 15.7%. This is not directly comparable to peak positivity in previous seasons as this includes additional RSV testing carried out from May 2021 to week 39 of 2021 in Public Health England (now UKHSA) regional laboratories for any available respiratory swabs in children aged 0 to 5 years (including those done for COVID-19 screening as well as those taken in line with routine practice for clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory illness). From week 30 of 2021 to week 13 of 2022, a general declining trend was observed before a slight increase in week 14. Comparatively, RSV positivity through DataMart remained very low during winter 2020 to 2021, with positivity never exceeding 0.4%. This compares with positivity peaks of 13.4% in 2019 to 2020, 21.5% in 2018 to 2019 and 20.9% in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 24). Surveillance of RSV is ongoing with further data of current trends published in the weekly national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report. Figure 24. Weekly overall RSV swab percentage positivity and number of detections through Respiratory DataMart in England, 2021 to 2022 In Scotland, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the second most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogen with 1.02% positive samples (1,636 detections out of 159,718) detected through non-sentinel sources (ECOSS) for the 2021 to 2022 season (up to week 14 of 2022). In line with patterns observed in England, early RSV activity during the summer of 2021 was also observed in Scotland. England collates data on confirmed hospitalised RSV cases through the SARI Watch surveillance system. For RSV, this is a sentinel surveillance system. Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, a total of 1,922 confirmed RSV cases (1,717 hospitalised to lower level of care and 205 admitted to ICU or HDU) were reported from 38 participating sentinel trusts. The cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 14 was 11.96 per 100,000 trust catchment population in 2021 to 2022. This compares to 0.13 per 100,000 in 2020 to 2021, 37.04 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 34.07 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 31.83 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. It is again important to consider that RSV activity during the inter-seasonal period from week 20 to week 39 of 2021 was higher than previously observed, as RSV transmission rebounded as COVID-19 control measures eased, resulting in a prolonged season. Out-of-season increases in RSV hospitalisations were seen from week 20 of 2021, peaking during week 31 2021 at 2.46 admissions per 100,000 (lower level of care and ICU or HDU). From this point, the rate of hospitalisation with RSV began to decline until week 9 of 2022 where slight increases have since been noted. For comparison, peak weekly admission rates for RSV (lower level of care and ICU or HDU) were observed at 0.07 per 100,000 in 2020 to 2021, 5.28 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 4.67 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 4.06 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 25). Figure 25. Weekly hospitalised RSV case rate per 100,00 trust catchment population and number of admissions to sentinel Trusts, England, week 40, 2021 to week 14, 2022 Children under the age of 5 are most affected by RSV. Activity peaked prior to the season in week 31 2021 at 31.8 per 100,000 hospital admissions (lower level of care and ICU or HDU). During the 2021 to 2022 season, hospitalisation rates for RSV in this age group followed the same overall trend. Rates continued to decline steadily, remaining below 5 admissions per 100,000 from week 1 to week 14 of 2022. For comparison, the RSV hospitalisation rate in under 5 year olds peaked at 56.7 per 100,000 in week 51 of the 2019 to 2020 season and at 67.4 per 100,000 in week 48 of the 2018 to 2019 season, and 56.4 per 100,000 in week 46 of the 2017 to 2018 season. In the 2021 to 2022 season from week 40 to week 14 inclusive, there were 1,401 RSV hospitalisations (lower level of care or ICU or HDU admissions) to SARI-Watch sentinel Trusts in those aged under 5. Of these, 59.0% (826) were in children aged under 1 year, including 621 aged 6 months or younger. Figure 26. Rate of RSV hospitalisation in under 5 years per 100,000 trust catchment population by week of admission and season, sentinel data from acute NHS trusts, England Other seasonal respiratory viruses Of the other respiratory viruses monitored through the respiratory DataMart system, the highest levels of positivity were observed with rhinovirus throughout the season. Rhinovirus positivity was highest at the beginning of the season, although lower than at this point in the 2019 to 2020 and the 2020 to 2021 seasons. From late 2021 onwards, rhinovirus activity was similar to that seen in 2019 to 2020, and higher than the positivity levels observed in 2020 to 2021. Activity remained relatively stable at between 10% to 13% positivity through the majority of the season, with decreases seen from week 12 2022 (Figure 27). Consistent with previous seasons, low levels of adenovirus were observed throughout the season with no clear seasonality seen, although positivity was slightly elevated between weeks 4 and 14 of 2022. Parainfluenza positivity was higher than that observed in 2020 to 2021, however was lower than activity seen in 2019 to 2020 from week 40 2021 to week 7 2022. From week 8 2022 onwards, activity has been higher than that observed in previous seasons, although remains relatively low overall. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) activity in 2021 to 2022 was elevated at the start of the season compared to the previous 2 seasons, peaking in week 49 at 10.3% positivity. From this point, positivity decreased and from week 1 2022 remained below the levels observed during the same period in 2019 to 2020 and higher than or comparable to those of 2020 to 2021 (Figure 27). Figure 27. Weekly number of positive samples and proportion positive for other respiratory viruses, DataMart sentinel laboratories, England, 2019 to 2022 (a) Adenovirus (b) Parainfluenza (c) Rhinovirus (d) Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) In Scotland, the pattern of non-influenza respiratory pathogens detected through ECOSS for 2021 to 2022 season (up to week 14 of 2022), was not similar to that seen in the previous 2 seasons (2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021). Of 159,718 samples, rhinovirus was the most common non-influenza respiratory pathogen (5,134 detections, 3.3% positive samples) detected through non-sentinel sources (ECOSS). RSV was the second most common non-influenza pathogen followed by hMPV (1,431 detections, 0.9% positive samples), seasonal coronavirus (non-SARS-CoV-2) (1,399 detections, 0.9% positive samples), adenovirus (1,374 detections, 0.9% positive samples) and parainfluenza (1,043 detections, 0.7% positive samples). Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MPN) was the lowest detected non-viral pathogen (8 detections, 0.01% positivity). In Wales, between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022, 48,952 hospital and non-sentinel GP samples were routinely tested for influenza, RSV, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, enterovirus, hMPV and SARS-CoV-2. An additional 140,506 samples were tested only for influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV2 (using a rapid test system). The 2 most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogens were rhinovirus (5,884 out of 48,952 detections, 12.0% positive samples) and SARS-CoV-2 (19,090 out of 189,458 detections, 10.1% positive samples). Other detected causes of respiratory infection included adenovirus (3.4%), human metapneumovirus (3.4%), enterovirus (3.2%), parainfluenza (1.7%), RSV (1.3%) and mycoplasma (under 0.1%). Preceding, co- and secondary respiratory infections with SARS-CoV-2 Seasonal respiratory virus co-infections are defined as a patient with a sample testing positive for the viral organism and another sample testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within one day of each other. Preceding and secondary infection definitions for these organisms are defined as the pathogen occurring 2 to 28 days pre- or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Please note that undertesting of pathogens may result in an underestimate of preceding, co- and secondary infection cases. Furthermore, children receiving the LAIV in the preceding 14 days prior to swabbing may result in positive influenza detection in the absence of infection. Full pre-, co- and secondary infection definitions are available in Appendix 1 of the National flu and COVID-19 surveillance graphs packs. Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, 86 co-infections of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 and 35 co-infections of influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 were identified in England via the Respiratory DataMart and SGSS systems. A total of 56 preceding and 82 secondary influenza A infections were reported in comparison to 23 preceding and 18 secondary influenza B infections. These numbers remain low but are an increase on last season (Figure 28), where between week 40 2020 and week 14 2021, 10 influenza A co-infections and 14 influenza B co-infections were recorded. There were 7 secondary influenza A and 6 secondary influenza B infections recorded and less than 5 preceding infections identified for each organism. Please note an extensive data validation exercise has identified additional respiratory viral specimens from Respiratory Datamart for the 2020 to 2021 season. . Between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, the most frequent viral organisms (preceding, co- or secondary infections) identified from respiratory specimens amongst persons with COVID-19 were RSV, rhinovirus and influenza A (Figure 28). RSV was the most commonly detected pre-, co- and secondary infection accounting for 25.5% of all pre-, co- and secondary infections, followed by rhinovirus which accounted for 21.8%. A total of 2,033 pre-, co- and secondary infections were detected across all seasonal respiratory viruses in the 2021 to 2022 season. Figure 28. Weekly number of respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with COVID-19 diagnosed in England, 2020 to 2022 Figure 29. Most frequent respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with COVID-19 diagnosed in England between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022 Sentinel GP-based swabbing In England, influenza activity through the GP sentinel swabbing scheme in collaboration with the RCGP was low overall in comparison to seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total of 37 positive samples between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022. Activity began to increase in week 10 of 2022. Influenza A(H3N2) accounted for the majority of positive influenza specimens (Figure 30). Figure 30. Number of influenza positive samples and weekly positivity (%) by influenza type In Northern Ireland, 2 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2021 to 2022 season through GP sentinel swabbing, in week 9 and week 12 respectively. Both were influenza A(H3N2). In Scotland, between week 40 of 2021 and week 14 of 2022 there were 72 detections of influenza through GP sentinel swabbing, 54 of which were Influenza A(H3N2). Positivity was calculated from week 44 of 2021 onwards and peaked in week 10 of 2022 at 24.6%. In Wales, 5 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2021 to 2022 season through GP sentinel swabbing. Of these, 1 was influenza B in week 48 of 2021, and 4 were influenza A(H3N2) between weeks 10 to 14 of 2022. Virus characterisation UKHSA characterises the properties of influenza viruses through one or more tests, including genome sequencing (genetic analysis) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (antigenic analysis). This data is used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the strains included in seasonal influenza vaccines, and to monitor for changes in circulating influenza viruses. The interpretation of genetic and antigenic data sources is complex due to a number of factors, for example, not all viruses can be cultivated in sufficient quantity for antigenic characterisation, so that viruses with sequence information may not be able to be antigenically characterised as well. Occasionally, this can lead to a biased view of the properties of circulating viruses, as the viruses which can be recovered and analysed antigenically, may not be fully representative of majority variants, and genetic characterisation data does not always predict the antigenic characterisation. The UKHSA Respiratory Virus Unit has genetically characterised 362 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, collected since week 40 of 2021. Of the characterised influenza A(H3N2) viruses where the age of the individual sampled is known, 54% are from individuals in age groups that would not normally be eligible for influenza vaccination. Sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene shows that these A(H3N2) viruses belong in genetic subclade 3C.2a1b, 352 within a cluster designated 3C.2a1b.2a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2021 to 22 influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain (an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020-like virus) also belongs in genetic subclade 3C.2a1b, within the 2a.1 genetic group. Ten A(H3N2) viruses collected between week 50 of 2021 and week 4 of 2022 fall within a cluster designated 3C.2a1b.1a. Viruses within this genetic cluster have been detected in recent months in west and South Africa. Eleven influenza B viruses, collected since the start of the season in week 40 of 2021 have been genetically characterised and belong in genetic clade 1A.3 of the B/Victoria lineage, characterised by deletion of three amino acids in the haemagglutinin (HA), in a subgroup designated 1A.3a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2021 to 22 B/Victoria-lineage quadrivalent and trivalent vaccine component virus (a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus) belongs in genetic clade 1A.3. Twenty-three influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been characterised to date this season, belonging in genetic subgroup 6B.1A.5a. Four fall within a cluster designated 6B.1A.5a.1, with 2 collected from returning travellers. Nineteen A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses also belong in genetic subgroup 6B.1A.5a, within a cluster designated 6B.1A.5a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2021 to 22 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain (an A/Victoria/2570/2019-like virus) also belongs in genetic subclade 6B.1A.5a, within the 6B.1A.5a.2 cluster. The detection of circulating A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses is in accordance with predominant detections internationally over the period of August and September 2021, and from week 40 to week 14. The Respiratory Virus Unit has confirmed by genome sequencing the detection of LAIV viruses in 39 influenza A and or influenza B positive samples collected since week 37 of 2021, from children aged 2 to ≤16 years of age. Virus characterisation in Scotland is performed by the West of Scotland laboratory throughout the influenza season. This data is published in the weekly report. Antiviral susceptibility Influenza positive samples are screened for mutations in the virus neuraminidase (NA) and the cap-dependent endonuclease (PA) genes known to confer neuraminidase inhibitor or baloxavir resistance, respectively. The samples tested are routinely obtained for surveillance purposes, but diagnostic testing of patients suspected to be infected with antiviral-resistant virus is also performed. Influenza virus sequences from samples collected between week 40 of 2021 and week 10 of 2022 have been analysed. No viruses with known markers of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors were detected in 309 A(H3N2), 17 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 11 B/Victoria-lineage neuraminidase gene sequences. No viruses with known markers of resistance to baloxavir marboxil were detected in 14 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 B/Victoria-lineage PA gene sequences (cap-dependent endonuclease). Of 277 A(H3N2) PA gene sequences, 275 had no markers of resistance to baloxavir, however 2 sequences were identified with an E199G amino acid substitution The E199G substitution has been reported previously as causing a minor reduction in baloxavir susceptibility (4.4-fold) in vitro, detected post treatment in a phase 2 paediatric study. For the 2 viruses identified with this substitution, the first was present as a mixed population (37% E199G) in a sample taken from a child in mid-January. The second virus had the E199G substation present at 100% and was detected in an adult. No clinical details are available yet. Table 2.

The UK uses the European monitoring of excess mortality (EuroMOMO) algorithm to estimate weekly all-cause excess mortality. This algorithm allows for direct comparison between excess mortality estimates in the countries of the UK. The number of deaths by date of death is corrected by reporting delay and excess determined by week of death, avoiding the effect of bank holidays. During 2021 to 2022, up to week 14, 2022 excess mortality was seen in England in all ages between from week 40 to week 2, and again in weeks 13 and 14 (Table 3). The excess mortality observed up to week 2 is significantly lower than the levels observed in 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 which were largely attributed to deaths related to COVID-19 (Figure 31). Across the devolved administrations of the UK, modelled estimates using the EuroMOMO model showed excess mortality in all ages for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (Table 3). Further information can be found on the EuroMOMO website. Table 3. Weeks with excess mortality observed in 2021 to 2022 (up to week 14) in the UK Country Weeks with excess in 2021 to 2022 England 40 to 2, 13 to 14 Wales 40, 42 to 43, 45, 51 Northern Ireland 43 to 44, 46 to 50, 52, 13 to 14 Scotland 40 to 41, 45, 47 to 49, 52, 2 Figure 31. Weekly observed and expected number of all-age all-cause deaths, with the dominant circulating strain type(s), England, 2015 to 2022 Vaccination Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in adults Although all countries of the UK use standardised specifications to extract vaccine uptake data from IT information systems in primary care (GP system suppliers), there are some differences in extraction specifications, so comparisons should be made with caution. England In England, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by UKHSA throughout the season based on weekly and monthly extracts from GP system suppliers via ImmForm for the cohorts primarily delivered via the GP practice. Cumulative uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 28 February 2022 was reported from 97.1% (6,355 out of 6,542) of GP practices in England in 2021 to 2022. Comparative data are up to 28 February 2021 where vaccine uptake was reported from 97.6% (6,438 out of 6,596) of GP practices in England in 2020 to 2021. This season saw a vaccine uptake of 82.3% in those 65 and over (compared to 80.9% in 2020 to 2021) and 52.9% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with one or more underlying clinical risk factors (excluding pregnant women without other risk factors and carers), compared to 53.0% in 2020 to 2021 (Table 4). Vaccine uptake in pregnant women was 37.9%, compared to 43.6% in 2020 to 2021. In the 2020 to 2021 season, the programme was extended for a second season to include all 50 to under 65 year olds not at-risk. Vaccine uptake in this group was 45.7%, but data between seasons for this age group is not directly comparable to the 2020 to 2021 season due to the current season eligibility starting 3 months earlier than last season. Scotland In Scotland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of (i) aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk, 2 to 5 years not at school, primary and secondary school pupils and pregnant women, and (ii) weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS) which contains individual-level data for adults eligible for flu vaccine, and for one NHS board, the data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes. At this time, the vaccine uptake data reported is not comparable to previous years which reflects the improvements in data recording but also changes in how uptake has been determined in some cohorts. It is estimated that at least 2,706,968 individuals received influenza vaccine, as reported to PHS. Cumulative uptake to week 15, 2022 for the 2021 to 2022 season indicates that for those aged 65 years and over the uptake is 90.2%. This compares to 79.6% in the previous season. Uptake amongst those aged 18 to 64 years in one or more clinical at-risk groups was 62.4%. Overall uptake in pregnant women (including those with and without other risk factors) up to week 15, 2022 was 55.2%, compared to 53.3% and 44% in the previous 2 seasons (2020 to 2021 and 2019 to 2020). There is some indication that co-administration of the flu and COVID-19 vaccines may have contributed to improved uptake during the past season. Data is presented in Scotland’s weekly national respiratory report. Wales In Wales, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored on a weekly basis by Public Health Wales throughout the season, based on automated weekly extracts of Read coded data using software installed in all general practices in Wales, collected through the Audit+ Data Quality System. Cumulative uptake data on influenza vaccinations administered were received from 100% of GP practices in Wales in 2021 to 2022. This showed a vaccine uptake of 78.0% in 65 year olds and over (compared to 76.5% in 2020 to 2021) and 48.2% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with one or more underlying clinical risk factors, compared to 51.0% in 2020 to 2021. Uptake in all patients aged 50 to 64 years old was 42.4% (288,862 vaccinated out of 680,934). Overall uptake in pregnant women was 78.5% compared to 81.5% in 2020 to 2021. In Wales, vaccine coverage in pregnant women is measured differently using a survey of pregnant women giving birth each year during January. In addition, as elsewhere in the UK, data are also automatically collected from general practices for women with pregnancy related Read codes, these data report uptakes of 51.3% in pregnant women at risk and 38.0% in healthy pregnant women. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by the Public Health Agency (PHA) of Northern Ireland. This season influenza vaccine uptake was determined using data extracted from the regional Immunisation Information System developed by the Department of Health Digital team, known as the Vaccine Management System (VMS). Influenza vaccination was introduced into the VMS in August 2021. Caution should be used when considering the 2021 to 2022 influenza vaccination uptake rates in comparison to previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. In the population aged 65 years and over, uptake was 54.5% (compared to 79.1% in 2020 to 2021). Uptake was 37.5% in the population of 50 to 64 year olds. 2020 to 2021 was the first year of roll out in this age group, when 21,931 vaccinations were undertaken (denominator not available). In the population of under 50 years at risk the uptake was 51.7%, (82,029 vaccinations out of 158,631) (no previous comparable reporting group). Note that the VMS does not currently collect data on the specific clinical risk conditions for influenza vaccination, therefore the number vaccinated aged under 50 years was used as proxy for those aged under 50 years ‘at risk’. Uptake in pregnant women was 45.9% compared to 50.0% in 2020 to 2021. Healthcare workers In England, vaccine uptake among frontline healthcare workers was 61.4%. In Trusts, vaccine uptake was 60.5% (from 78.5% of Trusts responding), a decrease from 76.5% vaccine uptake in 2020 to 2021. In GP practice (including ISHCPs), vaccine uptake was 74.1% (from 22.7% of GP practices and ISHCPs responding), a decrease from 81.6% vaccine uptake in 2020 to 2021. In Scotland, uptake among health care staff was 67.3% and among social care staff was 49.3% during the 2021 to 22 season. The combined vaccine uptake in health and social care workers was 58.8%. In Wales, uptake reached 57.2% compared to 65.6% in 2020 to 2021. In Northern Ireland, uptake in all healthcare workers including social care workers (working within the 5 health and social care Trusts and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service) was 41.8%. This is not directly comparable to previous seasons during which uptake in frontline health and social care workers was reported (49.8% in 2020 to 2021). It was not possible to disaggregate data to exclude social care workers. Table 4.

Cumulative vaccine uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 28 February 2022 was reported from 97.1% (6,347 out of 6,538) of GP practices in England in 2021 to 2022. Comparative data are up to 28 February 2021 where vaccine uptake was reported from 97.2% (6,406 out of 6,592) of GP practices in England in 2020 to 2021. This season saw a vaccine uptake for all GP-registered 2 year olds of 48.7% (compared to 55.3% in 2020 to 2021) and was 51.4% in 3 year-olds (compared to 58% in 2020 to 2021) in England. The combined uptake for 2 and 3 year olds was 50.1% compared to 56.7% in 2020 to 2021. In the 2021 to 2022 season, the influenza vaccine programme for school aged children was extended to include all children in secondary school (all children from reception to year 11, aged 4 to 16 years old). The programme was mainly delivered via a school-based route, with one area (Isle of Scilly) delivering vaccinations through general practice. Vaccine uptake was monitored through manual returns by local teams for their responsible population. An estimated 4,129,981 children in school years reception to year 11 (age 4 to 16 years old) in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period 1 September 2021 to 31 January 2022. With an estimated total target population of 7,986,411, the overall uptake was 51.7%. Vaccine uptake in all primary school age children (age 4 to 11 years old) was 57.4% compared to 61.9% in 2020 to 2021 (Table 5). Vaccine uptake in all secondary school age children (age 11 to 16 years old) was 43.6% (Table 5). Vaccine uptake in children of school age reception to year 11 decreases with increasing age, this trend has been seen in the 4 previous years where comparable data is available (Table 5 and Figure 32).

Percentage influenza vaccine uptake for children in school years reception to year 6 (age 4 to 10 rising to 11 years old) (primary school age), collected between 1 September 2021 to 31 January 2022 Overall vaccine uptake for all children of school age reception to year 11 (age 4 to 16 years old) by local authority (LA) (not shown here) ranged from 27.0% (15,291 out of 56,702) in Leicester to 72.3% (47,992 out of 66,346) in North Yorkshire. Uptake by year group and LA ranged from: 28.1% to 75.2% in reception 32.2% to 83.7% in year 1 32.8% to 85.5% in year 2 32.4% to 77.8% in year 3 32.1% to 79.8% in year 4 31.1% to 76.9% in year 5 30.3% to 77.3% in year 6 20.4% to 74.7% in year 7 19.8% to 70.5% in year 8 18.7% to 67.3% in year 9 17.6% to 67.3% in year 10 13.6% to 70.6% in year 11 Further detail on final influenza vaccine uptake data in all cohorts in England is now publicly available. Scotland As previously described, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in children is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of: (i) aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk, 2 to 5 years not at school, primary and secondary school pupils and (ii) weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS) which contains individual-level data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes for one NHS board. The estimated uptake in pre-school children (2 to under 5 year olds, not yet in school) was 57.2%. This compares with 63.0% and 52.5% in 2020 to 2021 and 2019 to 2020, respectively. The influenza vaccination programme in primary school-aged children in Scotland continues with an estimated uptake of 74.6% in 2021 to 2022. The offer of influenza vaccine was extended to young people in secondary schools for the first time in 2021 to 2022, there was an estimated uptake of 62.1%. Wales In Wales, immunisations for 2 and 3 year olds were delivered through general practices, apart from one health board where the majority of 3 year olds were immunised through nursery school immunisations sessions (uptake in these nursery school sessions was 61.9%). National uptake of influenza vaccine in 2 and 3 year olds decreased in 2021 to 2022. Uptake of influenza vaccine for children aged 2 years was 48.2% (compared to 54.7% in 2020 to 2021), for 3 year olds it was 47.0% (compared to 57.8% in 2020 to 2021). For the whole group of children aged 2 and 3 years, uptake was 47.6% (compared to 56.3% in 2020 to 2021). The childhood influenza programme in Wales includes all primary and secondary school children up to school leaving age. Uptake in primary school children decreased. Children aged 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years received their vaccinations in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 67.5%, 69.5%, 69.7%, 69.1%, 69.2%, 68.2% and 67.8% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 68.7% (compared to 72.4% in 2020 to 2021). In secondary school, children aged 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years, received their vaccination in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 64.7%, 60.2%, 58.0%, 54.9% and 52.9% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 58.2%. Northern Ireland In 2021 to 2022 the childhood influenza vaccination programme continued to include all pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old and all primary school aged children. The former group were offered vaccination through primary care, with the latter group offered vaccination through school health teams. The vaccination uptake rate in 2021 to 2022 for pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old was 24.4% (compared to 55.2% in 2020 to 2021). The vaccination uptake rate for children in primary school (aged approximately 4 to 11 years old) was 72.7% (compared to 73.1% in 2020 to 2021). In 2021 to 2022, Northern Ireland expanded the vaccination programme from all year 8 children (introduced in 2020 to 2021) to include secondary school children (years 8 to 12) with an uptake rate of 64.2%. These year groups were vacinated through school clinics. Caution should be used when considering the 2021 to 2022 influenza vaccination uptake rates in pre-school children in comparison to previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. Influenza vaccinations administered by Trust School Nursing teams are recorded in the Child Health System (CHS), similar to previous seasons. Vaccine effectiveness In the 2021 to 2022 season, as in previous seasons, influenza VE was measured using a test-negative design (TND) study. VE was measured for the first time against influenza in those requiring ED visits rather than patients in primary care. Infection and attendance data were collected through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance scheme and the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS). Vaccination status of study participants was obtained through data linkage with the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). In adults aged 50 years and over, the provisional overall adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness (aVE) in 2021 to 2022 was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5% to 43%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. Protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was good with an aVE of 76% (95% CI: 30% to 92%), but lower against influenza A(H3N2) (aVE 28%, 95% CI -3% to 50%) (Table 6). Estimates by vaccine type were broadly similar with overlapping confidence intervals. Moderate aVE was observed for the cell-based quadrivalent vaccine (QIVc) of 39% (95% CI 5% to 61%) which was offered to the 50 to 64 year old cohort. In children aged 1 to 17 years, the provisional overall aVE in 2021 to 2022 was 73% (95% CI 53% to 84%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. For LAIV specifically, the aVE was 72% (50% to 85%). Final end-of-season results with further breakdowns will be published in a peer-reviewed journal article later this year.

Emerging respiratory viruses MERS-CoV infections Since WHO first reported cases of MERS-CoV in September 2012, a total of 2,585 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported globally up to 10 April 2022. This includes 892 fatal cases (case fatality ratio of 35%). In the most recent reporting period between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, 7 cases have been reported globally by WHO. The majority of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. A feature of MERS-CoV is its ability to cause large outbreaks within healthcare settings. Local secondary transmission following importation has been reported from several countries including the UK, France, Tunisia, and the Republic of Korea. A total of 5 (1 in 2012, 3 in 2013 and 1 in 2018) confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported in the UK since 2012. This includes 2 secondary cases with non-sustained transmission in the UK linked to the second imported UK case in January 2013. In April and May 2014, 2 laboratory confirmed cases transited through London Heathrow Airport on separate flights to the USA. Contact tracing of flight contacts did not identify any further cases (3). UKHSA remains vigilant, closely monitoring developments in countries where new cases emerge and continues to work with international colleagues to assess whether recommendations need to change in relation to MERS-CoV. Further information from UKHSA on the investigation and management of possible cases is available online (4). Human influenza A(H7N9) infections Since the first human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported in China through WHO in April 2013, up to 4 May 2022 1,568 cases have been reported, including[at least 616 deaths giving an overall case fatality ratio of 39.3%. The last case of A(H7N9) was reported in 2019. The risk of influenza A(H7N9) infection to UK residents in the UK remains very low. Information from UKHSA including advice on clinical management is available on GOV.UK. Human influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H5N6) infections Since 2003 and up to 7 April 2022, 864 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported worldwide including 456 deaths, giving an overall case fatality rate of 52.8%. On 6 January 2022 UKHSA notified WHO of the detection of a laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5) from south west England, which later tested positive for influenza A(H5N1). The case was exposed to domestically kept birds with confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) and was the first reported case of human infection in the UK, with no evidence of secondary transmission identified. Since 2021 there has been an increase in detections of influenza A(H5N6) in humans, with up to 78 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection from 2014 to 10 April 2022, in China and Lao People’s Democratic Republic. In 2021, 32 cases were reported by WHO, 31 from China and 1 from Laos. So far in 2022 up to 10 April 2022, WHO have reported 19 cases from China. The increase in reports of human cases of infection may reflect the circulation of the virus in birds, as well as enhanced surveillance and diagnostic capacity since the COVID-19 pandemic. Human influenza A(H9N2) Since 2021 there has been an increase in detections of influenza A(H9N2) in humans, with up to 85 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection from 2015 to 24 March 2022. In 2021, 22 cases were reported by WHO, 21 from China and 1 from Cambodia. So far in 2022 up to 10 April 2022, WHO have reported 13 cases from China and 1 case from Cambodia. Avian Influenza A(H9N2) has been mainly reported from mainland China. Other cases have been reported in other countries including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Oman, Senegal and Egypt. The majority of human cases of Avian Influenza A(H9N2) have reported exposures to avian species such as backyard poultry or live poultry markets. Avian influenza summary Most human cases of avian influenza viruses are exposed through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets or domestically kept birds. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Even though small clusters of H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections have been reported, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to undergo sustained transmission amongst humans. It is important to ensure that imported cases of suspect avian influenza are detected promptly to ensure public health measures including infection control can be rapidly put in place to minimise any risk of onward transmission. There have been multiple detections of avian influenza in avian species in the UK in 2021 to 2022 as reported by DEFRA. Information on recent acute public health events or potential events of concern including avian influenza can be found on WHO Disease Outbreak News. Conclusions Influenza activity remained low through the majority of the 2021 to 2022 influenza season, with activity higher than that of 2020 to 2021 but lower than that of previous seasons. Slight increases in activity were observed through several indicators in late 2021, before declining likely as a result of government and personal non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant. From around week 8 of 2022, increases in influenza were noted in several indicators, representing late-season activity. Despite this increase, activity overall remained low. Influenza-like illness consultation rates remained far below the baseline and much lower than levels seen in seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic across the UK, with rates mostly lower than even those observed in the inter-seasonal periods in many previous years. Hospital admissions for confirmed influenza also remained below baseline levels for the majority of the season, reaching slightly above baseline in only week 12 and week 14. Admissions to ICU and HDU remained low and below baseline throughout the season. Detections of influenza through Respiratory DataMart were higher than in 2020 to 2021, however remained significantly lower than the levels observed in seasons prior. Again, although low overall, late-season activity was observed through this indicator. Other countries in the Northern Hemisphere also observed similar general trends, with late-season activity and overall activity being higher than levels observed in 2020 to 2021, but lower than pre-pandemic seasons, including across Europe, Canada and the US. A contributing factor to the particularly low influenza activity seen in 2020 to 2021 is the many non-pharmaceutical interventions put in place to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which has in turn led to lower influenza transmission. In 2021 to 2022, influenza activity was overall higher than the previous season but lower than that of pre-pandemic seasons. Social contact rates remained below those observed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (5). Influenza vaccine uptake in 2021 to 2022 varied across the UK. In England, vaccine uptake in those aged 65 years and over was the highest ever achieved, however was lower than last season in other cohorts. In Scotland, vaccine uptake was higher than the previous season in most reported target groups although some of the data is not comparable to previous seasons. In Northern Ireland, uptake should be interpreted with caution due to the introduction of the new VMS. Reported uptake was lower than during the 2020 to 2021 season in those aged over 65 and in pregnant women. In Wales, uptake was higher than last season in those aged 65 years and over. The rollout of the vaccination programme to those aged 50 to 64 years old continued in 2021 to 2022, after first being offered during the 2020 to 2021 season dependent on vaccine supply. The roll out and expansion of the childhood LAIV programme which was first implemented in the 2013 to 2014 season, continued across the UK. The programme targeted eligible pre-school cohorts and all children in primary school in the UK, and for the first time, all children in secondary school up to school leaving age. Vaccine uptake in children was generally slightly lower in the 2021 to 2022 season compared to the 2020 to 2021 season, across the UK. Surveillance continues in the UK for other respiratory viruses, as well as novel respiratory viruses including MERS-CoV and avian influenza viruses such as influenza A(H7N9), influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H5N6), with risk assessments being updated regularly.

Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of foodborne illness and H5N1 risks, per the CDC. Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesWhen H5N1 avian influenza started spreading among dairy cattle across the U.S. this year, regulators warned against consuming unpasteurized milk. What happened?

At the same time, the federal government is unprepared for a new pandemic: It doesn’t have enough vaccines, and there is no plan for getting them out quickly. The public health infrastructure has not come even close to recovering after COVID, and people are going to resist measures that might help control a new epidemic, such as school closures or even mask use. The population is largely resigned to infection and death.At such a vulnerable point in time, an old enemy, bird flu, moves into a new host: the milk cow. It’s an animal that people are in constant and intimate contact with, and whose flesh and milk are consumed daily.One possible scenario for spillover into the population: a raw-milk drinker or a farmworker gets infected with this strain of H5N1 that’s moving among cattle and also gets co-infected with a human-adapted strain of influenza. In such a situation viruses can swap genes in a process called reassortment. A major fear about H5N1 has always been that it might do this. H5N1 has shown it can easily move from one species to another, acquiring new genetic material in the process.Or someone catches H5N1 from a cow or its raw milk, and—perhaps through an immune deficiency—they develop a long-lasting infection that allows the virus to mutate in their body. “There absolutely is a risk here,” says Richard Webby, an expert in animal and human viruses who works at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.Here’s what it takes for a virus to start a human pandemic: it must acquire the ability to infect people easily; it must then pass easily from person to person; and it must cause significant illness.“The more it spreads within mammals, that gives it more chances to mutate. As it mutates, as it changes, there is a greater chance it can infect humans. If it gains the ability to spread efficiently from person to person, then it would be hard to stop,” says Nita Madhav, a former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researcher who is now senior director of epidemiology and modeling at Ginkgo Biosecurity.This can happen fast. “We’ve all seen how a virus can spread around the globe before public health has even had a chance to get its shoes on,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the CDC, said at a Council on Foreign Relations briefing in May. It only took three years for COVID to kill seven million people.So far, the H5N1 virus has infected three dairy farm workers, according to the CDC. Those are the known cases. The CDC has not even begun to jump through the hoops needed to force inspections and testing—and any such moves would almost certainly result in prolonged legal battles with both the dairy industry and some states.The symptoms were mild in two workers: an eye infection known as conjunctivitis. But the third worker had respiratory symptoms, the Michigan health department says – something that might lead to easier spread. The same strain of the virus has killed more than a few farm cats, and a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May shows the virus infected multiple organs in mice that drank H5N1-contaminated raw milk. Mild symptoms mean it could be spreading, unnoticed, among people.What’s called for now is stepped-up surveillance, ideally on dairy farms across the country, with regular testing of the milk supply and in clinics where dairy farms are concentrated. Ideally the CDC would test populations of raw milk enthusiasts. The CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are trying to get onto farms to test, but with only limited success. Dairy owners don’t want the stigma of having the virus found on their farms, and workers are worried they will be questioned about their immigration status or that they’ll be deported if they are found to be infected.Worse, if the federal government does decide to take a serious stand on the virus and announce measures to get out ahead of it, it will almost certainly become a divisive campaign issue in the current election. It is easy to imagine former president Donald Trump telling his supporters that the Biden administration is inventing an imaginary threat to scare them.Moreover, disinformation and misinformation have never been worse, thanks in no small part to social media. “Drink raw milk so that you don’t get bird flu,” urges one distributor on X, formerly Twitter. People have always had odd ideas about how to resist disease, from the notion that eating certain diets can boost immunity to the widely debunked Great Barrington Declaration that called for allowing COVID-19 to spread through most of the population to build up some kind of natural immunity, a recipe for overloaded ICUs and mass deaths.These are all natural reactions, says Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health: “When extraordinary things happen, a common psychological response is to deny it. ‘It can’t be happening.’”But after having seen this response in real time during COVID, the U.S. and many other governments have done too little to learn from their mistakes. “We have literally not made any serious effort to understand what worked and what didn’t,” Nuzzo says.The federal government and its agencies haven’t even gone back to pre-COVID studies about how to communicate with the public and how to coax the reluctant into cooperating with public health measures. It takes a gentle, almost personalized, approach—one that would work best on the basis of a long-term, familiar relationship. The best messengers are individuals or institutions that already have the trust of the targeted audience.“In an ideal world our response to [a pandemic threat] would be voluntary where everyone chooses to take actions to protect themselves, their community, their loved ones,” Nuzzo says. “We just can’t compel people to take action that is not in their best interests. You have to convince them that it is in their best interests and help people feel like they are part of the solution.”But in 2024 trust in institutions is elusive. The FDA urged consumers to avoid raw milk after H5N1 was found in one out of five samples of commercially available milk it tested. That’s when sales of raw milk took off.“People that follow us—if FDA says it’s bad, they'll run [toward] it,” Marc McAfee, a dairy farmer in California who founded the Raw Milk Institute, told NPR. That’s what raw milk promoters are doing now.There’s never a good time for a flu virus to find a new way to circulate, but with American stubbornness hitting a new peak, 2024 could not be a worse time.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsMaggie Fox is a journalist specializing in health, science and communicating in plain language.

Here’s the Latest on the Virus The strain is not the same one that has infected U.S. cows and three dairy farm workers, and officials say the risk to the general public remains low Will Sullivan Daily Correspondent June 7, 2024 Chickens on a poultry farm in Tepatitlan, Jalisco State, Mexico, on June 6, 2024. Outbreaks of H5N2 avian influenza have recently been reported in poultry in Mexico. Ulises Ruiz / AFP via Getty Images A 59-year-old man in Mexico who was infected with H5N2 avian influenza has died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It’s the first time any person has tested positive for H5N2 and the first time a person in Mexico has tested positive for an H5 bird flu virus. The patient had multiple underlying medical conditions and was bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before his acute symptoms began, per the WHO. Mexico’s health ministry says in a statement that the man died as a result of chronic conditions, not because of the virus. He had chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. None of the patient’s close contacts near his residence or at the hospital where he died have tested positive for the virus, per the WHO. The agency says the current risk to the general population posed by the virus is low. “The prompt follow-up in health care professionals and family members in contact with the infected patient provides reassurance at present this is an isolated case,” Ian Brown, the avian virology group lead at the Pirbright Institute in England, says to BBC News’ Michelle Roberts. The case was a different strain of avian influenza from the H5N1 strain that has spread in dairy cattle across the United States and recently caused infections in three people. “It is concerning that a new virus subtype has infected a human,” Troy Sutton, who studies avian influenza at Pennsylvania State University, tells NBC News’ Berkeley Lovelace Jr. The WHO does not know how the person in Mexico became infected with H5N2. Infections have been reported in poultry in Mexico, but the patient had not been exposed to poultry or other animals. “The fact there was no reported contact [with an infected bird] does raise the possibility that he was infected by someone else who visited him, but it’s premature to jump to those conclusions,” Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, says to Mike Stobbe of the Associated Press (AP). Ed Hutchinson, who studies influenza at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, tells BBC News that the person probably caught the virus from an infected animal. In the U.S., two dairy farm workers in Michigan and one in Texas have tested positive for H5N1 following direct contact with infected cows in recent months. The most recent person to test positive, in Michigan, experienced a cough and eye discomfort, and their symptoms are resolving, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The other two people only reported symptoms in their eyes. Meanwhile, infections have been detected in cows across 83 herds in nine states, including recent infections in Minnesota and Iowa identified for the first time. Most H5 viruses are classified as low pathogenic, meaning they cause either asymptomatic or mild infections in poultry, per the CDC. The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 in birds around the world has led to the deaths of tens of millions of birds over the last couple of years, either through fatal infections or preventative culling. “Sporadic” H5 infections have occurred in humans, according to the CDC. Since 1997, such infections in 23 countries have resulted in death in about half of cases. Avian influenza in poultry can infect humans through direct exposure to the animals or from contaminated areas. There has not been historical evidence of a sustained spread of H5 viruses between humans, the WHO says. The patient in Mexico developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general malaise on April 17, according to the WHO. He was hospitalized in Mexico City on April 24 and died later that day. Follow-up testing later found the person was infected with H5N2 at the time of his death. “The person may have already been quite sick,” Sutton tells NBC News. “That changes the calculation a little bit more than, say, a healthy farm worker getting infected.” Officials detected an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 in a backyard poultry farm in a state neighboring the patient’s state of residence in March, per the WHO. Other outbreaks of low pathogenic H5N2 were reported in Mexico in March and April. Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Previous work estimated that Homo neanderthalensis made these fires around 52,000 years ago — plus or minus a few thousand years. Researchers dramatically narrowed down this timeframe by analysing traces of Earth’s changing magnetic field preserved in the fire pits’ minerals. The oldest and youngest of the hearths were last lit at least 200 years apart, with decades-long intervals between the use of different hearths.Nature | 4 min readReference: Nature paperDad’s diet affects sons’ healthA father’s sperm records his diet, which affects his sons’ metabolism — in both mice and in humans. The male offspring of mice that ate high-fat foods were more likely to have problems such as glucose intolerance, a characteristic of diabetes. And the sons of human dads with a high body-mass index had similar problems, according to an analysis of more than 3,000 children. In mice, an unhealthy diet changed certain types of sperm RNA, which could alter the offspring’s epigenome — the collection of chemical tags hanging from DNA and its associated proteins. Why this seems to only affect sons is “a very good question for future studies”, says biologist Qi Chen.Nature | 5 min readReference: Nature paperSquishy surgery-free brain sensorsBiodegradable, wireless sensors can monitor changes in the brain following a head injury or cancer treatment without invasive surgery.

The virus can survive for hours in splattered milk. This reinforces that the milking process is probably driving transmission among cows and might be spreading the virus to humans. The fact that H5N1 doesn’t seem to spread through airborne particles is good news. It means changes to milking procedures — such as disinfecting equipment between cows and protective equipment to farm workers — could help to bring the outbreak under control.Nature | 5 min readReference: bioRxiv preprint & medRxiv preprint (not peer reviewed)Features & opinionThe chips powering the AI revolutionComputer chips are trying to keep pace with the ever-increasing computing demands of AI models.

By: Jennifer Shutt and Jared Strong - June 5, 2024 1:35 pm The USDA has performed more than 17,000 tests for avian influenza on cattle, with a total of 67 herds affected throughout nine states. (Photo via Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.) Dairy farmers throughout the country are on guard and the federal government is mobilizing after an outbreak among cattle herds of highly pathogenic avian influenza — once thought to be confined to poultry flocks. What’s more, the virus, also known as H5N1 or bird flu, was diagnosed in a third dairy farmworker last week, marking the first U.S. case with respiratory symptoms, said to be mild. The other two cases, also both mild, were diagnosed as pink eye. The notable leap from cows and chickens to humans is not yet ringing alarm bells for public health officials or veterinarians, who believe the risk to the public remains low. However, they are closely monitoring poultry and dairy farms for any changes, despite a reluctance among some dairy farmers to test their herds. “Avian influenza is something that public health scientists are worried about,” said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “It’s probably the potential infection or outbreak that causes the greatest amount of anxiety just because, if this did get into a place where it was easily transmissible among humans, everybody fears that could be a really, really bad scenario.” The ongoing response has brought together a veritable alphabet soup of government agencies and agricultural organizations, highlighting the complicated nature of fighting bird flu. The mobilization is intended to stem the significant economic toll that farmers could face and curb the virus’ spread. At the federal level, the Agriculture Department is responsible for the farm animals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for human health, the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over the eggs and milk sold in grocery stores, and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response oversees its piece of the pie. Then come the state agencies, interest groups, agribusiness and family farms. As of last week, more than 40 people had been tested for H5N1 with more than 350 people enrolled in monitoring, about 220 of whom are in Michigan. Two of the human cases have been in Michigan while the other was diagnosed in Texas. Michigan also has several dairy cattle herds diagnosed with H5N1. The USDA has performed more than 17,000 PCR tests on cattle, with a total of 67 herds affected throughout nine states, including Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. This strain of bird flu has also cropped up in a wide variety of mammals, including domestic cats. That’s led experts to recommend that people limit their pets’ interactions with wild birds, which hold a reservoir of the virus, as well as all farm animals. USDA begins expanded testing The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that it’s launching a voluntary pilot program to expand testing for dairy farms to gain better insight into the virus and make it easier for farmers to ship dairy cows across state lines. The department is also transferring $824 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for the ongoing response. “It’s important to note that as these additional testing measures take place, USDA anticipates that we may see an increase in the number of herds that are testing positive,” said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza and deputy assistant secretary for congressional relations. The pilot program will test milk samples from bulk tanks for H5N1. Farms that consistently test negative will “be able to ship their cows at the time they prefer and without testing individual animals, knowing that their entire herd is free of the disease,” Deeble said. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, on a press call with reporters Monday, declined to say whether USDA has a full grasp of the extent of the virus’ spread in dairy cattle, but he said, “We have a pretty good understanding of the nature of this virus and essentially what’s causing its spread.” “We’re trying to essentially corner this virus, so that over time it dissipates,” Vilsack said. Dairy farmers can begin enrolling in the pilot program this week in participating states. Dairy farms reluctant to test Infected cows have tremendous amounts of the virus in their milk, so those that are lactating must test negative for the virus before they can be transported across state lines, the USDA has ordered. In states such as Iowa, which has no detections of the virus in cattle, dairy farmers have been reluctant to test more than is required. “There has not been a lot of testing to date,” said Rodger Main, director of the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which first discovered bird flu was infecting cattle. “What’s being tested is the dairy cattle that are moving interstate.” Scientists are sequencing the genetic code of an avian flu that was found in a flock of 4.2 million egg-laying hens last week in northwest Iowa to determine if it is the same variant that has been infecting cattle, said Don McDowell, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. If so, it might indicate that there are infected cattle in Iowa. A similar detection happened more than a month ago at a turkey flock in Minnesota, another state with no known dairy cattle infections. However, no coordinated testing was done of dairy farms near the infected turkey flock to determine whether they had infected cattle and might have been the source of the transmission, said Michael Crusan, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. “The Board of Animal Health didn’t collect any samples from dairy farms surrounding HPAI positive poultry premises,” Crusan said. “We do not have authority to test those dairy farms without suspected or confirmed illness reported to us.” There is reluctance among some dairy farmers to voluntarily test their cattle for fear of what might happen if those tests reveal their herds are infected, said Dr. Barb Petersen, a Texas veterinarian who helped discover that bird flu was infecting cattle. They might be afraid that they’ll be barred from selling their cattle for an unknown amount of time or that animal movements to and from their farms will be otherwise restricted. Petersen suspects that nearly all the dairies in her area near Amarillo were infected but that many were not tested. Infected cows typically recover in 10 to 14 days. Infected herds suffer a drop in milk production that can last about a month. The virus is much more severe for chicken and turkey flocks, where it often causes fatal illness. Entire flocks are destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. More testing and better biosecurity measures are important to help prevent the virus from spreading from infected cattle to the poultry flocks, said Phillip Jardon, the dairy extension veterinarian for Iowa State University. He is aware of several dairy farms that installed noise-making systems to keep away wild birds, which are believed to be an initial source of the infections. It’s unclear how many other state-recommended precautions are being adopted. “The risk to dairies is not as large as it is to poultry, but dairies should keep in mind that they have neighbors who are poultry producers where it can be devastating, and they don’t want to have a local source of the virus,” he said. Vilsack said USDA needs to better educate dairy farmers about the risks to their neighboring farmers to get more voluntary help in tracking and containing the virus. It spread from Texas to faraway states through the transportation of infected cattle, but it has likely spread locally via farmworkers, veterinarians and equipment moving farm to farm, Vilsack said. PPE for farmworkers Plescia from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials said during an interview with States Newsroom that while the risk to the public remains low, health officials are paying close attention to agricultural workers. Ensuring farmworkers have access to personal protective equipment is essential, though it could be challenging to get all workers to use it during the hotter summer months, Plescia said. The most recent case in a farmworker in Michigan, announced May 30, is more concerning to experts. “We’re much, much more worried about respiratory infections because it’s respiratory infections, where in the past with earlier versions of H5N1, we’ve seen that those infections can be very, very severe and the mortality can be very high,” Plescia said. Public health officials need to work with farm owners and farmworkers to make sure that even people with mild symptoms get tested for avian flu to ensure that it isn’t circulating more widely than the documented cases, he said. They need to ensure that undocumented workers or those on agricultural work visas who are concerned about interaction with the government are comfortable enough to get tested. “When the state government starts showing up to do testing as far as they’re concerned, people are fearful of that and so they’ll stop coming to work,” Plescia said. Plescia also cautioned that people shouldn’t drink raw milk for the foreseeable future. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview with States Newsroom the agency is focusing its attention on farmworker safety through personal protective equipment, testing and additional resources. The CDC is also working to build trust so that workers who might be in the U.S. on visas or who are undocumented feel comfortable getting tested for H5N1 or reporting an illness to public health officials. “When H5 became a phenomenon in poultry farms, it took some time for poultry farm owners and poultry farmworkers to gain trust with the public health system,” Shah said. “The same thing, the same dynamic, is at play here.” Shah, speaking during a separate press briefing on H5N1, said that even with the new respiratory case, there have been no signs, either genetically or epidemiologically, that this strain of avian influenza is adapting in a way that would lead to greater transmission. “We are on the lookout for those changes, but the mere fact that this individual displayed some respiratory symptoms — again, we should be alert — but, in and of itself, is not a cause to change or suggest that we’re at an inflection point,” Shah said. “It is a cause and a reason to remain alert.” Amira Roess, professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, said in a written statement that public health officials must “provide incentives for individuals to report illness and to get tested, or at least we have to remove barriers.” “Because we don’t have meaningful, high quality and accessible health care for the majority of our population, particularly those in rural areas where the virus has first spilled over, it will be challenging to get ahead of this,” Roess wrote in response to questions from States Newsroom about H5N1. “Many farmworkers are hourly workers and cannot afford to take time off for what they perceive as mild illness.” Keep pets away from wild birds Meghan Davis, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in an interview with States Newsroom this particular strain of avian flu has been spreading between mammals, including domestic pets, and will likely continue to do so. “The fact that this particular clade has been able to infect so many different mammalian species, and has now caused at least two documented cases in people — although, thankfully, with relatively mild symptoms — is a concern,” she said, before the third case was announced. Davis cautioned that because there have been cases among cats living on dairy farms that drank raw cow’s milk, people shouldn’t give raw milk to their pets. Pet owners should also be cautious about letting their animals interact with wild birds, which are known to spread the virus. Milk purchased in grocery stores is safe to drink since it’s been pasteurized and has been repeatedly tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during the past few months to ensure there’s no active virus in the country’s food supply. Other mammals diagnosed with avian flu this year include a mountain lion in Montana, red foxes in Michigan and Missouri, and a raccoon in Colorado. Domestic cats have been diagnosed in Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas, according to data from the CDC. Davis said the surveillance system for H5N1 should be broadened to include “more systematic testing, which would require us to have somewhat better access to workers, to animals on farms, etc.” as well as antibody testing to determine if more people have contracted avian flu and recovered. The additional information could help if the virus were to shift in the coming months or years. “We don’t know exactly what this virus is going to do,” Davis said, noting the mild nature of the virus detected so far could mean that more people have contracted it and simply didn’t realize it. Davis explained that public health officials and researchers need to closely monitor viruses like H5N1 since they can change in a way similar to how the flu changes, leading to the need for a different flu shot each year. Roess, the epidemiology professor from George Mason University, noted that an uptick in human cases of avian influenza, could “be an indication of other types of transmission than what is currently believed.” “Right now, the cases reported are a result of direct contact with infected food animals,” Roess said. “It is critical to ramp up surveillance of people working closely with possibly infected animals, other animals in the vicinity and other people who are not directly in contact with possibly infected animals in the community.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

SUPPORT XBird flu’s spread from poultry to cattle to humans provokes worry among feds, states by Jennifer Shutt and Jared Strong, Oklahoma Voice June 5, 2024 Bird flu’s spread from poultry to cattle to humans provokes worry among feds, states by Jennifer Shutt and Jared Strong, Oklahoma Voice June 5, 2024 Dairy farmers throughout the country are on guard and the federal government is mobilizing after an outbreak among cattle herds of highly pathogenic avian influenza — once thought to be confined to poultry flocks. What’s more, the virus, also known as H5N1 or bird flu, was diagnosed in a third dairy farmworker last week, marking the first U.S. case with respiratory symptoms, said to be mild. The other two cases, also both mild, were diagnosed as pink eye. The notable leap from cows and chickens to humans is not yet ringing alarm bells for public health officials or veterinarians, who believe the risk to the public remains low. However, they are closely monitoring poultry and dairy farms for any changes, despite a reluctance among some dairy farmers to test their herds. “Avian influenza is something that public health scientists are worried about,” said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “It’s probably the potential infection or outbreak that causes the greatest amount of anxiety just because, if this did get into a place where it was easily transmissible among humans, everybody fears that could be a really, really bad scenario.” The ongoing response has brought together a veritable alphabet soup of government agencies and agricultural organizations, highlighting the complicated nature of fighting bird flu. The mobilization is intended to stem the significant economic toll that farmers could face and curb the virus’ spread. At the federal level, the Agriculture Department is responsible for the farm animals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for human health, the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over the eggs and milk sold in grocery stores, and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response oversees its piece of the pie. Then come the state agencies, interest groups, agribusiness and family farms. As of last week, more than 40 people had been tested for H5N1 with more than 350 people enrolled in monitoring, about 220 of whom are in Michigan. Two of the human cases have been in Michigan while the other was diagnosed in Texas. Michigan also has several dairy cattle herds diagnosed with H5N1. The USDA has performed more than 17,000 PCR tests on cattle, with a total of 67 herds affected throughout nine states, including Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas. This strain of bird flu has also cropped up in a wide variety of mammals, including domestic cats. That’s led experts to recommend that people limit their pets’ interactions with wild birds, which hold a reservoir of the virus, as well as all farm animals. USDA begins expanded testing The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that it’s launching a voluntary pilot program to expand testing for dairy farms to gain better insight into the virus and make it easier for farmers to ship dairy cows across state lines. The department is also transferring $824 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for the ongoing response. “It’s important to note that as these additional testing measures take place, USDA anticipates that we may see an increase in the number of herds that are testing positive,” said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza and deputy assistant secretary for congressional relations. The pilot program will test milk samples from bulk tanks for H5N1. Farms that consistently test negative will “be able to ship their cows at the time they prefer and without testing individual animals, knowing that their entire herd is free of the disease,” Deeble said. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, on a press call with reporters Monday, declined to say whether USDA has a full grasp of the extent of the virus’ spread in dairy cattle, but he said, “We have a pretty good understanding of the nature of this virus and essentially what’s causing its spread.” “We’re trying to essentially corner this virus, so that over time it dissipates,” Vilsack said. Dairy farmers can begin enrolling in the pilot program this week in participating states. Dairy farms reluctant to test Infected cows have tremendous amounts of the virus in their milk, so those that are lactating must test negative for the virus before they can be transported across state lines, the USDA has ordered. In states such as Iowa, which has no detections of the virus in cattle, dairy farmers have been reluctant to test more than is required. “There has not been a lot of testing to date,” said Rodger Main, director of the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which first discovered bird flu was infecting cattle. “What’s being tested is the dairy cattle that are moving interstate.” Scientists are sequencing the genetic code of an avian flu that was found in a flock of 4.2 million egg-laying hens last week in northwest Iowa to determine if it is the same variant that has been infecting cattle, said Don McDowell, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. If so, it might indicate that there are infected cattle in Iowa. A similar detection happened more than a month ago at a turkey flock in Minnesota, another state with no known dairy cattle infections. However, no coordinated testing was done of dairy farms near the infected turkey flock to determine whether they had infected cattle and might have been the source of the transmission, said Michael Crusan, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. “The Board of Animal Health didn’t collect any samples from dairy farms surrounding HPAI positive poultry premises,” Crusan said. “We do not have authority to test those dairy farms without suspected or confirmed illness reported to us.” There is reluctance among some dairy farmers to voluntarily test their cattle for fear of what might happen if those tests reveal their herds are infected, said Dr. Barb Petersen, a Texas veterinarian who helped discover that bird flu was infecting cattle. They might be afraid that they’ll be barred from selling their cattle for an unknown amount of time or that animal movements to and from their farms will be otherwise restricted. Petersen suspects that nearly all the dairies in her area near Amarillo were infected but that many were not tested. Infected cows typically recover in 10 to 14 days. Infected herds suffer a drop in milk production that can last about a month. The virus is much more severe for chicken and turkey flocks, where it often causes fatal illness. Entire flocks are destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. More testing and better biosecurity measures are important to help prevent the virus from spreading from infected cattle to the poultry flocks, said Phillip Jardon, the dairy extension veterinarian for Iowa State University. He is aware of several dairy farms that installed noise-making systems to keep away wild birds, which are believed to be an initial source of the infections. It’s unclear how many other state-recommended precautions are being adopted. “The risk to dairies is not as large as it is to poultry, but dairies should keep in mind that they have neighbors who are poultry producers where it can be devastating, and they don’t want to have a local source of the virus,” he said. Vilsack said USDA needs to better educate dairy farmers about the risks to their neighboring farmers to get more voluntary help in tracking and containing the virus. It spread from Texas to faraway states through the transportation of infected cattle, but it has likely spread locally via farmworkers, veterinarians and equipment moving farm to farm, Vilsack said. PPE for farmworkers Plescia from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials said during an interview with States Newsroom that while the risk to the public remains low, health officials are paying close attention to agricultural workers. Ensuring farmworkers have access to personal protective equipment is essential, though it could be challenging to get all workers to use it during the hotter summer months, Plescia said. The most recent case in a farmworker in Michigan, announced May 30, is more concerning to experts. “We’re much, much more worried about respiratory infections because it’s respiratory infections, where in the past with earlier versions of H5N1, we’ve seen that those infections can be very, very severe and the mortality can be very high,” Plescia said. Public health officials need to work with farm owners and farmworkers to make sure that even people with mild symptoms get tested for avian flu to ensure that it isn’t circulating more widely than the documented cases, he said. They need to ensure that undocumented workers or those on agricultural work visas who are concerned about interaction with the government are comfortable enough to get tested. “When the state government starts showing up to do testing as far as they’re concerned, people are fearful of that and so they’ll stop coming to work,” Plescia said. Plescia also cautioned that people shouldn’t drink raw milk for the foreseeable future. Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview with States Newsroom the agency is focusing its attention on farmworker safety through personal protective equipment, testing and additional resources. The CDC is also working to build trust so that workers who might be in the U.S. on visas or who are undocumented feel comfortable getting tested for H5N1 or reporting an illness to public health officials. “When H5 became a phenomenon in poultry farms, it took some time for poultry farm owners and poultry farmworkers to gain trust with the public health system,” Shah said. “The same thing, the same dynamic, is at play here.” Shah, speaking during a separate press briefing on H5N1, said that even with the new respiratory case, there have been no signs, either genetically or epidemiologically, that this strain of avian influenza is adapting in a way that would lead to greater transmission. “We are on the lookout for those changes, but the mere fact that this individual displayed some respiratory symptoms — again, we should be alert — but, in and of itself, is not a cause to change or suggest that we’re at an inflection point,” Shah said. “It is a cause and a reason to remain alert.” Amira Roess, professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, said in a written statement that public health officials must “provide incentives for individuals to report illness and to get tested, or at least we have to remove barriers.” “Because we don’t have meaningful, high quality and accessible health care for the majority of our population, particularly those in rural areas where the virus has first spilled over, it will be challenging to get ahead of this,” Roess wrote in response to questions from States Newsroom about H5N1. “Many farmworkers are hourly workers and cannot afford to take time off for what they perceive as mild illness.” Keep pets away from wild birds Meghan Davis, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in an interview with States Newsroom this particular strain of avian flu has been spreading between mammals, including domestic pets, and will likely continue to do so. “The fact that this particular clade has been able to infect so many different mammalian species, and has now caused at least two documented cases in people — although, thankfully, with relatively mild symptoms — is a concern,” she said, before the third case was announced. Davis cautioned that because there have been cases among cats living on dairy farms that drank raw cow’s milk, people shouldn’t give raw milk to their pets. Pet owners should also be cautious about letting their animals interact with wild birds, which are known to spread the virus. Milk purchased in grocery stores is safe to drink since it’s been pasteurized and has been repeatedly tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration during the past few months to ensure there’s no active virus in the country’s food supply. Other mammals diagnosed with avian flu this year include a mountain lion in Montana, red foxes in Michigan and Missouri, and a raccoon in Colorado. Domestic cats have been diagnosed in Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas, according to data from the CDC. Davis said the surveillance system for H5N1 should be broadened to include “more systematic testing, which would require us to have somewhat better access to workers, to animals on farms, etc.” as well as antibody testing to determine if more people have contracted avian flu and recovered. The additional information could help if the virus were to shift in the coming months or years. “We don’t know exactly what this virus is going to do,” Davis said, noting the mild nature of the virus detected so far could mean that more people have contracted it and simply didn’t realize it.

Share WHO: First confirmed human bird flu case did not die from it share Print The World Health Organization said Friday the first confirmed human infection with H5N2 bird flu, a man who died in April, suffered from multiple ailments and his death was not directly attributable to bird flu. At a Geneva news conference Friday, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters an investigation is ongoing, including blood testing of the man’s contacts to determine if there was any possible earlier infection. But he confirmed, "The death is a multi-factorial death, not a death attributable to H5N2." The WHO announced Wednesday the 59-year-old Mexican man was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with H5N2 avian influenza virus. SEE ALSO: WHO: First fatal human case of H5N2 bird flu identified In a statement, the agency said Mexican health officials first reported the case to the WHO May 23 when it was detected in the man after he was hospitalized in Mexico City. He had multiple underlying medical conditions and his relatives reported that the man had already been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons, and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. On April 24, the man was once again hospitalized with multiple symptoms and died the same day due to complications of his condition. Tests confirmed the man had contracted H5N2 influenza, the WHO said in May, stating that the risk to people in Mexico is low, and that no further human cases have been discovered. Of the man’s 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where he died, none contracted the illness. Scientists said the case is unrelated to the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the United States that has infected three dairy farm workers.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as the bird flu, HPAI or H5N1, is a highly contagious virus that is transmitted from wild birds to domestic poultry and other animals.According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, a producer noticed signs of illness in only a few cows over the weekend. The next day, however, the producer reported that over 40 cows had contracted a fever. Samples were collected from sick cows and sent to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory where the test results came back positive. The following day, the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories also confirmed the test results. Neither the Board of Animal Health or the USDA has confirmed that the positive test results mean all 40 cows who showed signs of illness had contracted HPAI. "We knew it was only a matter of time before this detection would reach our doorstep," said State Veterinarian Dr. Brian Hoefs. "It's important for dairy farmers to follow the example of this herd and test sick cows. The more the animal health community can learn about this virus today through testing and research, the better we can equip ourselves to prevent infections tomorrow."According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume.MORE NEWS: Western Minnesota goat tests positive for bird flu; first case of its kind in US historyHowever, dairy farmers are being advised to take extra precautions with their herds in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Dairy farms are required to dispose of milk from sick animals and isolate the affected cows from the rest of the herd for 30 days. After 30 days from the last positive test has passed, the herd can be retested and released from quarantine. Also, farmers are being told to look out for other symptoms of illness — outside of a fever — which include a drop in milk production, loss of appetite and changes in manure consistency. The risk to the public from this virus remains low at this time, says the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health is working closely with the Minnesota Department of Health on response plan. The people who would be most affected by the virus are those who work with or have direct contact with infected animals. If you are a part of this population, the CDC recommends wearing personal protective equipment — or PPE — to protect themselves from infection. Symptoms of avian influenza in people may include cough, sore throat, fever, red/watery eyes or discharge from the eyes.

Shmerling, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing, and Francesca Coltrera, Editor, Harvard Health Blog Reviewed by John Ross, MD, FIDSA, Contributor; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing A bird flu strain that began circulating in 2020 continues to evolve globally and locally within the United States. If you're wondering what this means, understanding the basics — what bird flu is, how it spreads, whether foods are safe, and prevention tips — can help. More information will come in as scientists learn more, so stay tuned. 1. What is bird flu and how does it spread? Bird flu, or avian flu, is a naturally occurring illness. Just as certain flu viruses spread among humans, Type A influenza viruses often spread among wild birds. The strain of virus circulating now is H5N1, named for two proteins on its surface. Avian flu infections are highly contagious. Infection often spreads first among wild water birds, such as ducks, geese, and gulls, and shore birds, such as plovers and sandpipers. The viruses are carried in their intestines and respiratory tract and shed in saliva, mucus, and feces. Wild birds can easily infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Some bird species, including ducks, may carry and spread infection without appearing sick. Domestic flocks are more likely to sicken and possibly die from bird flus. However, not all avian flu viruses are equally harmful: Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may cause no signs of illness, or signs of mild illness like fewer eggs or ruffled feathers in domestic poultry. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more severe illness and high rates of death in infected poultry. The current H5N1 virus is considered an HPAI. 2. Can humans get bird flu? Yes, though this doesn't usually happen. When flu viruses mutate, they may be able to move from their original hosts — birds in this case — to humans and other animals. As of early April 2024, only two cases of bird flu in humans had been reported in the US since 2022. In May, two more cases were reported. Newer case numbers of bird flu will continue to be reported by the CDC, which offers weekly snapshots of influenza in the US. The virus may be introduced into the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. For example, a person may inhale viral particles in the air (droplets, tiny aerosolized particles, or possibly in dust). Or they might touch a surface contaminated by the virus, then touch their eyes or nose. Bird flu in humans typically causes symptoms similar to seasonal flu, such as fever, runny nose, and body aches. 3. Which animals have been affected by bird flu? A surprisingly long list of animals affected by the current H5NI bird flu infection includes: wild birds, chickens, ducks, geese, and other domestic and commercial poultry in 48 states and more than 500 countries livestock, such as dairy cows in nine states at this writing, and other farm animals marine animals, such as seals, sea lions, and even dolphins wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, and racoons, and some domestic animals, such as farm cats. 4. Why are experts concerned about this bird flu outbreak? It might seem odd that there's been so much concern and news coverage about bird flu lately. After all, bird flu has been around for many years. We've long known it sometimes infects nonbird animal species, including humans. But the current outbreak is unique and worrisome for several reasons: Fast, far-reaching spread. The virus has been found throughout the US, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, multiple sub-Saharan African countries, and even Antarctica. Many species have been infected. Previously uninfected species have been affected, including animals in our food supply. Economic impact. If large numbers of beef and dairy cows and chickens sicken or must be culled (killed) to contain outbreaks, this could have a major economic impact on farmers, agriculture businesses, and affected countries' economies. This could also mean higher prices at the grocery store. Opportunities for exposure. Though only two human infections were reported in the US in recent years — both in people working with animals — the more exposure humans have to bird flu, the more chances the virus has to develop mutations that allow easier spread to humans. Potential for fatalities. Severe strains of bird flu have led to H5N1 infections in nearly 900 people in 23 countries since 2003. More than half of these reported cases were fatal. Keep in mind that the math isn't straightforward. It's likely that many more cases of bird flu in humans occurred, yet people experiencing few or no symptoms or those not tested weren't counted, so lethality is likely overestimated. New mutations. It's rare, but possible: If this H5N1 bird flu develops mutations that enable efficient person-to-person spread, bird flu could become the next human pandemic. 5. Are milk, beef, chicken, and the rest of our food supply safe? Public health officials emphasize that the food supply is safe. But concern has understandably run high since the discovery that this outbreak has spread from birds to dairy cows for the first time. More alarming? A study found fragments of bird flu DNA — which is not the same as live virus — in 20% of commercially available milk in the US. So far, there's been no indication that bird flu found in pasteurized milk, beef, or other common foods can cause human illness. Even if live bird flu virus got into the milk supply, studies show that routine pasteurization would kill it. Initial tests did not find the virus in ground beef. Of course, if you are particularly concerned, you could avoid foods and beverages that come from animals affected by bird flu. For example, you could switch to oat milk or almond milk, even though there's no convincing scientific justification to do so now. 6. What if you have pets or work with animals? Bird flu rarely spreads to pets. While that's good news, your pets could have exposure to animals infected with bird flu, such as through eating or playing with a dead bird. So, it's safest to limit your pet's opportunities to interact with potentially infected animals. If you work with animals, especially birds or livestock, or hunt, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends precautions to minimize your exposure to bird flu. 7. What else can you do to stay safe? The CDC recommends everyone take steps to avoid exposure to bird flu, including: Avoid contact with sick or dead animals and keep pets away from them. Avoid animal feces that may be contaminated by birds or bird droppings, as might be common on a farm. Do not prepare or eat raw or undercooked food. Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat raw milk cheese or raw or undercooked foods from animals suspected of having bird flu infection. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety goggles, gloves, and an N95 face mask, when working near sick or dead animals or their feces. Right now, available evidence doesn't support more dramatic preventive measures, such as switching to an all-plant diet. 8. Is there any good news about bird flu? Despite all the worrisome news about bird flu, this recent outbreak may wind up posing little threat to human health. Virus strains may mutate to spread less efficiently or to be less deadly. Efforts are underway to contain the spread of bird flu to humans, including removing sick or exposed animals from the food supply and increased testing of dairy cattle before transport across state lines. And there is other encouraging news: Some birds appear to be developing immunity to the virus. This could reduce the chances of continued spread between birds and other animals. Developing a vaccine to protect cattle from bird flu may be possible (though it's unclear if this approach will be successful). If spread to humans does occur, genetic tests suggest available antiviral medicines could help treat people. So far, human-to-human transmission has not been detected. That makes it less likely that the H5N1 bird flu will become the next pandemic. And if human infections with bird flu did become more common, researchers are working on human vaccines against bird flu using virus strains that match well with those causing the current outbreak. 9. How worried should you be about bird flu? Though there's much we don't know, this much seems certain: bird flu will continue to change and pose challenges for farmers and health experts to stay ahead of it. So far, public health experts believe that bird flu poses little health risk to the general public. So, it's not time to panic about bird flu.

Science Bird Flu Illness Animals Study Nature Mammals Wildlife New Bird Flu Change Sparks Scientists' Warning: 'Be Alert!' Published Jun 06, 2024 at 12:33 PM EDT CLOSE X By Robyn White Nature ReporterFOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Scientists are warning people to "be alert" as bird flu continues to adapt and change.This is because the pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has just crossed a new frontier, a new study reported. It is spreading among marine mammals in an unprecedented outbreak that has killed thousands of elephant seals. This development raises concerns about the virus's adaptability and potential implications for human health.The outbreak of H5N1, a variant of avian influenza, began at the Península Valdés in Argentina in October 2023, with scientists from UC Davis and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) observing a significant rise in elephant seal deaths. The researchers identified approximately 17,000 seal pups dead from the virus, marking the first known transnational transmission of HPAI among mammals. A stock photo shows two elephant seals. Bird flu is spreading rapidly across the species. A stock photo shows two elephant seals. Bird flu is spreading rapidly across the species. Foto4440 To reach the findings, the study authors used genomic analysis to reveal that the H5N1 virus has separated into distinct avian and marine mammal clades, a development that is unprecedented. Researchers found identical mutations in the viruses from both marine mammals and birds, suggesting the virus has adapted specifically for transmission among mammals."This is increased evidence that we should be alert, especially for marine mammals," Marcela Uhart, a veterinarian with UC Davis's Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center and co-author of the study said in a statement. "The more it adapts to mammals, the more important it becomes for humans."The H5N1 variant, which predominately affects birds, has shown a worrying ability to adapt to mammalian hosts. The virus first made global headlines in 2020, causing significant mortality among seabirds in Europe before spreading to South Africa. By 2022, it had reached the Americas, with cases reported in the U.S., Canada, and later, South America.The virus was detected in Argentina's poultry in early 2023, but it was not until August that marine mammals began showing symptoms, the study reported."Influenza viruses commonly mutate and exchange gene segments, enabling them to adapt to new hosts," virologist and co-leading author Agustina Rimondi of INTA said in a statement. "This virus is capable of adapting to mammals, as we can see from the mutations that are consistently found in the viruses belonging to the mammalian clade" .The study's authors stressed the importance of continued research into the situation, in order to understand the potential consequences of this virus on human health, as well as wildlife. The fact that the virus has adapted to marine mammals and retains the ability to infect birds is particularly concerning, as it indicates a high level of evolutionary flexibility."The more this virus spreads among different mammal species, the greater the risk of it acquiring mutations that could enable human transmission," Martha Nelson of the National Institutes of Health, one of the study's co-authors said in a statement."Frequent interactions between sea lions and scavenging by seagulls likely facilitated the spread of the virus," Uhart added. "This, coupled with the high density of the affected colonies, created a perfect storm for the virus to spread rapidly."Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

A third dairy worker has caught bird flu following exposure to sick cows, health officials report. (Image credit: Design Pics Editorial / Contributor via Getty Images) A third human case of bird flu has been linked to the ongoing outbreak in cows on U.S. dairy farms — and this one came with respiratory symptoms, such as cough, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported May 30.Officials first became aware of bird flu spreading among U.S. dairy cows in March, and since then, the viral disease has been detected among cattle on farms in nine states. The type of bird flu spreading is known as H5N1, which has sporadically infected individual humans in the past but has never spread widely from person to person. However, these rare human infections can sometimes be fatal, and there's concern about the virus picking up the necessary mutations to spread easily through the populace.Prior to the outbreak in cows, only one person in the U.S. had ever been infected with H5N1, as far as we know. Now, since the outbreak began, three people have likely been infected via exposure to sick cows. The first person infected by a cow was in Texas, and the second was in Michigan; both are dairy-farm workers and developed only eye infections from the virus before recovering.The third, newly reported case linked to cow exposure was also in Michigan but on a different farm. The person was given treatment and is now isolating at home as their symptoms resolve. This infection is notable because it is the first human H5N1 case in the U.S. associated with respiratory symptoms. Related: H5N1: What to know about the bird flu cases in cows, goats and people "This is the first human case of H5 in the United States to report more typical symptoms of acute respiratory illness associated with influenza virus infection, including A(H5N1) viruses," the CDC reported. "The patient reported upper respiratory tract symptoms, including cough without fever, and eye discomfort with watery discharge." In humans, bird flu viruses, including H5N1, can cause both mild symptoms — including pink eye, cough, sore throat, runny nose and body aches — as well as severe ones, such as pneumonia, difficulty breathing and seizures. If severe, the infections can be fatal, but antiviral drugs available for seasonal flu can help treat the disease.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Finding another case of human H5N1 infection is "not surprising," given the extent of the spread of this virus in dairy cows, the CDC says. H5N1 was also already known to cause respiratory symptoms — however, seeing this is still concerning because, generally, symptoms like coughing and sneezing can make it easier for a virus to spread between people, The New York Times reported.Each time the virus jumps to people, it gains an opportunity to pick up mutations that make it capable of spreading sustainably between humans — a chain of events that, in the worst scenario, could precipitate a pandemic. RELATED STORIES—21-year-old student dies of H5N1 bird flu in Vietnam—1st polar bear death from bird flu spells trouble for species—China reported 1st human death from H3N8 bird flu, WHO saysWith that possibility in mind, the CDC continues to closely monitor for unusual flu activity across the country. So far, "there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including no increase in emergency room visits for influenza and no increase in laboratory detection of human influenza cases," the agency reported. Scientists are also looking to see if the virus has picked up any mutations that would raise the risk of spread, although thus far, there's no evidence of person-to-person transmission. Based on the available information, the risk of spread to the general public remains low, the CDC noted. As always, health authorities still recommend against drinking raw milk. Dairy-farm workers currently face the highest risk of exposure, the agency emphasized. Some experts have argued that federal officials should be screening many more workers for H5N1 and offering optional experimental bird flu vaccines, The New York Times reported. At this point, only about 40 farm workers have consented to being tested for H5N1, while a few hundred are being monitored for possible symptoms, according to news reports.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

This significant development raises concerns about public health and highlights the need for vigilance. PDF FILE The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently confirmed the first human death related to avian influenza H5N2 in Mexico. This significant development raises concerns about public health and highlights the need for vigilance. Let’s explore the details of this case. Details of human death case Patient profile The victim was a 59-year-old man who resided in the State of Mexico. He had no known exposure to poultry or other animals, according to the WHO. The patient had underlying health conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks before developing acute symptoms. Symptoms and hospitalization On April 17, the patient developed symptoms including fever, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, nausea, and general malaise. He was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases Ismael Cosío Villegas (INER) in Mexico City. Unfortunately, he succumbed to complications related to his illness on the same day. Investigation and contagion risk The WHO conducted an epidemiological investigation and tested 17 identified contacts of the patient. No traces of influenza were found in any of these contacts. The origin of transmission remains unknown, as the patient had no direct exposure to birds. Global significance This case marks the first laboratory-confirmed human infection with the influenza A (H5N2) virus worldwide. While cases of this variant have been reported in Mexican poultry, the source of transmission to humans remains a mystery. Differences with H5N1 avian influenza Avian influenza is a disease caused by viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae family (H5N1, H5N3, H5N8, etc.), which usually infect wild birds and poultry, such as chickens. One of the best known is the A virus (H5N1), first detected in China in 1996. Since then it has caused worrying outbreaks in birds around the world. And over the past few years, outbreaks have also been recorded in mammals, such as cats, lions, seals or dolphins, which revealed that the virus was mutating to adapt to new hosts. Although avian influenza mainly affects birds, it can be transmitted to humans, especially to poultry workers or other people in contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. In other words, the virus does not enter the organism through the consumption of birds, but through their handling. As for human cases, and still speaking of influenza A (H5N1), from 2003 to April 1, 2024, a total of 889 cases and 463 deaths (case fatality rate of 52%) have been reported worldwide in 23 countries.Continue after advertising. Low risk of contagion The WHO emphasizes that the risk of contagion from this virus to the general population is currently low. However, any human infection caused by a new subtype of the influenza A virus warrants close monitoring. Conclusion As health authorities continue to investigate, it is crucial to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions. The emergence of avian influenza H5N2 in humans underscores the importance of global surveillance and rapid response to potential health threats. Sources: Available upon request.

Uh, guys? Are you in the right headspace to receive information that could possibly hurt you? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed last week that a third person in the U.S. has tested positive for a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Like the first and second cases reported in Michigan and Texas, respectively, this Michigan resident had been exposed to cows infected with the virus while working on a farm. The two Great Lakes State residents worked on different farms; we also know that for the first time, this third case experienced respiratory symptoms like a cough and eye discomfort. The respiratory symptoms are a cause for concern, since it means the virus could spread more easily between humans and lead to more serious illness. Besides that, the CDC press release doesn’t say much else about the farmworker, only that they are taking an antiviral, “isolating at home, and their symptoms are resolving.” Of the three human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza found in the U.S. this year, we know most about the Texas patient, since researchers quickly published a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine. That person worked on a dairy farm, and only experienced conjunctivitis (also known as pink eye) from the virus. They told officials they came into close contact with both healthy and sick cows, and reported wearing gloves but not respiratory or eye protection. Some have speculated that their infection might have been brought on by getting infected milk in their eye. Advertisement The second case in Michigan seemed similar. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a nasal swab from the person tested negative for H5N1, but an eye swab tested positive. Furthermore, the person’s only symptoms were eye-related. It’s not clear whether this Michigan resident used the same forms of protection when working with sick cattle. But pink eye is a less concerning symptom than signs of a respiratory infection: It’s easier to come into contact with tiny droplets from a cough or a sneeze than someone’s tears. This is one of the reasons why the most recent case out of Michigan has raised scientists’ concerns. Another speaks to the severity of this person’s symptoms, since despite its name, we’re not sure how dangerous highly pathogenic avian influenza could be to humans. (“Highly pathogenic” refers to its effects on birds.) Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I’m getting ahead of myself, of course, because I went to public health school for infectious disease epidemiology and that sometimes draws me into thinking like a hammer looking for a nail. For H5N1—or any zoonotic infection, for that matter—to develop sustained transmission in humans, the virus would need to acquire some key genetic differences. But in the classic model of zoonotic pathogen emergence, initial “spillover events,” where a disease jumps from an animal to a human, give way to cluster outbreaks where people get each other sick. I’m not calmed by the fact that these three spillover events occurred large distances apart, at three unrelated farms. This suggests that the characteristics allowing for spillover might be widespread. Nor do I feel great that we have growing evidence that farmworkers are shaping up to be particularly at risk. Advertisement Disease surveillance can only work properly when people aren’t afraid of engaging with the health care system. Immigration status, fear of retaliation from an employer, or anxiety over having to quarantine and risk losing an income source—these are all factors that complicate public health efforts. In that light, Michigan’s aggressive active surveillance program should be taken to mean that the virus might be spreading undetected in other states. Related From Slate Anna Gibbs Another Person Was Infected With Bird Flu. What’s Going On? Read More If it feels like we haven’t learned anything from COVID-19, it’s because outside of scientific circles, we haven’t. Even the welcomed public health developments, like a more robust wastewater surveillance system and rapid genetic sequencing of viral strains, represent monitoring improvements. In the absence of coordinated action, these promising advances will make little difference.

Trump’s Return Was Just the Beginning. Elon Musk Has Darker Plans for America. Even so, there are some concerning sides to H5N1 we haven’t seen yet, which is a relief, I guess. So far, H5N1 hasn’t been found circulating in pigs, which are more immunologically similar to humans than other livestock and harbor other flu strains that can already infect us. That’s an issue because influenza A viruses (the type H5N1 belongs to) can undergo a process called reassortment when two different viruses infect a single cell. The upshot of reassortment is that a virus lacking the genes to be good at infecting humans can very quickly acquire those tools to sustain transmission in humans. Advertisement There’s also good news and bad news when it comes to the milk supply. When the Food and Drug Administration tested milk from retail stores across 17 states last month, 1 in 5 milk samples contained fragments of H5N1 (the bad news). The silver lining is that those are fragments; pasteurization eliminates the virus and so milk is still safe to drink. Of course, that means now is probably one of the worst times to get into drinking raw milk. Could we be making a mountain out of a molehill? Potentially, given that the CDC’s risk assessment for the general public remains low. But my fear is that we haven’t learned anything from COVID-19 and are doomed to ignore pandemic potential until it’s too late. I think that caution outweighs the risk of getting too worked up over a bird disease.

How likely is this? And what do we need to think about to minimize our risk when shopping for or preparing food?How Safe Is Milk?Bird flu (or avian influenza) is a bird disease caused by specific types of influenza virus. But the virus can also infect cows. In the US, to date, more than 80 dairy herds in at least nine states have been infected with the H5N1 version of the virus.Investigations are under way to confirm how this happened. But we do know that infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. So bird flu can potentially contaminate animal-derived food products during processing and manufacturing.Indeed, fragments of bird flu genetic material (RNA) were found in cow’s milk from the dairy herds associated with infected US farmers.However, the spread of bird flu among cattle, and possibly to humans, is likely to have been caused through contact with contaminated milking equipment, not the milk itself.The test used to detect the virus in milk—which uses PCR technology similar to lab-based Covid tests—is also highly sensitive. This means it can detect very low levels of the bird flu RNA. But the test does not distinguish between live or inactivated virus, just that the RNA is present. So from this test alone, we cannot tell if the virus found in milk is infectious (and capable of infecting humans).Does that mean milk is safe to drink and won’t transmit bird flu? Yes and no.In Australia, where bird flu has not been reported in dairy cattle, the answer is yes. It is safe to drink milk and milk products made from Australian milk. In the US, the answer depends on whether the milk is pasteurized. We know pasteurization is a common and reliable method of destroying concerning microbes, including influenza virus. Like most viruses, influenza virus (including bird flu virus) is inactivated by heat.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanAlthough there is little direct research on whether pasteurization inactivates H5N1 in milk, we can extrapolate from what we know about heat inactivation of H5N1 in chicken and eggs. So we can be confident there is no risk of bird flu transmission via pasteurized milk or milk products.However, it’s another matter for unpasteurized or “raw” US milk or milk products. A recent study showed that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu developed signs of illness. So to be on the safe side, it would be advisable to avoid raw milk products.How About Chicken?Bird flu has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide, including in Australia. In recent weeks, there have been three reported outbreaks in Victorian poultry farms (two with H7N3 bird flu, one with H7N9). There has been one reported outbreak in Western Australia (H9N2).The strains of bird flu identified in the Victorian and Western Australia outbreaks can cause human infection, although these are rare and typically result from close contact with infected live birds or contaminated environments. Therefore, the chance of bird flu transmission in chicken meat is remote.Nonetheless, it is timely to remind people to handle chicken meat with caution as many dangerous pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, can be found on chicken carcasses.Always handle chicken meat carefully when shopping, transporting it home, and storing it in the kitchen. For instance, make sure no meat juices cross-contaminate other items, consider using a cool bag when transporting meat, and refrigerate or freeze the meat within two hours.Avoid washing your chicken before cooking to prevent the spread of disease-causing microbes around the kitchen.Finally, cook chicken thoroughly as viruses (including bird flu) cannot survive cooking temperatures.Are Eggs Safe?The recent Australian outbreaks have occurred in egg-laying or mixed poultry flocks, so concerns have been raised about bird flu transmission via contaminated chicken eggs.Can flu viruses contaminate chicken eggs and potentially spread bird flu? It appears so. A report from 2007 said it was feasible for influenza viruses to enter through the eggshell. This is because influenza virus particles are smaller (100 nanometers) than the pores in eggshells (at least 200 nm).Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanSo viruses could enter eggs and be protected from cleaning procedures designed to remove microbes from the egg surface. Therefore, like the advice about milk and meat, cooking eggs is best.The US Food and Drug Administration recommends cooking poultry, eggs, and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food.In a NutshellIf you consume pasteurized milk products and thoroughly cook your chicken and eggs, there is nothing to worry about as bird flu is inactivated by heat. The real fear is that the virus will evolve into highly pathogenic versions that can be transmitted from human to human. That scenario is much more frightening than any potential spread though food.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each dayElection reaction: The manosphere wonThe Big Story: California will keep moving the world forwardTrump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's presidentEvent: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoEnzo Palombo is associate dean of research at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.

This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with this variant of the virus worldwide. Gins Wang/Getty ImagesA 59-year-old man in Mexico who contracted H5N2 bird flu died in April, the World Health Organization said.This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of this avian flu variant globally.The risk to the public from this virus is low, the WHO said.A 59-year-old man in Mexico who contracted a type of bird flu known as A(H5N2) died in April, the World Health Organization said June 5. The source of the infection is unknown.This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an A(H5N2) virus worldwide, and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico, the WHO said.The agency said the current risk of A(H5N2) virus to the general population in Mexico is low.During a conference for the Association of Health Care Journalists, Mandy Cohen, MD, PhD, Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, addressed the death in Mexico.“This is H5N2, which is different from H5N1, which is what we’re seeing here in our dairy cattle right now….This was an older gentleman with a lot of underlying conditions.”Cohen also said she thought that public health authorities in Mexico were doing “a great job of doing contact tracing.”“The only piece that we are still awaiting is some further genetic analysis, which they are sending samples to CDC, we hope to be able to do a deeper characterization of the genetics there,” Cohen said. (edited) The man affected by A(H5N2) is a resident of the State of Mexico and was hospitalized in Mexico City on April 24 and died on the same day due to complications of his illness.A week earlier, he had developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort, WHO said.“Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico,” WHO said in a statement.In March, an outbreak of high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) occurred in backyard poultry in the state of Michoacán, which borders the State of Mexico where the man was living, according to the agency. That month, there were also two outbreaks of low-pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) in poultry in the State of Mexico.This virus has also spread in the United States. H5N2 was responsible for outbreaks at U.S. commercial and backyard farms in 2014 and 2015.No person-to-person spread“Thus far, it has not been possible to establish if this human case is related to the recent poultry outbreaks [in Mexico],” the WHO said.The man who died had no known history of exposure to poultry or other animals. However, he had multiple underlying medical conditions, the WHO said. His family reported that he had been bedridden for three weeks due to other reasons prior to the start of his symptoms of A(H5N2), the agency said.Reuters reports that Mexico’s Health Ministry said the man had type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.These and other chronic health conditions can increase a person’s chances of developing serious complications from influenza.Mexico’s Health Ministry said there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission related to this case, according to Reuters.Samples collected from people who had close contact with the man or lived near his residence tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the WHO said.“The thing to remember is that this is an isolated case,” said Maria Ruiz, MD, an infectious diseases physician at George Washington University, and director of the GW Travelers Clinic.“Although the person was quite sick for several weeks, so far, none of his contacts have tested positive for avian flu. So there’s been no human-to-human transmission related to this virus,” she told Healthline.H5N1 bird flu virus in U.S.There are many types, or strains, of avian flu viruses. “These viruses, such as H5N1 and now H5N2, primarily circulate among birds, with occasional spillover into mammals, including humans, under the right circumstances,” said Daniel Pastula, MD, MHS, chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology at the University of Colorado and Colorado School of Public Health.Wild birds such as gulls, terns, ducks, and geese are the natural hosts for avian influenza A viruses. But the viruses can also infect domestic poultry, and wild mammals such as seals, otters and foxes, and domestic animals such as cats.People can become infected through close contact with an infected animal or by touching a contaminated surface.In the United States, the bird flu virus A(H5N1) has been spreading among dairy cattle herds since March. So far, herds have been affected in nine states, including Texas, Kansas and Idaho.Domestic cats on dairy farms have also become infected, with some dying. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that A(H5N1) has been found in several house mice in New Mexico, potentially putting more people in closer contact with this virus.So far, three cases of A(H5N1) have been reported in people. Two had only eye infections, but the third had a respiratory illness caused by the virus. All three cases had direct contact with infected cows, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.There is no indication of person-to-person spread of A(H5N1) related to exposure to dairy cattle, the agency said in a release.“Cases like these show the importance of supporting our public health surveillance and response systems at the local, state, federal, and international levels,” said Pastula, “as we need strong biodefense lines.”“There are many emerging infections out there beyond avian influenza viruses, and we need to be prepared if and when they jump to humans,” he said.How to stay safe from bird flu“Overall, there is currently a low risk of avian influenza viruses circulating in humans as they generally do not transmit easily between humans,” Pastula told Healthline. “However, that could always change in the future if a virus mutates enough to allow more efficient human-to-human transmission.”People who work closely with birds and animals, particularly those that may be sick, should use appropriate protective equipment and wash their hands after handling the animal, he said.For the general public, Ruiz advises people not to handle sick or dead wild birds or other animals that may be sick with avian flu.“If there is a situation where you have to move a dead animal, wear gloves and a face mask,” she said, “and be careful with hand hygiene, such as not touching the animal and then touching your face without washing your hands.”For overall influenza prevention, Pastula recommends that “people wash their hands regularly, get recommended [seasonal] influenza vaccines, stay at home when sick from a respiratory infection (or wear a mask when around others) and seek medical care when appropriate.”TakeawayThe World Health Organization reports that a 59-year-old man in Mexico who contracted a type of bird flu known as A(H5N2) died in April. He had symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort.The source of the man’s infection is unknown. He had no known contact with poultry or wild animals, but the WHO reports that H5N2 outbreaks have occurred this year in poultry flocks in Mexico. The man had multiple underlying medical conditions, which may have increased his risk of severe illness from flu.This virus is separate from the A(H5N1) avian flu virus that is spreading among dairy cattle in the United States, and is known to have infected three people. Two of these cases involved only eye infections, but the third included a respiratory infection.Additional reporting by Gillian MohneyHow we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Shawn Radcliffe on June 7, 2024 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextCats Testing Positive for Bird Flu: What to Know About Risks to PeopleCats have recently tested positive for bird flu in areas where outbreaks have been detected.

The H5N2 virus, which is a different strain to H5N1 that is currently circulating in US dairy cattle, has been detected in poultry farms across Mexico in recent months – which experts suspect might somehow be the source of the infection.“Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments,” the WHO said.“Although this new case is rather unusual in that it is the first known human infection with H5N2 and the individual did not have any known exposure to animal sources, it is reported that the individual had multiple other health problems which may have made them particularly vulnerable,” said Prof Peter Horby, Director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford. Experts are racing to understand whether the H5N2 case is an isolated incident, or if it links to the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US Credit: Rodrigo Abd/AP H5 viruses, a subtype of Influenza A or ‘bird flu’, primarily infect wild birds like ducks, geese, and swans. When they spread to domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys, they can cause severe outbreaks with high mortality rates. These avian viruses have long been thought to pose the greatest risk of another human pandemic.Strains like H5N1 have shown a worrying ability to infect mammals and humans. It has killed around 400 people since its discovery in the late 1990s, while another clade – H5N6 – caused 18 deaths in China in 2021.Experts are racing to understand whether the H5N2 case was an isolated incident, or if it somehow links to the ongoing H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US – which has so far infected 82 herds of dairy cattle in ten states, and at least three farm workers.“This could be a fully avian H5N2 strain from poultry in Mexico, but we won’t know until we get genomic sequence data, which has not yet been released,” said Dr Rick Bright, a former head of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).“This case raises many more questions that we haven’t come close to answering about the virus on our doorstep,” he added. “Mexico and the US are very closely linked, if both of these viruses – H5N2 and H5N1 – are in the environment and circulating around us, the risk for a more significant outbreak increases greatly,” Dr Bright said. ‘Could a mouse be a mixing vessel?’One theory is that the H5N2 virus has somehow mixed with the H5N1 virus circulating in the US.Just this week, the US Department of Agriculture released data showing that eleven house mice in the state of New Mexico – around 2,000km away from Mexico City – had contracted H5N1. Although not the most likely scenario, it’s not out of the question that mammals like rodents could have somehow facilitated the transmission or reassortment of these viruses, potentially creating new and more dangerous strains.“This needs to be ruled out quickly and clearly – if a reassortment has happened, we’ll need to pick up the response. Could a mouse be a mixing vessel?” said Dr Bright. Another theory is that the victim might have had contact with people in the US working closely with sick cattle. About half of all US dairy workers – 51 per cent – are undocumented migrants, a significant proportion of which are Mexican. “It’s unclear if any of his contacts or visitors had any travel to the US, or if any of the migrant workers from the US were someone in contact with him,” Dr Bright said. Again, although H5N2 is a different strain of bird flu from H5N1, scientists have not yet seen genomic data – meaning they are ruling nothing out for the time being. Twelve of the patient’s contacts have been tested for the virus, and have come back negative, Mexican health authorities said. The WHO also stressed that the risk of human-human transmission is very low. “Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low,” the report read. The results from serological samples, which would detect a prior infection, have not been released yet, however. If a contact had the virus unknowingly, this might raise the risk that H5N2 has spread further into the local population.Swine flu, also known as H1N1, began in Mexico in 2009 and escalated into a pandemic. Originating from pigs, it swiftly spread among humans. Spillover events are thought to be more likely in developing nations like Mexico and parts of Asia because people live in far closer proximity to animals – chicken dashing around a backyard, meat purchased from a live market, etc. With this new development, concerns about controlling the bird flu virus and preventing it from spreading from poultry to humans have been raised by experts. “Rapid home and community-based tests need to be made available,” Dr Bright said. “Vaccine composition needs to be urgently reassessed as well.” Currently, there are no specific vaccines for preventing an H5N2 virus in humans. The US government is poised to announce a multimillion-dollar investment in mRNA vaccines with Moderna for H5N1 bird flu as early as next month, but this would likely not be effective for the H5N2 strain. Finland became the first country to announce plans to provide bird flu vaccines to individuals at risk of contracting H5N1 this week. The vaccination effort will target specific groups, including poultry farmers, veterinarians, researchers specialising in the virus, and workers in fur farms where animals such as mink and foxes are housed, and where outbreaks have occurred.Finnish health authorities have thus far ordered 20,000 doses which will be administered as soon as they arrive, Stat magazine reported. Scientists have welcomed the news, and have questioned why countries including the US have not followed suit.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024The chicken and egg problem of fighting another flu pandemic • Arkansas Advocate HOME NEWS Government & Politics Health Care Environment Education Investigations Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Government & Politics Health Care Environment Education Investigations Decision 2024 7:00 News Story Health Care The chicken and egg problem of fighting another flu pandemic By: Arthur Allen, KFF Health News - June 2, 2024 7:00 am (Moment/Getty Images) This article first appeared on KFF Health News and is reprinted here under a Creative Commons license. Even a peep of news about a new flu pandemic is enough to set scientists clucking about eggs. They worried about them in 2005, and in 2009, and they’re worrying now. That’s because millions of fertilized hen eggs are still the main ingredient in making vaccines that, hopefully, will protect people against the outbreak of a new flu strain. “It’s almost comical to be using a 1940s technology for a 21st-century pandemic,” said Rick Bright, who led the Health and Human Services Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) during the Trump administration. It’s not so funny, he said, when the currently stockpiled formulation against the H5N1 bird flu virus requires two shots and a whopping 90 micrograms of antigen, yet provides just middling immunity. “For the U.S. alone, it would take hens laying 900,000 eggs every single day for nine months,” Bright said. And that’s only if the chickens don’t get infected. The spread of an avian flu virus has decimated flocks of birds (and killed barn cats and other mammals). Cattle in at least nine states and at least three people in the U.S. have been infected, enough to bring public health attention once again to the potential for a global pandemic. As of May 30, the only confirmed human cases of infection were dairy workers in Texas and Michigan, who experienced eye irritation. Two quickly recovered, while the third developed respiratory symptoms and was being treated with an antiviral drug at home. The virus’s spread into multiple species over a vast geographic area, however, raises the threat that further mutations could create a virus that spreads from human to human through airborne transmission. If they do, prevention starts with the egg. To make raw material for an influenza vaccine, virus is grown in millions of fertilized eggs. Sometimes it doesn’t grow well, or it mutates to a degree that the vaccine product stimulates antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus — or the wild virus mutates to an extent that the vaccine doesn’t work against it. And there’s always the frightening prospect that wild birds could carry the virus into the henhouses needed in vaccine production. “Once those roosters and hens go down, you have no vaccine,” Bright said. Since 2009, when an H1N1 swine flu pandemic swept around the world before vaccine production could get off the ground, researchers and governments have been looking for alternatives. Billions of dollars have been invested into vaccines produced in mammalian and insect cell lines that don’t pose the same risks as egg-based shots. “Everyone knows the cell-based vaccines are better, more immunogenic, and offer better production,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “But they are handicapped because of the clout of egg-based manufacturing.” The companies that make the cell-based influenza vaccines, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi, also have billions invested in egg-based production lines that they aren’t eager to replace. And it’s hard to blame them, said Nicole Lurie, HHS’ assistant secretary for preparedness and response under President Barack Obama who is now an executive director of CEPI, the global epidemic-fighting nonprofit. “Most vaccine companies that responded to an epidemic — Ebola, Zika, covid — ended up losing a lot of money on it,” Lurie said. Exceptions were the mRNA vaccines created for covid, although even Pfizer and Moderna have had to destroy hundreds of millions of doses of unwanted vaccine as public interest waned. Pfizer and Moderna are testing seasonal influenza vaccines made with mRNA, and the government is soliciting bids for mRNA pandemic flu vaccines, said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness at HHS’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. Bright, whose agency invested a billion dollars in a cell-based flu vaccine factory in Holly Springs, North Carolina, said there’s “no way in hell we can fight an H5N1 pandemic with an egg-based vaccine.” But for now, there’s little choice. BARDA has stockpiled hundreds of thousands of doses of an H5N1-strain vaccine that stimulates the creation of antibodies that appear to neutralize the virus now circulating. It could produce millions more doses of the vaccine within weeks and up to 100 million doses in five months, Boucher told KFF Health News. But the vaccines currently in the national stockpile are not a perfect match for the strain in question. Even with two shots containing six times as much vaccine substance as typical flu shots, the stockpiled vaccines were only partly effective against strains of the virus that circulated when those vaccines were made, Adalja said. However, BARDA is currently supporting two clinical trials with a candidate vaccine virus that “is a good match for what we’ve found in cows,” Boucher said. Flu vaccine makers are just starting to prepare this fall’s shots but, eventually, the federal government could request production be switched to a pandemic-targeted strain. “We don’t have the capacity to do both,” Adalja said. For now, ASPR has a stockpile of bulk pandemic vaccine and has identified manufacturing sites where 4.8 million doses could be bottled and finished without stopping production of seasonal flu vaccine, ASPR chief Dawn O’Connell said on May 22. U.S. officials began trying to diversify away from egg-based vaccines in 2005, when avian flu first gripped the world, and with added vigor after the 2009 fiasco. But “with the resources we have available, we get the best bang for our buck and best value to U.S. taxpayers when we leverage the seasonal infrastructure, and that’s still mostly egg-based,” Boucher said. Flu vaccine companies “have a system that works well right now to accomplish their objectives in manufacturing the seasonal vaccine,” he said. And without a financial incentive, “we are going to be here with eggs for a while, I think.” KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

That’s because millions of fertilized hen eggs are still the main ingredient in making vaccines that, hopefully, will protect people against the outbreak of a new flu strain. “It’s almost comical to be using a 1940s technology for a 21st-century pandemic,” said Rick Bright, who led the Health and Human Services Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) during the Trump administration. It’s not so funny, he said, when the currently stockpiled formulation against the H5N1 bird flu virus requires two shots and a whopping 90 micrograms of antigen, yet provides just middling immunity. “For the U.S. alone, it would take hens laying 900,000 eggs every single day for nine months,” Bright said. And that’s only if the chickens don’t get infected. The spread of an avian flu virus has decimated flocks of birds (and killed barn cats and other mammals). Cattle in at least nine states and at least three people in the U.S. have been infected, enough to bring public health attention once again to the potential for a global pandemic. As of May 30, the only confirmed human cases of infection were dairy workers in Texas and Michigan, who experienced eye irritation. Two quickly recovered, while the third developed respiratory symptoms and was being treated with an antiviral drug at home. The virus’s spread into multiple species over a vast geographic area, however, raises the threat that further mutations could create a virus that spreads from human to human through airborne transmission. If they do, prevention starts with the egg. To make raw material for an influenza vaccine, virus is grown in millions of fertilized eggs. Sometimes it doesn’t grow well, or it mutates to a degree that the vaccine product stimulates antibodies that don’t neutralize the virus — or the wild virus mutates to an extent that the vaccine doesn’t work against it. And there’s always the frightening prospect that wild birds could carry the virus into the henhouses needed in vaccine production. “Once those roosters and hens go down, you have no vaccine,” Bright said. Since 2009, when an H1N1 swine flu pandemic swept around the world before vaccine production could get off the ground, researchers and governments have been looking for alternatives. Billions of dollars have been invested into vaccines produced in mammalian and insect cell lines that don’t pose the same risks as egg-based shots. “Everyone knows the cell-based vaccines are better, more immunogenic, and offer better production,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “But they are handicapped because of the clout of egg-based manufacturing.” The companies that make the cell-based influenza vaccines, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi, also have billions invested in egg-based production lines that they aren’t eager to replace. And it’s hard to blame them, said Nicole Lurie, HHS’ assistant secretary for preparedness and response under President Barack Obama who is now an executive director of CEPI, the global epidemic-fighting nonprofit. “Most vaccine companies that responded to an epidemic — Ebola, Zika, covid — ended up losing a lot of money on it,” Lurie said. Exceptions were the mRNA vaccines created for covid, although even Pfizer and Moderna have had to destroy hundreds of millions of doses of unwanted vaccine as public interest waned. Pfizer and Moderna are testing seasonal influenza vaccines made with mRNA, and the government is soliciting bids for mRNA pandemic flu vaccines, said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness at HHS’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. Bright, whose agency invested a billion dollars in a cell-based flu vaccine factory in Holly Springs, North Carolina, said there’s “no way in hell we can fight an H5N1 pandemic with an egg-based vaccine.” But for now, there’s little choice. BARDA has stockpiled hundreds of thousands of doses of an H5N1-strain vaccine that stimulates the creation of antibodies that appear to neutralize the virus now circulating. It could produce millions more doses of the vaccine within weeks and up to 100 million doses in five months, Boucher told KFF Health News. But the vaccines currently in the national stockpile are not a perfect match for the strain in question. Even with two shots containing six times as much vaccine substance as typical flu shots, the stockpiled vaccines were only partly effective against strains of the virus that circulated when those vaccines were made, Adalja said. However, BARDA is currently supporting two clinical trials with a candidate vaccine virus that “is a good match for what we’ve found in cows,” Boucher said. Flu vaccine makers are just starting to prepare this fall’s shots but, eventually, the federal government could request production be switched to a pandemic-targeted strain. “We don’t have the capacity to do both,” Adalja said. For now, ASPR has a stockpile of bulk pandemic vaccine and has identified manufacturing sites where 4.8 million doses could be bottled and finished without stopping production of seasonal flu vaccine, ASPR chief Dawn O’Connell said on May 22. U.S. officials began trying to diversify away from egg-based vaccines in 2005, when avian flu first gripped the world, and with added vigor after the 2009 fiasco. But “with the resources we have available, we get the best bang for our buck and best value to U.S. taxpayers when we leverage the seasonal infrastructure, and that’s still mostly egg-based,” Boucher said. Flu vaccine companies “have a system that works well right now to accomplish their objectives in manufacturing the seasonal vaccine,” he said. And without a financial incentive, “we are going to be here with eggs for a while, I think.” KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

Tags influenzaviruses University University of California, Davis Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses are becoming increasingly flexible and are adapting to mammals in new ways that could have global consequences for humans, wildlife, and livestock, according to a new study. Researchers investigated a massive outbreak among elephant seals in Argentina in 2023. Their study shows clear mammal-to-mammal transmission of the virus. The study states the outbreak is the first known, multinational transmission of the virus in mammals ever observed globally, with the same virus appearing in several pinniped species across different countries over a short period of time. The study’s genomic analysis showed the virus is now evolving into separate avian and marine mammal clades in South America, which is unprecedented. There is growing concern that H5N1 viruses adapted to mammal transmission could jump to other species, including people. “This is increased evidence that we should be alert, especially for marine mammals,” says co-leading author Marcela Uhart, a veterinarian with the University of California, Davis’ Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center and its Latin America Program. “The more it adapts to mammals the more important it becomes for humans.” The current variant of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b began to cause problems at a global scale in 2020. While humans confronted the COVID-19 pandemic, H5N1, or “avian influenza,” began killing tens of thousands of seabirds in Europe before moving to South Africa. In 2022, it entered the US and Canada, threatening poultry and wild birds, and then spread to South America in late 2022. By February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in Argentina for the first time, affecting poultry primarily in inland central Argentina for five months. By August 2023, after two months of no outbreaks in poultry, the virus was found in sea lions at the tip of South America off the Atlantic coastline of Tierra del Fuego island. From there, it moved swiftly northward, with deadly results, first for marine mammals and later for seabirds. In October 2023, following outbreaks in sea lions, the study authors surveyed a breeding colony of elephant seals at Punta Delgada along the coast of Península Valdés, Argentina. They recorded unprecedented mass mortality—some 17,000 elephant seals were dead. By November, 96% of pups born that season would die. Test results confirmed that HPAI H5N1 was present in the seals as well as in several terns that died at the same time. The virus’ separation into avian and marine mammal clades unfolded as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b—specifically genotype B3.2—arrived on the continent through migratory birds before spilling over to mammals. It then separated from the avian clade virus to become its own, marine mammal-adapted virus. Concerningly, while the virus moves across pinnipeds, it can also still infect birds. That was evident in the study, where the virus found in terns was identical to that from elephant seals. “We’re showing the evolution of this marine mammal virus over time,” says virologist and co-leading author Agustina Rimondi of INTA. “This virus is capable of adapting to mammals, as we can see from the mutations that are consistently found in the viruses belonging to the mammalian clade.” Influenza viruses commonly mutate and exchange gene segments, enabling them to adapt to new hosts. Uhart and Rimondi says it is critically important that monitoring and investigation continue to better understand the consequences of the virus to human health, wildlife conservation, and ecology. The study appears online as a preprint.

So far, there is no evidence that that is happening, but a new study looks at what vaccines are currently in the works to protect us if it ever does. We already have several hundred thousand shots stockpiled, left over from past trials. However, there are questions over how effective they'd be against the latest strains of bird flu, and how quickly we could scale up production efforts. Virologists Flavio Faccin and Daniel Perez, from the University of Georgia, analyzed current efforts to prepare for a human pandemic involving the current bird flu variants – and they've identified several promising options for vaccine development. "This deep delve into the landscape of avian influenza vaccines for humans shows vaccination remains the primary defense against the spread of these viruses," says Faccin. Until bird flu jumps directly from one human to another, vaccines won't be produced on a mass scale, but scientists are busy perfecting different types of drug protection that would be ready to go if needed. "Exploring and employing a diverse range of vaccine platforms is crucial for enhancing pandemic preparedness and mitigating the threat of avian influenza viruses," the researchers write in their published paper. Faccin and Perez looked at inactivated vaccines, which are developed using dead versions of the virus they're designed to protect against. In tests, including a study on mice with the H5N1 virus, these have already shown to offer high levels of protection. frameborder="0″ allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>Then, there are live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs), which use a weak form of a virus to get the body prepared to guard against more severe forms. These vaccines typically create a more comprehensive immune response, and again we've seen promising results for H5N1 – including in one study using monkeys. The team also looked at newer types of vaccine technology, including virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines that try and (safely) mimic real viruses, as well as messenger RNA (mRNA), which use mRNA fragments to direct cells to produce proteins that match the virus being targeted. Here too, early results are encouraging, and there have already been limited trials with human participants. While there's no room for complacency – particularly given H5N1 bird flu kills half the people it infects – the vaccine research that's happened so far is encouraging. Deployment of these vaccines, if needed, will still require cooperation across many different countries and agencies, which the World Health Organization is working to ensure. "The H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 subtypes of avian influenza virus pose a dual threat, not only causing significant economic losses to the global poultry industry but also presenting a pressing public health concern due to documented spillover events and human cases," says Faccin.The research has been published in Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics.

On Wednesday, May 22, 2024, Michigan health officials said a farmworker has been diagnosed with bird flu, the second human case connected to an outbreak in U.S. dairy cows.Cynthia Goldsmith, Jackie Katz/CDC via APBy Leada Gore | lgore@al.comA third person in the U.S. has tested positive for bird flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said even as it stressed the risk to the general public remains low.The case was the second reported in Michigan and followed an earlier positive test in Texas. None of the three cases are associated with the others but all the patients were dairy farm workers exposed to infected cows. Mammals can be infected with bird flu viruses when they eat tainted birds or are exposed to environments contaminated with viruses.The most recent patient exhibited different symptoms than the previous cases, including those more typical of flu, such as cough, congestion, water eyes and sore throat. Previously, the patients reported only eye issues similar to pink eye.“What the respiratory symptoms tell us, more than anything, is that this virus, like many viruses, can present in more than one way, and for that reason, we should remain alert, not be alarmed,” Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a briefing reported by CNN.The patient is being treated at home and their symptoms are improving, officials said. Another 200 people are being monitored in Michigan.The CDC said it is monitoring flu data but as of yet, there have been no signs of a major influenza uptick among people, even in the affected states. Risk to the general public remains low, the agency said, but it’s recommended those who work around animals take extra precautions such as wearing protective gear.RECOMMENDED•al.comPoachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Man who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.What are the symptoms of bird flu?Symptoms of bird flu infections in humans have ranged from extremely mild to severe.

This development comes after hundreds of people were reported dead in Arizona after suffering near-instantaneous blood clots. Research findings suggest that a satellite crashed in the region previously. The wreckage introduced a deadly pathogen from space to the people of the region.

Furthermore, it advised the space organisation to "ensure that they do not bring back any extra-terrestrial or mutated terrestrial microbes that could pose a threat to Earth’s human, animal, plant, or ecosystem health or the Moon.”New findings suggest that spaceflight at times re-activate deadly viruses such as herpes, Epstein-Barr, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus and more. These viruses increase viral shedding in astronauts. The report emphasises, "A human infection in a space-like environment could pose a significant threat to everyone on board.”Also read: Is sending astronauts to Mars possible?

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The ACT government announced on Tuesday that due to steady increase in Covid-19, influenza and RSV case notifications, Canberra Health Services would put in place additional safety measures, including a mask mandate and increasing Covid-19 testing for hospital patients.According to the latest ACT Health reporting, Covid-19 case notification numbers increased to 242 from 159 in the previous week and 146 in the week before. Hospital numbers also rose from 28 to 67, but there were no people in the intensive care unit or ventilated.The ACT government spokesperson said “there is currently no indication of more severe disease related to the increasing Covid-19, influenza and RSV cases.”The latest national data on Covid-19 in residential aged care homes shows there are 469 active outbreaks, an increase of 76 outbreaks since 23 May. There are 3,788 cases among residents and staff.The Victorian Department of Health’s most recent report said wastewater surveillance suggested increasing prevalence of Covid-19 infections in the community.Prof Adrian Esterman, the chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said Australia was “right in the middle of another big wave” of Covid-19.Esterman said the current wave was “as bad as it was at the end of last year”. “And it’s still going up, so that’s a major concern especially since many hospitals have stopped mandatory face masks for their staff.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what to know about them | Allen ChengRead moreIn South Australian hospitals there have 237 staff off with Covid and 193 patients with flu or Covid, SA Health said.Esterman called on governments to increase messaging to their most vulnerable populations about face masks and vaccinations, noting only 40% of those over 75 were up to date with their booster shots.Esterman said influenza and RSV rates were also double what they were last year. He believed the increase in illness was due to the “double whammy effect” of waning vaccine uptake combined with people not having been exposed to these viruses because of all the protections they were undertaking between 2020 and 2022.Esterman and Bennett said authorities could no longer rely on reported Covid-19 case numbers, as was the case when widespread testing was occurring in previous years.“We’re looking at six to 10 times as many people actually infected as the case numbers are showing,” Esterman said.The Covid cases in Australia are still Omicron subvariants, the most recent known as FLiRT, which has caused less severe disease and fewer people ending up in hospital, Bennett said. However, she cautioned that hospitalisations and deaths could rise again if people were too complacent, vaccination rates lagged and infection risks aren’t managed.Bennett said she believed Australia was in an acute phase, still “a few weeks off peak” with the next six weeks critical. She encouraged people in this period to ensure they were up to date on their vaccinations, be aware of their own symptoms, dust off their masks and think about ventilation and good hygiene.Explore more on these topicsHealthCoronavirusFlunewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)To learn more about the spread of bird flu, Bay Area disease detectives are once again turning to an unlikely source of information: sewage. And so far, at least, the news is promising. After California food safety regulators detected avian influenza in two chickens at a San Francisco live-bird market at the beginning of last month, scientists at Stanford University tested samples daily from wastewater collected at treatment plants across the country as part of a national project called WastewaterSCAN. In San Francisco, they tested frozen samples dating back several months and found evidence of bird flu from early May, around when the two chickens were identified in the live market, but they have not detected it in any daily tests in recent weeks. “This seems to have been a confined event associated with perhaps these birds being in the market there,” said Alexandria Boehm, a professor and Stanford environmental engineer who also directs the wastewater research team. Officials in San Francisco had discovered the two infected chickens during routine surveillance using a PCR test, which can’t discern between live or dead virus. The chickens were asymptomatic. Sponsored They monitored the market employees who had contact with the chickens for several weeks, and no symptoms were reported. They believe the public was not exposed, and the market has since been sanitized and reopened. San Francisco’s health department would not disclose the location of the market to KQED.related coverage The WastewaterSCAN project has found evidence of bird flu at more than a dozen locations, including two states — Minnesota and Iowa — that officials have yet to list as having infected herds. Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the third human case of bird flu was reported in a farmworker in Michigan who experienced respiratory symptoms after exposure to an infected herd. No human cases have been reported in San Francisco or elsewhere in California. A more precise wastewater measurement The work by Boehm’s team represents the first time researchers have tested for H5N1 in wastewater. It builds on a pandemic-era playbook for monitoring wastewater for COVID-19, which has since expanded to other diseases, even the use of illicit substances and drugs. Although the CDC has tracked influenza A viruses in sewage — using them as a barometer for the spread of bird flu because flu viruses that sicken humans circulate at low levels during summer months, that testing is not H5N1-specific. Boehm’s team, working with San Francisco and California health officials, developed a precise marker for H5N1 bird flu last month as dairy cow outbreaks spread across the U.S. “Once we had the detection in the live bird market, that was an opportunity to look at wastewater for H5N1,” said Dr. George Han, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health’s communicable disease prevention and control program. Although researchers found fragments of bird flu material in the frozen bank of sewage from San Francisco, subsequent monitoring detected no further evidence in the city “nor elsewhere in California, for that matter,” Han said. That’s potentially good news for the state, which boasts the largest dairy industry in the country with more than 1.5 million dairy cows. Federal officials had observed several jumps in influenza A viruses in California, which they thought could indicate that bird flu was circulating across its ranches. San Francisco’s health department does not believe that any of the wastewater hits for bird flu are related to human infection, Han said. “I think that’s really important and the take home message,” he said. “No one really thinks at this point that the detections are due to human cases of H5N1.” San Francisco’s unique sewer system San Francisco is one of only about 700 American communities with a combined sewer system, with stormwater and sewage flowing through the same pipes. That’s an issue for the city during bad storms when the system regularly overflows — the city is fending off a lawsuit from federal and state environmental officials for discharging billions of gallons of untreated sewage into the San Francisco Bay each year because of it. However, it is a benefit for this disease research work. San Francisco’s health department has a working hypothesis: Migratory birds with avian flu may have passed through San Francisco, and their waste ended up in its combined sewer shed. “If there is any kind of bird feces in the street and somebody washes it off the street or the sidewalk, that material ends up in the sanitary sewer,” Boehm said. “We’re able to use that wastewater to understand circulation of both human disease, but also, in some cases, animal disease.” That, Boehm said, could help scientists “better understand the extent and duration of the H5N1 outbreak this spring in the United States.” lower waypointKQEDStay in touch.

Update on the Influenza Season in South Africa (2024) 4 June , 2024 Since the start of the influenza season in week 17 (week starting 22 April 2024), there has been a steady increase in the number of influenza cases from the pneumonia (hospitalised cases) surveillance sentinel sites. Based on the circulation of influenza in 2016-2019 and 2022-2023, the 2024 flu season transmission and impact are at a moderate level. As of 26 May 2024, among patients enrolled in the Pneumonia Surveillance Programme, the most commonly detected subtype and lineage is influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (90/116, 77.6%) followed by influenza B/Victoria (23/116, 19.8%) and influenza A(H3N2) (3/116, 2.6%). Influenza detection rates from week 17 to week 21 in 2024, in the Pneumonia Surveillance Programme, exceeded the average detection rates during the same weeks in previous seasons (2016-2019; 2022). However, it follows a similar trend compared to the 2023 influenza season. Similarly, the proportion of inpatient admissions and outpatient clinic consultations from a private hospital group and a network of general practitioners that are respiratory-related (based on ICD-10 codes, J00-J99) appears to be at a similar level to the peak in 2023. Clinicians should include influenza as a possible diagnosis when managing patients with respiratory illness. Although the majority of people with influenza will present with mild illness, influenza may cause severe illness, which may require hospitalisation or cause death, especially in individuals who are at risk of getting severe influenza complications. High-risk groups include pregnant women (up to 6 weeks post-partum), individuals living with HIV, those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, lung disease, tuberculosis, heart disease, renal disease, and obesity, older individuals (≥aged 65) and children <2 years old. These groups should be encouraged to seek medical help early.

Philip Gruber, pgruber@lancasterfarming.com Jun 7, 2024 Jun 7, 2024 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Jevtic Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Dairy farmers are mulling adding protective gear for their workers after three U.S. dairy farm workers apparently got avian influenza from sick cows.The avian influenza outbreak on 81 dairy farms in nine states poses little threat to the average person, but those who work with infected cows and milk face heightened risk, according to public health authorities.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that dairy workers use personal protective equipment such as coveralls, goggles or face shields, rubber boots or boot covers, gloves, hair coverings and even respirators. Are dairy farm workers adequately protected from avian influenza? June 8, 2024 You voted: A. Yes B. No Vote View Results Back Those guidelines only apply when working with infected or potentially infected livestock.In Pennsylvania, where no herds have tested positive, dairy farms may already be using the protective gear needed to keep their workers safe.“The practices are in place. We’ve just got to be extra thoughtful at these times,” said Adrian Barragan, a Penn State Extension veterinarian.Milking workers at Pennsylvania dairy farms commonly wear gloves, plastic aprons, and goggles or safety glasses.Barragan recommends farms continue using that gear and keep up their current biosecurity practices.Additional measures could be in order if a positive herd is detected in Pennsylvania.On an infected farm especially, it would make sense for workers to have N95 masks to protect against infected droplets, Barragan said.Those droplets could be created by, for example, pouring milk into a container for feeding to calves.Raw milk from infected cows can contain the virus, and mice that consumed such milk in a study exhibited flu symptoms.In addition to wearing PPE, Barragan said workers on all dairy farms should pay special attention to hygiene.That means not touching their eyes or mouths, being sure to clean up after getting splashed with milk, and washing their hands thoroughly — particularly when going from the milking parlor to the lunch room.“If they don’t do a good job washing their hands, they can get exposed to that raw milk,” Barragan said.Still, as long as Pennsylvania remains free of influenza in cows, Barragan sees no reason for the strictest measures, especially with dairy margins being tight.Putting workers in respirators, as the CDC suggests for infected herds, would be overkill in Pennsylvania right now, he said.Paul Hartman, a Pennsylvania farmer who milks cows in Lancaster and Berks counties, said he hasn’t changed his PPE practices so far in response to the out-of-state infections.“I think if it gets detected in PA we would be more aggressive,” he said.His workers were already using nitrile gloves, but at least at one of his farms, none wear goggles or safety glasses.Hartman said he might make boxes of eye protection available if the risk level increases.He said he has been educating himself about the virus and has told his workers what symptoms to watch for in the cows.Those symptoms include decreased milk production, colostrum-like milk and nasal discharge.National ConcernThe CDC’s recommendations on protective gear come as the three infected dairy farm workers — one in Texas, two in Michigan — were reported to not be wearing as much PPE as recommended for flu-positive farms.The Texas worker wore gloves but not mouth or eye protection, according to a case report in The New England Journal of Medicine.Two of the infected workers had irritated eyes. The other had respiratory symptoms.On May 6, the CDC asked that state health and ag departments make PPE available to workers on dairy and poultry farms and in slaughterhouses.But few farms have requested PPE in states that are offering it, according to multiple news reports.The CDC also got no immediate takers when it offered $75 to workers at affected farms to get tested for the flu, according to the University of Minnesota.In a statement, Dairy Farmers of America said it has made PPE and other biosecurity resources available to its farmer members nationwide.No farms have requested PPE in Pennsylvania yet, but protective gear is part of the state’s emergency planning.If a dairy farm in the state reports a suspected case of avian influenza, the state or federal officials who collect samples from the farm would distribute PPE to management and employees.If an animal tests positive, the Department of Health will work with the farm to conduct wellness checks on people who have worked with the sick animal, said Shannon Powers, the press secretary for the Pennsylvania Ag Department.To protect dairy employees, United Farm Workers is calling for the distribution of PPE such as face shields that is practical for the working conditions.The group also wants widespread testing and treatment for farm workers, as well as paid sick leave for testing, isolation and recovery.But it sees PPE as an urgent need.Ideally, employers would be responsible for providing it, but the group also supports the government providing the materials.“Dairy workers are on the front lines of what could well become the next global pandemic. Smart investments in protecting dairy workers’ health now are essential to protecting the broader public’s health later,” said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a United Farm Workers spokesman.Staying ProtectedProtective clothing and gear are nothing new on farms.They are used to prevent pesticide exposure and stop contaminants from getting into food. Even steel-toe boots could be considered PPE.Dairy and beef operations have generally had less strict biosecurity than poultry and swine farms, where workers may shower when entering and leaving and often wear dedicated clothes when around the animals.The Pennsylvania dairy industry has paid increased attention to biosecurity since the avian influenza outbreak began in U.S. poultry two years ago, costing the state millions of birds.Infected flocks get severely ill and must be depopulated. Cows have much milder illness and are expected to recover.Public health officials believe the current avian flu strain is not optimized for spread among humans, but they are monitoring for genetic changes in the virus.Biosecurity procedures protect against disease spread, both from people to animals and animals to people.But farmers may be more concerned about keeping their livestock well than about risks to their own health.A 2010 Penn State study found that 90% of women on Pennsylvania dairy farms believed they had little risk of catching a disease from their livestock.And despite its usefulness, PPE has limits to its appeal.In the summer heat, extra layers of clothing can be hot and uncomfortable, and concerns have been raised about goggles fogging up in humid milking parlors.At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when public health agencies were being extremely cautious, many farmers were disgusted or amused when Pennsylvania’s Health Department said ag workers should wear masks even when working outside.State and federal restrictions on interstate shipment of cattle have likely limited the spread of avian influenza across the U.S.But research suggests PPE could also play a role in keeping workers safe.A 2023 study in New Jersey found that using gloves can substantially reduce the risk of dairy workers getting sickened by cryptosporidium, a protozoa that cows can spread to humans.Hand washing and mask wearing also reduced the risk.Alexis Mraz, a public health professor at The College of New Jersey who was the lead author of the study, said her top concern for influenza would be reducing dairy workers’ touches to their mouths, lips and eyes while working with cattle.“PPE can help minimize these touches in addition to lowering the virus contamination on the farmers’ hands,” Mraz said.Farm workers’ best defense against avian influenza, she said, is probably regular hand washing.Avian Flu ResourcesPennsylvania dairy farmers who want to receive information about avian influenza educational meetings or request PPE may call Jessica Theiss at 717-307-3258 or email RA-AG_STATEVET@pa.gov.Management and workers are encouraged to report human symptoms to the state Health Department at 1-877-PA-HEALTH as soon as symptoms develop so testing can be arranged.

(WWSB) - The CDC is reporting another case of bird flu in Michigan, the third human case associated with an ongoing outbreak of the H5N1 influenza virus in U.S. dairy cows.This follows one case in Texas in April and another in Michigan earlier in May. All three infections are in dairy farm workers who had exposure to infected cows.While the first two cases reported only conjunctivitis, or “pink eye”, as the primary symptom, this third case also involved upper respiratory tract symptoms.The CDC says transmission of bird flu from person to person remains unlikely, and that the primary risk for infection is in other farm workers who have contact with dairy cows. Additional infections are expected going forward, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reporting 69 infected herds in 9 states across the U.S. since March. So far, none have been reported in Florida.Steps are being taken to try to prevent further spread of the virus in cattle, with scientists currently developing a bird flu vaccine for cows. All cattle are also currently being tested for bird flu when they cross state lines.The CDC aims to eventually eradicate H5N1 in cattle, which would also prevent human cases in the future.WWSB ABC7 Good Morning Suncoast - Weekends at 6amCopyright 2024 WWSB.

Here's the latest.Tim Hrenchir Topeka Capital-JournalThe lethal and highly contagious avian influenza has been detected this year in birds and cattle in Kansas.The disease, also known as "bird flu" and H5N1, has infected only one Kansas flock of birds in recent months, after infecting 15 in December and January, said the website of the Kansas Department of Agriculture.The disease was additionally identified as being present in two Kansas commercial dairy herds in March and two more in April, the KDA said.What Kansas counties have avian flu hit this year?Federal guidelines require all birds to be destroyed in any flock where HPAI is detected to try to slow the spread of the disease and alleviate the birds' suffering, said Heather Landsdowne, KDA's director of communications.Symptoms among birds include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; a lack of coordination; and diarrhea.Avian flu between Dec. 4 and Jan. 19 affected five flocks in Mitchell County in north-central Kansas, four in Rice County in central Kansas, two each in McPherson and Barton counties in central Kansas and one each in Shawnee and Pottawatomie counties in northeast Kansas, the KDA website said.The KDA quarantined all 15 premises involved but has since lifted those quarantines, it said. Avian flu was then detected April 9 in a flock in Grant County in southwest Kansas, which remains under quarantine, the KDA said.What about dairy cattle?The KDA announced March 25 that the first two cases of avian flu in Kansas commercial dairy operations had been identified.Two additional Kansas herds reported positive tests for bird flu in early April, the KDA said April 29, adding that the illnesses weren't expected to pose a risk to the public. Dairies may only sell milk from healthy cows.The KDA didn't reveal the locations where avian flu was found in dairy cattle.Avian flu symptoms are restricted mostly to late-stage lactating cows and include a drop in milk production, loss of appetite, and changes in manure consistency, it said.What's the risk of avian flu to people?The risk of Avian flu to people is thought to be low.One dairy worker each in Texas and Michigan have been identified as having been infected this year.The only other human case in the U.S. occurred in 2022 and involved a person incarcerated in a Colorado prison who was exposed to poultry infected with avian flu.Contact Tim Hrenchir at threnchir@gannett.com or 785-213-5934.

As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states. Robert F. Bukaty/AP/File CNN — Results from recent wastewater testing across the US suggests that H5N1 bird flu may not be as widespread as first feared. The data, released Monday by the nonprofit WastewaterSCAN network, showed detections of the H5 protein portion of the flu virus in sewage from 14 water treatment plants in five states, mostly in Texas and Michigan, suggesting that an ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle may largely be confined to states that have already been identified as having affected herds. “We’re not detecting H5 everywhere. We’re only detecting it in certain locations,” said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and program director for WastewaterSCAN. The test for H5 was run in 190 monitoring sites across the US over the past two weeks. Nine states are not enrolled in the WastewaterSCAN network and so are not included in the surveillance: South Carolina, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. There were detections in two states where no affected dairy herds have been identified: Iowa and Minnesota. However, both states have seen recent outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry.

(Photo by: Ed Young /Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Ed Young/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Related article Cows have human flu receptors, study shows, raising stakes on bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle Boehm explained that the researchers aren’t sure exactly what the sources of H5 in wastewater may be. It could be from permitted discharges of unused or leftover raw milk to wastewater treatment plants where the samples are collected. “In the case of Amarillo in Texas, for example, they had a dairy processing plant that was making processed dairy products, and their waste stream discharges into the wastewater treatment plant because milk, raw milk from the local area, was coming into that plant with H5N1,” Boehm said. That may not be the source in all areas, however. There’s a chance the H5 detections might also be due to human infections or from less-likely sources such as infected wild birds that might contaminate wastewater or stormwater runoff that picks up H5N1 virus on its way into sewers, perhaps from bird droppings, Boehm said. People shouldn’t be unduly alarmed if H5 appears in a nearby sewer system, Boehm said. “The way that we’re thinking about it is that wastewater is providing an additional tool to the nation” to keep eyes on the virus amid the outbreak, Boehm said. Experts say such tools are needed because testing of cattle has been limited, and the farm workers who are most at risk of catching the virus from infected cattle often live on minimal incomes and might not want to be tested if it means they could miss days of work without pay. As of Tuesday, 81 dairy herds with infected cows have been identified across nine states. States reporting the highest numbers of affected herds are Michigan, Idaho and Texas, according to the US Department of Agriculture. The USDA issued an order in late April requiring dairy cattle to test negative for H5N1 before they can be transported across state lines, but many farmers have been reluctant to let government officials into their farms to conduct further surveillance for the virus. Dr. Eric Deeble, deputy assistant secretary for the USDA, said last week that more than 17,000 tests for H5N1 flu had been run on cattle, with the caveat that some of the samples were pooled, so one test may represent more than one cow. But when asked to estimate whether one thousand, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of cows had been affected, Deeble said he could not, underscoring the large degree of uncertainty involved in understanding the scope of the outbreak.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring for human infections through a representative network of clinics that submit test results for respiratory viruses to the agency and through public health laboratories. It’s also hoping to conduct an epidemiological study to better understand the risk of transmission between animals and humans on farms. In a study published May 29, the CDC estimated that there was a 72% to 77% chance that current surveillance would detect one human case of H5N1 in an emergency room or urgent care clinic monthly, provided the person had symptoms similar in severity to a case of seasonal flu, and there were at least 100 cases of H5N1 in the population. “While these findings indicate that existing flu surveillance systems are likely to detect at least one novel influenza case before the virus has spread widely, CDC is asking that health care providers remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of influenza virus infection over the summer and maintain high rates of testing,” the agency said in a news release. It also encouraged providers to forward any specimens that test positive for influenza A to public health laboratories for additional testing.

The source of exposure to the virus is unknown. As per WHO, the 59-year-old person had been hospitalised in Mexico City and died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and general discomfort.advertisement"Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico," WHO said in a statement.KNOW ALL ABOUT THE H5N2 STRAIN OF BIRD FLUBird flu has been rampantly spreading across farms in countries like the US, UK, France, Japan and Australia, among others. Several strains of the virus have been detected till now with H5N1 being the most prominent among birds. Known as avian influenza, the virus usually doesn't affect humans. However, there are been rare fatal cases. According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses have been responsible for most human illness from avian influenza viruses reported worldwide to date, including the most serious illnesses with high mortality.Birds infected by the virus, shed the influenza through their saliva, mucous and feces.

(Photo: Getty Images) Other animals infected with avian influenza viruses may have the virus present in respiratory secretions, different organs, blood, or in other body fluids, including animal milk.The H5N2 strain has been detected in poultry farms in Mexico recently. The strain is a subtype of the species Influenzavirus A. Birds infected by this strain usually do not appear ill but might show mild symptoms. Certain variants of this subtype are significantly more pathogenic than others, and outbreaks of the "high-path" H5N2 strain occasionally lead to the culling of thousands of birds on poultry farms. Birds infected by this strain usually do not appear ill but might show mild symptoms. (Photo: AFP) The symptoms of H5N2 are similar to the H5N1 strain, but milder in form. Fever, cough, body aches and shortness of breath are common signs of the strain. As per WHO, whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Epidemiological and virological evidence indicates that A(H5) viruses from past events have not developed the capability for sustained human-to-human transmission, making the current likelihood of such spread low.There are no vaccines for preventing the influenza A(H5) viruses. However, candidate vaccines to prevent this virus in humans have been developed for "pandemic preparedness purposes."

Share this item with your network: By Veronica Salib, Associate Editor Published: 07 Jun 2024 After months of stress over the rising prevalence of H5N1, or avian influenza A, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has published a research agenda outlining investigative goals for ongoing research into this virus. According to the NIH press release, H5N1 influenza viruses first emerged in 2003 and are circulating globally in 23 countries. These viruses most often impact wild birds and poultry, putting workers in close contact with them at risk. However, more recently, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 has spread beyond birds, impacting roughly 50 animal species, including dairy cows in Texas. “Although the virus so far has not shown genetic evidence of acquiring the ability to spread from person to person, public health officials are closely monitoring the outbreak as part of overarching pandemic preparedness efforts,” stated the NIH in its press release. This preparedness requires extensive research, which has led the NIAID to develop the NIAID Research Agenda for 2024 H5N1 Influenza. The research agenda focuses on four primary objectives. The first objective is to increase our understanding of H5N1 viral biology and gather more data on factors influencing disease pathogenesis and transmission. Understanding viral epidemiology can provide context for other research on preventing or treating disease. Under this objective, there are multiple focus areas. The first focus area centers on H5N1 virus epidemiology and genomic surveillance to understand disease spread within and between farms and examine genetic sequences. Another focus area is researching virus biology and pathogenicity to identify sites of viral replication, clinical signs of illness, and duration of viral shedding. Other focus areas include understanding drivers of viral transmission, gathering data on virus persistence and reservoirs, and assessing immune response to H5N1 viral infection. The second objective is focused on developing and evaluating prevention strategies for H5N1. The NIAID provides two primary focus areas under this objective: antigen discovery and vaccine development and adjuvant research. The NIAID is working on developing a universal influenza vaccine that offers protection against multiple subtypes of influenza, including H5N1. The third research objective is focused on advancing existing and novel treatments for H5N1. This objective focuses on developing direct-acting therapeutics that address emerging antiviral resistance via new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The NIAID is also exploring monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for pre-exposure prophylaxis or treatment of influenza infections. The final objective prioritizes identifying strategies for viral detection, with the primary goal of developing in vitro diagnostic tools for H5N1. These research objectives and the overarching agenda provide comprehensive goals for addressing the multifaceted components of H5N1 viral transmission. “The NIAID H5N1 research agenda builds on the institute’s longstanding influenza research efforts. It addresses the current outbreak in US dairy cows, including potential human-to-human transmission of H5N1 influenza viruses. NIAID will leverage both its domestic and international research infrastructures to achieve the plan’s objectives,” concluded the press release.

This publication is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-flu-reports/surveillance-of-influenza-and-other-seasonal-respiratory-viruses-in-the-uk-winter-2022-to-2023 Main findings This report describes surveillance findings for seasonal influenza, other seasonal respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the monitoring of human cases of avian influenza and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Across the UK, influenza activity was concentrated in a relatively short period, and relatively early within the typical seasonal range. High levels of influenza activity were seen across most surveillance systems from week 48 2022 to week 3 2023, where activity through multiple indicators showed a rapid increase in activity, followed by a rapid decline in activity and returning to low levels of activity for the remainder of the season. Activity was higher than levels observed during the 2021 to 2022 season, with 2022 to 23 the first since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in which there have not been significant non-pharmaceutical control measures in place: these also suppress influenza transmission. During the 2022 to 2023 season, influenza A dominated, with influenza A(H3N2) the predominant subtype in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant in Northern Ireland. Influenza type B Victoria lineage circulated at low levels becoming more prominent in 2023 as influenza A declined. All sequenced influenza B were Victoria lineage; there were no confirmed detections of wild-type influenza B Yamagata lineage. In primary care, GP influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates across the UK were above baseline intensity levels between week 51 2022 and week 1 2023: the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly in syndromic surveillance (England), peak rates of 111 calls and emergency department attendances for ILI were higher than most previous seasons between weeks 49 of 2022 and week 1 2023, though this pattern in 111 calls was not observed in other nations. Note that while ILI is a relatively specific indicator, signifying an illness considered by the clinician to be most likely due to influenza virus, all respiratory clinical indicators using signs and symptoms or syndromes can also reflect the activity of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. In England and Scotland, the hospitalisation rate peaked during week 51 2022 and was above the baseline activity threshold between week 43 2022 and week 9 2023 in England. Peak hospitalisation rates were higher than previous influenza seasons; improved virological case ascertainment is likely to have contributed to this, with increased influenza testing compared with pre-COVID-19 seasons. Total hospitalisations in England were higher than previous influenza seasons. Total hospitalisations were also high in Scotland, although lower than the 2017 to 2018 season. Intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) influenza admissions also peaked during week 51 2022 and were above the baseline activity threshold between week 46 2022 and week 3 2023 in England. While rates were higher than those observed in 2021 to 2022, total admission rate was lower than those seen in previous seasons. Provisional end-of-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalisation was higher in children (point estimates 60% to 70% across nations providing estimates) than in adults (point estimates around 30% to 35%) with broad confidence intervals for estimates of vaccine effectiveness against different influenza subtypes. This is consistent with previous seasons. The vaccines were well matched to circulating A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses, with some evidence of ongoing evolution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Vaccine uptake for the 2022 to 2023 season in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is summarised in this report. This includes uptake in pre-school aged children, primary school aged children, those eligible in secondary school, those in clinical at-risk groups, pregnant women, those aged 50 years and over and all frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). Activity from other circulating seasonal respiratory viruses, including RSV, was broadly similar than previous seasons. RSV activity was raised through the summer months of 2022, increasing further from week 40 2022 and peaked in weeks 46 to 50 2022 across the nations before declining to low for the rest of the season. Novel and emerging respiratory viruses, including MERS-CoV and avian-origin influenza viruses, have continued to result in human cases in affected countries. There have been multiple detections of avian influenza in avian species in the UK in 2022 to 2023 as reported by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). The UK reported 2 detections of avian influenza A(H5) virus in poultry workers at a farm in England in May 2023, with no evidence of onward transmission. Both cases were asymptomatic and detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza. Surveillance and public health measures are recommended in the UK for persons potentially exposed to infected birds and for severe respiratory disease among travellers returning from affected countries. Surveillance of influenza and seasonal respiratory viruses in the UK Surveillance of influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses in the 4 UK nations is undertaken throughout the year by teams within the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland (PHS), Public Health Wales (PHW) and the Public Health Agency (PHA) Northern Ireland, who are each responsible for monitoring influenza activity for their respective nation. UKHSA undertakes a combination of England and UK functions and collated this annual report in collaboration with the other public health agencies. Surveillance is also carried out for emerging novel respiratory viruses, including MERS-CoV and for human infections with avian influenza such as influenza A(H5N1), influenza A(H5N6) and influenza A(H7N9). Weekly outputs on influenza are normally published during the winter season between October (week 40) and May (week 20), the period when influenza typically circulates. Since 2020 these reports have also covered COVID-19 and these reports run weekly year-round. A variety of data sources are collated to provide information on influenza activity and to provide rapid estimates of influenza-related burden within the community, on the health service and in excess all-cause mortality. In addition, in-season and end-of-season monitoring of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness is undertaken. This report describes influenza activity observed in the UK in the period from week 40 2022 (week ending 9 October 2022) to week 15 2023 (week ending 16 April 2023). This includes observations and commentary on influenza activity, activity of other seasonal and novel respiratory viruses and from the influenza vaccination programmes. There was some limited influenza B activity beyond week 15 2023. Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses continues year round with reduced reporting for weeks 21 to 39. The moving epidemic method (MEM) is used by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to standardise reporting of influenza activity across Europe. It has been adopted by the UK and is presented for GP ILI consultation rates for each UK scheme and for the hospitalisation and ICU admissions rate through the SARI Watch scheme. During the 2022 to 2023 season, the licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was, for the first time, offered to all children aged 2 years in all UK nations up to the school-leaving age in the UK with the rollout in England reaching year 11. During the 2022 to 2023 season, influenza vaccination was again offered to individuals between 50 and 64 years old as part of the COVID-19 response, anticipating that influenza could rebound to above typical levels as social contact increased. Measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the previous 2 seasons. These measures included public health messaging, social and physical distancing measures, national lockdowns, the wearing of face coverings, hand hygiene and travel restrictions. Changes in healthcare-seeking patterns also affect some influenza indicators directly and indirectly. Although many of these restrictions and interventions were lifted by the 2022 to 2023 influenza season (some measures were reintroduced in December 2021 as Omicron-variant COVID-19 emerged, curtailing influenza transmission), these factors continue to be important to consider when interpreting the influenza surveillance indicators presented in this report, especially when comparing with previous seasons. Community surveillance Syndromic surveillance In England, national UKHSA real-time syndromic surveillance systems include GP in-hours (GPIH) consultations and GP out-of-hours (GPOOH) contacts, emergency department (ED) attendances (Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS)) and NHS 111 calls and online assessments. These systems monitor a range of indicators sensitive to community influenza activity, for example NHS 111 ‘cold or flu’ calls and GP in-hours consultations for ILI. Both clinical coding and healthcare-seeking behaviour have been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Syndromic data over the 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 winter seasons should therefore be interpreted with some caution. Furthermore, during winter 2022 to 2023, syndromic surveillance data should also be interpreted with some caution due to the ‘group A strep incident’ from week 48 2022. During this incident, national media reports of an increase in severe invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) disease in children led to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour across the NHS, particularly in children with GAS-type symptoms, which are likely to have been respiratory symptoms. GP in-hours consultation data presented here represents the findings from a sentinel surveillance system, as reported throughout the most recent 6 influenza seasons. The levels (consultation rates) reported may differ from those presented in previous annual reports, which were based on a dual data feed system with a larger population coverage which ended in March 2021. During winter 2022 to 2023, GPIH ILI consultation rates increased rapidly from week 47, peaking during week 51. This peak occurred comparable with or earlier than in previous pre-pandemic years but was lower than the 2017 to 2018 season. Similarly, GPIH pneumonia consultation rate also peaked during week 51 2022, at similar levels to those observed in previous seasons but lower than those seen in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). Figure 1a: Weekly all age GP in-hours consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI), winter 2017 to 2023, England Figure 1b: Weekly all age GP in-hours consultations for pneumonia, winter 2017 to 2023, England ED attendance syndromic surveillance data presented here includes 121 EDs (NHS type 01) that reported data throughout the most recent 6 influenza seasons. Therefore, numbers may differ slightly from those presented in previous annual reports, where a different number of EDs were included. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) ED attendances increased rapidly from week 44, before peaking in week 49 at the highest level of all years for which comparable data is available (Figure 2). Pneumonia ED attendances followed a similar pattern and peaked at a similar level to the 2019 to 2020 season (Figure 2). ILI ED attendances increased from week 45, peaking during week 51. This peak was higher than in any previous season (Figure 2). Figure 2a: Weekly all age Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS) acute respiratory infection (ARI) attendances winter 2018 to 2023 Figure 2b: Weekly all age EDSSS pneumonia attendances, winter 2018 to 2023 Figure 2c: Weekly all age EDSSS ILI attendances, winter 2018 to 2023 From week 40 2022 onwards, the number of NHS 111 ‘cold or flu’ calls was similar to 2021 to 2022, but higher than the numbers seen at the start of the previous 4 seasons. The 2022 increase from week 45 onwards was earlier than in previous years, peaking during week 51 at a level higher than during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in week 11 2020 (Figure 3). It should be noted that COVID-19 activity caused an increase in the use of cold or flu codes prior to the introduction of COVID-19 specific options, causing the rapid drop in cold or flu calls recorded from week 12 2020 onwards. Figure 3: Weekly all age England NHS 111 cold or flu calls, winter 2017 to 2023 In Wales, the weekly proportion of cold or flu calls made to NHS Direct Wales remained relatively low and stable throughout the season (Figure 4). The percentage of calls was slightly higher than the 2021 to 2022 season, but remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic seasons. In Scotland, the weekly proportion of all calls to NHS 24 which mention cold or flu increased steadily between week 44 2022 and week 1 2023, before a sharp decline to low levels where it became steady for the remainder of the season. The percentage of calls was similar to what was reported in 2021 to 2022 but with a later peak and remained lower than those seen in most pre-pandemic seasons (Figure 5). Figure 4: Proportion of calls for cold or flu (all ages) to NHS-Direct, Wales, 2017 to 2023 Figure 5: Proportion of calls for cold or flu (all ages) through NHS 24, Scotland, 2017 to 2023. FluSurvey (internet-based surveillance) FluSurvey, run by UKHSA, provides internet-based surveillance of ILI and COVID-19 symptoms in the UK population. It is part of a European wide initiative (including 11 European countries). On registration, individuals aged 18 years and over complete a baseline profile questionnaire which collects information on demographic, geographic, socioeconomic (household size and composition, occupation, education, and transportation), and health (vaccination, diet, pregnancy, smoking, and underlying medical conditions) data. Subsequently, participants are sent weekly reminders via email to report any symptoms relating to flu or COVID-19 that they may have experienced and their health-seeking behaviour as a result of their symptoms. This creates a fast, reliable and flexible real-time monitoring surveillance system. Recruitment of survey participants remained open throughout the 2022 to 2023 season to enable post pandemic surveillance of disease activity in the community. A total of 2,490 participants were recruited and completed at least one survey with an average weekly participation of 1,984 (79.7%), contributing 55,628 responses across the 2022 to 2023 season. There were more participants aged 65 years and over (50.6%) compared with other age groups (0 to 18 years (1.0%), 19 to 45 years (9.2%), 46 to 64 years (39.3%)). There was a higher proportion of female participants compared with male participants (66.4% versus 33.6%). The majority (2,581 or 89.7%) of participants were resident in England, 177 participants were from Scotland, 19 participants were from Northern Ireland and 92 from Wales. Any participant completing the symptoms questionnaire during the reporting week was included in the analysis. The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) ILI case definition was applied of sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of: fever, malaise, headache or muscle pain and at least one of: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath. The total number of self-reported ILI episodes was 1,404 (2.5%). Overall, self-reported ILI activity was slightly higher than that observed in the previous season and peaked during week 52 (Figure 6). Social mixing with people outside of participants’ households increased further compared with 2021 to 2022 as COVID-19 control measures reduced. Some drops in social mixing were seen during seasonal holidays, also aligning to the ILI peak. Further analysis of the 2022 to 2023 flu survey will be available on the FluSurvey website in the summer. Figure 6: Weekly ILI incidence per 1,000 reported through FluSurvey Please note that in the 2019 to 2020 season FluSurvey reporting began in week 46. Please note there was no FluSurvey update in week 49 2022. Figure 7: FluSurvey participants’ self-reported number of social contacts outside the household FluDetector (internet-based surveillance) UKHSA works with University College London (UCL) to assess the use of internet-based search queries as a surveillance method for ILI in England. This is part of work on early-warning surveillance systems for influenza, through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) project i-sense. Combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques, a non-linear Gaussian process model was developed by UCL to produce real-time estimates of ILI. The supervised model, trained on historic national data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) scheme, produces daily ILI estimates based on the proportion of ILI related search queries within a 10% to 15% sample of all queries issued, and is extracted daily from Google’s Health Trends Application Programming Interface. Estimated rates of ILI were above the baseline threshold level of 19.6 per 100,000 between week 48 2022 and week 52 2022, reaching a peak of 40.7 per 100,000 in week 51. Overall estimated rates were higher than those seen in 2021 to 2022, and intermediate to the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons (Figure 8). Figure 8: Daily estimated ILI Google search query rates per 100,000 population Acute respiratory infection incidents Here we present data on ARI incidents in different settings that are reported to UKHSA health protection teams (HPTs) and entered onto the HPZone case and incident management system. Incidents are suspected outbreaks of acute respiratory infections linked to a particular setting. All suspected outbreaks are further investigated by the HPT in liaison with local partners. The ARI definition includes presentations of both of ILI and other acute viral respiratory infections (AVRI). Causal pathogens can include influenza A and B, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, a total of 8,260 incidents in closed settings were reported in the UK, the majority of which were SARS-CoV-2. The 2022 to 2023 season saw a decrease in the total number of incidents largely due to a decrease in the number of reported SARS-CoV-2 incidents. The number of influenza and other respiratory virus incidents increased compared with the previous season, although levels remained low compared with pre-pandemic seasons. England In England, there were a total of 6,049 ARI incidents in closed settings reported between week 40 of 2022 and week 15 of 2023. Of these, 5,006 (82.8%) were reported from care homes, 166 (2.7%) from educational settings, 477 (7.9%) from hospital settings and 400 (6.6%) from other settings. Where information on virological testing results was available, 2,828 were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2, followed by 454 influenza incidents, 32 RSV incidents and 24 incidents linked to other respiratory viruses (Table 1). Table 1: The number of incidents in England by institution and virus type between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023.

By subtype, 432 were influenza A(not subtyped), 8 were influenza A(H3), 7 were influenza B, 4 were influenza A(H1N1) and 3 were influenza (untyped). The majority of influenza outbreaks occurred in care home settings, with the highest number in a week observed during week 51 2022 (Figure 9). Figure 9: The number of total influenza outbreaks by week and setting, 2022 to 2023, England Scotland In Scotland, there were a total of 741 ARI outbreaks reported between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023. An outbreak is defined as at least 2 cases (laboratory confirmed and or suspected) of any acute respiratory illness within 48 hours in any setting. Of these, 668 (90.2%) were reported from care homes, 45 from other settings (6.1%), 24 (3.2%) from educational settings and 4 from prisons (0.5%). Virological results indicate 561 outbreaks were SARS-CoV-2, 66 were influenza A(not subtyped), 9 were influenza(not subtyped), 8 were RSV, 5 were seasonal coronavirus, 4 were rhinovirus, and 1 was enterovirus. The remaining 87 outbreaks did not have an organism reported. Only outbreaks captured through HPZone are reported, therefore the total number of outbreaks may be an underestimate. Please note that the denominator for different settings will vary significantly, as does the propensity to report outbreaks between different settings. For these reasons, comparisons between settings are not advised. Wales During the 2022 to 2023 influenza season in Wales there were 708 outbreaks of influenza, ILI or acute respiratory illness (ARI) reported to Public Health Wales HPTs, compared with 1,266 reported outbreaks during the 2021 to 2022 season. Outbreaks were reported from 2022 week 40 to 2023 week 15. The number of outbreaks reported from residential homes was 668 (94%), 23 outbreaks (3%) were reported from other community settings, 9 (1%) were reported from school or nursery settings, 5 (0.7%) were reported from prisons and 3 (0.4%) were reported from hospitals. Of these outbreaks, 683 were SARS-CoV-2, of which 681 were confirmed, and 2 were suspected. Of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 incidents, 5 had only one reported case. Of the other outbreaks, 17 were influenza A; there were 3 outbreaks of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and 3 outbreaks of influenza-like-illness with no respiratory result. Where influenza was detected in an outbreak, 14 were influenza A(untyped), 4 were influenza A(H3) and 2 were influenza A(H1N1). Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, there were a total of 762 ARI outbreaks reported to the Public Health Agency between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, compared with a total of 1,058 ARI outbreaks in the 2021 to 2022 season and 1,025 ARI outbreaks in the 2020 to 2021 season. In the 2022 to 2023 season, 379 (49.7%) reported outbreaks were from care homes, 309 (40.6%) from hospitals, and 74 (9.7%) from other settings. Virological results were available for 762 confirmed respiratory outbreaks of which 729 were SARS-CoV-2, 29 influenza A(not subtyped), 2 influenza/SARS-CoV-2 co-infections, 1 influenza B and 1 RSV. Further information on ARI incidents during the 2022 to 2023 season is available in the weekly influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report and information on ARI incidents occurring in previous seasons is available in previous annual flu reports. Primary care consultations England Weekly rates of GP consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) through the RCGP scheme surpassed the 2022 to 2023 season moving epidemic method (MEM) baseline threshold of 11.47 per 100,000 during week 49 2022 and remained in within the medium MEM threshold until week 1 2023 before returning below the baseline threshold from week 3 2023 (Figure 10). The ILI rate for 2022 to 2023 was higher than that observed in the 2021 to 2022 season. GP ILI consultation was comparable to the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 seasons but below 2017 to 2018, when the ILI rate was above the MEM baseline threshold level for 14 weeks (Figure 10). Figure 10: Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2022 to 2023 and past seasons, England (RCGP) Scotland Weekly GP consultations for ILI surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 19.8 per 100,000 between week 51 2022 and week 1 2023 in Scotland. Overall, the ILI consultation rate was higher than levels observed in 2021 to 2022 but below activity seen in the 2017 to 2018 season (Figure 11). Figure 11: Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2022 to 2023 and past seasons, Scotland Wales Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Wales surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 10.97 per 100,000 between weeks 49 2022 to week 2 2023. The ILI consultation rate remained within the baseline MEM threshold for the rest of the season. Overall seasonal ILI consultation was higher than levels observed in 2021 to 2022 but below the activity in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 12). Figure 12: Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2022 to 2023 and past seasons, Wales Northern Ireland Weekly GP consultations for ILI in Northern Ireland surpassed the baseline MEM threshold of 11.3 per 100,000 between week 51 2022 and week 1 2023. Rates in the current season were higher than observed in the 2021 to 2022 and 2020 to 2021 seasons, but lower than seen in the 2017 to 2018 season (Figure 13). Figure 13: Weekly all age GP influenza-like illness rates for 2022 to 2023 and past seasons, Northern Ireland Secondary care surveillance In England, the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch surveillance system was established in 2020 to report the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza, COVID-19 and RSV cases admitted to hospital and critical care units (ICU or HDU) in acute NHS trusts. This has replaced the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance System (USISS) mandatory and sentinel data collections for influenza surveillance used in previous seasons, and the COVID-19 hospitalisations in England surveillance system (CHESS) collections for COVID-19 surveillance. Aggregate level data is submitted by acute NHS trusts on a weekly basis. A week is based on the ISO week system running from Monday to Sunday. The weekly rate of new admissions of influenza cases is based on the catchment population of those NHS trusts who made a return in that week. Surveillance is usually between week 40 (around October) to week 20 (late May) in the following year. However, since the pandemic, influenza and RSV surveillance were week 39 (comprising one-year surveillance) to detect out of season rebounds. The MEM method has been applied to the SARI Watch hospital and ICU or HDU admissions for confirmed influenza to assess the impact of influenza activity throughout the season. The MEM thresholds are based on data from the 2016 to 2017 to the 2021 to 2022 seasons (data from 2020 to 2021 was excluded due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Trends in influenza hospitalisation and critical care admission should be interpreted in the context of testing practices for acute respiratory infections. In recent years there has been wider implementation of rapid molecular point of care tests for influenza in hospital settings. From a public health surveillance perspective, it is important to consider a step change in influenza case ascertainment in more recent years. On 16 February 2023, UKHSA issued a reminder to acute NHS trusts that influenza A samples from critical care should be subtyped in line with existing guidance. This was in the context of vigilance over avian influenza and concern that severe cases presenting in ICU or HDU settings may be missed. The new testing direction may impact on the ratio of subtyped to unsubtyped in surveillance data. On 29 June 2023, the following amendments were issued to the ‘Secondary care surveillance’ section of the report. Previously published cumulative RSV hospital admission rates in England were based on a sum of weekly cases divided by the sum population of all reporting trusts. This has been replaced with cumulative rates, which are based on a sum of weekly rates. This approach allows for the fact that not all sentinel trusts were involved in data reporting throughout the entirety of the season.Figures 14, 17, 20 and 23 were adjusted to account for the leap week in 2020. Finally, the number of ECMO admissions in the 2017 to 2018 season was updated to include an additional case added retrospectively. These amendments do not affect the epidemiological interpretation of the data. Hospitalisations Through SARI Watch, a total of 8,751 hospitalised confirmed influenza cases were reported by 45 participating sentinel NHS acute trusts in England from week 40 2022 to week 15 2023. This compares with 1,093 hospitalised cases in the previous season (from week 40 2021 to week 15 in 2022) reported by 41 trusts, the total increasing to 1,710 cases over a one-year surveillance period to week 39 2022. In the 2020 to 2021 season the number of cases were 40 from week 40 2020 to week 15 2021 reported by 58 trusts, increasing to 64 cases over a one-year period to week 39 2020. In the pre-pandemic seasons, surveillance was from week 40 to week 20 in the following year. In 2019 to 2020 the number of hospitalised cases of confirmed influenza was 4,916 reported by 21 sentinel trusts. In the 2018 to 2019 this was 5,675 cases reported by 23 sentinel trusts. In 2017 to 2018 there were 10,080 cases reported by 26 sentinel trusts. Note that since the last report, retrospective updates for previous seasons are included. The cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 15 was 87.25 per 100,000 trust catchment population in 2022 to 2023. This compares to a cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 15 of 9.03 per 100,000 in 2021 to 2022, 0.30 per 100,000 in 2020 to 2021, 47.22 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 51.06 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 83.13 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. The number of influenza hospitalisations in acute NHS trusts in England including admissions to critical care (ICU or HDU) was estimated by applying the weekly influenza hospitalisation rate to the latest England population. The result per week was summed. Between week 40 2022 to week 15 2023, the estimated number of admissions due to confirmed influenza in England was 49,300 (95% CI: 48,200 to 50,300). This compares with an estimated 8,400 cases in England in 2021 to 2022 (one year to week 39) and 300 in 2020 to 2021 (one year to week 40). In the pre-pandemic seasons from week 40 to week 20 in the following year, the estimated number was 26,700 in 2019 to 2020, 29,800 in 2018 to 2020 and 47,200 in 2017 to 2018. These estimates are based on case confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or molecular point of care. There is the assumption of trust representation in terms region and trust type. However, among 45 reporting trusts in the sentinel scheme in 2022 to 2023, there was under representation of small acute trusts as well as trusts from the Midlands and North East. In the 2022 to 2023 season, hospital admission rates for confirmed influenza started to increase several weeks earlier than in previous pre-pandemic seasons. For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza hospitalisation rates breached the medium (2.62 to less than 8.68 per 100,000 trust catchment population) and high (8.68 to less than 14.74 per 100,000 trust catchment population) impact ranges. The peak was the highest observed since surveillance began which also breached the very high impact range (14.74 per 100,000 trust catchment population). The rate returned to baseline levels continuously from week 9 2023 (Figure 14). The unusual shape of the epidemic wave in the 2022 to 2023 season (characterised by early increases, sharp increases, a high peak followed by steep decreases) could partly be due a step change in case ascertainment as well as potentially reflecting a rebound season in a population with higher-than-usual susceptibility, with higher transmission leading to more hospital activity, and the higher impact of A(H3N2) on older adults. COVID-19 control measures resulted in unprecedented low activity in 2020 to 2021 (one surveillance year from week 40 2020 to week 39 2021). In 2021 to 2022 (one surveillance year), influenza hospitalisations rebounded later (in week 10 2022) although the rate was similar to activity at the start of typical influenza season. The rate peaked at 1.15 per 100,000 in week 14 2022 taking it from baseline level to the low impact range before returning to baseline. Influenza admissions continued to be seen throughout summer 2022. Weekly confirmed influenza hospitalisation rates to sentinel hospital trusts in England since winter 2010 are shown in Figure 17. Figure 14: Weekly overall influenza hospital admission rates per 100,000 trust catchment population (with thresholds) and number of influenza hospital admissions to sentinel trusts, SARI Watch, England Figure 15 shows the distribution of 8,751 sentinel influenza hospital admissions reported up to week 15 2022 by subtypeype and age group. Overall, 608 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 648 were influenza A(H3N2), 6,250 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 1,245 were influenza B (Figure 15). Influenza B became a more common cause of admission than influenza A from week 5 2023 as the overall number of influenza A hospitalisations decreased considerably since the peak in week 51 2022. A late season rise in influenza B hospitalisations mainly affected those aged 15 to 44 years. It should be noted that the high proportion of influenza A that is unsubtyped may reflect increase in the use of rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) used at the point of care as well as longer standing use of laboratory NAATs that do not include subtyping. Overall, of the total influenza A hospitalised cases in 2022 to 2023, 83% (6,250 out of 7,506) were not subtyped, ranging from 64% (58 out of 91) in 6 to 11 months to 91% (800 out of 878) in those aged 85 years and over. The subtyping data is used for public health surveillance and allows a more complete picture of circulating subtypes affecting severe cases in particular. Hospital trusts are encouraged to perform influenza subtyping locally where possible or regionally and to integrate results into local information systems. Figure 15: Cumulative number of influenza hospital admissions by influenza subtypeype and age group, SARI Watch sentinel surveillance, England, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 Figure 16: Rate of influenza hospitalisations by age group, SARI Watch sentinel surveillance week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 Figure 17: Weekly all-age rate of confirmed influenza hospital admissions to sentinel trusts, 2010 to 2023, England Scotland Scottish influenza hospital admissions are calculated by linking the Rapid Preliminary Inpatient Dataset (RAPID) emergency or non-injury hospital admissions to positive Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS) test results. RAPID captures all hospital admissions. The ECOSS data set provides all laboratory test data for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV) in Scotland. Linkage is performed by linking the Community Health Index (CHI) number with the admission date to the ECOSS test results and test date. Cases counted in the hospital admission totals for these pathogens are defined as those admitted to hospital, appearing in RAPID and testing positive for influenza (appearing in ECOSS with a test/specimen date) within 14 days prior or 48 hours post RAPID admission date. A total of 6,693 hospitalised confirmed influenza admissions was reported from 14 regional NHS boards in Scotland from week 40 2022 to week 15 2023. This compares to 553 hospital admissions in the previous season (from week 40 2021 to week 15 in 2022), the total increasing to 1,140 admissions over a one-year surveillance period to week 39 2022. In the 2020 to 2021 season, the number of admissions from week 40 2020 to week 15 2021 was 62, the total increasing to 91 admissions over a one-year period to week 39 2021. In the pre-pandemic seasons, surveillance was from week 40 to week 20 in the following year. In 2019 to 2020, the number of hospital admissions of confirmed influenza was 3,741. In 2018 to 2019, there were 4,482 admissions. In 2017 to 2018, there were 9,158 admissions. Figure 18 shows the distribution of 6,693 influenza hospital admissions reported up to week 15 2023 by subtypeype. Overall, 482 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 975 were influenza A(H3N2), 4,975 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 261 were influenza B. Figure 18. Weekly number of patients admitted to a hospital as an emergency positive for influenza, by influenza subtype, Scotland, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 The hospital admission rate for patients who tested positive for influenza reported in week 51 and 52 2022 (24.5 per 100,000 and 23.8 per 100,000 respectively) were higher than those reported for any week since the 2016 to 2017 season (Figure 19). Figure 19. Weekly hospital admission rate (including ICU/HDU) for influenza, Scotland, 2016 to 2023 ICU or HDU admissions Through SARI Watch, a total of 1,681 critical care (ICU or HDU) confirmed influenza admissions were reported from 108 NHS acute trusts across England from week 40 2022 to week 15 2023. This compares with 182 admissions in the previous season (from week 40 2021 to week 15 in 2022) reported by 114 trusts, the total increasing to 316 admissions over a one-year period to week 39 2022. In the 2020 to 2021 season the number of admissions were 9 from week 40 2020 to week 15 2021 reported by 129 trusts, increasing to 15 admissions over a one-year period to week 39 2020. In the pre-pandemic seasons, surveillance was from week 40 to week 20 in the following year. In 2019 to 2020 the number of critical care cases of confirmed influenza was 1,671, 3,017 cases in 2018 to 2019 and 3,247 cases in 2017 to 2018. ICU or HDU admission rates for confirmed influenza started to increase earlier compared with pre-pandemic seasons. The rate crossed the threshold for the medium impact range (0.18 per 100,000 trust catchment population) for the first time since the 2019 to 2020 season. The rate peaked in week 51 2022 at 0.65 admissions per 100,000 (Figure 20), occurring 2 to 3 weeks earlier than the peaks in the 2018 to 2019 and 2017 to 2018 seasons. Of the 1,681 influenza ICU or HDU admissions reported up to week 15 2022, 143 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 121 were influenza A(H3N2), 1,208 were influenza A (not subtyped) and 209 were influenza B (Figure 21). Influenza B admission numbers exceeded influenza A admissions later in the season (from week 10 2023) as influenza A admissions decreased. A high proportion of influenza A remain unsubtyped. Of all influenza A ICU or HDU cases in 2022 to 2023, 82% (1,208 out of 1,472) were not subtyped, ranging from 71% in 6 months or younger to 88% in 55 to 64 years. The surveillance on influenza ICU or HDU admissions includes a separate collection for influenza fatalities in ICU or HDU as an indication of severity near real time for use in conjunction with other severity indicators such as excess mortality. There were 139 fatalities reported among influenza cases admitted to ICU or HDU reported from to week 40 2022. Of these, 9 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 11 were influenza A(H3N2), 97 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 22 were influenza B. Patients aged 65 years or over made up the largest group in ICU and HDU influenza fatal case reporting (47% of fatal cases). Weekly confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admission rates in England since winter 2011 are shown in Figure 23. Figure 20: Weekly influenza ICU or HDU admission rates per 100,000 trust catchment population (with thresholds) and number of influenza ICU or HDU admissions, SARI Watch, England Figure 21: Cumulative number of influenza ICU or HDU admissions by influenza subtype and age group, SARI Watch, England, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 Figure 22: Rate of influenza ICU or HDU admissions by age group, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 Figure 23: Weekly all-age rate of confirmed influenza ICU or HDU admissions, 2011 to 2023, England Scotland There were 350 confirmed influenza admissions to ICU or HDU in Scotland between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023. Among these there were 263 influenza A(not subtyped), 54 influenza A(H3N2), 24 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 influenza B (Figure 24). Patients admitted to ICU or HDU with recently confirmed influenza are identified from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG) that collects detailed patient level data on all patients in ICU or HDU across Scotland. Additional information on patients with laboratory confirmed influenza is collected through ICU enhanced surveillance forms. All patients that are admitted to ICU or HDU with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before the ICU or HDU admission and the ICU or HDU discharge date are included. Where the discharge date is missing, any patients with a positive influenza test result within a period of 14 days before ICU or HDU admission and 7 days after ICU or HDU admission are included. Figure 24a: Weekly number of laboratory-confirmed influenza ICU or HDU cases, Scotland, 2022 to 2023 Figure 24b: Weekly crude rate of admissions, Scotland, 2021 to 2023 Wales Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 there were 103 influenza admissions to ICU or HDU in Wales. Of these, 40 were influenza A(H3N2), 39 were influenza A(unknown subtype), 21 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 were influenza B. Northern Ireland Critical care data for the 2022 to 2023 season is not available. RSV England collates data on confirmed hospitalised RSV cases through the SARI Watch surveillance system. For RSV, this is a sentinel surveillance system. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, a total of 2,435 confirmed RSV cases (2,285 hospitalised to lower level of care and 150 admitted to ICU or HDU) were reported from 35 participating sentinel trusts. The cumulative admission rate between week 40 and week 15 was 32.18 per 100,000 trust catchment population in 2022 to 2023. This compares to 19.19 per 100,000 in 2021 to 2022 for the same interval (31.18 per 100,000 based on one-year surveillance to week 39). The rate was 0.31 per 100,000 in 2020 to 2021 up to week 15 2021 (30.57 per 100,000 based on one-year surveillance to week 39). In the pre-pandemic seasons (from week 40 to week 20 in the following year the cumulative rates were: 48.23 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 41.66 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 45.29 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. It is important to note the seasonal displacement of RSV transmission observed after the easing of COVID-19 control measures. RSV hospitalisations rebounded in the summer of 2021 following unprecedented low activity in 2020 to 2021. The overall hospital admission rate peaked in week 31 2021 at 2.77 per 100,000 followed by small decreases causing prolonged activity into the following season. The decline of the RSV hospitalisation rate continued into the winter of 2021 to 2022. The rate rebounded in the summer of 2022 but not as strongly as the previous summer, peaking in week 23 2022 to 0.81 per 100,000 followed by a prolonged period of slow declines. By the 2022 to 2023 season however, RSV hospitalisations resumed a seasonal pattern peaking in week 47 2022 to 3.12 per 100,000, although this peak was lower than in pre-pandemic seasons. For comparison, peak weekly admission rates for RSV (lower level of care and ICU or HDU) were observed at 5.28 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 4.67 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 4.06 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 25). Figure 25: Weekly hospitalised RSV case rate per 100,000 trust catchment population, England, 2018 to 2023 Children under the age of 5 years are most affected by RSV with substantially high hospitalisation rates. Those aged 65 years and over have the next highest burden. In the 2022 to 2023 season, the RSV hospitalisation rate for children aged under 5 years peaked at 35.93 per 100,000 in week 47 2022 (Figure 26). The epidemic curve in 2022 to 2023 for those under 5 years followed a typical seasonal pattern in contrast to the 2 preceding seasons. In 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022, the burden was displaced to the summer following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions (thus allowing some other respiratory viruses to circulate). In 2020 to 2021, the rate in this age group peaked at 36.34 per 100,000 in week 31 2021 followed by a prolonged period of slow decreases through the winter. In 2021 to 2022 the rate started to surge from week 20 2022 but this was at lower level and prolonged until a more conventional seasonal pattern resumed in 2022 to 2023. For comparison to pre-pandemic years, the RSV hospitalisation rate in those under 5 years peaked at 56.73 per 100,000 in week 51 of the 2019 to 2020 season and at 67.37 per 100,000 in week 48 in 2018 to 2019, and at 56.38 per 100,000 in week 46 in 2017 to 2018. In 2022 to 2023, from week 40 to week 15 inclusive, there were 1,393 RSV hospitalisations (lower level of care or ICU or HDU admissions) to SARI Watch sentinel trusts in those aged under 5 years. Of these, 67.7% (943) were in children aged under 1 year, including 741 aged 6 months or younger. Figure 26: Rate of RSV hospitalisation in those aged under 5 years per 100,000 trust catchment population by week of admission and season, sentinel data from acute NHS trusts, England, 2018 to 2023 The rate for those aged 65 years and over peaked at 4.64 per 100,000 in week 51 2022, later than the peak among children aged under 5 years. For those aged 85 years and over the rate peaked at 16.56 per 100,000 in week 51 2022. In pre-pandemic seasons the rate for the elderly (65 years and over) was 6.93 per 100,000 in 2019 to 2020, 6.07 per 100,000 in 2018 to 2019 and 3.77 per 100,000 in 2017 to 2018. These also peaked later than the peaks for children aged under 5 years. Scotland Scottish RSV hospital admissions are calculated by linking the Rapid Preliminary Inpatient Dataset (RAPID) emergency or non-injury hospital admissions to positive ECOSS test results. RAPID captures all hospital admissions. The ECOSS data set provides all laboratory test data for respiratory viruses (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV) in Scotland. Linkage is performed by linking the Community Health Index (CHI) number with the admission date to the ECOSS test results and test date. Cases counted in the hospital admission totals for these pathogens are defined as those admitted to hospital, appearing in RAPID and testing positive (appearing in ECOSS with a test/specimen date) within 14 days prior or 48 hours post RAPID admission date. A total of 3,182 hospitalised confirmed RSV admissions were reported from 14 regional NHS boards in Scotland from week 40 2022 to week 15 2023. This compares to 1,014 hospital admissions in the previous season (from week 40 2021 to week 15 in 2022), the total increasing to 2,649 admissions over a one-year surveillance period to week 39 2022. In the 2020 to 2021 season, the number of admissions from week 40 2020 to week 15 2021 was 161, the total increasing to 1,665 admissions over a one-year period to week 39 2021. In the pre-pandemic seasons, surveillance was from week 40 to week 20 in the following year. In 2019 to 2020, the number of hospital admissions of confirmed RSV was 4,184. In 2018 to 2019, there were 3,632 admissions. In 2017 to 2018, there were 3,593 admissions. Figure 27. Weekly hospital admission rate (including ICU and HDU) per 100,000 for RSV, Scotland, 2018 to 2023 The trend in the spread of laboratory-confirmed RSV admissions from 2022 to 2023 does not follow the typical seasonal pattern observed in previous respiratory winter seasons. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 the highest rate of RSV hospital admissions for those under the age of 5 occurred in week 46 2022 (59.9 per 100,000). In the previous season, the peak was higher and occurred in week 40 2021 (66.9 per 100,000). Figure 28. Weekly hospital admission rate (including ICU and HDU) per 100,000 for RSV in children under 5 years, Scotland, 2021 to 2023 ECMO admissions The UKHSA collects data on every adult patient admitted to a severe respiratory failure (SRF) centre, for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or other advanced respiratory support, whether or not the primary cause is known to be infection related. There are 7 SRF centres in the UK (6 in England and 1 in Scotland) participating in the UKHSA ECMO surveillance module. One of the SRF centres joined the surveillance from the 2022 to 2023 season. Surveillance is all year round. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 there were 106 admissions to SRF centres requiring ECMO in the UK (Figure 29). Of these, 39 were for laboratory-confirmed influenza (19 influenza A (not subtyped), 8 influenza A(H3N2), 6 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 6 influenza B cases). There were 4 influenza admissions to SRF centres in 2021 to 2022. There were no influenza admissions in 2020 to 2021. In pre-pandemic seasons, there were 37 influenza admissions to adult SRF centres in 2019 to 2020, 110 in 2018 to 2019 and 62 in 2017 to 2018. Figure 29: Laboratory confirmed ECMO admissions in adults (COVID-19, influenza and non-COVID-19 confirmed) to Severe Respiratory Failure centres in the UK, week 16 2021 to week 15 2023 Microbiological surveillance Influenza The Respiratory Datamart system began during the 2009 influenza pandemic to collate all laboratory testing information in England. It is now used as a sentinel laboratory surveillance tool, monitoring all major respiratory viruses in England. Sixteen laboratories in England reported data for this season. Overall influenza positivity showed an increased level of activity between week 40 of 2022 and week 15 of 2023, with peak positivity much higher than that seen in the 2021 to 2022 season and comparable to (slightly exceeding) recent pre-pandemic seasons. The majority of detections were influenza A, with increased late detections of influenza B observed. Of the detected influenza A viruses that were subtyped, the majority were influenza A(H3N2). A gradual increase in overall influenza positivity was observed from week 40 of 2022, rising to 31.8% in week 51 of 2022 before declining. Early season positivity (weeks 40 to 46) was above that of pre-pandemic seasons. Influenza B positivity showed a late-season increase to levels between 0.9% and 1.7% between week 52 2022 and week 15 2023. Comparatively, in the 2021 to 2022 season, detections of all influenza through Respiratory DataMart were much lower, never reaching more than 5.8% of samples tested. This compares to peak positivity of 25.3% in 2019 to 2020 and 28.6% in 2018 to 2019 season (Figure 30). Figure 30a: Weekly influenza swab percentage positivity through Respiratory Datamart sentinel laboratories in England, 2017 to 2023 Figure 30b: Weekly number of influenza detections by subtype through Respiratory Datamart sentinel laboratories in England, 2022 to 2023 The weekly count of confirmed cases by each major type or subtype of influenza through Respiratory DataMart from winter 2010 onwards is shown in Figure 31. Figure 31: Weekly number of influenza detections by subtype through Respiratory Datamart in England, with overall percentage positivity, 2010 to 2023 Scotland In Scotland, overall influenza positivity is reported through non-sentinel sources via ECOSS. There have been high numbers of influenza diagnoses recorded to date this season with a total of 14,094 samples testing positive for influenza between week 40 of 2022 and week 15 of 2023. Overall influenza positivity peaked at 33.6% in week 51 of 2022 (Figure 32). Swab positivity for influenza is an estimate of underlying national positivity, as the actual number of negative tests for influenza was not available for the 2022 to 2023 season. Figure 32a: Weekly ECOSS influenza positivity by influenza subtype from week 40 of 2022 to week 15 of 2023, Scotland Figure 32b: Weekly number positive by influenza subtype from week 40 of 2022 to week 15 of 2023, Scotland Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) From week 40 2022 to week 15 2022, RSV detections reported through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance system in England showed a similar seasonality as in pre-COVID pandemic seasons but at slightly lower levels. Positivity peaked at 12.4% in week 47 2022. This compares with positivity peaks of 13.4% in 2019 to 2020 and 21.5% in 2018 to 2019 (Figure 33). Surveillance of RSV is ongoing with further data of current trends published in the weekly national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report. Figure 33: Weekly overall RSV swab percentage positivity and number of detections through Respiratory DataMart in England, 2018 to 2023 In Scotland, RSV was the second most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogen detected through ECOSS for the 2022 to 2023 season (up to week 15 2023), contributing to 30.5% of all positive samples. Other seasonal respiratory viruses Of the other respiratory viruses monitored through the respiratory DataMart system, the highest levels of positivity were observed with rhinovirus throughout the season. Rhinovirus positivity was highest at the beginning of the season and then decreased and fluctuated between 8% and 18% positivity through the rest of the season, with lower activity levels seen between week 51 2022 and week 3 2023 (Figure 34). Consistent with previous seasons, low levels of adenovirus were observed throughout the season with no clear seasonality seen, although positivity was slightly elevated between weeks 1 and 8 of 2023. Parainfluenza positivity remained relatively low overall for 2022 to 2023 season. It started to increase slowly from week 5 2023, and by the data cut-off time for this report (week 15 2023) it had been showing increased activity with a peak of 6.5% in week 14 which was slightly higher and earlier than the 2021 to 2022 season peak of 4.7% in week 24 2022. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) activity in 2022 to 2023 was generally lower than that in the 2021 to 2022 season and peaked at 5.2% in week 52 2022, compared with the peak of 10.3% in week 49 2021 in the 2021 to 2022 season (Figure 34). Figure 34a: Weekly number of positive samples and proportion positive for adenovirus, DataMart sentinel laboratories, England, 2018 to 2023.

Figure 34d: Weekly number of positive samples and proportion positive for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), DataMart sentinel laboratories, England, 2018 to 2023. In Scotland, the pattern of non-influenza respiratory pathogens detected through ECOSS for 2022 to the 2023 season (up to week 15, 2022), was more comparable to pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons than the 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 seasons. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogen detected through non-sentinel sources (ECOSS) for the 2022 to 2023 season (up to week 15, 2022), contributing to 33.2% of positive samples. RSV was the second most common (30.5% of positive samples) followed by adenovirus (14.1% of positive samples), hMPV (8.3% of positive samples), coronavirus (non-SARS-CoV-2) (8.2% of positive samples), and parainfluenza (5.6% of positive samples). In Wales, of the 54,280 testing episodes in hospital patients that had a sample collected from a hospital setting, all were tested for influenza and RSV, with 54.7% (29,682 out of 54,280) tested for all respiratory pathogens and 27.7% (n=15,014/54,280) tested for influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 only. The most commonly detected non-influenza respiratory pathogens were SARS-CoV-2 (20.9%, 8,197 out of 54,280) and rhinovirus (15.1%, 5,942 out of 39,266). Other detected causes of respiratory infection included: adenovirus (7.3%, 2,862 out of 39,266) enterovirus (3.3%, 1,292 out of 39,266) seasonal coronavirus (4.5%, 1,772 out of 39,266) hMPV (4.2%, 1,667 out of 39,266) parainfluenza (3.3%, 1,296 out of 39,266) RSV (6.75%, 3,665 out of 54,280) Mycoplasma pneumoniae (0.01%, 3 out of 39,266) Seventy-one per cent (10,734 out of 15,014) of patients tested for all 9 routinely screened pathogens were negative, and from the patients that were only tested for influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2, 43.9% (17,219 out of 39,266) were negative for all 3 pathogens. Preceding, co- and secondary respiratory infections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza The surveillance of preceding, co- and secondary infections with COVID-19 in England began as part of UKHSA’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular reporting in the National flu and COVID-19 surveillance report began in late 2020. The workstream aims to provide rapid detection and timely surveillance of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens acquired in conjunction with COVID-19. This workstream was expanded to include the surveillance of pathogens acquired in conjunction with influenza in 2022. Seasonal respiratory virus co-infections are defined as a patient with a sample testing positive for the viral organism and another sample testing positive for either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza within one day before or after the viral organism positive date. Preceding and secondary infection definitions for these organisms are defined as the pathogen occurring 2 to 28 days pre- or post- SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infection. Please note that undertesting of pathogens may result in an underestimate of preceding, co- and secondary infection cases. Furthermore, children receiving LAIV in the preceding 14 days prior to swabbing may result in positive influenza detection in the absence of infection. Full preceding, co- and secondary infection definitions are available in Appendix 1 of the National flu and COVID-19 surveillance graphs packs. Seasonal respiratory viral pathogens acquired in conjunction with SARS-CoV-2 A total of 5,790 pre-, co- and secondary infections were detected across all seasonal respiratory viruses among persons with COVID-19 in the 2022 to 2023 season in England, via the Respiratory DataMart and SGSS systems. Of which, 3,879 were defined as co-infections, 951 as preceding and 960 as secondary to a COVID-19 infection. These numbers are an increase to the previous 2021 to 2022 season (Figure 35). Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, 1,926 co-infections of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 and 296 co-infections of influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 were identified in England. A total of 527 preceding and 461 secondary influenza A infections were reported in comparison with 50 preceding and 44 secondary influenza B infections. These numbers are a considerable increase on last season, where between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, 86 influenza A co-infections and 35 influenza B co-infections were recorded. Over the same period, there were 56 preceding and 82 secondary influenza A infections, and 23 preceding and 18 secondary influenza B infections recorded. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, the most frequent viral organisms (preceding, co- or secondary infections) identified from respiratory specimens among persons with COVID-19 were influenza A, RSV and influenza B (Figure 36). Influenza A was the most commonly detected pre-, co- and secondary infection accounting for 50.3% of all pre-, co- and secondary infections, followed by RSV which accounted for 20.0%. Figure 35: Weekly number of respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with COVID-19 diagnosed in England, 2021 to 2023 Figure 36: Most frequent respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with COVID-19 diagnosed in England between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 Seasonal respiratory viral pathogens acquired in conjunction with influenza Please note, the base infection is any type of influenza (A, B, or both) for all viral preceding, co- and secondary infections, except for influenza B where the base infection is influenza A. A total of 4,436 pre-, co- and secondary infections were detected across all seasonal respiratory viruses among persons with influenza in the 2022 to 2023 season in England, via the Respiratory DataMart and SGSS systems. Of which, 3,196 were defined as co-infections, 681 as preceding and 559 as secondary to an influenza infection. These numbers are an increase compared with the previous 2021 to 2022 season (Figure 37). Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, 593 respiratory viral co-infections of influenza B and influenza A were identified in England. A total of 38 preceding and 47 secondary influenza B infections with influenza A were reported. These numbers remain low but are an increase on last season, where between week 40 2021 and week 14 2022, 397 co-infections of influenza B and influenza A were recorded. There were 2 preceding and 2 secondary influenza B infections with influenza A recorded. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, the most frequent viral organisms (preceding, co- or secondary infections) identified from respiratory specimens among persons with influenza were RSV, influenza B and rhinovirus (Figure 38). RSV was the most commonly detected pre-, co- and secondary infection accounting for 38.1% of all pre-, co- and secondary infections, followed by influenza B which accounted for 15.3%. Figure 37: Weekly number of respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with influenza diagnosed in England, 2021 to 2023. Figure 38: Most frequent respiratory viral specimens, by timing of diagnosis, in persons with influenza diagnosed in England between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 Please note the baseline infection is any type of influenza (influenza A or B or both) for all viral preceding/co-/secondary infections except for influenza B where the baseline infection is influenza A. Sentinel GP-based swabbing In England, influenza activity through the GP sentinel swabbing scheme in collaboration with the RCGP was higher overall in comparison with the previous season, with a total of 1,385 positive samples between week 40 of 2022 and week 15 of 2023. Activity began to increase in week 45 of 2022. Influenza A(H3N2) accounted for the majority of positive influenza specimens (Figure 39). Figure 39: Number of influenza positive samples and weekly positivity (%) by influenza type, England, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023. Broader virological swab positivity is depicted in Figure 40. For non-flu pathogens detected through the RCGP sentinel swabbing scheme, rhinovirus was the most detected respiratory pathogen between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023 in England (32.4% of total positive specimens). Influenza comprised 19.0% of the total respiratory pathogens detected in the swabbing scheme. This was followed by SARS-CoV-2 at 11.6% of total positive specimens, and RSV at 10.4% of total positive specimens. Other respiratory pathogens include seasonal coronavirus (7.9%), hMPV (7.2%), adenovirus (7.1%) and enterovirus (4.4%). Figure 40 : Number of positive samples by pathogen, England, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 In Scotland, the Community Acute Respiratory Infection (CARI) surveillance programme tests for a range of respiratory pathogens: SARS-CoV-2 influenza A and B RSV adenovirus coronavirus (non-SARS CoV-2) HMPV rhinovirus parainfluenza Mycoplasma pneumoniae Between week 40 of 2022 and week 15 of 2023 there were 1,478 detections of influenza through GP sentinel swabbing, 763 of which were influenza A(H3N2), 399 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 197 were influenza A(not subtyped), 112 were influenza B and 7 were co-infections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2). For non-flu pathogens, rhinovirus was the most commonly detected respiratory pathogen detected through sentinel sources (CARI) for the 2022 to 2023 season (up to week 15, 2023), contributing to 24.4% of positives for non-influenza respiratory pathogens. RSV was the second most common non-influenza pathogen (8.5% of positive samples) followed by SARS-CoV-2 (7.9% of positive samples), coronavirus (non-SARS-CoV-2) (6.9% of positive samples), HMPV (6.2% of positive samples), adenovirus (5.8% of positive samples), parainfluenza (4.0% of positive samples) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (0.2% of positive samples). Figure 41 includes individual pathogens and total samples, in addition to coinfections as some samples tested positive for more than one pathogen (ranging from 0.4% to 13.6% coinfections weekly within the season). Figure 41: Number of CARI samples and positives by pathogen, Scotland, week 40 2022 to week 15 2023 In Northern Ireland, 39 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2022 to 2023 season through GP sentinel swabbing. Sixteen tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 12 for influenza B, 10 for influenza A(H3N2) and one for influenza A(not subtyped). In Wales, 383 specimens tested positive for influenza during the 2022 to 2023 season through GP sentinel swabbing. Of these, 232 were influenza A(H3N2), 97 were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 29 were influenza A(not subtyped) and 25 were influenza B. Virus characterisation UKHSA characterises the properties of influenza viruses through one or more tests, including genome sequencing (genetic analysis) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (antigenic analysis). This data is used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the strains included in seasonal influenza vaccines, and to monitor for changes in circulating influenza viruses. The interpretation of genetic and antigenic data sources is complex due to a number of factors, for example, not all viruses can be cultivated in sufficient quantity for antigenic characterisation, so that viruses with sequence information may not be able to be antigenically characterised as well. Occasionally, this can lead to a biased view of the properties of circulating viruses, as the viruses which can be recovered and analysed antigenically may not be fully representative of majority variants, and genetic characterisation data does not always predict the antigenic characterisation. Between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, the UKHSA Respiratory Virus Unit have genetically characterised, by sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, 2563 influenza A viruses (1694 A(H3N2) and 869 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses) and 147 influenza B viruses. The 1,694 influenza A(H3N2) viruses genetically characterised, all belong in the genetic subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2022 to 2023 influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain (an A/Darwin/9/2021-like virus) also belongs in this 3C.2a1b.2a.2 genetic subclade. Sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene shows that these A(H3N2) viruses belong in subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2; defined by the amino acid changes Y159N, T160I(-CHO), L164Q, G186D, D190N, F193S and Y195F in the HA gene. Approximately 60% of characterised A(H3N2) viruses have the additional HA substitution H156S (3C.2a1b.2a.2a), of which two-thirds had D53G (subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1 and 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.2), one-third had D53N (subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.3) and a small proportion (<5%) had D53S. Approximately 40% of viruses that retained H156 all clustered into the group with E50K, F79V, I140K amino acid substitutions (subclade 3C.2a1b.2a.2b). These groups within the 2a.2 subclade circulated continuously over the season, with limited change in proportion over time. The 869 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterised to date this season, all belong in genetic subgroup 6B.1A.5a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2022 to 2023 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain (an A/Victoria/2570/2019-like virus) also belongs in genetic subclade 6B.1A.5a, within the 6B.1A.5a.2 cluster. Almost 80% of viruses characterised by sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene possessed the additional amino acid substitutions of P137S, K142R, D260E, T277A, E356D and N451H (subclade 6B.1A.5a.2a.1). This 80:20 ratio was maintained throughout the season. In community surveillance, 6B.1A.5a.2a.1 viruses were present at less than 90% at the start of the season in October 2022 and accounted for the greatest proportion of viruses (less than 60%) throughout the season. The vaccine strains selected for the Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine 2023 to 2024 are clade 6B.1A.5a.2a.1 viruses. The 147 influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses that have been genetically characterised, all belonging in subclade V1A3, within the subgroup V1A3a.2. The Northern Hemisphere 2022 to 2023 influenza B/Victoria lineage vaccine strain (a B/Austria/1359417/2021-like virus) also belongs in this V1A3a.2 subclade/group. The Respiratory Virus Unit has confirmed by genome sequencing the detection of LAIV viruses in 2 influenza A positive samples and 9 influenza B positive samples collected since week 40 2022, all from children aged between 2 and 16 years of age, consistent with known shedding characteristics of LAIV viruses as detailed in laboratory guidance. Virus characterisation in Scotland is performed by the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WoSSVC) throughout the influenza season. This data is published in the weekly National respiratory infection report. Influenza antiviral susceptibility Influenza positive samples are genome sequenced and screened for mutations in the virus neuraminidase (NA) and the cap-dependent endonuclease (PA) genes known to confer neuraminidase inhibitor or baloxavir resistance, respectively. The samples tested are routinely obtained for surveillance purposes, but diagnostic testing of patients suspected to be infected with antiviral-resistant virus is also performed. Influenza virus sequences from samples collected between weeks 40 2022 and 17 2023 have been analysed. Analysis of 1,494 A(H3N2) viruses by sequencing found 2 oseltamivir resistant viruses. One oseltamivir resistant virus with an E119V amino acid substitution present as a mixed population (80% E119V) was collected from an adult, post-oseltamivir treatment, in January 2023. An R292K mutation was detected transiently, in a viral subpopulation (25%), and was undetectable in a sample taken 9 days later, while the E119V mutation was maintained over 19 days. The patient was not treated with zanamivir. A second oseltamivir resistant virus with an E119V amino acid substitution (100% E119V) was collected from an immune compromised adult in February 2023. Follow-up of this case is ongoing. Of 808 A(H1N1)pdm09 NA sequences analysed, one oseltamivir resistant virus with an H275Y amino acid substitution present as a mixed population (80% H275Y) was detected. The sample was collected from an immune compromised adult, post oseltamivir treatment, in December 2022. No viruses with known markers of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors were detected in 141 influenza B NA sequences analysed.

Due to the mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic from late March 2020, and very little influenza circulation in 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 winters, FluMOMO was not run in those years. In winter 2022 to 2023 there was a concentrated period of influenza activity, as well as a spike in all-cause mortality. There was also Omicron-variant COVID-19 circulation and several periods of severe cold weather or cold snaps. To estimate the contribution of these factors to the detected excess mortality, FluMOMO was adapted. A working paper detailing the adapted methodology used provides further information. Note that these are new methods and the findings should be considered experimental statistics. Furthermore, one of the adaptions to prevent undue influence of COVID-19 on trends required assigning a period of time covering the first 2 COVID-19 waves no weight in the model. This meant that for the 2021 to 2022 winter the excess was not attributed. Figure 42 shows the weekly number of all-age deaths and attribution to influenza, COVID-19 and extreme temperature from week 40 2012 to week 13, 2023. The model demonstrates the winter 2022 to 2023 spike in mortality is predominantly attributed to influenza (red line), and partly attributed to COVID-19 (blue) and cold weather (green) (Figure 42, Table 3 and Table 4). Influenza-related mortality for winter 2022 to 2023 is estimated at nearly 15,000 which is higher than that seen in the previous 4 years, but lower than the 2014 to 2015, 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 seasons (Table 4). The feature of the 2022 to 2023 winter season was the concentrated period of high activity which supports attribution in the model. While the model also produces estimates of the contribution of cold weather and COVID-19 to all-cause mortality, these estimates are less reliable because Omicron COVID-19 has not shown large spikes and the effects of cold weather are assumed to spread across the week of the cold weather and the following 2 weeks. For temperature-related mortality, the 5,500 estimate is based on 3 cold weeks (with mean central England temperature below 3°C) and is the highest since 2012 to 2013. This estimate is contingent on the definition of cold used. If the threshold for cold was changed to assign more weeks as cold weeks, it is likely more deaths would be attributed to severe cold weather; however, the aim was to look at extreme cold weather only.

Vaccination Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in adults Although all countries of the UK use standardised specifications to extract vaccine uptake data from IT information systems in primary care (GP system suppliers), there are some differences in extraction specifications, so comparisons should be made with caution. England In England, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by UKHSA throughout the season based on weekly and monthly extracts from GP system suppliers via ImmForm for the cohorts primarily delivered via the GP practice. Cumulative uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 28 February 2023 was reported from 97.1% (6,257 out of 6,447) of GP practices in England in 2022 to 2023. Comparative data is up to 28 February 2022 where vaccine uptake was reported from 97.1% (6,355 out of 6,542) of GP practices in England in 2021 to 2022. This season saw a vaccine uptake of 79.9% in those aged 65 years and over (compared with 82.3% in 2021 to 2022) and 49.1% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with one or more underlying clinical risk factors (excluding pregnant women without other risk factors and carers), compared with 52.9% in 2021 to 2022 (Table 5). Vaccine uptake in pregnant women was 35.0%, compared with 37.9 % in 2021 to 2022. In the 2022 to 2023 season, the programme was extended for a third season to include all 50 to under 65 year olds not at risk. Vaccine uptake in this group was 40.6%, but data between seasons for this age group is not directly comparable with the 2020 to 2021 season due to the current season eligibility starting 6 weeks later than last season. Scotland In Scotland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of: aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk 2 to 5 years not at school primary and secondary school pupils pregnant women weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS), which contains individual-level data for adults eligible for flu vaccine, and for one NHS board, the data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes At this time, the vaccine uptake data reported is not comparable with previous years which reflects the improvements in data recording but also changes in how uptake has been determined in some cohorts. By the end of week 15 2023, a total of 1,843,781 influenza vaccines were delivered to adults currently resident in Scotland corresponding to a 63.7% uptake. Among adults aged 65 years and older, 85.5% have been vaccinated against influenza during the current vaccination programme. Among at-risk groups, 56.9% have been vaccinated against influenza. Figures (numerators and denominators) are representative of the current living Scottish population of each respective eligible cohort. Deaths and leavers from Scotland have been removed. Data is presented in Scotland’s weekly national respiratory report. Wales In Wales, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored on a weekly basis by PHW throughout the season based on automated weekly extracts of Read coded data using software installed in all general practices in Wales collected through the Audit+ Data Quality System. Cumulative uptake data on influenza vaccinations administered were received from 99% of GP practices in Wales in 2022 to 2023 (2 GP practices were excluded due to data quality issues and may be included at a later date). This showed a vaccine uptake of 76.3% in those aged 65 years and over (compared with 78.0% in 2021 to 2022) and 44.2% for those aged 6 months to under 65 years of age with one or more underlying clinical risk factors, compared with 48.2% in 2021 to 2022. Uptake in all patients aged 50 to 64 years old was 42.0%. Overall uptake in pregnant women was 60.0% compared with 78.5% in 2021 to 2022. In Wales, vaccine coverage in pregnant women is measured differently using a survey of pregnant women giving birth each year during February. In addition, as elsewhere in the UK, data is also automatically collected from general practices for women with pregnancy-related Read codes, this data reports uptakes of 46.7% in pregnant women at risk and 34.2% in healthy pregnant women. Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine is monitored by the PHA of Northern Ireland. From 2021 to 2022 onwards, influenza vaccine uptake has been determined using data extracted from regional Immunisation Information System developed by the Department of Health (DoH) Digital team; known as the Vaccine Management System (VMS). Caution should be used when considering the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 influenza vaccination uptake rates in comparison with previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. In the population aged 65 years and over uptake was 83.0% (compared with 57.7% in 2021 to 2022). Uptake was 51.4% in the population of 50 to 64 year olds in 2022 to 2023, compared with 43.5% in 2021 to 2022. The first year of rollout in this age group was 2020 to 2021. Note that the VMS does not currently collect data on the specific clinical risk conditions for influenza vaccination. Uptake in pregnant women (counted as mothers who delivered during the flu vaccine programme) was 29.8% in 2022 to 2023 compared with 45.9% in 2021 to 2022. Healthcare workers In England, vaccine uptake among all frontline healthcare workers (trusts and GP practices) was 49.9%. In trusts, vaccine uptake was 49.4% (from 94.3% of trusts responding), a decrease from 60.5% vaccine uptake in 2021 to 2022. In GP practices, vaccine uptake was 66.5% (from 14.6% of GP practices), a decrease from 74.1% vaccine uptake in 2021 to 2022. In Scotland, in 2022 to 2023, the combined uptake among health and social care workers was 46.9%. Please note in the 2021 to 2022 season, healthcare workers and social care workers were reported separately. In Wales, uptake reached 46.2% in 2022 to 2023 compared with 56.0% in 2021 to 2022. In Northern Ireland, uptake in frontline healthcare workers including social care was 37.5% in 2022 to 2023 compared with 49.8% in 2020 to 2021. Uptake in 2021 to 2022 is not comparable as it was not possible to disaggregate frontline and non-frontline staff. It should be noted that data sources differ between 2020 to 2021 and 2022 to 2023.

In Wales, vaccine coverage in pregnant women is measured differently using a survey of pregnant women giving birth each year during January. Influenza vaccine (LAIV) programme for children England The influenza vaccine uptake in 2 and 3 year olds in England is monitored by UKHSA throughout the season, through weekly and monthly extracts from GP system suppliers via ImmForm. Cumulative vaccine uptake on influenza vaccinations administered up to 28 February 2023 was reported from 98.4% (6,339 out of 6,442) of GP practices in England in 2022 to 2023. Comparative data is up to 28 February 2022 where vaccine uptake was reported from 97.1% (6,347 out of 6,538) of GP practices in England in 2021 to 2022. This season saw a vaccine uptake for all GP-registered 2 year olds of 42.3% (compared with 48.7% in 2021 to 2022) and was 45.1% in 3 year olds (compared with 51.4% in 2021 to 2022) in England. The combined uptake for 2 and 3 year olds was 43.7% compared with 50.1% in 2021 to 2022. In the 2022 to 2023 season, the influenza vaccine programme for school-aged children was focused on the year groups reception to year 9 (aged 4 to 14 years). The programme was mainly delivered via a school-based route, with one area (Isle of Scilly) delivering vaccinations through general practice. Vaccine uptake was monitored through manual returns by local teams for their responsible population. An estimated 3,502,566 children in school years reception to year 9 (age 4 to 14 years old) in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023. With an estimated total target population of 6,747,523, the overall uptake was 51.9%. Vaccine uptake in all primary school age children (age 4 to 11 years old) was 56.3% compared with 57.4% in 2021 to 2022 (Table 6). Vaccine uptake in secondary school age children (age 11 to 14 years old) was 41.9% compared with 45.5% in 2021 to 2022 (Table 6). Vaccine uptake in children of school age reception to year 9 generally decreases with increasing age. This trend has been seen in the 4 previous years where comparable data is available (Table 6 and Figure 43). Table 6: Percentage influenza vaccine uptake in children of school age: reception to year 11 (age 4 to 14 years old) in England. Age group 2022 to 2023 Percentage vaccine uptake 2021 to 2022 Percentage vaccine uptake Reception(age 4 to 5 years) 56.7 56.7 Year 1(age 5 to 6 years) 56.4 58.7 Year 2(age 6 to 7 years) 57.5 58.6 Year 3(age 7 to 8 years) 57.3 57.8 Year 4(age 8 to 9 years) 56.2 57.2 Year 5(age 9 to 10 years) 55.6 56.1 Year 6(age 10 to 11 years) 54.2 55.8 Year 7(age 11 to 12 years) 45.2 48.2 Year 8(age 12 to 13 years) 40.7 45.4 Year 9(age 13 to 14 years) 39.6 42.0 All primary school age(age 4 to 11 years) 56.3 57.4 All secondary school age(age 11 to 14 years) 41.9 45.5 All eligible school age(age 4 to 14 years) 51.9 53.8 Figure 43: Percentage influenza vaccine uptake for children in school years reception to year 6 (age 4 to 10 years rising to 11 years old) (primary school age), collected between 1 September 2022 to 31 January 2023 Overall vaccine uptake for all children of school age reception to year 9 (age 4 to 14 years old) by local authority (not shown here) ranged from 38.5% (391,568 out of 1,016,832) in London to 58.8% (365,556 out of 621,328) in the South West. Uptake by year group and local authority ranged from: 21.9% to 77.9% in reception 21.2% to 77.1% in year 1 21.2% to 86.8% in year 2 21.2% to 83.0% in year 3 19.9% to 79.6% in year 4 19.2% to 79.5% in year 5 17.1% to 74.7% in year 6 0.7% to 70.6% in year 7 0.7% to 67.7% in year 8 0.7% to 66.3% in year 9 Further detail on final influenza vaccine uptake data in all cohorts (GP patients, school-aged children and frontline healthcare workers) in England is now publicly available. Scotland As previously described, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccine in children is estimated by PHS throughout the season, using a combination of: aggregated data returns submitted by staff in all the territorial NHS boards on a weekly basis for those eligible in the following cohorts: 6 months to 2 years at risk 2 to 5 years not at school primary and secondary school pupils weekly extracts of data downloaded from the national clinical data store (NCDS), which contains individual-level data relating to the childhood schools’ and nurseries’ programmes for one NHS board The estimated uptake in preschool children (2 to under 5 years old, not yet in school) was 56.4%; this compares with 57.2% in 2021 to 2022. For primary school children the estimated uptake was 74.7% compared with 74.6% in 2021 to 2022. In secondary school children there was an estimated uptake of 61.0% compared with 62.1% in 2021 to 2022. Note, caution should be taken when comparing uptake percentage between the seasons due to differences in data collection methods. Wales In Wales, immunisations for 2 and 3 year olds were delivered through general practices, apart from one health board where the majority of 3 year olds were immunised through nursery school immunisations sessions (uptake in these nursery school sessions was 50.6%). National uptake of influenza vaccine in 2 and 3 year olds decreased in 2022 to 2023. Uptake of influenza vaccine for children aged 2 years was 42.9% (compared with 47.0% in 2021 to 2022), for 3 year olds it was 44.7% (compared with 48.2% in 2021 to 2022). For the whole group of children aged 2 and 3 years, uptake was 43.8% (compared with 47.6% in 2021 to 2022). The childhood influenza programme in Wales includes all primary and secondary school children. Uptake in primary school children decreased this season. Children aged 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years, received their vaccinations in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 62.7%, 65.0%, 65.1%, 64.2%, 64.5%, 63.9% and 62.7% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 63.8% (compared with 68.7% in 2021 to 2022). Uptake in secondary school children also decreased this season. Children aged 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years, received their vaccinations in school immunisation sessions and uptake was 62.3%, 55.3%, 52.9%, 51.4% and 49.8% in each of these groups respectively. For the group as a whole, uptake was 54.4% (compared with 58.2% in 2021 to 2022). Northern Ireland Caution should be used when considering the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 influenza vaccination uptake rates in pre-school children in comparison with previous seasons, due to the introduction of the new VMS involving new methods of recording and extracting influenza vaccine data. Influenza vaccinations administered by trust school nursing teams are recorded in the Child Health System (CHS), similar to previous seasons. In 2022 to 2023, the childhood influenza vaccination programme continued to include all pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old, all primary school aged children (year groups 1 to 7) and post primary school children in year groups 8 to 12. The former group was offered vaccination through primary care, while the latter 2 groups were offered vaccination through school health teams. The vaccination uptake rate in 2022 to 2023 for pre-school children aged 2 to 4 years old was 33.0% (compared with 25.4% in 2021 to 2022). The vaccination uptake rate for children in primary school (aged approximately 4 to 11 years old) was 70.6% (compared with 72.7% in 2021 to 2022). In 2021 to 2022, Northern Ireland expanded the vaccination programme from all year 8 children (introduced in 2020 to 2021) to include post-primary school children (years 8 to 12) with an uptake rate of 63.8%. In 2022 to 2023, uptake within this group was 60.2%. These year groups were vaccinated through school clinics. Vaccine effectiveness In England for the 2022 to 2023 season, as in previous seasons, influenza VE was estimated using a test-negative study design. VE is presented against influenza in those requiring hospitalisation following an emergency care attendance in England. Infection and admission data was collected through the Respiratory DataMart surveillance scheme and the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS). Vaccination status of study participants was obtained through data linkage with the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). In children aged 2 to 17 years, the overall adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness (aVE) in 2022 to 2023 was 65% (95% CI: 52% to 75%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza. In adults aged 18 to 64 years, the overall aVE was 32% (95% CI: 13% to 47%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza (Table 7). In adults aged 65 years and over, the overall aVE was 28% (95% CI: 15% to 39%). The overall VE largely reflects protection against A(H3N2), as influenza A predominated, and the dominant subtype was A(H3N2). In subtype-specific analyses across the age groups, low to good aVE was demonstrated against influenza A(H3N2). Low circulation of influenza A(H1N1) led to greater uncertainty in VE against influenza A(H1N1), with low to moderate mid-point estimates, and wide confidence intervals, crossing zero in all age groups. Protection against influenza B was good in children but uncertain in adults aged 18 to 64 years and not able to be estimated in adults aged 65 years and over due to low case numbers. There was good evidence of protection against hospitalisation by quadrivalent cell-based vaccine (QIVc), the joint first-line recommended vaccine for those aged 18 to 64 years, and the adjuvanted quadrivalent egg-based vaccine (aQIV), joint first line recommended for those aged 65 years and over. There was insufficient usage of recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIVr), joint first line recommended vaccine in the 18 to 64 years and 65 years and over age groups, to be able to estimate VE using Respiratory DataMart. For LAIV, the first line recommended vaccine in children aged 2 to 17 years, the aVE was 64% (95% CI: 49% to 75%). Table 7: Adjusted influenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation following an emergency department visit, using laboratory-confirmed influenza by influenza and vaccine type by age group, 2022 to 2023 season, England Ages 2 to 17 Ages 18 to 64 Ages 65 and above All aVE 65% (52 to 75%) 32% (13 to 47%) 28% (15 to 39%) Influenza type: A(H1N1) 39% (-47 to 75%) 35% (-39 to 69%) 2% (-79 to 46%) Influenza type: A(H3N2) 68% (43 to 82%) 25% (-28 to 56%) 39% (14 to 56%) Influenza type: B 91% (68 to 97%) 42% (-36 to 76%) Not available Vaccine type: LAIV 64% (49 to 75%) Not available Not available Vaccine type: QIVc 72% (24 to 89%) 35% (15 to 51%) 30% (-14 to 57%) Vaccine type: QIVe Not available 13% (-36 to 44%) Not available Vaccine type: aQIV Not available Not available 27% (14 to 38%) Adjusted for week of sample, age group, UKHSA region, clinical risk status, and COVID-19 vaccination status (adults only). Scotland In Scotland, in the 2022 to 2023 season, VE was also measured using a test-negative study design. VE is presented against influenza infection among individuals admitted to hospital, as an emergency admission, with a respiratory related diagnosis. The analysis was performed through the data linkage of influenza testing data from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS), hospital admission data from Scottish Morbidity Records 01 (SMR01) database and vaccination status of patients from the NCDS. Study period for the analysis was 3 October 2022 to 2 April 2023. Due to limitations in the collection of childhood influenza vaccine data in Scotland, aVE results are only shown for those aged 5 to 15 years. In children aged 5 to 15 years, the overall aVE in 2022 to 2023 was 71% (95% CI 54% to 82%) against all laboratory confirmed influenza in those admitted to hospital with a respiratory diagnosis. In adults aged 18 to 64 years, the overall aVE was 36% (95% CI 28% to 43%) and in adults aged 65 years and over, overall aVE was 30% (95% CI 21% to 38%). In subtype-specific analyses across the age groups, moderate to good aVE was demonstrated against influenza A(H3N2). Like England, low circulation of influenza(H1N1) led to greater uncertainty in VE against influenza A(H1N1). Low to good mid-point estimates were reported, but due to wide confidence intervals, crossing zero in children aged 5 to 15 years and adults aged 65 years and over, these results should be interpreted with caution. High aVE was found against influenza B across all age groups; however, like with influenza A(H1N1), these results should be interpreted with caution due to low circulation of influenza B in the study period and wide confidence intervals.

Emerging respiratory viruses Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections Since the World Health Organization (WHO) first reported cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, a total of 2,604 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported globally to WHO up to April 2023. This includes 936 fatal cases (case fatality ratio of 36%). In the most recent reporting period between week 40 2022 and week 15 2023, 4 cases have been reported globally by WHO. The majority of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. A feature of MERS-CoV is its ability to cause large outbreaks within healthcare settings. Local secondary transmission following importation has been reported from several countries including the UK, France, Tunisia, and the Republic of Korea. A total of 5 cases of MERS-CoV (3 imported and 2 linked cases) have been confirmed in the UK through ongoing surveillance since September 2012. In April and May 2014, 2 laboratory confirmed cases transited through London Heathrow Airport on separate flights to the US. Contact tracing of flight contacts did not identify any further cases. Further information on management and guidance of possible cases is available online. The latest ECDC MERS-CoV risk assessment highlights that risk of widespread transmission of MERS-CoV remains very low. Avian influenza and other zoonotic influenza Human influenza A(H5N1) and human influenza A(H5N6) Since 2003 and up to 24 April 2023, 874 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported worldwide including 458 deaths, giving an overall case fatality ratio of 52.4%. Since 2020, the avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has become widespread in birds, with some limited spillover to non-avian species and rare detections in humans. In mid-May 2023 UKHSA notified WHO of the detection of avian influenza A(H5) virus in a poultry worker at infected premises in England where poultry was infected with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses. Another detection was reported in a second individual at the infected premises. Both detections were later confirmed by additional testing as A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b. Both cases were asymptomatic and detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza. Since 2021 there has been an increase in detections of influenza A(H5N6) in humans, with up to 84 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection from 2014 to 19 May 2023 reported to WHO in the Western Pacific Region. The last case was reported from China, with an onset date of 17 December 2022. The case was hospitalised on 21 December 2022 with severe pneumonia and has since recovered. Human influenza A(H9N2) Since 2021 there has been an increase in detections of influenza A(H9N2) in humans, with up to 87 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection reported from 2015 to 19 March 2023. Of these, 85 were reported from China and 2 were reported from Cambodia. The last case was reported from China, with an onset date of 5 February 2023, and has since recovered. The majority of human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have reported exposures to avian species such as backyard poultry or live poultry markets. Avian influenza summary Most human cases of avian influenza viruses are exposed through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets or domestically kept birds. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Even though small clusters of H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections have been reported, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to undergo sustained transmission among humans. It is important to ensure that imported cases of suspect avian influenza are detected promptly to ensure public health measures including infection control can be rapidly put in place to minimise any risk of onward transmission. There have been multiple detections of avian influenza in avian species in the UK in 2022 to 2023 as reported by APHA. Information on recent acute public health events or potential events of concern including avian influenza can be found on WHO Disease Outbreak News. Swine influenza There continue to be some sporadic reports internationally of human infections with swine influenza viruses such as influenza A(H1N1)v and influenza A(H1N2)v. Close contact with infected pigs or attendance at sites such as farms and agricultural fairs continue to pose an exposure risk. There have been no new cases reported from the UK. Conclusions During the 2022 to 2023 season, influenza A dominated, with influenza A(H3N2) the predominant subtype in Great Britain and A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant in Northern Ireland. Influenza A activity was concentrated in a relatively short period, and relatively early within the typical seasonal range with some late season influenza B activity at low levels. High levels of influenza activity were seen across most surveillance systems from week 48 2022 to week 3 2023, where activity through multiple indicators showed a rapid increase in activity, followed by a rapid decline in activity and returning to low levels of activity for the remainder of the season. Excess mortality associated with influenza was above average for a season, though not into the range of the highest impact seasons when over 20,000 excess deaths are recorded in England. Mortality was likely influenced by this being an A(H3N2) dominated season, which is typically more severe in older adults due to lack of childhood exposure, and by the protection given by the vaccines, which were well-matched to the circulating A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza-like-illness consultation rates showed consistent activity trends with other indicators, although lower compared with previous years; it should be noted that peak activity weeks coincided with bank holiday weeks and that fewer appointment slots may have reduced ILI consultation rates. Influenza hospitalisation rates also peaked at weeks 50 to 52 2022, with peak and cumulative activity surpassing previous years substantially. This should be interpreted in the context of more intensive testing leading to improved virological ascertainment of patients hospitalised by influenza compared with norms prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peak ICU admission rates in England were only marginally higher than in previous seasons with significant influenza activity, with cumulative admission rates being lower than pre-pandemic seasons. This relative lower utilisation may reflect a number of factors including higher pre-pandemic testing in critical care relative to medical wards, critical care concurrent demands, and this being an A(H3N2) dominated season, rather than an A(H1N1)pdm09 dominated season which would have had higher impact on younger adults and therefore critical care. ECMO admissions due to SARI were mainly caused by influenza. Influenza activity in the UK in 2022 to 2023 has been broadly comparable to other Northern Hemisphere countries, though relatively higher proportions of A(H1N1)pdm09 were seen in much of Europe. Vaccines had an important role in reducing morbidity and other impacts of influenza this winter. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was higher in children (point estimate 60 to 70% across nations providing estimates) than in adults (point estimates around 30 to 35%). There was higher protection against influenza B than A where analysis was possible, and broad confidence intervals for estimates of vaccine effectiveness against different influenza A subtypes. This has been the first full influenza season since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in 2020. Previous sero-epidemiological investigation has shown some reduction in population immunity associated with the reduced circulation of influenza from COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical control measures. It is likely the resultant higher-than-usual population susceptibility contributed to the timing, shape and scale of influenza activity observed in 2022 to 2023 (see van Leeuwen and others on medRxiv, January 2023). Activity from other typical circulating respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and hMPV, was overall similar to that seen in the previous few seasons. RSV activity was similar to those observed in pre-pandemic seasons. Surveillance continues in the UK for other respiratory viruses, as well as novel respiratory viruses including MERS-CoV and avian influenza viruses such as influenza A(H7N9), influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H5N6), with risk assessments being updated regularly.

Bird flu has infected a Benton County herd this week. (Glen Stubbe/The Minnesota Star Tribune)CommentGiftShareListenBird flu has infected a Benton County dairy herd this week, marking the first confirmed case of the virus in Minnesota cows.But, as State Veterinarian Brian Hoefs said, “it was only a matter of time.”“It’s important for dairy farmers to follow the example of this herd and test sick cows,” Hoefs said in a Thursday statement. “The more the animal health community can learn about this virus today through testing and research, the better we can equip ourselves to prevent infections tomorrow.”Several dozen cows are sick. Farmers will destroy milk from the animals, and the cows will quarantine for 30 days, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.The board said public risk from avian influenza is currently low, though “people who work with or have direct contact with infected animals could be at risk of getting sick.”A dairy worker in Texas contracted bird flu this past March and recovered as avian influenza spread among cattle in several states. Two months later, a Michigan dairy worker tested positive with mild eye symptoms. Only one other person in the U.S., a poultry worker in Colorado, is known to have caught the virus during the current outbreak that began two years ago.“Symptoms of avian influenza in people may include cough, sore throat, fever, red/watery eyes or discharge from the eyes,” according to the board.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said this spring it found inactive traces of the virus in the milk supply, but health officials said pasteurized dairy remains safe.“There continues to be no concern that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health, or that it affects the safety of the interstate commercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the market,” the FDA said.At a dairy farm east of Rochester on Thursday afternoon, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan touted the opening of National Dairy Month by snacking on an ice cream cone and attesting to the safety of dairy products.“Our job is to make sure that we’re telling Minnesotans that milk is safe to drink,” said Flanagan, who called dairy farming an “important part of our way of life here” as workers behind her tended to cows on a rotating milking parlor.Related CoverageBusinessMillions more egg-laying hens lost to bird flu in Minnesota and IowaBusinessMinnesota farmers remain on guard after Michigan worker tests positive for bird fluShelly DePestel, vice president of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association and a dairy farmer outside Lewiston, said federal and state officials have assured producers that cows recover from bird flu infections.”But it still gives us a little anxiety about what this could roll into,” DePestel saidThe cow cases come amid a resurgence in bird flu infections at Minnesota poultry operations, including the euthanization of tens of thousands of turkeys and more than 1.3 million egg-laying hens last month. That pushed the state’s virus-related poultry losses to nearly 8 million since 2022.State officials are urging dairy farmers to contact their veterinarian if cows appear sick. Symptoms include fever, lower milk production, loss of appetite and changes in manure consistency, the board said.ShareCommentabout the writersBrooks JohnsonFood and Manufacturing ReporterBrooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends.See MoreChristopher VondracekAgriculture ReporterChristopher Vondracek covers agriculture for the Star Tribune.See MoreMore from AgricultureSee MoreAgricultureCHS facing competition for its $200M offer to buy West Central cooperativeBrooks JohnsonAgricultureCHS facing competition for its $200M offer to buy West Central cooperativeBrooks JohnsonMinnesota-based CHS also reported a $1.1 billion annual profit Wednesday.AgricultureFarming is more high-tech than ever.

Following the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 4.2 million of its egg-laying chickens, those birds will have to be destroyed and the facilities disinfected this summer. Eric Sandbulte esandbulte@nwestiowa.com Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save SIOUX CENTER—The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in approximately 4.2 million egg-laying chickens at a Center Fresh Group facility west of Sioux Center.Center Fresh Group president J.T. Dean said immediate action has been taken in cooperation with state and federal authorities at Center Fresh Egg Farm, located about four miles west of Sioux Center at 4135 Garfield Ave. Center Fresh Group has approximately 10 million layer chickens total.“In a situation like this, it’s not really about money. It’s about making sure our team members are taken care of along with our customers and community and stakeholders. I think we’ll manage to navigate this and be just fine and get production back for our customers as soon as we can,” Dean said.Part of the required response process includes destroying the infected birds, disposing of them and their manure via composting and then disinfecting the premises and equipment. Once the virus is confirmed to be gone from the facilities, new chickens can be brought in.Dean expects the business will be able to repopulate the farm later this summer and get close to full production again by the end of the year. In the meantime, Center Fresh will work with its clients to procure as much available supply as it can.Center Fresh Egg Farm’s 150 employees will remain fully employed during this time.According to Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship communications director Don McDowell, the viral disease HPAI affects wild and domestic birds and can be transmitted to lactating dairy cattle. HPAI can travel in wild birds without those birds appearing sick. Although it is often fatal to domestic bird populations, that is rarely the case for dairy cattle with the disease.Some of the common signs of HPAI in birds include lethargy; a lack of appetite; a decrease in egg production; soft and thin-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles and hocks; stumbling and falling down; and diarrhea.“On Monday morning, we detected a few signs in the birds. There was one flock on the farm whose birds looked lethargic and weren’t moving normally,” Dean said. Buy Now Center Fresh Group confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza at its farm west of Sioux Center. This will require the culling of 4.2 million infected egg-laying chickens, but the farm’s 150 employees will remain employed during the disinfecting process this summer. Eric Sandbulte esandbulte@nwestiowa.com Samples were sent to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship’s animal industry division and analyzed by the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames, with the presence of HPAI then confirmed, according to McDowell.Dean, who also is a member of the Avian Influenza Global Taskforce for the International Egg Commission, said the poultry and egg industries have been grappling with a nationwide outbreak of the virus since 2022, with nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys impacted so far.Center Fresh already had biosecurity processes in place at its facilities to reduce the risk of it and other diseases being introduced to their chickens.“Every person who gains access to one of the houses where the birds are must take off anything that comes off the street,” Dean said. “They cross an entry point where they take their footwear off and cross onto a clean side. They go into a personal, individual locker room where they remove their personal garments and go through a full showering process. They put on company garments and footwear that always stays on the clean side. Nothing on the outside can come across what we call the red line to get into those layer houses.”So far, signs point to HPAI being introduced at Center Fresh Egg Farm by wild birds passing near the farm. This was despite measures already taken to discourage the presence of wild birds at the property through such means as on-site vegetation management and installing nets above open water so they will not want to land there.“Unfortunately, this is an environmental challenge that’s out there, and we don’t think this was spread from another farm. We think this was an introduction from a migratory bird,” Dean said. “Maybe a bird landed in the wrong spot or went to the bathroom in the wrong spot, and it takes only such a small amount of virus to get one chicken sick. It could have come through an air inlet or something like that, which based on where we detected these sick birds, that’s kind of what we think happened.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Food safety: Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported, despite outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, it remains safe to enjoy poultry products. As a reminder, consumers should always utilize the proper handling and cooking of eggs and poultry products, including cooking to an internal temperature of 165 degrees. It is a longstanding practice that only milk from healthy animals may enter the food supply. There is no concern about the safety of pasteurized milk or dairy products. Pasteurization has continually proven to successfully inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk.

Vaccination is recommended during September or October to maximise immunity during the peak flu season. Among young children in the United States, preventive care visits tend to occur during birth months and are a convenient time to receive the influenza vaccine, but large scale studies of the optimal timing of vaccination are unavailable.To address this, researchers set out to assess the optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children.Using health insurance claims data, they identified over 800,000 children aged 2-5 years who received an influenza vaccination between 1 August and 31 January during 2011-18. They then analysed rates of diagnosed influenza among these children by birth month.After accounting for a range of potentially influential factors such as age, sex, existing conditions, healthcare use and family size, the results show that October was the most common month for children to be vaccinated.Children born in October also had the lowest rate of influenza diagnosis. For example, among children born in August, the average rate of influenza diagnosis across flu seasons studied was 3% compared with 2.7% for children born in October and 2.9% for those born in December.This is an observational study and the authors acknowledge that their findings are limited to insured children who received medical care. Nor can they rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results.Nevertheless, results were similar after additional analyses to evaluate whether the relation between birth month and influenza risk was due to chance, providing greater confidence in their conclusions.“Our findings suggest that US public health interventions focused on vaccination of young children in October may yield the best protection in typical flu seasons,” they say. “The study’s findings are consistent with current recommendations promoting October vaccination,” they add.[Ends]Notes for editors Research: Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children: population based cohort study doi: 10.1136/bmj-2023-077076 Journal: The BMJFunding: NoneLink to Academy of Medical Sciences Press releases labelling system: http://press.psprings.co.uk/AMSlabels.pdfExternally peer reviewed?

The property has been placed in quarantine and contact tracing is underway to determine the source of the infection.A third poultry farm has declared an outbreak of avian influenza in Victoria.Farm Pride Foods announced this morning the viral strain detected at its Lethbridge aviary site was "the same strain found on the egg farm at Meredith" about 10 days ago.Those farms are about 10 minutes' apart by road in the Golden Plains Shire in central Victoria.A different strain of avian influenza — H7N9 — was discovered at a farm at Terang on May 24. Farm Pride Foods said it had been collaborating with Agriculture Victoria to conduct hen health assessments.Tests on June 1 showed hens kept in sheds were free of bird flu.But tests carried out on Sunday, June 2 showed free-range hens had the H7N3 strain, with the results received on Monday.Second outbreak for producerFarm Pride Foods said in a statement there were 80,000 free-range hens at the Lethbridge Aviary site, which is about 8 per cent of the company's total production capacity.The company has a further 40,000 birds in the Lethbridge area, which are also subject to monitoring and testing.This is the second bird flu outbreak for the egg producer in four years.In 2020, Farm Pride Foods faced two avian influenza outbreaks on its Lethbridge properties.Those outbreaks led to the culling of 380,000 egg-laying caged, barn and free range hens – 33 per cent of the company's stock.Movement restrictions are in place in a bid to control the bird flu outbreak. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)Poultry owners to keep bird in cages in restricted areaAgriculture Victoria has confirmed it is responding to the detection of avian influenza at three Victorian poultry farms."This new infected property is located within the current 5-kilometre restricted area in the Golden Plains Shire," Agriculture Victoria said."Tests have now confirmed the high pathogenicity H7N3 strain of the avian influenza virus at the property."This property has been placed in quarantine and all poultry will be safely disposed of. The sites will be cleaned and cleared of the infection."The H7N3 strain of bird flu has previously been detected in wild birds.Disposal options being consideredThe new farm outbreak is no surprise, Agriculture Victoria deputy chief vet Cameron Bell told the Victorian Country Hour on ABC Radio."It's clearly as a result of the ongoing and intensive surveillance activities that we're undertaking within the restricted and control area," Dr Bell said.What do we know about Australia's bird flu case?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Two different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria. Here's what to know about bird flu, its risk of transmission to humans and what precautions to take against its spread.Authorities are examining disposal options for hens at the centre of this latest bird flu outbreak."At this stage, no activities have commenced but we'll be determining the most feasible options in collaboration with the owners," Dr Bell said.About a quarter of the state's eggs are produced in the Golden Plains region where the avian influenza-hit farms are located."Having a concentration of poultry enterprises there does mean that owners need to be on the lookout and report any unexplained deaths to Agriculture Victoria," Dr Bell said.Movement controls that include a housing requirement for all birds within the restricted areas and control areas are now in place in Meredith and Terang.Under the housing requirement, all poultry farmers and backyard flock and bird owners must house or keep their birds enclosed in cages or sheds as much as practical.Agriculture Victoria says staff are on the ground supporting the businesses and working with industry to contain and eradicate the virus.Contact tracing is also underway to determine the source and spread of the infection.ABC Rural news dailyKey stories of the day for Australian primary producers, delivered each weekday afternoon.ABC Rural Weekday NewsABC Rural Weekly NewsYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Tue 4 Jun 2024 at 2:41amTuesday 4 Jun 2024 at 2:41amTue 4 Jun 2024 at 2:41am, updated Tue 4 Jun 2024 at 3:56amTuesday 4 Jun 2024 at 3:56amTue 4 Jun 2024 at 3:56amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

What's next? WHO said the current risk of bird flu to the general population is low.A person with prior health complications who contracted the first human case of a subtype of bird flu has died in Mexico City, says the World Health Organization.The 59-year-old died on April 24 after developing a fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general discomfort, WHO said in a statement on Wednesday, local time. WHO said the current risk of bird flu to the general population is low.Are we ready for the next pandemic?Photo shows Dozens of hens with glossy brown feathers and red plump combs under a clear blue sky.With Australian officials closely monitoring local outbreaks of avian influenza, and another highly pathogenic strain wreaking havoc overseas, experts in infectious disease and public health say this is how we should prepare for the possibility of a future pandemic.It is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with the H5N2 strain of bird flu, also known as avian influenza, reported globally, and the first avian H5 virus reported in a person in Mexico, according to the WHO."Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico," WHO said in a statement.Mexico's Health Ministry said the source of infection in the victim from Mexico City had not been identified, but so far no evidence of person-to-person transmission has occurred.The man had several prior health conditions, the ministry said in a statement, and all people who had contact with him have tested negative.The victim had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals but had multiple underlying medical conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms, the WHO said.Australian health officials are closely monitoring bird flu outbreaks at poultry farms in Victoria and Western Australia. (Reuters: Mariana Nedelcu)Mexico's Health Ministry said the person had chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes."That immediately puts a person at risk of more severe influenza, even with seasonal flu," said Andrew Pekosz, an influenza expert at Johns Hopkins University.Last week Victorian health officials confirmed Australia's first human case of one particular strain of the bird flu, H5N1 avian influenza, which was detected in a child travelling home to Victoria from India. The same strain, which scientists also say is unrelated to the case in Mexico, has so far infected three dairy farm workers in the US. Avian influenza has been detected in dairy herds across nine US states.

No further cases have been detected yet. By Ed Cara Published June 6, 2024 | Comments (6) | ð Copied! Image: Dimas Ardian (Getty Images) A particular type of bird flu has now killed its first human. On Wednesday, Mexican health officials and the World Health Organization announced a confirmed case of H5N2 avian influenza in a 59-year-old man, who subsequently died from complications of the infection. The incident is the first lab-confirmed case and death tied to H5N2, but WHO officials say that the risk to the general public from this virus is low. According to the WHO, the man first developed symptoms of the infection on April 17, which included fever, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, and general discomfort. On April 24, after seeking medical attention, the man was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, but he succumbed to his illness and died that same day. Doctors detected an unknown subtype of influenza A virus within the manâs respiratory samples, which prompted genetic sequencing. The early results suggested that this virus was a strain of H5N2, which was subsequently confirmed by further testing. On May 24, local health officials notified the WHO of their discovery. The case doesnât appear to be connected to the ongoing outbreaks of bird flu in U.S. dairy cattle, which are caused by strains of H5N1 avian influenza. But there have been recent outbreaks of both low and high pathogenic H5N2 bird flu strains among poultry farms in Mexico (pathogenic referring to its ability to cause illness and death in birds). At least three such outbreaks of H5N2 occurred near or in the state of Mexico, where the man resided, in March 2024. At this point, however, itâs not known whether this case is connected to any of these clusters, since the man had no reported history of exposure to poultry or other animals. This is the first confirmed human case and death ever linked to H5N2. Bird flu is worrying for several reasons. For one, humans already have low immunity to these strains relative to the seasonal flu strains that circulate every year. Given enough bad luck, the fear is that some strains will develop the right assortment of mutations that would allow the virus to spread easily between humans and cause substantial amounts of severe illness at the same timeâthe beginnings of a potential pandemic. As of yet, neither avian H5N1 nor H5N2 appear certain to make this jump to people. Health officials identified and monitored 17 recent contacts of the 59-year-old man, including people at the hospital where he died. While some people did experience symptoms of a potential respiratory illness, none of the contacts have tested positive for an acute infection of H5N2, though antibody tests that can detect a past infection are still pending. Itâs also possible that the manâs preexisting health may have played a role in the severity of his illness, since the man had several underlying conditions and had been bedridden for three weeks prior to his symptoms, according to interviews with his relatives. For now, the WHOâs assessment of the threat posed by H5N2 and other bird flu strains remains the same: a serious concern that has to be monitored closely and contained as much as possible, but not an imminent danger. âAvailable epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses from previous events have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission between humans, thus the current likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low,â the WHO wrote in its report of the H5N2 case.

However, the serotype of this flock infection is different from the first.According to a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) the most recent case of HPAI was confirmed in a mixed free-range and caged commercial egg operation in Terang, Victoria. The Terang flock was struck by an H7N9 variant of HPAI, whereas the first flock infection, in Meredith, Victoria, was identified as an H7N3 variant of HPAI.In the instance of H7N9 HPAI 300 hens died, and 14,000 birds were identified as cases. The total flock included 160,000 birds, according to WOAH.WOAH stated that the Terang farm had a commercial link with the Meredith farm, “through management needs only,” and that the “H7N9 virus is genetically related to strains detected in wild birds in Australia.”“A detailed surveillance plan is being implemented and epidemiological investigation and tracing is underway,” the WOAH report stated. “Operational activities commenced immediately. A Control Area (CA) and Restricted Area (RA) have been declared around the premises. Movement controls have been implemented in the CA and RA. A requirement to house free-range birds where possible has been put in place across the CA. A public information strategy has been employed.”The H7N9 case was confirmed on May 23, while the H7N3 case was confirmed on May 21. Between the two instances of HPAI, Australia has had 573,000 head of poultry affected by HPAI.The country has also had one human infection, which involved yet another serotype. The Victoria Department of Health reported that a child had contracted an H5N1 variant of the virus while visiting India. The child has reportedly since recovered and is “no longer unwell.” View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

(Image Credits: Pixabay) Bird Flu in Mexico: The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday reported the first human death caused by bird flu in Mexico. The victim, a resident of Mexico, died after suffering from symptoms of avian influenza A (H5N2). According to WHO, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) on 23 May 2024. “This is the first laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus reported globally and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in Mexico,” WHO said in a statement.Also Read This biosensor can help in early detection of kidney diseases-Know all about this innovation Equatorial Guinea civil servant’s 400 sex tapes go viral, authorities attempt to disrupt internet traffic One-third Indians with obesity fail to recognise their condition, widespread misconception leading to delayed treatment EXPLAINER | Why doctors want changes in the anti-sex detection law Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico, the global health agency stated. According to the IHR (2005), a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO. Based on available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus as low. Also ReadCan bird flu cause the next pandemic? Here’s what doctors say amid concerning rise in H5N1 cases ‘No history of exposure to poultry or other animals’ In its statement, WHO said that the 59-year-old patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. However, he had multiple underlying medical conditions. The patient’s relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms. “On 17 April, the case developed fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general malaise. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases “Ismael Cosio Villegas” (INER per its acronym in Spanish) and died the same day due to complications of his condition,” WHO reported. According to the UN health body’s statement, results from Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of a respiratory sample collected and tested at INER on 24 April indicated a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On 8 May, the sample was sent for sequencing to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases of INER, which indicated that the sample was positive for influenza A(H5N2). On 20 May, the sample was received at the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference of the Mexico National Influenza Centre, for analysis by RT-PCR, obtaining a positive result for influenza A. On 22 May, sequencing of the sample confirmed the influenza subtype was A(H5N2). Meanwhile, no further cases were reported during the epidemiological investigation. Of the 17 contacts identified and monitored at the hospital where the case died, one reported a runny nose between 28 and 29 April. Samples taken from these hospital contacts between 27 and 29 May tested negative for influenza and SARS-CoV 2. “12 additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case’s residence. Samples of pharyngeal exudate, nasopharyngeal swabs and serum were obtained from these individuals. On 28 May, the InDRE reported that all twelve samples from contacts near the patient’s residence tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B, as determined by RT-PCR. The results of the serological samples are pending,” WHO stated. In March this year, a high pathogenicity avian influenza A(H5N2) outbreak was detected in a backyard poultry farm in the state of Michoacán, which borders the State of Mexico where the patient was residing.

Usually, animal influenza viruses circulate in animals but can also infect humans. A human can contract the infection when he or she comes in contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. Depending on the original host, influenza A viruses can be classified as avian influenza, swine influenza, or other types of animal influenza viruses, WHO stated. What are symptoms of H5N2 bird flu infection? Avian influenza virus infections in humans may cause mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections and can be fatal. According to WHO, Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported. The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include: a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery aching muscles headache a cough or shortness of breath Other early symptoms may include: diarrhoea sickness stomach pain chest pain bleeding from the nose and gums conjunctivitis It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you’ve been infected. How H5N2 Bird Flu infection is treated? Some antiviral drugs, notably neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival prospects for some cases. “There are no specific vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) virus infection in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes,” the global health agency stated.

Paul Nuki Global Health Security Editor, London 05 June 2024 4:38pm BST House mice have become the latest mammal to become infected with H5N1 bird flu, sparking fears that the almost omnipresent pests could spread the virus to humans.Eleven house mice in the state of New Mexico – where several herds of dairy cattle are infected with H5N1 – tested positive for the avian influenza, new data released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown. The discovery of the virus in mice is particularly alarming, as it significantly raises the risk of human transmission and further spread, say experts.Mice live in unnervingly close proximity to humans: they scurry beneath floorboards, hide in cupboards and roam our offices, larders and restaurants.Their excreta – urine, droppings and saliva – can carry and transmit a wide array of pathogens.“This brings the virus closer to human homes,” Dr Rick Bright, a former head of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), told The Telegraph. “It increases the risk of direct exposure and infection.” H5N1 has been circulating for over 20 years, but in 2020 picked up speed – triggering an animal pandemic Credit: AFP via Getty Images/NIAID Although USDA have not released any information about how the mice contracted the virus, scientists suspect the creatures lived on a farm, and became infected after consuming unpasteurised milk from infected cattle. A study was released a month ago documenting the death of cats from Texas which are thought to have contracted the virus via the same route.The US authorities are warning consumers not to drink unpasteurised milk or other dairy products.Mice don’t stay in one place and can act as efficient vectors for disease.Travelling in groups, they can climb through pipes, voids, and other tight spaces to move with ease from place to place, house to house. They thrive in groups of up to two dozen and practically live on top of each other – meaning viruses can rapidly spread between them. “House mice living near infected farms can spread H5N1 virus into residential areas, making containment of the outbreak significantly more challenging,” explained Dr Bright. “This is out of control.”Need for ‘immediate action’Rodents are infamous reservoirs of disease, and are responsible for a number of epidemics. The bubonic plague, or ‘Black Death’ – which killed off half of Europe in the 1300s – was transmitted via rats. Lassa Fever – which causes around 5,000 in West Africa every year – is carried by multimammate mice, which contaminate human food sources through urine and faeces.“We know mice can transmit pathogens like hantavirus, leptospirosis, and LCMV,” explained Dr Krutika Kuppalli, a spokesperson for the Infectious Disease Society of America and former WHO medical officer.“I suspect this could happen with H5N1, but we will need more studies to understand this,” she said. “We need urgent comprehensive testing to prevent a wider health crisis – the history of rodent-borne pandemics like the Black Death underscores the potential severity of the H5N1 virus’s spread into house mice, and the need for immediate action,” added Dr Bright. USDA has released limited information on how the mice became infected. Data uploaded on Tuesday revealed the creatures tested positive for H5N1 on May 8 – almost a month ago. Authorities have also not released any genetic sequence data, meaning there is no information on whether the virus has mutated to better spread between mammals, something Dr Bright says is “very concerning”.H5N1 has been circulating for over twenty years, but in 2020 picked up speed – triggering an animal pandemic that has killed tens of millions of mammals and birds, including foxes, seals, alpacas, polar bears, and mountain lions. In March, the virus was detected in US cattle – and since has spread to 71 dairy herds in nine US states. Three dairy workers at farms in Texas and Michigan have also become infected – sparking major fears over the virus’ ability to ‘jump’ to humans. Last month, the US government announced $200 million of funding to try and get the virus in dairy cows under control, including support for dairy farms, testing, vaccine development, surveillance and measures to ensure the safety of commercial milk.But experts don’t think the move goes far enough. Dame Sarah Gilbert, Professor of Vaccinology at the Pandemic Sciences Institute in Oxford and lead scientist on the Oxford Covid19 jab, told The Telegraph on Tuesday the information coming out of the US on H5N1 was “concerning” and urged vigilance.Producing conventional vaccines in the event of a pandemic could take six months or more, she said, and welcomed investment in mRNA and other more rapid vaccine technologies. Last week it was reported that Barda was set to make a multimillion-dollar investment in Moderna so that it could get its prototype H5N1 vaccine tested.Experts also stressed the importance of better regulating the interaction between humans and nature.“We need healthy wildlife for a healthy human population,” explained Prof Vincent Savolainen, Professor of Organismic Biology at Imperial College London. “Authorities are playing catch-up every time this virus jumps to a new species, but we need to start being proactive – not reactive.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024WHO confirms first human death from H5N2 bird flu strain in Mexico डाउन टू अर्थPrint EditionSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewslettersSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewsletters HealthWHO confirms first death from bird flu strain H5N2 in Mexico59-year-old patient had underlying multiple health conditions, but officials face challenges in tracing the source of infectioniStockHimanshu NitnawarePublished on: 06 Jun 2024, 1:00 pmCopiedWorld Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the first-ever human death caused by the H5N2 strain of avian influenza. The victim, a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico with underlying health conditions, passed away in April after contracting the virus.This is the first globally reported, laboratory-confirmed human case of influenza A (H5N2) virus infection and the first instance of an avian H5 virus infecting a person in Mexico. The patient had no known history of exposure to poultry or other animals. Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in MexicoWHO statementMexican health authorities reported the case to WHO on May 23, 2024. The individual had been hospitalised in Mexico City on April 24, 2024 and exhibited symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, nausea and general discomfort. According to the officials, the laboratory test has confirmed the 59-year-old person dying of the infection.The death has sounded alarm bells among the scientific community. As per International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, a human infection due to novel influenza A virus subtype even has potential for high public health impact.The man had multiple underlying medical conditions, the WHO statement highlighted. The relatives of the victim informed the authorities that the person had been bedridden for about three weeks for reasons different than what it displayed before the acute symptoms of avian flu.The laboratory results from the person’s sample showed a non-subtypeable influenza A virus. On May 8, 2024, the sample was sent for further analysis to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Emerging Diseases Center for Research in Infectious Diseases, which confirmed it was positive for influenza A (H5N2).On May 20, the sample was sent to the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) of the Mexico National Influenza Centre for RT-PCR analysis, which yielded a positive result for influenza A, the WHO said. The sample’s sequencing confirmed the influenza subtype as A (H5N2).This virus poses a low risk to the general population, according to WHO.The health officials identified and tested 17 other contacts who were close to the case, out of whom one reported a runny nose between April 28 and 29. However, the tests were negative for the influenza and SARS-COV-2. Twelve additional contacts (seven symptomatic and five asymptomatic) were identified near the case’s residence, the statement further said.All of the samples tested negative for influenza A, B, and SARS-CoV-2. The results of the serology or blood serum are pending.Earlier in March, the strain A (H5N2) outbreak was discovered in a backyard poultry farm in Michoacán, bordering State of Mexico, where the victim’s death was reported. Later that month, another outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) of the same strain was discovered in poultry from Texcoco, State of Mexico, followed by another outbreak of the same strain in April from the municipality of Temascalapa, also in the same state.So far, authorities have not been able to link the first human case to the poultry outbreak. Earlier in March, Avian influenza virus type A (H5N1) was found in dairy cattle in nine states, infecting some humans who came into close contact with the animals.In May, Australia reported the first human infection with A(H5N1), with no evidence of transmission. In 2021, 18 herons in China died due to avian flu of strain A(H5N6) as per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Avian Flubird fluworld health organizationMexicoH5N2Show CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

It comes after the World Health Organization said a man's death in Mexico was caused by a new strain of bird flu that has never before been found in a human.Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.TRANSCRIPTBird flu has been around since the 1990s, detected in wild birds in China like geese; and then spreading to poultry around the world; before emerging in mammals like cows in recent months.Bird flu is caused by a handful of influenza viruses, just like the seasonal flu that circulates each winter.However, with the odd exception, it is spread only between animals; or from animals to humans.Human-to-human transmission is thought to have been limited and non-sustained.Since the 1990s, there have been 900 known human cases – nearly half have died.Now, the World Health Organization says they have confirmed through laboratory tests the discovery of a new strain of bird flu - called H5N2 - that has never been found in a human.It was detected in a 59-year-old man, with chronic health conditions, who died a Mexico City hospital on 24 April, a week after being admitted with fever, shortness of breath and diarrhoea.It is unclear how he became infected with bird flu, with Mexican health officials saying he had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals.It took officials in Mexico a month to report the case to the WHO who has only now publicly confirmed the case and lab test results (5 June).The WHO says, at this stage, it assesses the current risk to the general population from this new strain as low, although it notes the identification of a new subtype has "the potential for high public health impact".Dr Wenqing Zhang is the head of the WHO's Avian Influenza Programme."We need to bear in mind is that each infection in humans is an attempt of the virus to try to establish itself in human population. Although the chances are slim so far, as long as it is succeeds once, just once, it is a start of an influenza pandemic, which can be as mild as the 2009 pandemic, but equally it also could be devastating like the 1981 one also-called Spanish Flu. That's why we are concerned about avian influenza and are watching it very closely.”Scientists say the bird flu variant at the centre of US dairy farm outbreak, involving cows, is different to the one in the Mexico case.Dairy workers in the US have now died from the H5N1-type of bird flu, with the first case confirmed by the WHO on 1 April.And yet another type of bird flu is circulating among chickens in Australia - the H7N3 strain - has been detected at a fifth poultry farm in Victoria.Victoria’s Chief Veterinary Officer Graeme Cooke says quarantine and surveillance measures are in place to contain the virus.Veterinary scientist Robyn Alders is an honorary professor with the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University.She says we have yet to see sustained transmission of bird flu into a fully-fledged human pandemic, but it is the mutation of the virus that needs to be closely monitored."There's been ongoing small numbers of Avian influenza outbreaks in chicken flocks in Australia since the 1970s. Those outbreaks are detected quickly because they can often cause quite high mortality in the chickens. What we are seeing now in Victoria is a little different. With the move to have pasture-raised or free-range chickens, we're having more birds out in the open being able to have some contact with these migratory birds. And then as virus numbers increase, or the virus hitches a ride between people, birds - or things as egg trays or cages that move between different farms - the virus can hitch a ride."She says understanding how the variants spread and the regulations in place, is key to knowing how to respond as a consumer of milk, meat or egg products."So what has changed in the Australian situation is the move to having more free range flocks. What typically happens in Europe now is during the peak migratory season of birds, free range producers are asked to keep their birds inside during that time. So we may see that regulations will change here in Australia. But for consumers we should be confident that any egg or chicken, or meat, or milk product that is available for sale through the commercial outlets are safe and fit for human consumption."The WHO says it is preparing tailored and specific guidance to help countries develop plans to manage the public health risks.Meanwhile, scientists are testing vaccines to protect both cows and humans against bird flu.The US Agriculture Department is testing a vaccine developed by University of Pennsylvania researchers by giving it to calves - with the strategy of restricting the spread of the virus before it reaches dairy workers.The US Department of Health and Human Services has also been talking to manufacturers about possible mRNA flu vaccines that, if needed, could supplement millions of bird flu vaccine doses already in government hands.Richard Webby is a flu researcher at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee."What the COVID-19 pandemic taught us was some of these newer technologies can be used to rapidly prepare vaccines against emerging threats like the H5 virus. And so, you know, the particular work that we're involved in here with colleagues in Pennsylvania were actually to use that same technology that was used essentially to make a Covid vaccine, but instead of it expressing the SARS coronavirus antigens, it was expressing flu antigens."Scaling up vaccine development and production would require a declaration by the W-H-O that we have a virus that has pandemic potential.That hasn't happened.Professor Alders says work on vaccines should continue - and with that strategies for prevention and preparation."Because of advances in science and the ability to really get excellent sequencing of the influenza virus, should it become necessary to to produce a vaccine for use in humans, that should happen relatively quickly. There are companies already looking at doing the preparatory work for developing a vaccine for use in humans. The big challenge will be as we saw in COVID, is making sure that that vaccine is available to those who really need it."ShareLatest podcast episodesNew program will see pregnant mothers and babies protected from life-threatening virusNew data sheds light on the mental health impacts of losing a pregnancyHysterical: Fatima found a 'hidden community' of grieving parents after not getting culturally safe support'These laws would have protected her': advocates welcome social media banRecommended for you'First step to the world war': North Korean soldiers reported in Ukrainerussia ukraine warAustralia's driver's licence rule change — and who it's set to affectaustralian driving licence'Embarrassing and disrespectful': Lidia Thorpe faces backlash over King Charles protestindigenous peoplesWho is Susie Wiles, the 'Ice Maiden' who will become Trump's chief of staff?politics of united states'Remarkable courage': Principal speaks as student who died in schoolyard crash identifiedcar accidentsUS presidential election results: What we know so far2024 united states presidential electionThis bright comet is still visible in Australia, but not for long.

The contagious H7N3 variant of avian influenza was detected on Wednesday at a property at Lethbridge, in Victoria's southwest.The virus is understood to have spread inside a sealed and climate-controlled shed that houses around 120,000 chickens. The latest outbreak of the disease comes after 80,000 free-range chickens at Farm Pride Foods, a property located 900metres away from the latest case, was affected by the virus over the weekend, according to the Geelong Advertiser.The farm is located within an existing 5km-exclusion zone set up after the virus was detected at a nearby property in May. A fourth farm (pictured) has been hit by the contagious variant of bird flu, with a property in Lethbridge in Victoria's southwest the latest to be affected by the outbreak The disease was earlier detected last month at two farms in Meredith and Terang, in Victoria's west, with some 500,000 birds slaughtered to contain the spread of the virus. Read More I'm the CDC's top bird flu expert - this is why I'm losing sleep over the H5N1 outbreak tearing through US farms Avian influenza is a highly infectious disease for birds that can cause severe symptoms and death among poultry. Agriculture Victoria said in a statement yesterday that all four properties have been placed into quarantine. 'All poultry will be safely disposed of. The sites will be cleaned and cleared of the infection,' it said. Restriction and control orders are in place in Meredith, Lethbridge and Terang to restrict the movement of poultry and poultry products. The order is also in place for vehicles and equipment on and off the properties in the designated areas. The enclosed shed where the H7N3 variant of the avian influenza was detected at the farm in Lethbridge houses around 120,000 chickens (stock image) Some 500,000 birds were culled after the disease was detected last month on two farms in Meredith and Terang, in Victoria's west (pictured, health and safety crews at a farm in Meredith in May after the infectious strain of the virus was detected)Agriculture Victoria said staff are working with affected business to contain and eradicate the disease. The outbreaks of the virus have struck the Golden Plains Shire, the main poultry-growing region in regional Victoria. There are more than 1.5million free-range, barn and caged hens, and around two million chicken meat birds on farms in the area. Farm Pride Foods said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday that around eight per cent of their total production output has been affected. 'The Company will seek compensation from the Emergency Animal Disease Compensation Scheme arising from the disposal of these birds,' the company said. The outbreaks are expected to impact egg supply to consumers in coming weeks.Danyel Cucinotta, the vice-president of the Victorian Farmers Federation, told The Guardian, 'We’re anticipating a flow-on impact to egg supplies in the coming week and are working as hard as possible to maintain availability'.'My advice is to shop around at your local grocer, market or small independent store to buy your eggs.'Despite concerns the virus could potentially be deadly to humans, health officials said the H7N3 variant of avian influenza is not a major health threat.Agriculture Victoria states consumers should not worry about supermarket eggs and poultry products as they 'do not pose a risk and are safe to consume'.

There is no avian influenza vaccine available in Canada for public use, according to Health Canada’s website. Canada is also not currently stockpiling human avian flu vaccines, but this could change in the future, according to federal health officials.“The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has proactively met with pandemic influenza vaccine suppliers (e.g., GSK, Seqirus and Sanofi) with whom we have an agreement for domestic or off-shore vaccine manufacturing to discuss pandemic influenza vaccine preparedness activities in order to inform steps that could be taken against avian influenza,” a PHAC spokesperson told Global News in a Friday email.“These activities include obtaining an H5N1 candidate vaccine virus, and the possibility of producing pre-pandemic vaccine if and when production capacity is freed up from producing the seasonal influenza vaccines.” Story continues below advertisement The bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species in scores of countries since 2020. It was detected in U.S. dairy herds in March, and since then at least three people — all workers at farms with infected cows — have been diagnosed with bird flu, although the illnesses were considered mild.But earlier versions of the same H5N1 flu virus have been highly lethal to humans in other parts of the world. Officials are taking steps to be prepared if the virus mutates in a way that makes it more deadly or enables it to spread more easily from person to person.

Health Matters: Asthma linked to memory deficits in children Health Canada talks Radon Action Month While it is rare for the virus to spread to humans, experts warn that it could mutate and become more transmissible, posing a significant health threat due to its potential lethality.“The bird flu has surprised us over and over and over,” said Kerry Bowman, a professor of bioethics and global health at the University of Toronto. “People didn’t predict it would jump to mammals and that mammals would give it to each other. But then look what happened.”Canada has increased its surveillance of bird flu in dairy cows and milk. As of May 24, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has also confirmed that Canada’s milk supply remains free of avian flu fragments after testing came back negative.Although the risk may be low, and the virus has not been detected in Canada, experts like Maxwell Smith, a bioethicist at Western University in London, Ont., believe it’s never too early to start preparing for a potential bird flu pandemic. Story continues below advertisement “It’s much easier and much preferable to intervene now, even though the risk is very low at the present moment for transmission into humans, ” he told Global News.“Even though we will have to spend some resources now and make a little bit of an investment and think about these questions, it’s far better doing that now than having to address the questions that will emerge if there were a human-based pandemic of H5n1.” 2:13 Health Matters: 3rd case of bird flu confirmed in U.S. 'We need to have vaccines' A lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that we never want to be too late in preparing for a potential pandemic, warned Dr. Shayan Sharif, an avian immunologist and associate vice president of research at the University of Guelph. Story continues below advertisement “Should we be thinking about [vaccines]? Yes, absolutely. It’s always good to be prepared,” he said. “The virus is not a pandemic at the moment, and we want to make sure that it would never become a pandemic. But if it does, then we need to have vaccines, and vaccines would need to be tested for their safety and for their efficacy. And all of those things would take some time, and we want to be prepared for that possibility.”He added that while it takes time to distribute doses within Canada if we have learned anything from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is that vaccinating people in one country alone is not sufficient to eradicate the disease.

So we need to have plans in place for not only vaccinating Canadians, but also vaccinating the entire world,” Sharif said.Bowman mentioned that Canada has the infrastructure to manufacture these vaccines but is not activating it at this time.One reason, he highlighted, is that doing so would disrupt the production of seasonal influenza vaccines for the 2024 and 2025 seasons, which is crucial for Canadians.“If we go into high gear with mass production, it’s going to knock out the preparation for the flu vaccines for, late 24 into 25,” Bowman said. “We won’t have the capacity [for both].” Story continues below advertisement Another hurdle with vaccines is ensuring they are made with the current strain of H5N1, which could mutate again. Similar to the influenza virus, bird flu viruses are capable of rapid genetic changes through mutations. 2:17 Australia, U.S. report second bird flu cases in humans Where do other countries stand? Trending Now One person is dead and 16 are injured after a shooting at Tuskegee University How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins The U.S. government has a stockpile of H5N1 vaccines and has partnerships with three pharmaceutical companies: GSK, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi. These companies have seasonal influenza production capacity and say they would be able to scale up production of avian flu vaccines if needed, according to the Associated Press. Story continues below advertisement On May 30, CSL Seqirus announced that it was in the works to manufacture and deliver around 4.8 million doses of pre-pandemic vaccine that is “well-matched to the H5 of the currently circulating H5N1 strain.” It is estimated to be complete in the late summer of 2024.CSL Seqirus, located in North Carolina, manufactures an FDA-approved cell-based H5N1 vaccine called Audenz.And the pharmaceutical company Moderna already has a bird flu mRNA vaccine in very early-stage human testing. In a statement, Moderna confirmed that “we are in discussions with the U.S. government on advancing our pandemic flu candidate,” the Associated Press reported.These messenger RNA vaccines are made using a small section of genetic material from the virus. The genetic blueprint is designed to teach the body how to make a protein used to build immunity.Similar work has been going on at Pfizer. Company researchers in December gave human volunteers an mRNA vaccine against a bird flu strain that’s similar to — but not exactly the same as — the one in cows. Since then, researchers have performed a lab experiment exposing blood samples from those volunteers to the strain seen in dairy farms, and saw a notable increase in antibody responses, Pfizer told the Associated Press. 2:16 WHO says Bird flu risk to humans an ‘enormous concern,’ but what should you know? Billions of vaccines could be produced, WHO says In the event of a bird flu pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that it is on standby, ready to trigger and ramp up vaccine production for the virus. Story continues below advertisement Speaking at a media conference on May 8, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, director of pandemic preparedness with the WHO, said although there has not been any human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, there is a system in place.“And through those systems, there’s an ongoing risk assessment of the viruses, looking at the viruses themselves, the different mutations, the characteristics of those viruses. And through that system, there are candidate vaccine viruses that are recommended to be considered for production,” she explained.“Within that system, we have two that are H5N1 viruses that could be used to ramp up vaccine production. We have not triggered that system yet.”However, she added that the WHO has access to real-time production of these bird flu vaccines. If production is triggered, there there are “billions of vaccines that could be produced within the first year if necessary, based on the manufacturing technologies that we have. “When asked why vaccines aren’t available now, Dr. Michael Ryan, who leads the WHO’s response to disease outbreaks, explained that while vaccine candidates are in place, it’s imperative that they work against the current strain.He added that producing billions of bird flu vaccines would hinder the production of influenza vaccines.“We produce hundreds of millions of seasonal flu vaccines every year that we would have to switch production. So it’s not you can just press the button will begin producing pandemic H5 vaccines. You have to stop producing your seasonal vaccine.” Ryan said. “This requires a very careful consideration.” Story continues below advertisement — with files from the Associated Press and Global News’ Katherine Ward Journalistic standards Comment Report an error © 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

(Reuters: Mariana Nedelcu)abc.net.auews/who-says-australia-human-case-of-bird-flu-followed-india-travel/103954424Link copiedShareShare articleIn short: The WHO has confirmed Australia's first human case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu was contracted by a child who had travelled to India last month.The health organisation said no close contacts in Australia or in India had developed symptoms as of May 22.What's next? It advised the public to continue to avoid contact with live animal markets or farms, but advised against introducing travel or trade restrictions based on this event.The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed the child who contracted Australia's first human case of a "severe" subtype of bird flu was likely exposed during a trip to India last month.The WHO said on Friday, local time, that genetic sequencing showed the avian influenza virus was H5N1 — a strain that circulates in South-East Asia and has been detected in previous human infections and in poultry."Although the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, the exposure likely occurred in India, where the case had travelled, and where this clade of A(H5N1) viruses has been detected in birds in the past," it said in a statement.The two-year-old girl from Victoria had travelled to Kolkata in India's state of West Bengal from February 12 to February 19, returning to Australia on March 1, the WHO said.The child was hospitalised on March 2 and remained there for more than two weeks before making a "full recovery", according to Victoria's health department. The WHO said, as of May 22, no close family contacts in Australia or India had developed symptoms."Additional information provided by the family indicates that the case did not travel outside of Kolkata, India, and did not have any known exposure to sick persons or animals while in India."What do we know about Australia's bird flu case?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Two different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria. Here's what to know about bird flu, its risk of transmission to humans and what precautions to take against its spread.Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Clare Looker, had previously said it was unclear how the child had picked up the virus, but noted when humans contracted H5N1, it was usually from exposure to poultry."So either visiting poultry farms or live wet markets, which have birds at them, or if they've had a lot of contact with domesticated birds," she said."Occasionally, people can also get it from handling the meat or eggs of infected birds."We couldn't identify a clear event that led to this child's infection, but we suspect it's one of those things."Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said while it would be difficult to do months after the fact, an investigation was needed to see if the child was in contact with poultry or other birds."H5N1 viruses do not transmit efficiently between humans and I suspect there's an occult animal exposure that led to the infection," Dr Adalja said.WHO advises against travel restrictionsThe WHO said human infection of H5N1 can cause "severe disease" and has "a high mortality rate". From 2003 to 2023, a total of 246 cases of human infection with H5N1 have been reported from four countries within the western Pacific region, according to the WHO. Of these cases, 138 were fatal."These A(H5N1) influenza viruses, belonging to different genetic groups, do not easily infect humans, and human-to-human transmission thus far appears unusual," the WHO said."As the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas, the potential for further sporadic human cases remains."The organisation advised the public to avoid contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets and farms, as well as live poultry or surfaces that might be contaminated by poultry droppings."WHO advises against implementing travel or trade restrictions based on the current information available on this event," it said. "WHO does not advise special traveller screening at points of entry or other restrictions due to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface."It said any person who had exposure to potentially infected animals or contaminated environments, and who felt unwell, should seek health care promptly and limit exposure to others.Editor's note (08/06/2024): This story was updated to give the correct location of Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal, not in western India.ABC/ReutersPosted Fri 7 Jun 2024 at 10:23pmFriday 7 Jun 2024 at 10:23pmFri 7 Jun 2024 at 10:23pm, updated Sat 8 Jun 2024 at 4:07amSaturday 8 Jun 2024 at 4:07amSat 8 Jun 2024 at 4:07amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.
