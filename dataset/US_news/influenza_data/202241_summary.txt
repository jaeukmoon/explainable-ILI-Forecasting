Causes: The flu is caused by influenza viruses, specifically types A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics, while influenza C causes mild respiratory symptoms. There are various subtypes of influenza A based on proteins on the virus's surface, with H1N1 and H3N2 being the most common subtypes for seasonal flu in humans. Influenza D mainly affects cattle.

Symptoms: The flu affects the throat, nose, bronchi, and sometimes the lungs. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headache, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Complications: Influenza can lead to various complications, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions. Complications can include pneumonia, sinus and ear infections, inflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle tissues, and worsening of chronic medical conditions.

Treatment: Treatment for the flu usually involves rest, fluid intake, and over-the-counter pain relievers to reduce fever and relieve symptoms. Antiviral medications may be prescribed for severe cases or those at higher risk of complications. Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections like the flu but may be prescribed if a bacterial infection develops as a complication.

Prevention: The best way to prevent the flu is by getting an annual flu vaccination. Vaccination is recommended for everyone older than 6 months, including pregnant women. Other preventive measures include practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Impact: The flu has a significant global impact, with an estimated 1 billion cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually. In the United States, there were approximately 35 million cases, 380,000 hospitalizations, and 20,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season. Understanding the history and patterns of flu can help inform public health measures and vaccination campaigns to reduce the burden and severity of future flu seasons.
