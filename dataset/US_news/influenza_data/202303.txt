During fall 2022, many states reported increased respiratory virus activity earlier than is typically observed. Information was limited about the impact of early influenza activity. What is added by this report? After several low-severity influenza seasons, the 2022–23 season in Tennessee has been characterized by earlier activity, higher rates of pediatric hospitalization, and a higher rate of symptomatic illness among children than among adults or during past seasons. What are the implications for public health practice? To prevent influenza and severe influenza complications, all persons aged ≥6 months should get vaccinated, avoid contact with ill persons, and take influenza antivirals if recommended and prescribed.

This report describes a field investigation conducted in Tennessee during November 2022, following reports of increasing influenza hospitalizations. Data from surveillance networks, patient surveys, and whole genome sequencing of influenza virus specimens were analyzed to assess influenza activity and secondary illness risk. Influenza activity increased earlier than usual among all age groups, and rates of influenza-associated hospitalization among children were high in November, reaching 12.6 per 100,000 in children aged <5 years, comparable to peak levels typically seen in high-severity seasons. Circulating influenza viruses were genetically similar to vaccine components. Among persons who received testing for influenza at outpatient clinics, children were twice as likely to receive a positive influenza test result as were adults. Among household contacts exposed to someone with influenza, children were more than twice as likely to become ill compared with adults. As the influenza season continues, it is important for all persons, especially those at higher risk for severe disease, to protect themselves from influenza. To prevent influenza and severe influenza complications, all persons aged ≥6 months should get vaccinated, avoid contact with ill persons, and take influenza antivirals if recommended and prescribed.* The field investigation was conducted in November 2022 to understand early influenza activity in 14 of 95 Tennessee counties clustered in middle Tennessee and to identify groups most affected.† Weekly, age group–stratified data on emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI-ED) and influenza-associated hospitalizations were obtained from the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) and FluSurv-NET surveillance systems,§ respectively, and were compared with data from previous influenza seasons.¶ For influenza-associated hospitalizations, a probability distribution constructed from the three highest weekly rates from each previous season (2) was used to define age group–specific intensity thresholds for the 50th (medium), 90th (high), and 98th (very high) percentiles. Hospitalization data from previous seasons were adjusted for underdetection using data on age group–specific testing practices; 2022–23 season data were not adjusted. All surveillance data were restricted to October 2, 2022–January 7, 2023, reported as of January 12, 2023. Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the Mid-Cumberland Regional Health Department clinics provided the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) with information about persons who received testing for influenza. These data were merged with influenza vaccination records for the current season obtained from the Tennessee Immunization Information System. Persons who received a positive or negative influenza test result during November 4–18, 2022, were invited to complete a survey asking about their illness, which was facilitated by REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at TDH** (3,4). Those who received a positive influenza test result were invited to complete a second, follow-up survey 1 week after their test to inquire about illnesses in household contacts.†† VUMC clinics provided influenza-positive specimens collected during November 4–18 to CDC for whole genome sequencing to characterize circulating influenza viruses. Factors associated with positive influenza test results in patients who received testing at participating clinics were identified using logistic regression. Characteristics of household contacts were compared using logistic regression accounting for household clustering. Secondary attack rates for symptomatic illness among household contacts with adjustment for age, vaccination status, and household size were assessed with a chain binomial model, assuming a 2-day infectiousness period, beginning at symptom onset, and a 2-day incubation period (5). Descriptive and regression analysis of outpatient data was conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute), and the chain binomial modeling was conducted in C. This activity was reviewed by CDC, TDH, and VUMC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§ During October 2, 2022–January 7, 2023, ILI-ED visits and influenza-associated hospitalization rates began increasing and reached high levels earlier than in recent influenza seasons. These trends were most evident among persons aged <18 years, with ILI-ED visits in this group accounting for 31% of all visits during the week ending November 26, 2022 (previous seasons’ peak levels range = 14%–34%). Weekly pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations reached 12.6 per 100,000 children aged <5 years and 6.9 per 100,000 persons aged <18 years, exceeding the 90th percentile (high intensity) and approaching the 98th percentile (very high intensity) of peak weekly rates for children reported during previous influenza seasons (Figure). In comparison, among persons of all ages, ILI-ED reached 15% of all visits (previous seasons’ peak range = 5%–13%), and influenza-associated hospitalizations surpassed medium intensity. Among 4,626 persons from participating outpatient clinics who received influenza testing during November 4–18, 2022, a total of 2,164 (47%) were children, who were more likely to receive a positive test result (33%; 714 of 2,164) than were adults (20%; 483 of 2,462) (p<0.001). Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was low in both children (23%; 499 of 2,164) and adults (34%; 830 of 2,462) who were tested for influenza. Among 332 specimens with completed sequencing data, 179 (54%) were classified as A(H3N2)3C.2a1b2a.2, and 153 (46%) as A(H1N1)pdm096B.1A5a.2; all were genetically similar to vaccine components.¶¶ Among 489 persons who responded to the survey (11% of 4,626 patients contacted for the survey), 269 (55%) were reported as children. Among 238 persons surveyed who had a positive influenza test result within 48 hours of symptom onset, 109 (46%) received influenza antiviral medication. Children were less likely to be treated (41%; 63 of 155) than were adults (55%; 46 of 83) (p = 0.03). One hundred eighty-five persons with influenza completed the follow-up household survey.*** Among their 480 household contacts, 151 (31%) reported having any illness before or after the respondent’s illness, among whom 83 (55%) reported symptoms of fever and either cough or sore throat consistent with influenza-like illness. From a univariate logistic regression model, household contacts reporting any illness were more likely to be children (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.45–2.35) or share a bedroom with an ill person (OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 2.59–2.80) during the week before or after the respondent’s positive influenza test date compared with contacts who were not ill. In the transmission model, children were more likely to become ill than were adults (adjusted OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.55–4.03) (Table). After adjustment for household size and reported vaccination status, the secondary attack rate was 11.9% (range = 6.1%–22.0%) among child contacts and 5.1% (range = 2.7%–9.4%) among adult contacts. Top Discussion Influenza activity in Tennessee during the 2022–23 season began earlier than in previous seasons, and the percentage of outpatient visits for influenza and the rate of influenza-associated hospitalization among children have been high. This investigation found that children seeking outpatient care were more likely to receive a positive influenza test result than were adults, and that pediatric influenza-associated hospitalization rates in late November reached levels similar to peak activity during recent high-severity influenza seasons. Together with the finding that, among household contacts, secondary illnesses occurred more frequently in children than in adults, these results suggest that children are experiencing an increased impact of influenza during the 2022–23 season. Influenza activity appears to have been declining in Tennessee and nationally since early December 2022; however, influenza continues to circulate and several weeks of the season remain (6). Although anyone can be infected with influenza viruses, young children, older adults, and persons with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for influenza-associated morbidity and mortality (7). Seasonal influenza vaccination remains the best way to protect against influenza and influenza-associated complications, including among children. All persons aged ≥6 months should receive a seasonal influenza vaccine to protect themselves for the remainder of the influenza season. In addition, everyday preventive actions, such as reducing interactions with persons who are ill; avoiding others when ill; avoiding touching one’s mouth, eyes, and nose; frequent handwashing; and wearing facemasks when respiratory virus circulation is high, can help reduce the risk for becoming infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. The rates of influenza-associated hospitalization in Tennessee, especially among children, were higher during October–November 2022 than during the same months in recent influenza seasons. The hospitalization rates among children in Tennessee are similar to those seen nationally among children (8). Influenza antiviral medication should be prioritized for hospitalized persons and all patients at increased risk for influenza complications (including children aged <2 years and persons with certain underlying medical conditions); these medications can reduce the risk for influenza-associated complications (9). The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, these findings are limited in generalizability because the population represents a sample from middle Tennessee recruited over a period of 2 weeks in November, and only 11% of invited participants completed the survey. Second, this early season assessment might not be indicative or predictive of the remainder of this influenza season. Third, because Tennessee does not require reporting to the state immunization registry, vaccination status might be underestimated. Fourth, survey participants were recruited from among clinic patients and likely represent a subset of the population with more access to health care services. Finally, the transmission model assumes that ill household contacts had influenza, which might overestimate infection because other respiratory viruses were also circulating. In Tennessee, the 2022–23 influenza season has been marked by early and intense activity, particularly affecting children, with higher rates of pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations than have been reported in recent influenza seasons. As the influenza season continues, it is important for all persons, especially those at higher risk for severe disease, to protect themselves from influenza. To prevent influenza and severe influenza complications, all persons aged ≥6 months should get vaccinated, avoid contact with ill persons, and take influenza antivirals if recommended and prescribed.

The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE) captures emergency department visits statewide; analysis was restricted to the same eight counties. Survey data were collected from two clinic networks in middle Tennessee, including the same eight counties as well as Houston, Humphreys, Maury, Montgomery, Stewart, and Trousdale counties. § ESSENCE is a syndromic surveillance system that captures weekly percentages of ED visits with an influenza-specific diagnosis code or chief complaint suggesting influenza-like illness. FluSurv-NET is a population-based surveillance system that identifies weekly rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations within the catchment area. ¶ For ESSENCE data, comparison seasons included 2017–18 through 2019–20 and 2021–22. For FluSurv-NET data, comparison seasons included 2012–13 through 2019–20 and 2021–22. The 2020–21 influenza season was excluded from both comparisons because of minimal influenza activity. ** The survey was provided in the region’s most frequently spoken languages (Arabic, English, or Spanish) and facilitated by REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at TDH with a Twilio application programming interface. Survey participants could access the survey online through a link provided by text message to their mobile telephone. In addition, TDH- and VUMC-affiliated employees called invited participants and offered the survey by telephone. †† The follow-up survey asked about sex, age, and influenza vaccination status of household members, whether they slept in the same room as an ill person, and whether they were ill the week before or after the participant received influenza testing. If an ill household member was reported, additional questions were asked about onset date and symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, and body aches. Responses from participants whose household members had already participated were excluded. §§ 45 C.F.R. part 46, 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. Sect. 241(d); 5 U.S.C. Sect. 552a; 44 U.S.C.

Modulation within the immune system is important for eliciting a protective response, and the optimal response differs according to vaccine formulation and delivery. For both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) lower levels of IL-8 were observed in post-vaccination sera. Post-vaccination antibody levels were higher and IFN-γ levels were lower in IIV sera compared to LAIV sera. Subjects who suffered breakthrough infections after IIV vaccination had higher levels of sCD25 compared to the control group. There were differences in LAIV post-vaccination interleukin levels for subjects who subsequently suffered breakthrough infections, but these differences were masked in subjects who received concomitant vaccines. Wide variances, sex-based differences and confounders such as concomitant vaccines thwart the establishment of specific cytokine responses as a correlate of protection, but our results provide real world evidence that the status of the immune system following vaccination is important for successful vaccination and subsequent protection against disease.

For many vaccines, including inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), there is a correlation between antibody titers elicited by the vaccine and vaccine efficacy. Knowledge about the role played by other parts of the immune system is limited and more information is needed to provide a framework for understanding the biological mechanisms driving vaccine efficacy1,2. For example, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have been licensed based on efficacy without a correlate of protection (CoP). In seasons when vaccine efficacy is unusually low, it is more challenging to identify possible causes without correlates. When a CoP is available, as in the case of the IIVs, it is easier to identify other immune signals that track with the correlate, but these are often quantified with respect to antibody titers not vaccine efficacy. In addition, differences in innate immune status prior to vaccination also affect antibody responses to vaccination3,4. Here we investigate post-vaccination cytokine levels in subjects that subsequently suffered influenza infections and compare these to matched control groups.Influenza viruses cause respiratory disease that results in significant seasonal morbidity and mortality in humans5. Influenza viruses affect other mammalian and avian species and occasionally jump from one host species to another but, for the most part, the genera currently afflicting humans are influenza A (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B. Vaccines are available that provide protection against these subtypes. However, the viruses continually evolve, and changes in the antigenically dominant viral hemagglutination (HA) protein led to a decline in protection. Currently available vaccines require yearly updates so that the antigenic components better match the circulating strains.IIV and LAIV are manufactured differently and have different routes of administration. LAIV are administered intranasally where the live attenuated virus engages the immune system in mucosal tissues. Although there are indications of localized inflammation and increased antibody secreting cells after vaccination6,7, LAIV does not have a CoP. In contrast, most IIV are administered intramuscularly, and the antigenic components of the vaccine are processed in proximal lymph nodes. Antibody-secreting plasmablasts are prevalent the following week and elevated levels of activated B cells persist for several weeks8. These different methods of engaging the immune system both result in protection against disease through different (but perhaps not exclusive) mechanisms. The protection elicited by IIV correlates with antibodies that target the major viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin. However, it has been shown that some cytokine levels are also associated with changes in antibody levels. For example, Wang et al.9 found that post-vaccination IL-10 levels correlated with antibody increase. Similarly, Krakauer and Russo10 observed lower IL-10 levels 30 days post-vaccination for IIV recipients who failed to reach protective antibody titers, but the difference didn’t reach significance in their study.The immune mechanisms underlying LAIV vaccine effectiveness remain poorly understood. A marker of inflammation, CXCL10 (IP-10), has been shown to increase after LAIV vaccination6. Both the innate and humoral arms of the immune system respond to LAIV but engagement of each arm varies depending on the recipients age and prior exposure to influenza11,12. The innate response is guided by pattern recognition receptors that detect virus and the engagement of T-cells by the antigen presenting cells. This leads to the induction of cytokines and chemokines from T helper 1 (Th1) cells (TNF, IFN-γ, IL-2), Th2 cells (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and T follicular helper (TFH) cells (CXCL10)13. Although LAIV leads to an increase in influenza-specific interferon producing cells it has not been possible to correlate interferon, or other individual immune markers, with protection14. Influenza antibody titers are more pronounced toward strains encountered in the first decade of life15. The 2009 pdmH1N1 strain differed from the preceding seasonal H1N1 strains and was more closely related to contemporary swine viruses16. The presence of cross-protective antibodies in older adults, and a greater T-cell response after vaccination compared to younger adults demonstrate the importance of both arms of the immune system in an older population17,18.Randomized clinical trials involving tens of thousands of subjects are necessary for demonstrating vaccine efficacy but have limited ability to link vaccine mechanism and effectiveness. Here we turn the traditional approach on its head by first identifying breakthrough infections in a population and then linking those to stored serum samples drawn post-vaccination. Cytokines in these samples were compared to matched controls. Soluble (s)CD25 serum levels correlated with breakthrough infections for subjects receiving IIV, and IL-6 levels correlated with breakthrough infections for subjects receiving LAIV. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the impact of sex and concomitant vaccinations. For subjects that suffered breakthrough infections, regardless of vaccine modality and antibody titer, changes in post-vaccination serum cytokine levels were identified that correlated with subsequent infection, indicating that vaccine efficacy could be improved with better understanding of patient post-vaccination immune status.ResultsDifferences in post-vaccination cytokine response for IIV and LAIVThe Department of Defense (DoD) routinely collects and stores serum samples from service members and these are linked to medical surveillance and administrative health care data19. Serum samples are used in this prospective study to compare cytokines from vaccine recipients who subsequently suffered breakthrough infections with matched healthy subjects. There were 106 samples associated with IIV breakthrough infections and 150 samples associated with LAIV breakthrough infections (Supplementary Table 1). The same number of samples from matched individuals were identified and included in the study. From these 512 subjects 87 were identified with serum samples obtained within 6 months prior to vaccination (pre-vaccination samples). We compared the mean pre-vaccination cytokine levels from a subset of the subjects with the post-vaccination levels from four groups; IIV Case, IIV Control, LAIV Case and LAIV Control (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We first sought to determine if changes in cytokine levels observed in our cohorts were comparable with existing studies. Although high levels of inter-subject variability are observed, the sample size in each group resulted in the detection of several significant differences. The mean levels for IL-8 and TNF-α are lower in all groups with either vaccine modality (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The significance is more notable for IL-8 (p < 0.001 for all groups) than for TNF-α (p < 0.05 for the two IIV groups and the LAIV Case group but no significance for the LAIV Control group). We and others have reported reduced post-vaccination levels for IL-8 and TNF-α20,21,22. Martin et al.23 reported downregulation of IL-8 gene expression in PBMCs after vaccination with either IIV or LAIV, and an association between decreased serum TNF-α and lack of seroconversion after LAIV vaccination. The mean serum levels were also lower in all post-vaccination groups for IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10 and BAFF (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1) but only reached levels of significance for some groups (described with respect to breakthrough infections below). Serum IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α levels have been shown to drop below baseline levels in mice 24–48 h after receipt of inactivated influenza vaccines by McDonald et al.24. Pre-vaccination antibody titers were observed for both the seasonal H1N1 vaccine strain (A/Brisbane/59/2007) and the pandemic H1N1 strain (A/California/07/2009) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This is in line with prior vaccination or exposures and the observed spread of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus in the USA by late 200925. Higher post-vaccination log2 HI titers for both A/Brisbane/59/2007 and A/California/07/2009 were observed the IIV Case and Control groups and to a lesser extent for the LAIV Case and Control groups (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These results are in line with other studies and indicate the suitability of the prospective study design to investigate differences in post-vaccination cytokine levels.Figure 1Overview of experimental design. First, case subjects with an influenza diagnosis during the 2009/10 influenza season were identified. Second, stored sera samples taken 1–21 days post-vaccination (IIV, inactivated influenza vaccine, or LAIV, live attenuated influenza vaccine) were selected. Third, where available, sera samples drawn within 6 months prior to vaccination were selected. Fourth, post-vaccination samples from matched control subjects with no record of ILL were selected, along with pre-vaccination samples where available. For most analyses the 87 pre-vaccination samples were treated as one group and compared to each of the four post-vaccination groups.Full size imageFigure 2Comparison of pre-vaccination and post-vaccination cytokine and antibody levels. Serum cytokine measurements (pg/mL) are shown for IL-8 (a) and IFN-γ (b). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers (log2) toward the A/California/07/2009 strain are shown in (c). The mean value for each group is shown with standard deviations. *p-value < 0.05; **p-value < 0.01; ***p-value < 0.001.Full size imageWe observed different trends in post-vaccination cytokine levels associated with each vaccine modality. For example, although mean IFN-γ levels trended lower for all four post-vaccination groups, the difference from the pre-vaccination mean was significant for the IIV groups but not the LAIV groups (Fig. 2). We observed that IL-1β and CXCL10 post-vaccination levels trended higher for both LAIV groups but not the IIV groups (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Changes in cytokines observed during influenza infection might be expected to align with differences after vaccination with live attenuated vaccines. Higher levels of the serum cytokines, including CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL3 (MIP-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α, have been reported in patients infected with influenza26. In contrast to infected patients described by Othumpangat et al.26 the LAIV post-vaccination sera from subjects in our study had lower IFN-γ and TNF-α levels compared to pre-vaccine levels (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This might reflect a difference in the host control of an attenuated virus compared to a wild strain. A large difference between the IIV and LAIV vaccine modalities was observed with IL-1β levels; the levels for both IIV groups were lower, and the levels for both LAIV groups were higher than the pre-vaccination group (0.37 and 0.39 pg/mL for IIV Case and Control groups respectively, 0.72 and 0.67 pg/mL for LAIV Case and Control groups respectively versus 0.52 pg/mL for the pre-vaccination group). IL-1β gene expression in PBMCs was shown to be expressed at lower levels after IIV vaccination in children23. However, the IL-1β inter-subject variability was high in our results and these differences were not significant (Supplementary Fig. 2). Some changes in cytokine level are more acute, while others persist for days or weeks. Temporal differences have been described IIV and LAIV vaccinations, particularly for CXCL1027, and these described below. These data confirm that cytokine responses differ depending on the vaccine modality and that, even with high inter-subject variably, these differences align with previous descriptions even with serum sampled over a range of days (1–21 days post-vaccination) rather than at a fixed timepoint post-vaccination.Post-vaccination cytokine levels correlate with breakthrough infectionsWe specifically undertook these analyses to identify differences in cytokine profiles between subjects who suffered a breakthrough infection and those who did not. Identifying correlates other than specific antibody titers may led to improved vaccines or vaccination strategies1,13. Mean sCD25 serum cytokine levels for subjects who received an inactivated vaccine were significantly higher in the IIV Case group (315 pg/mL, p < 0.05) and significantly lower in the IIV Control group (272 pg/mL, p < 0.05) than pre-vaccination levels (293 pg/mL) leading to a greater difference between the IIV Case and Control groups (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). IL-8 levels were significantly lower in the IIV Case group compared to the IIV Control group (21.7 pg/mL versus 31.5 pg/mL, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). In contrast, neither sCD25 nor IL-8 levels differed significantly between LAIV Case and LAIV Control groups, and post-vaccination sCD25 levels did not differ significantly from pre-vaccine levels in either LAIV post-vaccination group. This indicates that post-vaccination sCD25 and IL-8 levels might be useful in predicting IIV vaccine success.Figure 3Differences between case and control groups. Serum cytokine measurements (pg/mL) are shown for sCD25 (a) and IL-6 (b). The sCD25/IL-1β ratios were calculated for each subject and are shown in (c). The mean value for each group is shown with standard deviations. *p-value < 0.05; **p-value < 0.01; ***p-value < 0.001.Full size imageFor subjects receiving LAIV vaccination there is no established correlate of protection, but we observed trends suggesting regulation of interleukins plays an important role. We observed significantly lower levels of IL-6 in the LAIV Control group (0.62 pg/mL) compared to either pre-vaccination (0.81 pg/mL, p < 0.05) or LAIV Case levels (0.76 pg/mL, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 2). Mean IL-10 levels in the LAIV Control group were also significantly lower than the pre-vaccination levels (0.31 pg/mL versus 0.37 pg/mL, p < 0.05) but, as the mean IL-10 levels for the LAIV Case group (0.35 pg/mL) were slightly lower than the pre-vaccination levels, there was no significant difference between the LAIV Case and Control groups (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, CXCL10 (IP-10) levels in the LAIV Case group were significantly higher than the pre-vaccination levels (8.38 pg/mL versus 7.63 pg/mL, p < 0.05) but, as the LAIV Control levels were also higher than the pre-vaccination levels (7.99 pg/mL), there was no significant difference between the two groups (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, like the LAIV Control group, the IIV Case group had lower IL-6 and IL-10 levels. These results indicate that modulation of the interleukin response is important for efficacious LAIV vaccination, and that it differs from the regulation of the immune response required for efficacious IIV vaccination.We also looked for combinations of cytokine responses associated with breakthrough infections. As described above, there were differences in mean sCD25 levels post-vaccination between the IIV Case and IIV Control groups but not between the LAIV groups. In line with cytokine changes after receipt of inactivated vaccine described by others23,24, IL-1β post-vaccination levels are slightly lower than the pre-vaccination levels (0.52 pg/mL) for both the IIV Case group (0.37 pg/mL) and IIV Control group (0.39 pg/mL) but these differences do not reach a level of significance (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast the mean LAIV post vaccination titers are slightly higher but do not reach a level of significance (LAIV Case, 0.72 pg/mL; LAIV Control, 0.67 pg/mL) (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). When we analyzed the sCD25/IL-1β ratio we observed that values for the IIV Case and LAIV Case groups were significantly higher than the pre-vaccination mean and corresponding Control groups (Fig. 3): The mean sCD25/IL-1β ratio for the IIV Case group is higher than the pre-vaccination ratio (1095 versus 665, p < 0.01) and the IIV Control group (1095 versus 849, p = 0.05), and the mean ratio for the LAIV Case group is higher than the pre-vaccination ratio (945 versus 665, p < 0.05) and the LAIV Control group (945 versus 650, p = 0.01). This indicates that certain combinations of post-vaccination cytokine response may be predictive of either IIV or LAIV vaccine success. However, as described below, some cytokine levels (including IL-1β) change gradually over time which may hinder the usefulness of this approach.There is high variability in cytokine levels amongst individuals and this is reflected in the broad variance in our data (Figs. 2, 3). We investigated if the variability was affected by the timing of the blood draw. We observed a correlation between some cytokine levels and the number of days post-vaccination that the serum was collected. Most of the significant correlations were observed in LAIV data (see Table 1 below). This observation aligns with another study: Gradual temporal changes in cytokine levels were reported for live attenuated vaccines but not inactivated vaccines27.Table 1 Temporal association between cytokine level and number of days post-vaccination. Spearman correlations are shown for results with p-values less than 0.05 for the Case and Control groups according to vaccine modality.Full size tableClinical trials that follow a small number of subjects over a series of hours or days post-vaccination have been published21,22,27. While these studies are valuable in assessing changes in immune function after vaccination, they are not directly linked to vaccine success or breakthrough infections. The work by Weiner et al.27 highlights the acute increase in CXCL10 (IP-10) serum levels during the first 2 days after receipt of inactivated vaccines in contrast to the more gradual increase over 7 days observed after receipt of live attenuated vaccines. Similarly, we observed a correlation between the number of days post-vaccination that serum was collected and cytokine level. Correlations were observed for several cytokines in the LAIV groups but for only one cytokine in the IIV group (cytokines with Spearman correlations p values < 0.05 are provided in Table 1). The more significant correlations were negative correlations with the CCL2 and CCL3 in the LAIV Control group and IL-1β in the LAIV Case group. The trends were similar for CCL2 and CCL3 in the LAIV Case group but did not reach significance (− 0.169, p = 0.054, df = 129 and − 0.166, p = 0.074, df = 120 respectively). We observed a positive correlation between the day of blood draw and CXCL10 (IP-10) serum levels for the LAIV Case subjects (0.177, p = 0.044, df = 128) and a non-significant negative correlation for the LAIV Control group (− 0.148, p = 0.088, df = 131). We observed a negative correlation between the day of blood draw and BAFF (p < 0.05) for the LAIV Control group but not the LAIV Case group or either IIV group. These correlations indicate that temporal changes in post-vaccination cytokine levels tend to be associated with LAIV rather than IIV vaccinations.Differences between male and female post-vaccination responsesMales and females are known to respond differently to influenza infection and vaccination28,29. We performed subgroup analyses to determine if there were differences in cytokine levels between the groups that might provide insight into these differences. The majority of serum samples available for analysis were from male subjects with only 13% (79/599) from females. There were seven cytokines for which the mean levels of both the pre- and post-vaccination sera differed significantly (p-values < 0.05) between male and female samples: TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-8, IL-10, CCL2, CCL3 and sCD25. The pre-vaccination levels for all of these cytokines except IL-10 were significantly lower in the female datasets compared to the male (Supplementary Fig. 3). Even with different baseline cytokine levels several of the patterns remained for both sexes. Different patterns were observed for IFN-γ, IL-8, CCL2 and CCL3.The mean pre-vaccination IFN-γ levels for females (0.92 pg/mL) was much lower than that for males (2.17 pg/mL). All post-vaccination mean levels were higher than the mean pre-vaccination level for females and lower for males. The trend of higher IFN-γ levels in the LAIV groups compared to the IIV groups persisted for both sexes with no significant difference between the respective Case and Control groups. The pre-vaccination IL-8 levels were lower in females but lower post-vaccination IL-8 levels were still apparent for the Control groups for when both sexes were analyzed separately (males, p < 0.001; females, p < 0.05). Interestingly, the mean IL-8 levels for the IIV Case groups were significantly lower (p < 0.05) for females and higher (p < 0.001) for males than the respective IIV Control groups. In addition, the LAIV Control levels were significantly higher than LAIV Case levels (p < 0.01) for females.Although pre-vaccination CCL2 levels were lower in females than males (132 pg/mL versus 188 pg/mL), the post-vaccination levels for both IIV Case and Control groups were similar among the sexes (175–192 pg/mL). This resulted in significantly higher relative post-vaccine titers for the female IIV groups but not for the males (or combined datasets). There were no significant differences between the pre- and post-vaccination CCL3 levels for the combined data or when males were analyzed separately. However, higher CCL3 levels for the female LAIV Control group and lower levels for the IIV Control group resulted in significant differences between Case and Control groups for both IIV and LAIV (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively).A similar pattern was observed with TNF-α levels for both men and women even though the absolute levels were lower for females. Post-vaccination TNF-α levels were lower than pre-vaccination averages for both IIV Case and Control groups for both sexes, but the significance was lost in the smaller female dataset. The mean TNF-α levels for females in the LAIV Control group were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the LAIV Case groups. For IL-10 the mean pre-vaccination levels were higher in females, but similar differences were observed for IIV groups from pre-vaccination levels; significantly lower levels in the IIV Case groups and similar levels for IIV Control groups.Although female pre-vaccination sCD25 levels were lower than male (208 pg/mL versus 301 pg/mL) the trend for higher levels in the IIV Case groups compared to IIV Control observed in the combined dataset persisted in both subgroups but was not significant for the female dataset. Of note, while the sCD25/IL-1β ratios were higher for the IIV and LAIV Case groups than Control groups for the total dataset, this pattern was lost for the male IIV groups and female LAIV groups.Analysis of outliersIt might be expected that if a sample had an outlying value for one cytokine, then other cytokines from that sample might also skew higher or lower from the rest of the group if the subject had an underlying medical condition at that time. We were interested if specific samples were broadly responsible for wide variances observed. We found that 75% of samples had an outlying value for at least one of the 15 cytokine measurements (Fig. 4) and of those 16.8% had six or more cytokine measurements that were outliers. These outliers are spread among the different groups: Of the 76 post-vaccination samples with six or more outlying values 36 were from Case sera and 40 from Control sera; 36 from IIV sera and 40 from LAIV sera. This indicates that the presence of outlying values was not associated with the type of influenza vaccine, nor breakthrough infections.Figure 4Relationship between outlying cytokine values and number of vaccinations. The number of samples with one or more outlying value were identified (a). The Case and Control groups are compared based on the number of subjects receiving multiple vaccinations (b). The proportion of total subjects receiving multiple vaccination is compared with the portion of subjects with sera presenting 6 or more outlying cytokine measurements (yellow bars in a,c).Full size imageWe performed additional ad hoc assessments of the samples with multiple outlying cytokine levels. Of the 87 samples with outlying TNF-α values, 40 (12 pre-vaccination and 28 post-vaccination samples) also had outlying values for IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Like the samples with six or more outliers described above, these were spread throughout the different groups and included 4 paired samples and 7 matched samples. This suggests that outlying levels for these cytokines may persist in some subjects and that the matching criteria may have paired subjects with common characteristics associated with outlying values.The distribution curves for Control and Case subjects were similar with regard to the number of vaccines concomitantly administered (Fig. 4). We checked to see if similar vaccines were administered to subjects with outlying TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 values. Of the 28 subjects with post-vaccination samples, seven had records indicating receipt of only the influenza vaccine, and all but three of the remainder had anthrax and/or tetanus vaccines administered concomitantly with the influenza vaccine. Anthrax vaccination has been shown to increase TNF-α levels30 and tetanus vaccination increases IFN-γ levels31. For all sera samples there were 118 records (20% of all sera samples) indicating anthrax vaccination during the 30 days prior to the blood draw, and 14/118 had six or more cytokine measurements that were outliers. Similarly, there were 124 records of tetanus vaccination prior to blood draws representing 21% of all sera samples and 16/124 were associated with multiple outliers (including 6 that had also received anthrax vaccinations within the same timeframe). Anthrax and Tetanus vaccinations are known to lead to changes in cytokine levels30,31,32. From the limited medical data included with the serum samples for this study we observed that the distribution of subjects presenting > 6 outlier values differed from the distribution of all subjects according to the number of concomitant vaccines (Fig. 4). This indicates that receipt of multiple vaccine may be associated with a range of cytokine measurements beyond the normal range in the DoD population.Effects of concomitant vaccinationWe performed subgroup analyses based on receipt of any other vaccine 30 days prior to influenza vaccination or between the influenza vaccination and the post-vaccination blood draw (Supplementary Fig. 4). The subgroups were fairly evenly split with 47% of the post-vaccination samples from subjects without additional vaccines and 53% from subjects receiving concomitant vaccines. Within those groups the splits between Case and Control groups for each vaccine modality were also fairly even (from 46 to 54%).Differences in antibody titers were observed between the groups with or without additional vaccinations. There were no significant differences in HI titers before and after vaccination for the LAIV groups for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 vaccine strain recommended prior to the pandemic (Supplementary Fig. 4). There were slightly higher titers in the IIV Control groups (p < 0.05) with or without additional vaccines. The IIV Case group with concomitant vaccination had a significantly higher post-vaccination titer (p < 0.001) that was not observed for the IIV Case group receiving IIV alone. Hemagglutination inhibition titers for the A/California/07/2009 strain recommended in the first year of the H1N1 pandemic were significantly higher (p < 0.001) for both IIV Case and Control groups regardless of additional vaccine receipt or not (Fig. 5). Interestingly, there was a difference in A/California/07/2009 titers in the LAIV Case groups associated with receipt of additional vaccines. There were significantly higher titers for the LAIV Case (p < 0.01) and Control (p < 0.05) groups when no additional vaccine was administered but titers were lower in the LAIV Case group receiving concomitant vaccines that resulted in a significant difference between these LAIV Case and Control groups (4.7 versus 5.7, p < 0.01). These data indicate that concomitant vaccination may have contributed to a back boost for A/Brisbane/59/2007 HI titers in the IIV Case group and a reduced A/California/07/2009 antibody response for the LAIV Case group. But these differences in antibody cannot be the sole factor in subsequent breakthrough infections because similar numbers of breakthrough infections were observed in the groups not receiving additional vaccines where there were no differences in mean antibody titer between those Case and Control groups.Figure 5Antibody and cytokine values with (a–c) or without (d–f) concomitant vaccinations. Hemagglutination inhibition titers (log2) toward the A/California/07/2009 strain are shown in panels (a) and (d). Serum cytokine measurements (pg/mL) are shown for CCL3 (b,e) and sCD25 (c,f). The mean value for each group is shown with standard deviations. *p-value < 0.05; **p-value < 0.01; ***p-value < 0.001.Full size imageConcomitant vaccination alters the cytokine responses, especially for subjects receiving LAIV. Analysis of the subgroup not receiving additional vaccines revealed significant differences in post-vaccination CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL10 levels (p < 0.05) that resulted in differences between the LAIV Case and Control groups (p < 0.05) not observed in the subgroup receiving additional vaccines (Fig. 5, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 4). CCL2 and CCL3 are induced by inflammation and CXCL10 is an interferon protein so we next compared the pro-inflammatory cytokine and IFN-γ levels. There was no difference in IFN-γ levels between the LAIV Case and Control groups with or without concomitant vaccination. However, there was a significant difference in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-1β and IL-8 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01) when the LAIV Case and Control groups without concomitant vaccines were compared (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The same pattern was observed for IL-6 and IL-10 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 respectively). In contrast, in the subgroup receiving concomitant vaccines the trend was lost (IL-6 and IL-10) or reversed with IL-1β and IL-8 levels significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the LAIV Control groups compared to the LAIV Case groups (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that additional vaccines affect post-vaccination cytokine levels compared to LAIV administration alone. As there were similar numbers of breakthrough infections among the two subgroups (with or without concomitant vaccines) these differences in post-vaccination cytokine levels by themselves cannot account for subsequent susceptibility to breakthrough infection.Distinctions between IIV Case and IIV Control groups remained apparent regardless of concomitant vaccination for most cytokine levels. In the subgroup analysis the pattern remained the same for sCD25 levels although the significance for the difference between the IIV Case and IIV Controls was not as strong as seen with the complete dataset (p < 0.01 for concomitant vaccines and p < 0.05 for no additional vaccines compared to p < 0.001 for the complete group) (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 4). The trend for higher sCD14 levels in the IIV Case groups compared to the IIV Control groups remained but the significance was reduced (p < 0.05 for IIV alone, p = 0.17 in the concomitant subgroup) (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The pattern remained the same with lower IFN-γ levels observed in the IIV Case and Control groups with or without receipt of additional vaccines (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 4). These data indicate that, although concomitant vaccination affects post-vaccination cytokine levels, post-vaccination sCD25 levels are indicative of subsequent susceptibility to breakthrough infections.DiscussionIn this study we have identified serum cytokines levels that changed after vaccination and describe differences in cytokine levels in subjects that subsequently suffered breakthrough infections. Mean cytokine levels differed from pre-vaccination levels for both IIV and LAIV groups for several of the assayed cytokines. There was a trend for reduced cytokine levels after either vaccine modality (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α) while some, such as IL-1β and CXCL10, increased after LAIV vaccination but not after IIV vaccination. We also report differences between the Case and Control groups demonstrating the important role cytokines have in successful vaccination. Large variances in cytokines levels may be indicative of different immune challenges among subjects at the time of vaccination. In our cohorts, receipt of additional vaccines masked some differences between Case and Control groups, especially for LAIV recipients.The humoral response is characterized by the formation of antibodies which play an important role in protection from disease. Antibody titers are used as a correlate of protection for IIV and a connection between antibody titers and BAFF cytokine levels has previously been demonstrated. Hill et al.33 observed a negative correlation between antibody and BAFF levels after vaccination an adult population linking B cell stimulation to antibody production. We also observed a decrease in post-vaccination BAFF levels and higher antibody titers for the IIV groups but not the LAIV groups confirming this association for inactivated influenza vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the IIV Case and Control groups had the same mean post-vaccination antibody titers indicating that something beyond the antibody titer contributes to vaccine efficacy. Our investigation of post-vaccine cytokine levels indicates that control of the immune response, inflammation in particular, plays a significant role in vaccine induced protection.Beyond antibody production, the parts of the immune response needed for an efficacious vaccine are less well characterized34. Temporary increases in IFN-γ and CXCL10 have been observed after mRNA vaccination35. We also observed higher CXCL10 levels after vaccination and other responses specific to the type of vaccine received. Cytokine levels have been measured before and after LAIV vaccination by others36. Like Stein et al.36 we did not observe significant differences in the mean pre- and post-vaccination for IFN-γ, CCL2 (MCP-1) or CCL3 (MIP-1α) levels after LAIV vaccination. Both TNF-α and IFN-γ levels trended lower after LAIV vaccination in line with the results from Stein et al.36. TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were significantly lower after IIV vaccination indicating more robust modulation of that part of the immune response with IIV administration (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). This trend persisted with IIV subgroups receiving additional vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 4) but not for IFN-γ in the female subgroup with lower pre-vaccine levels (Supplementary Fig. 3). Higher CXCL10 levels after both IIV and LAIV influenza vaccination have previously been reported6,22,27,36. Weiner et al.27 showed that the change in CXCL10 levels differ between IIV and LAIV, with an acute response for IIV and a more sustained change for LAIV. This is also reflected in our data with higher mean CXCL10 levels after LAIV compared to IIV (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, a positive temporal correlation between CXCL10 levels and timing of the blood draw post-vaccination was observed in the LAIV Case group but not the LAIV Control group (Table 1). This suggests that a return to normal levels was abrogated in the Case group. Changes in gene expression in PBMCs after receipt of IIV or LAIV in children also included upregulation of CXCL10 and downregulation of IL-6 after LAIV (Ref.23, Supplementary Table 3) as was observed in the young adult population studied here (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). In another study, more than 10% of samples from an adult population assessed had CXCL10 or IL-6 levels below the limit of detection so statistical analyses were not performed preventing a comparison36. Several cytokines (including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 IL-1β, BAFF, IFN-γ and TNF-α) have been shown to drop below baseline levels after receipt of inactivated influenza vaccines20,21,22,24. We also observed decreases in these cytokine levels with the IIV cohort (Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The change in these cytokine levels after vaccination is the opposite of the recall response observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are stimulated37 suggesting that cytokines secreted from other cells play an important role.Our analysis of post-vaccination cytokine levels between subjects who succumbed to breakthrough infections and those who did not indicates the difference could be related to the immune status at the time of vaccination. Altered cytokine levels have been observed for different diseases or chronic conditions. Higher levels of circulating IL-6 and IL-1β have been observed in patients with chronic pulmonary sequelae, and higher circulating IL-1β and TNF-α levels are involved in signaling to repair damaged lung tissue38. Several cytokine levels trended higher in the LAIV groups than the IIV groups suggesting greater systemic inflammation after LAIV vaccination (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and CXCL10: Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2, and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). We also observed significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β in LAIV Case subgroup without additional vaccines compared to the LAIV Control subgroup. This suggests a difference in control of the attenuated virus that subsequently affected vaccine efficacy (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 4). This difference remained significant for IL-6 but not IL-1β when subjects with concomitant vaccines were included (Fig. 3). For the IIV recipient group lower levels of interleukins 6, 8 and 10 were observed in the Case group compared to the Control group with the difference reaching significance for IL-8 (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, expression of the alpha-chain of the interleukin 2 receptor (sCD25) differed significantly between the IIV Case and Control groups (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). This indicates that controlling inflammation and the activation of T-cells after vaccination plays an important role in establishing an effective response to vaccination.Individual host attributes, such as prior exposures or vaccinations, may affect the response to vaccination. However, there is a limited body of work describing how these differences affect vaccine efficacy. Many prior analyses have focused on the antibody response to repeat influenza vaccinations39,40,41. Vaccination itself alters the immune landscape at least temporally6,22,27, and possibly for months or years42,43. Receipt of additional vaccines within the same timeframe as the influenza vaccine was a prominent confounder in our analysis. We observed that subjects receiving concomitant anthrax or tetanus vaccines were more likely to have multiple cytokine values that were outliers signifying a skewed immune response. Differences were more notable for LAIV than IIV. For example, the distinction between LAIV Case and Control groups for IL-6 and CXCL10 was reduced or reversed when subjects receiving additional vaccines were assessed separately (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, and Supplementary Fig. 4). Elevated sera CXCL10 levels have previously been associated with some adverse events (large local reactions) but not others (systemic reactions) after anthrax vaccination44. Much lower levels of IL-6 were observed in the IIV and LAIV Case subgroups with additional vaccination compared to the IIV and LAIV subgroups with no concomitant vaccines in line with the decrease in IL-6 observed in mice vaccinated with anthrax45. The immune stimulatory power of anthrax toxin has been harnessed as a potential adjuvant to broaden the specificity of influenza vaccines46. It has been suggested that receiving multiple concomitant vaccines, or certain combinations of vaccines, could be a contributing factor in adverse outcomes47. However, we observed breakthrough infections in both subgroups (with or without concomitant vaccines) suggesting more complex reasons for breakthrough infections. It appears from our work that there is a correlation between breakthrough infections and cytokine levels after LAIV that is affected by concomitant vaccination. There is evidence of non-specific effects, including protection from respiratory disease, from other live vaccines in children42,48. This would suggest that some aspect of the immune response to the live vaccines is beneficial irrespective of the antigen content. We hypothesize that additional concomitant vaccines altering post-vaccination immune status may mute this effect.Our results suggest that vaccine efficacy is better with an optimal post-vaccination cytokine response but there is a lack of information connecting these parameters. An epidemiological approach comparing vaccine efficacy in populations that are more obese with populations that are less obese might collaborate some of these findings. Adjustments are sometimes made to factor in obesity when making comparisons among countries49. Differing obesity and metabolic phenotypes are associated with different post-vaccination cytokine levels even though antibody response is the same50. Despite robust antibody responses some studies indicate vaccinated obese suffer more infections51. This is not the case for all types of vaccines as higher morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 was not observed for obese subjects vaccinated against COVID-1952. Amending the immune response to vaccination by using cytokines as adjuvants has been investigated but toxicity and nonspecific effects on different T-cell populations present major challenges with this approach53,54. Other approaches such as diet modification to moderate the inflammatory response could have role in facilitating an optimal response to vaccination. Supplements that have been shown to prevent influenza infection in clinical trials are thought to achieve this effect by moderating the inflammatory response55. An awareness of links between pre-vaccination immune status and possible post-vaccination outcomes (in addition to antibody response) may be informative in selecting the optimal vaccine (or adjuvant), and optimal timing of vaccination, for individual patients.There are several limitations to our study. The population was limited to a young adult population which doesn’t bear the brunt of annual influenza morbidity and mortality. We do not know if our observations will extend to immune responses in older and younger populations where prevention of disease has more impact. The study population is a highly vaccinated one and the receipt of additional vaccines ablated several differences between Case and Control groups. Although the majority of blood draws in this population are routine, we cannot discount the possibility that the blood draws could have been initiated in response to a medical event that may have also altered cytokine levels. The timing of the blood draws with respect to the time of vaccination is not fixed as in traditional trial design and this hampers comparisons. We performed our analysis on sera samples that had been frozen and thawed at least twice. While we were able to apply the same conditions to all samples processed in our laboratory, we do not know if prior differences in sample treatment could have contributed to cytokine stability or degradation. The timing of sample collection post-vaccination covered a range of 1–21 days. Although our results are concordant with other analyses, the detection of temporal associations requires further investigation. The study was performed using samples for the 2009/10 season, the first winter season during which the 2009 pdmH1N1 strain was predominant and the likely cause of influenza infections. Cytokine responses to vaccines for an antigenically shifted strain may differ from responses to vaccines updated for antigenically drifted strains to which the body could have prior experience. Even with these limitations we provide evidence of differences in post-vaccination cytokine levels that correlate with breakthrough infections. Our identification of differences in cytokine levels that correlate with vaccine breakthrough infections for two different influenza vaccine modalities opens up new avenues for investigating and understanding how vaccine efficacy is achieved.Materials and methodsSera were obtained from the Department of Defense Serum Repository. The study was approved by the Defense Health Agency Office of Research Protections. All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations including the de-identification of samples before release.The study population consisted of service members with documented influenza vaccination between October 1st and December 15th 2009 (CVX codes 111, 140, 141, 015, 088, 123, 125, 126, 127 and 128). The first criterion is that samples from the test group were identified as influenza cases; any subject having an inpatient or outpatient medical encounter with an influenza like illness (ILI) diagnosis. These include ICD codes that indicate an infection is caused by influenza but do not state that influenza infection was confirmed (ICD-9: 079.99, 382.9, 460, 461.9, 465.8, 466.0, 486, 488.0, 488.8, 488.81,488.02, 488.82, 488.09, 488.1, 488.19, 488.89, 487.0, 487.1, 488.12, 487.8, 490, 786.2, 780.6, 780.60; ICD-10: J09–J11). However, there are strong correlations between some codes and confirmed influenza56 and some codes have been used in other studies to assess the impact of vaccination on pdmH1N1 infection57. Subjects diagnosed with influenza within 14 days of vaccination were excluded because of the possibility that they had already been infected before protection from the vaccination was achieved. The next criterion was that a serum sample was taken 1–21 days post-vaccination. Immediately after vaccination there are changes in the cytokine and chemokine levels22. We are interested in determining if there is a correlation between these signals and vaccine breakthrough infections. If available, a pre-vaccination serum sample within the six months prior to vaccination was included.The samples for the control group were matched to each test subject based on the following criteria: Type of vaccination (2009/10 seasonal or pdmH1N1); timing of blood draw relative to the vaccination (same day ± 1); any second influenza vaccine received that season (2009/10 seasonal or pdmH1N1); no evidence of an influenza like illness during the entire influenza season (no inpatient or outpatient medical encounter with ILI diagnosis (ICD-9-CM Codes: 460.xx, 486.xx, 488.xx, 490.xx, 079.99, 382.9, 461.9, 465.8, 465.9, 466.0, 487.0, 487.1, 487.8, 786.2, 780.60; ICD-10-CM Codes: B97.89, H66.9, H66.90, H66.91, H66.92, H66.93, J00, J01.9, J01.90, J06.9, J09, J09X, J09.X1, J09.X2, J09.X3, J09.X9 ,J10, J10.0, J10.00, J10.01, J10.08, J10.1, J10.2, J10.8, J10.81, J10.82, J10.83, J10.89, J11, J11.0, J11.00, J11.08, J11.1, J11.2, J11.8, J11.81, J11.82, J11.83, J11.89, J12.89, J12.9, J18, J18.1, J18.8, J18.9, J20.9, J40, R05, R50.9); and other descriptive demographic attributes like the test case sample (sex, age, race) where possible. The date and CVX codes for any concurrent vaccines received from 30 days before the influenza vaccination and demographic information (age, sex and race) were included. The exclusion criteria applied to the study population were immunosuppressed individuals (279.3), pregnant individuals (V22.0), and those with any serious active disease [e.g. cancer (140–174), congestive heart failure (428), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (496), autoimmune disease 279.49, asthma (493.90)].Cytokines were measured using 96-well multiplex plates from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) in a Luminex FlexMap 3D multiplex plate reader. The cytokines assayed were C-Reactive Protein (CRP), sCD14, BAFF/BLyS, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, sCD163, sCD25/IL-2R alpha, CXCL10/IP-10, sIL-6R alpha, IFN-γ, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, IL-10 and TNF-alpha). The serum samples were thawed and aliquoted at the appropriate dilution for the Luminex assay. All plates included standards and a control sample.Mean cytokine levels for the different groups were compared: The post-vaccination cytokine levels for the case and control groups for each vaccine modality (IIV or LAIV) were compared to the pre-vaccine group cytokine levels to identify changes in response to vaccination; the case and control groups were compared to identify differences that correlated with breakthrough infections; and the paired samples from individual subjects were visualized to assess if the individual patterns were comparable to the group data. The interquartile range (IQR, 25th–75th percentile) for the results of each cytokine for each group were determined and outliers (beyond the median ± 1.5 × IQR) were removed. Student T-tests were used to assess the significance of differences between groups.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed as previously described40. Briefly, one volume of serum was treated with three volumes of receptor destroying enzyme (RDE; Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NJ, USA) at 37 °C overnight. The RDE was inactivated by heat treatment at 56 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of six volumes of PBS to reach a final dilution of 1:10. Two-fold dilutions of the sera samples were made across a 96-well plate leaving 25 µl in the first 11 columns. PBS was added to the 12th column as a no sera control. An equal volume of virus titrated to 4 hemagglutinin units was added to the first 11 columns and the plates were incubated at room temperature to allow antibodies to bind virus. Then turkey red blood cells (RBCs, 0.5%) were added to all wells and the plates incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow time for the RBCs to pellet or agglutinate if insufficient virus remained sequestered by antibodies. The HI titer is reported as the last dilution of sera that completely inhibited agglutination.

Sightings of dead geese in neighborhood ponds are becoming sadly more common today, as the most significant avian flu outbreak in U.S. history continues its march across the country. Nearly 58 million birds have fallen to the wild waterfowl-driven epidemic, with the virus now detected in 47 states. A dog is tested for avian flu at a research site in Guatemala. Although rare, bird flu can transmit to pets. Although risk to humans remains low, surveillance programs with both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among others, have been in high gear since the outbreak’s inception last winter. Only one human case has been detected in the United States so far in a man in Colorado, one of the hardest-hit states. “While we have been lucky so far, the concern is that with these millions of infections, we could see a mutation that could make the virus more transmissible to humans and begin to cause more severe disease,” said Daniel Olson, MD, explaining the need for strong surveillance aimed at halting the economic toll and keeping the public health risk low. Olson, an associate professor of epidemiology with the Colorado School of Public Health and its Center for Global Health, studies the intersection between humans, animals and the environment, largely at a University of Colorado-associated site in rural Guatemala. One of Olson’s current projects involves evaluating the prevalence of avian and human influenza in backyard poultry. Also a pediatric infectious disease expert with the CU School of Medicine, Olson recently shared more about the outbreak and how everyone, including backyard chicken owners, can help reduce the outbreak’s fallout. Can you describe the scope of the current outbreak from a historical perspective? In terms of scale, this is now the largest and longest avian influenza pandemic in U.S. history. Over 57 million birds have died across the country, some due to influenza infection, but many due to the need to cull non-infected birds within infected flocks in order to prevent new infections. There have been only a handful of human cases ever connected to avian flu in the U.S., including one with this outbreak in a Colorado man in April. How can a person become infected? I tend to think of three main factors that determine whether someone gets any kind of infection: 1) how infectious the pathogen is to humans, 2) how much pathogen a person is exposed to, and 3) how susceptible the person is to an infection (i.e. do they have a normal immune system?). So far, the virus hasn’t been highly infectious to humans, and no transmission in the U.S. has occurred between humans. The one documented human case from Colorado was in an individual who was actively culling poultry infected with influenza, so it was a very high-risk exposure. This individual had mild symptoms, was treated with oseltamivir and recovered. Yet the CDC says it is carefully monitoring the situation. Can you expand on that? The reason the CDC is watching closely is that the virus could mutate and become more infectious to humans. Just like we’ve seen with SARS-CoV-2, if the virus develops a mutation that allows it to infect humans, that is an evolutionary advantage to the virus, and it will allow that strain to spread more efficiently and cause lots of disease. In addition to the single mutations (antigenic draft) that just happen over time, influenza viruses also have the ability to have big “re-assortments” in which large sections of the virus recombine to create new, very different viruses (antigenic shift). This happens when two different types of influenza virus infect the same host. So for example, a human and avian influenza virus might infect the same host, and the segments of the virus recombine to make a new virus. In some cases, the new virus might include parts of the avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease or that humans haven’t seen before. It may also include parts of the human influenza virus that allow infections in humans. This is the type of big mutation we saw with 2009 pandemic H1N1, also known as swine flu. By conducting surveillance and culling of poultry, we can also limit the economic and environmental impacts of the epidemic, which are significant. Have there ever been human outbreaks of avian flu in other countries? There have been some clusters, or small outbreaks, of avian influenza in humans, which included human-to-human transmission. These clusters did not result in any sustained transmission. Again though, the fear is that if the virus becomes better adapted to humans, we could see sustained transmission in people. In terms of pandemic potential, avian influenza is up there at the top of the list. People have died from avian influenza, so it has the potential to be a severe disease. What are public health experts doing, specifically, to help make sure an outbreak doesn’t happen here? The most important thing public health officials are doing is communicating to the public on how to protect themselves against infection. In particular, whether you have a backyard chicken coop or a 1 million bird flock, there is clear guidance on the Colorado Parks and Wildlife and CDC websites for safe practices on proper handling of poultry. In addition, they are conducting surveillance in both wild birds and poultry, and they are trying to prevent transmission within these flocks. Unfortunately this means that if an infected bird is found, they often have to cull the other birds that were exposed. Are bird hunters or owners of backyard chickens at more risk? What should they do? Anyone who is exposed to wild birds or poultry is at greater risk. But again, the level of exposure matters. So a person with three backyard chickens is at significantly lower risk than someone at a large poultry farm. No matter the case, there are certain practices that can reduce the risk of transmission. While full PPE, which includes masks, googles, gowns, gloves, etc., may be difficult for the typical backyard chicken coop owner, the main goal is to prevent exposing yourself (especially your eyes, nose and mouth) to any secretions from chickens. And while more is always better in terms of prevention, certainly a mask and gloves/washing hands is better than nothing. Another important way to prevent infecting your own backyard flock is to quarantine any new poultry (CDC recommends at least 30 days) before they are introduced to other birds. Any sick or dead bird should be considered infectious and handled carefully. And finally, cooking poultry meat appropriately ensures any infected meat can’t spread the virus. Why is it so important from a public health perspective that chicken owners and everyone be alert and responsive regarding this issue? The more you can reduce the number of avian influenza infections out there, the lower the risk that the virus will mutate or re-assort itself to become adapted to humans and cause an outbreak in humans. An avian influenza virus adapting to humans is one of the most likely scenarios for the next global pandemic, and it could be just as bad or worse than COVID-19. Limiting infections also reduces the number of bird deaths, reducing the economic cost and impact on wild bird populations. How long do you expect this epidemic to continue? It is hard to say. The previous largest avian influenza pandemic lasted half a year, and we’re nearly twice that. As we learned with COVID-19, it’s very difficult to predict what will happen next. The best we can do is be prepared in case it gets worse. If the outbreak goes away, we’ll at least be ready for the next pandemic to come through.

A man weighs and checks his flock of white turkeys at his family's farm last year in Townsend, Del. The turkeys have been kept under shelter to prevent exposure to avian influenza.Nathan Howard / Getty Images fileJan. 18, 2023, 8:57 PM UTCBy Denise Chow and Evan BushThe worst outbreak of avian influenza on record is threatening to stretch into a second year, as the U.S. races to contain a virus that has already caused some food prices to soar amid a shortage of eggs.Nearly 58 million birds from commercial and backyard flocks have been wiped out in the U.S. since last February, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Experts say the virus, known as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, has been difficult to contain because it appears to be more prevalent in wild birds now than during previous outbreaks — a development that also makes future infections more likely. And while the risk of the virus spilling over into humans remains low, scientists say communities will feel the consequences of such a serious and lengthy outbreak for months to come.“As it is now, this is the largest animal emergency that the USDA has faced in this country,” said Gino Lorenzoni, an assistant professor of poultry science and avian health at Pennsylvania State University.More than 40 million egg-laying hens have been culled in the U.S. alone, causing the price of eggs nationwide to skyrocket, Lorenzoni said. Months earlier, the “bird flu” outbreak drove the cost of turkey meat to record highs. The virus can take commercial poultry farms out of commission for extended periods. “They have to remove dead birds, disinfect their facility and bring new birds in — that’s a several-month process to do that,” said Kevin Snekvik, the executive director of the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Washington State University. “That’s when production of eggs is hammered.”Eggs on a shelf at Pioneer Supermarkets in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Thursday.Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images fileEfforts to prevent infections in commercial and backyard flocks are ongoing, but slowing the outbreak has been challenging because the virus seems to have gained a foothold in species of wild birds, said Biao He, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine.As these birds migrate, crisscrossing continents and oceans, they can carry the virus with them. “That’s how the virus can go from Asia to Europe to North America — all the way around the world,” He said.Poultry can become infected through direct exposure to wild birds but more likely from fecal matter that contaminates the ground around farms or yards. Once that happens, entire flocks typically need to be culled.“The virus transmits very, very rapidly within the flock, so even if birds don’t appear sick, they will eventually die very soon,” Lorenzoni said. “The best way to stop the spread of the disease is if we eliminate all the birds that are in close contact with the contaminated birds.”Rescued chickens gather last year in an aviary at Farm Sanctuary’s Southern California Sanctuary in Acton, Calif.Mario Tama / Getty Images fileMonitoring and prevention of avian influenza has improved since the last major outbreak in 2015, Lorenzoni said, when roughly 50 million birds were killed over six months. The USDA’s “Defend the Flock Program” includes, for instance, information on biosecurity measures and how to spot signs of illness.Still, the scale of the spread is putting strain on animal health laboratories. Suresh Kuchipudi, the interim director of the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, said three animal testing laboratories in Pennsylvania are processing several thousand samples each week. His lab is largely operating seven days a week. “The spread is much more complex than what we normally predict,” Kuchipudi said. “Nothing like this has happened in the past and the question is — what has changed?”The virus’s prevalence in the wild presents new challenges for its containment. Many migrating birds are not sickened by bird flu, which means it’s not well understood just how widespread it is in the wild, Lorenzoni added.Local weather conditions also influence how the virus spreads. The sun can, for instance, naturally disinfect surfaces while gloomier days help viral particles survive on surfaces contaminated by infected bird poop, Lorenzoni said.And if the outbreak lingers into spring, infections could become even more difficult to prevent as a new wave of bird migrations begin.There are also concerns that the virus could mutate as it continues to spread or infect other animals. Though experts have said the virus rarely infects humans, HPAI has been detected in mammals such as skunks, raccoons, harbor seals, red foxes and bears, according to the USDA.If allowed to spread unfettered, the pathogen could evolve in such a way that makes it more devastating or harder to control. “A virus is single-minded: It has to replicate, to reproduce,” He said. “With all those replications, it can accumulate a lot of different changes. This is happening as we speak, and this is why I’m afraid influenza is going to be with us for a long while.”Denise ChowDenise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News.Evan BushEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

Nathan Howard/AP hide caption toggle caption Nathan Howard/AP With COVID, flu and cold viruses spreading widely this winter, researchers looked into whether you can get infected with more than one at once. Nathan Howard/AP If you're like most Americans, someone in your family or social circle is sick right now with COVID, flu, a cold or RSV. With the rolling waves of sickness hitting many households, some people are wondering: Could I have caught more than one of these germs at the same time? The answer is: Yes, it can happen. There's plenty of evidence of people testing positive for, say, COVID and the flu or flu and RSV simultaneously. "Absolutely, you can catch more than one virus at the same time," says Dr. Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Northwestern University. Sponsor Message "We've had kids that have actually had three different viruses. Some of them come in with RSV. They've also had influenza and enterovirus. There have been other kids who have presented with COVID and influenza." The risk for multiple infections is especially high this year because so many viruses have been surging together. "It's kind of perfect storm for co-infections," Tan says. It's unclear just how often this happens because most of the testing for this sort of thing is done on hospitalized patients, who probably aren't representative of the general public. But some studies have found co-infections in up to 20% of those patients. The risk, however, doesn't appear to be the same for everyone. Children appear to be far more likely to get more than one bug on top of the other, especially very young kids, researchers say. "About 20% of infants less than six months of age hospitalized with the flu have had co-infection with RSV," says Dr. Shikha Garg, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number drops to about 13% of kids six months to 2 years old and less than 5% for 5 years and up. The reason children are more prone to co-infections is unclear, but there are theories. Sponsor Message "It could be just because they're constantly being exposed to respiratory infections," says Amanda Jamieson, who studies viruses at Brown University. "But it could also be that they're immune systems just haven't built up the immunity that older people have." That said, co-infections can occur at any age, especially among older people and others with weaker immune systems. At the same time, there is growing evidence that co-infections can be more serious then just getting sick with one virus at a time. In fact, a new CDC study released Wednesday finds that's the case. The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, involving more than 4,000 hospitalized kids found those who had COVID plus another virus, such as a cold virus, were significantly more likely to require oxygen to help them breathe and to end up requiring intensive care. "We found that children under five had about twice the odds of having severe illness when they had a [ who led the study. "The children under two who had RSV were twice as likely to have severe illness compared to children who just had COVID and not RSV also." The results underscore the importance of testing patients hospitalized with respiratory infections to make sure they're getting the right treatment, Agathis says. The reason why co-infections would be more severe that isn't entirely clear, but it could be because multiple infections cause more inflammation and because different respiratory viruses damage the lungs in different ways. "It's almost as though you're getting punched more than once, and that can make you sicker," says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. The best thing people can do to reduce the risk is all the things people have been doing the last few years to protect themselves from infection during the pandemic: Get vaccinated, against both COVID and the flu; wash your hands a lot; and wear a mask in crowded, poorly ventilated places and around sick people. "Getting vaccinated with influenza and SARS-CoV2 vaccines and staying up to date on that is critical for protecting children as well as community and family members," says Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. "Staying home when you're sick is critical." tripledemic coinfection Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorCanine Influenza: How to protect from the dog fluSkip to main content HomeLocalSportsAVL BizAsheville SceneOutdoorsVoices & ViewsLifestyleNewslettersObituariesWeatherTraveleNewspaperArchivesCrosswordsComicsFor SubscribersContributor Content How to protect your dog from canine influenzaChristian Smith Asheville Citizen TimesShow Caption Hide Caption Protect your dog from canine influenzaThe Asheville Humane Society shares tips on how to prevent canine influenza in your dog.WochitASHEVILLE - Despite reopening for adoption, the Asheville Humane Society is warning that canine influenza, also called "dog flu," is still spreading in Buncombe County.The H3N2 canine influenza virus spreads through tiny virus-containing droplets that spray out more than 20 feet in the air when infected dogs sneeze or cough and can live on surfaces for up to 24 hours, according to a University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine fact sheet. Symptoms of the virus include fever, coughing, sneezing, lethargy, reduced appetite and nasal or eye discharge, which can take up to seven days to appear and may last up to three weeks. Cats can also be infected, but humans cannot, the sheet says."We have definitely seen reports coming in from different groomers, animal hospitals and boarding facilities, but I would say we don't have a specific number of animals that have tested positive," Asheville Humane Society's Senior Marketing Manager Sarah Stapleton told the Citizen Times on Jan. 9. "In our care, we have a total of 55 dogs that have actually recovered from canine flu."The virus can be mistaken for the more common kennel cough, so dog owners should seek vet care right away if they see any symptoms. The virus spreads quickly, Stapleton said, and can cause serious problems for dogs with preexisting conditions or that are older."Even dogs who are no longer showing symptoms can transmit the virus to other dogs for up to 28 days," she said.Missing Forest Plan:Approval for a final Pisgah, Nantahala forest plan was posted online.

There is currently a vaccine shortage, so Stapleton recommends dogs get the shot as soon as possible.Seek veterinary care immediately symptoms develop.If diagnosed, avoid exposure to other dogs or dog owners.The flu shut down the Asheville Humane Society's adoption program for several weeks, and after that, the program went to reservation only. Only on Jan. 11 did the program reopened to the public, Stapleton said.All dogs adopted from the Asheville Humane Society will have already received the flu vaccine, she said, but some dogs may still not be up for adoption. Before they are cleared for adoption, each dog must be at least 21 days past when they started showing symptoms or were exposed to the flu and must test negative.More:Why are egg prices so high and will they go down?

Everything you need to know to protect your dogDog flu is on the rise in the U.S. Jan. 18, 2023, 9:42 PM UTC / Source: TODAYBy Alex PortéeIt’s not just humans getting hit with the sniffles this winter.A rapid increase in the number of documented cases of canine influenza, or dog flu, has been a cause for concern among veterinary experts and owners recently in the United States.According to Merck Animal Health USA, since December, new cases have appeared in California, Colorado, D.C., Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. TODAY.com spoke to veterinarian Dr. Cynda Crawford, who is a clinical assistant professor of shelter medicine at the University of Florida, and Dr. Edward Dubovi, a virologist who served as the director of a veterinary virology unit at Cornell University for 38 years. Both offered advice and tips on how to learn more about the contagious respiratory disease and best practices for prevention and treatment.What is dog flu, or canine influenza, and how does it spread?Dog flu, or canine influenza, is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs generated by Type A influenza viruses, and two strains of influenza exist. One is the H3N8 virus, and the other is an H3N2 virus.The National Library of Medicine defines H3N8 as a subtype of the Influenza A virus and is the primary cause of equine influenza. It emerged in greyhounds in the U.S. in 2004. According to Crawford, H3N2 is the new, current virus. H3N2 emerged in the U.S. in 2015, and it's currently causing alarm for veterinarians and dog owners.Canine influenza rapidly spreads from one infected dog to another through respiratory droplets from coughs, sneezes, and barking, says American Veterinary Medical Association. What are the symptoms of dog flu?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, signs of canine influenza include cough, runny nose, and fever. Crawford noted that other symptoms such as fatigue, eye discharge, and reduced appetite could be signs that your dog might have influenza as well.While it may seem tempting to brush off what appears to be cold symptoms in dogs, Crawford says that when it comes to canine influenza, taking signs seriously early on is crucial. Being able to identify symptoms and taking swift action to seek treatment can help your dog from worsening and can keep the disease from spreading to other dogs.How serious is dog flu?Most dogs that come down with canine influenza will suffer the typical flu symptoms mentioned above, which can persist for up to 21 days, though some dogs may have asymptomatic infections, according to the AVMA.Crawford says that in some cases, however, canine influenza will progress to pneumonia, similar to when people get the flu and should be treated with the same care.“There is a significant proportion of dogs that will progress to pneumonia, just like people infected with flu,” Crawford explains. “These dogs with pneumonias may require in-hospital care, more intensive care to help them recover just like people with pneumonia due to human influenza virus infection.”Fortunately, the AVMA describes the mortality rate for canine influenza as being low.How can you prevent your dog from getting the flu?Both Crawford and Dubovi emphasize that education is key to preventing the spread of canine influenza and keeping your pup healthy.If you have a dog-about-town — meaning your pup goes with you to stores, attends doggy care or obedience classes, and spends time at dog parks — keep yourself informed as to whether or not canine influenza is circulating in or near your community.Dubovi says that keeping track of where the disease is popping up can be as simple as firing up your phone or computer.“You can go out there and just do Google searches,” Dubovi says.However, if avoiding crowded areas with various dogs is unavoidable, Dubovi suggests looking into getting a canine influenza vaccine for your dog.According to the American Kennel Club, vaccines are available for the two known strains (H3N8 and H3N2) of canine influenza, and dogs can now receive a single vaccination to prevent both. Vaccines will take three to four weeks to provide immunity, and dogs will need a booster shot two weeks after receiving the first vaccine.Just as humans are advised to receive the flu shot every year, dogs can get vaccinated by their veterinarian to provide a higher level of protection from infection.Is dog flu contagious to humans?No human infections with canine influenza have ever been reported.However, canine influenza has infected cats, Crawford notes, citing an incident in which the flu broke out at a shelter among its dogs and caused respiratory illness in the cats.Are there tests available for canine influenza?Yes, tests are available to confirm if your dog has H3N8 and H3N2 canine influenza virus infection. If you’re concerned that your dog may have been exposed, might be ill and are aware that an outbreak has happened in your community, Crawford recommends calling your veterinarian to find out if testing should be done and how to proceed.Also, if you feel compelled to take your dog to an emergency veterinarian or clinic, Crawford says to keep in mind that canine influenza is easily spread, and bringing infected dogs into a clinic could spread the disease more. When given a heads-up, veterinarians can prepare a clinic by clearing visiting dogs from the path of an infected dog or can arrange to meet and treat a dog in their home or in the parking lot of a veterinary center.How do you treat a dog with the flu?If your dog has canine influenza, the CDC says that treatment will largely involve supportive care. Break out the water and pillows to help keep your pup hydrated and comfortable. If the flu has progressed to pneumonia, dogs may be required to stay in the hospital to receive IV fluids, antibiotics, and in some cases, oxygen therapy.Crawford says dogs infected with the flu should be restricted to in-home isolation for at least three weeks and notes that a “dog may recover and look healthy again after two weeks, but it’s contagious for at least three weeks.”Alex PortéeAlex Portée is a senior trending reporter at TODAY Digital and is based in Los Angeles.RelatedCourtesy Marissa Jo CerarHow pet rescue helped me talk to my daughter about my own adoptionEssay / Updated Nov. 11, 2024Gus Stark / LSU University Images via Getty ImagesKirk Herbstreit cries paying tribute to late service dog BenPets & Animals / Updated Nov. 11, 2024@peanut_the_squirrel12 via InstagramWhy was Peanut the squirrel confiscated and euthanized?

The three bears were euthanized due to their sickness and poor condition. These were the first documented cases of HPAI in grizzly bears. A fox and a skunk in Montana also tested positive for HPAI last year, and the virus has also been found in raccoons, black bears, and even a coyote in other states and countries.“We suspect these mammals probably get the virus from consuming infected birds,” said FWP Wildlife Veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey.Avian influenza (AI) virus is a naturally-occurring virus in birds. AI viruses are classified into two groups, based on the severity of disease they cause in infected poultry. Low pathogenic AI viruses generally cause no clinical illness, or only minor symptoms in birds. HPAI viruses are extremely infectious and fatal to poultry and some species of wild birds.Although the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention considers risk of HPAI spread to humans to be very low, Montanans are advised to take precautions when handling game birds, sick or dead birds and mammals they find. Whenever possible, avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife. Even if an animal is not suspected to have died from a contagious disease, gloves should always be worn if a dead animal must be handled for disposal.FWP staff would like to know about unusual or unexplained cases of sickness and/or death of wild birds and animals by calling their local wildlife biologist or the wildlife lab in Bozeman at 406-577-7880 or 406-577-7882.TRENDINGMontana's new rodeo queensMeet the 'Farm Dog of the Year'Dead geese in Great Falls riverFOLLOW KRTVTikTok | Instagram | Twitter Copyright 2023 Scripps Media, Inc.

A Texas A&M expert says three main factors are driving up costs — and it will take at least a few months for prices to return to normal. Texas A&M University Division of Marketing & Communications January 20, 2023 Share ShareTweet0 Shares While the ongoing outbreak of avian influenza is the main factor behind rising egg prices, factors like inflation and increased demand are also playing a significant role, says Texas A&M associate professor Gregory Archer.Laura McKenzie/Texas A&M AgriLife Communications Shoppers have recently been shelling out more and more money to get their hands on a common supermarket staple, as the price of eggs continues to climb across Texas and the United States. In the face of these higher costs, some are even considering raising their own chickens at home. And many are wondering how long they’ll have to wait for prices to go back down. To help explain these recent trends, Texas A&M Today spoke with Gregory Archer, a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension specialist and associate professor in A&M’s Department of Poultry Science. What is driving this increase in egg prices? There are multiple factors affecting the price of eggs right now: The biggest is avian influenza – over 50 million birds have been lost this year. Many are commercial layers so supply is down at least 5%. Another is inflation, which is increasing the costs of feedstuffs (corn and soybean) used in feed, and fuel (gas, diesel, electricity, natural gas) needed to transport eggs and run farms. The last is increased demand. It’s normal for the holidays to see increased egg costs (people use eggs more in bakery products). But we are also seeing increased demand due to inflation, as people are consuming eggs more instead of other protein sources which are also seeing increased costs. What will need to change for prices to fall again? Producers need to replace the lost layers. It takes a layer 20+ weeks to start laying eggs from the day they are hatched, so that’s about four to six months. It also depends on the other factors above. If more flocks are hit, inflation increases and demand continues to rise, then this could last longer. In the meantime, what is your advice for consumers? Eggs are still a very inexpensive source of nutrition. There’s not much you can do to affect the price. Hopefully avian influenza will lessen as well as feed costs. Encourage anyone you know with backyard birds to practice good biosecurity. Keep their birds away from waterfowl, which are the main transmitter of avian influenza. The sooner we are free of the disease, the sooner flocks can be restored and remain stable, which will make prices go back down. How does this price spike compare to others we have seen in the recent past? Similar increases in prices happen when demand increases around holidays like Christmas, and Easter. Historically, in 2015 prices increased due to an avian influenza outbreak like this one. But once the layers’ population was restored, the prices went down.

Rapid diagnostic tests have not yet been integrated into routine use in German primary care, even though they are likely to reduce overall costs in cases of suspected infection. This study aims to demonstrate that the use of point-of-care testing (POCT) produces lower costs of illness compared to the costs incurred by relying on clinical judgment alone. With the help of a decision tree model, two different diagnostic approaches for influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care were compared: (1) clinical judgment with no technical support and (2) POCT. The costs of illness, as well as their differences, vary widely among the three age groups considered (elderly people, adults, and children). For the pathway of using clinical judgment alone, the costs of illness sum up to 155.99 € for elderly people compared to 76.31 € for adults and 74.15 € for children. With POCT, the costs of illness for the elderly amount to 115,09 €, which is 26% lower than the costs without diagnostic support. The costs for adults and children are 74.42 € and 75.66 €, respectively, which means 2.5% lower costs of illness for adults and 2% higher costs for children. The results demonstrate that the use of POCT to support detecting influenza in ILI patients may reduce the overall cost of illness. The provided data can help governments make informed decisions about potential cost savings by integrating POCT into the reimbursement scheme.

It can lead to numerous complications, such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic diseases1. Influenza is a significant contributor to global mortality and morbidity, causing approximately 500,000 deaths per year worldwide2. In the 2017/2018 influenza season in Germany, approximately 9 million patients were registered as seeking medical care in primary healthcare settings due to influenza-related diseases. A total of 60,000 patients were registered with influenza-related hospitalizations. The public health department reported influenza-related deaths in 1129 cases3. These data indicate a serious public health problem causing a high economic burden for society.According to the WHO Manual (2016), the economic burden of a disease from a societal perspective is the sum of direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are associated with the use of medical resources (e.g., ambulatory care, hospitalization, and pharmaceuticals) usually covered by the health system payers and with individual expenditures by the patient or patient’s families (e.g., transportation to the hospital, additional food costs, and additional expenses for accommodation). Indirect costs are defined mainly as the value of lost productivity because of absenteeism from work or school that applies to patients and their caregivers during disease-related treatment and hospitalization4. Influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) contribute to loss of productivity as an indirect cost that makes up 80–90% of the total costs of illness5. The direct cost of illness, together with the productivity loss in Germany, sum up to 2.2 billion Euro per year in an average season and can even be higher in peak seasons6. The corresponding cost per confirmed influenza case was 514 € from a societal perspective and 59 € from a health systems payer perspective in 20127.It has already been shown that the routine use of rapid influenza tests and early diagnosis is likely to reduce overall costs in cases of suspected influenza in German hospitals8. The detection of influenza during a patient’s first visit to primary care allows immediate clinical decisions, including targeted antiviral treatment and infection control measures9. Early antiviral therapy reduces the risk of hospitalization, complications, or even death10. Early detection also reduces inappropriate use of antibiotics and decreases additional GP visits as well as additional diagnostics (e.g., bloodwork or chest X-rays)11,12. Timely and accurate diagnosis is also a key aspect in the prevention of virus spread13. However, distinguishing influenza from other respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms is a difficult task for physicians14. Up-to-date point-of-care testing (POCT) can help to overcome this problem. Therefore, countries such as Japan have established and integrated POCT as a standard procedure in their diagnostic pathway for influenza in primary care15.In the past, rapid diagnostic tests for influenza were not very reliable because of their low sensitivity of antigen detection16. In recent years, many more dependable new rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been developed. They are self-contained, easy to use, and can detect viral RNA in 15 min. In Germany, POCT for influenza is not yet part of the reimbursement scheme of the statutory health insurance and hence is not part of standard diagnostics.The objective of this study is to analyze differences in the cost of illness when using a diagnostic pathway supported by molecular POCT in comparison to clinical judgment in primary care in Germany. Estimates on this issue have not been published thus far. Providing data on potential cost savings can help governments make an informed decision about the potential benefits of integrating POCT into the reimbursement scheme of SHI funds.MethodsAs a direct cost-of-illness calculation, this study compared NAAT POCT and clinical judgment to diagnose influenza from a healthcare system perspective. The definition of direct costs followed the WHO Manual for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza4. A decision tree model (Fig. 1) was developed to simulate ILI patients in primary care with different diagnostic approaches. Patients directly presenting in an emergency department or an urgent care center were excluded.Fig. 1: Simplified cost-of-illness calculation model.The figure shows the decision tree and simplified cost calculation model that was developed to simulate ILI patients in primary care with the two different diagnostic approaches.Full size imageThere are two paths in the model. One depicts the patient’s path when seeing a physician using rapid testing as diagnostic support and represents the status quo of ILI treatment in Germany. The other path follows patients with only clinical judgment as a diagnostic approach. Both paths have corresponding consequential costs depending on the different probabilities of resource utilization and the prescribed therapy. The sum of the costs of each path represents the direct costs of illness for the diagnostic approach. To display the change in the probability of resource utilization, such as hospitalization or follow-up visits, odds ratios were used. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE was conducted to retrieve literature in which healthcare resource utilization with and without POC diagnostics was measured. The keywords used were “influenza”, “cost of illness”, “hospitalization”, “point-of-care testing”, and “early treatment”. The studies were selected based on the following criteria: (1) publications were written in English and German, (2) rapid tests were performed with NAAT, and (3) the study was performed in an OECD country. Furthermore, only studies published between 2010 and 2021 were selected. Since POC influenza testing is not yet common in primary care, the search was expanded to secondary care studies as well, in cases where there were no original data available from primary care. Whenever the studies used age as a discriminating factor was taken over into this study as well. All articles found were screened for relevance and applicability to the present analysis. Whenever variables were found in several publications, the weighted average was used in the calculation for the cost-of-illness calculation.Model inputsClinical parameters are shown in Table 1. This was a retrospective study that was conducted by analyzing database medical records of patients diagnosed by German office-based physicians in two influenza seasons from May 2010 to April 2012. The probability of additional GP visits was estimated to be 20% for adults and 50% for children, the probability of antiviral treatment was 5.7% for adults and 6.6% for children, and the probability of antibiotic treatment was 33.1% for adults and 16.8% for children7. A paid transport to GP probability of 6.5% was calculated based on the number of total paid transports of nonemergency ambulance rides as well as paid taxi transports (46 million)17 and the number of 709 million total visits in primary care18. Influenza-related hospital admissions based on data from German primary care practices from the 2017/2018 season were reported for adults (0.31%), children (0.3%), and elderly people (1.5%)3. The additional X-ray probability was reported to be 33 and 52% for other diagnostics in a randomized trial conducted in a pediatric emergency department and an acute care clinic19.Table 1 Clinical parameters.Full size tableThe cost parameters are shown in Table 2. The economic model calculation was conducted from the perspective of healthcare payers in Germany; therefore, pricing in local currency was used. Costs for different medical services found in reports or scientific literature, if obtained from different years than 2020, were adjusted to the base year 2020 for the inflation rate in Germany based upon the consumer price index. Costs for the initial GP visit were taken from the reimbursement catalog of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians20,21 and depended on the patient age group: 13.20 € for adults, 20.89 € for children, and 19.92 € for elderly people. Since that payment is a quarterly lump sum, the costs for follow-up visits of patients can only be taken into account if that visit happens in the next quarter. Given a uniform distribution of patient visits in a quarter and a maximum interval of 7 days for the next visit, only 4% of the follow-up visits are reimbursed and hence included in the follow-up costs. Testing costs for NAAT testing of influenza A and B are also provided in the catalog and listed at 16.50 €. As already mentioned, GPs currently are not reimbursed for POCT with ILI patients. Based on the database of the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance, the cost of transportation was taken from 2018 and inflation-adjusted estimated to be 44.27 € in 202017,22. The daily cost of antivirals of 7.66 € and 1.44 € for antibiotics for 2020 was used based on the pricing from ifap Service - Institute for Physicians and Pharmacists GmbH23. Costs per hospital stay were taken from an influenza-specific German hospital cost calculation based on representative data of publicly insured patients, including ICD-10 diagnosis and hospitalization cost data, in the period of 2013–2019. The data distinguish patients with and without ventilation in the ICU during their hospital stay. The costs add up to 36,000.00 € for patients ventilated in the ICU and 3,400.00 € for patients treated in normal wards24. Also included were reimbursable transportation costs of 452.77 € for patients coming to the hospital in an ambulance17,22. Chest X-ray costs of 16.24 € were complemented by an age-specific lump sum for each patient, both of which are taken from the German reimbursement catalog20. Costs for other diagnostics of 56.85 € were taken from a Spanish POCT study25.Table 2 Cost inputs.Full size tableThe distinction in costs of illness mainly stems from different probabilities in the follow-up treatment of ILI patients. As described above, those probabilities were taken from the literature in which the effect of POCT on follow-up resource utilization was examined. With influenza POCT in ILI patients, the probability of receiving antiviral medication is more than twice as high as that with the use of clinical judgment. This probability is, on the other hand, lower (0.6) for an antibiotic prescription. Since early testing provides the first diagnostic guidance, the odds ratios for additional diagnostics as well as follow-up visits are also lower than 1. The most cost-intensive resource in health care, hospitalization, is also strongly influenced by the adoption of rapid testing. The odds ratio of the hospitalization rate was 0.5 when comparing POCT with clinical judgment. When physicians rely on clinical judgment alone to diagnose a patient, it is twice as likely that the patient will be hospitalized. The described ratios are summarized in Table 3. They are used for calculating the changes in the probability of resource utilization for the POCT approach compared to clinical judgment and are reflected in the clinical parameters shown in Table 1.Table 3 Differences in probabilities for resource utilization comparing clinical judgment and POCT.Full size tableResultsOverview and composition of costsThe cost of illness for ILI patients presenting in primary care in Germany without a POCT-assisted diagnosis is 87.87 € (see Table 4). The three largest cost factors are additional diagnostics, the first GP visit, and the costs of hospitalization. They add up to 86% of the total costs of illness. This lies within the scope of a prior study calculating the economic burden of influenza in which direct costs added up to an inflation-adjusted 63.03 €26. That study is from 1999 and does not include transport costs or antiviral medication. Using molecular POCT to detect influenza in ILI patients, the direct costs add up to 80.83 € (see Table 4). The first two largest cost factors are the same as those in the clinical judgment approach, but the third one, namely testing costs, is unique to the POCT pathway. Together, the three sum up to 67% of the total costs. Comparing both pathways, 8% or 7.05 € lower costs for patients diagnosed with POCT can be found.Table 4 Calculation (general).Full size tableDetailed costs of illnessWhen comparing the costs of illness in detail, a rise in antiviral medication costs of 2.48 € became apparent when using molecular POCT. This result is not surprising since the precise prescription of antivirals is one of the main advantages of using POCT for detecting influenza infection. The opposite effect can be observed with an antibiotic prescription: The costs drop by 1.69 € when POCT is implemented. In relative savings in the number of prescriptions, the additional antivirals are nearly offset by the reduction in antibiotics. In absolute monetary terms, however, antiviral medication is more costly than widely available antibiotics. In addition, targeted use of medication and prevention of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions may have even a greater benefits than only decreasing health care costs directly, as it helps in reducing the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Other aspects with lower costs on the POCT diagnostic pathway are hospitalizations as well as a reduced volume of additional diagnostics.Differences between the age groupsThe costs of illness differ widely among the age groups (see Tables 5–7 for age-specific results). Using clinical judgment alone, the costs of illness sum up to 155.99 € for elderly people (aged 60+) compared to 76.31 € for adults and 74.15 € for children. With POCT, the costs of illness for elderly people amount to 115,09 €, which is 26% lower than the costs without diagnostic support, as displayed in Table 7. The costs for adults and children, as depicted in Tables 5 and 6, are 74.42 € and 75.66 €, respectively, which means 2.5% lower costs of illness for adults and 2% higher costs for children. For the elderly population, the largest cost factor is hospitalization, and the main cost driver for adults and children is GP visits. Since this visit cannot be reduced with POC diagnostics, the hospitalization rate is lowered for ILI patients when not only using clinical judgment.Table 5 Calculation (age-group specific) children.Full size tableTable 6 Calculation (age-group specific) adults.Full size tableTable 7 Calculation (age-group specific) elderly people.Full size tableExtrapolation of costsLooking at the national level the costs of illness in Table 4 for ILI patients are 800,339,641 € with clinical judgment and 736,143,912 € with POCT assistance based on the patient numbers of the influenza season 2017/18. Taking age into account, the numbers are 145,108,274 € and 148,066,319 € for children, 440,802,489 € and 429,870,865 for adults, and 214,428,877 € and 158,206,728 € for elderly people (Tables 5–7). In total, there are lower costs of 64,195,730 € when using POCT for diagnosing influenza in ILI patients. The largest cost difference lies with elderly patients, with lower costs of 56,222,149 € with diagnostic support.DiscussionCost-of-illness studies are considered an important evaluation technique in healthcare. They itemize, value, and sum the costs to provide detailed information about the economic burden of an illness. Analyzing and comparing these costs can be beneficial, especially for healthcare decision-makers, by providing important information to support the political process management functions in defining and prioritizing the health policies and interventions that are planned to be implemented. This study demonstrates that POCT in primary care in Germany produces lower costs of illness than relying on clinical judgment alone. The savings amount to 64,195,730 € for a season with 9,107,800 ILI patients or 7.05 € per patient. In the subgroups of patients with a higher risk of hospitalization, such as elderly people, early testing at the point of care has a more significant impact on reducing healthcare spending and resource utilization.The present study was limited by the fact that most of the relatively few studies looking at the consequences of introducing POCT in primary care neglect diagnostic accuracy and do not distinguish between test results and true infection status as confirmed by real-time PCR in the case of influenza. This limitation becomes especially relevant when discussing the cost effects of POCT in general without considering the testing technology (lateral flow or NAAT), which in return has a high impact on the accuracy of the diagnosis. Furthermore, the majority of the studies included in the calculation were not conducted in Germany. As described in the methods section, studies were checked for applicability to the model. However, the German healthcare system has some peculiarities, especially in the primary care sector. Many specialized doctors, such as cardiologists or pulmonologists, have their own offices independent from a hospital. Patients can go directly to these specialists without seeing their GP first and can thus receive specialist-level care without going to a hospital. This could mean that hospitalization rates in other countries do not necessarily reflect the hospital admission frequency in Germany. On the other hand, there is a financial incentive for German hospitals to admit patients to the wards when they are seen at an emergency department. Other countries have higher discharge rates from emergency care27,28. The effects run contrariwise and might cancel each other out. This, however, is uncertain and remains a limitation of the results. A possible expansion of the model would be to also look at other respiratory viruses, such as RSV or SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the medical benefits, there could also be an additional economic upside: since the underlying technology of detecting the viruses is the same as that for detecting influenza, there could be synergies in device usage and hence testing costs.In conclusion, using rapid molecular POCT to support primary care physicians in detecting influenza in ILI patients reduces the overall cost of illness in Germany. This is most significant when used for elderly patients. Fewer follow-up GP visits, fewer additional diagnostics, and a reduction in hospitalizations contribute to lower costs. Decision-makers should also consider other potential benefits that result from POCT, including a positive effect on antibiotic resistance due to fewer prescriptions as well as positive effects on labor productivity due to a shorter period of symptoms with early antiviral treatment. Correct diagnosis using early POCT may also result in more patients receiving the correct treatment. Therefore, from a societal perspective, the benefits of POCT are probably much higher than the present estimations suggest.

The support of generous community partners, agencies and donors enables Senior Friendship Centers to help more older adults in need. How are Senior Friendship Centers helping improve vaccination among older adults? A belief in “People Helping People,” has been the foundation of Senior Friendship Centers for five decades, with volunteers serving in nearly every facet of the organization. In the spirit of “People Helping People” and leveraging their community partners, Senior Friendship Centers developed key vaccine uptake strategies, applied for an NCOA COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake grant, and were the among the first senior centers to receive grant funding through this new funding opportunity. The Senior Friendship Centers in Sarasota and Venice will use the following strategies to increase vaccine uptake: Host two vaccine clinics for up to 250 adults age 50+ to receive either a COVID-19 and/or flu vaccine(s) Conduct outreach and education to 2,500 adults age 50+ years in Sarasota County Provide referral services for vaccinations to 200 adults age 50+ (referral services will include assistance with scheduling vaccine appointments and transportation to vaccine sites) Who will Senior Friendship Centers reach with vaccine support, and how? The individuals targeted for these efforts will be low-income, minority, and homebound adults age 50 and over in Sarasota County. Previous efforts by the Senior Friendship Centers to reach this population were successful in improving access to food and local benefits to pay for utilities. The two centrally located senior centers will be the hub for the Senior Friendship Centers vaccine clinics. They will partner with a local pharmacy to host vaccine clinics and publicize the clinics to older adults in the community through outreach events and by working with community partners. For current clients, staff will supply them with educational materials and identify and address barriers to receiving vaccines. Common barriers include transportation, lack of insurance, inability to pay for copayments, and being homebound. Education efforts will focus on combatting misinformation. Senior Friendship Centers have positive working relationships with several community partners, including Sarasota Health and Human Services, Sarasota Community Foundation, United Way of the Suncoast and South Sarasota, and the local area agency on aging. These partners and others will be leveraged to increase awareness and market the vaccine clinics, with the goal of reaching the most vulnerable in the community. Senior Friendship Centers have hosted flu vaccine clinics in the past through their previously operated medical clinics. Now that they no longer operate these clinics, they are working to support and assist seniors get vaccinated through other means. Their communications team will be responsible for leading the marketing efforts of this program through print, local radio, and TV advertisements, and in-person events. Other team members will be responsible for outreach and education by reaching out to currently enrolled clients and attending outreach events. This multi-pronged approach will allow for outreach and education to both current clients and those who do not receive any services from Senior Friendship Centers. Senior Friendship Centers will begin their outreach and education initiative in January and will continue to provide vaccine referral services through the end of the year. Demographic data about those receiving vaccines will be collected during their two vaccine clinics as well as for their vaccine referral, education, and outreach activities. How are Senior Friendship Centers and the Vaccine Update Initiative focusing on diversity? An important aspect of NCOA’s COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccine Uptake Initiative is assuring diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) of those receiving vaccines. Senior Friendship Centers have worked hard to promote DEI within their organization and create safe and welcoming spaces for diverse older adults in their community. For example, centers offer LGBTQ+ support groups on a weekly basis. In addition, their staff speak multiple languages and are representative of the older adults they serve. The Board has been recruiting new members who are more reflective of the racial and ethnic diversity of the older adults using the centers’ services and programs. DEI will be an integral component of the Senior Friendship Centers outreach and education efforts. What is the NCOA Vaccine Uptake Initiative? With $50 million in federal funding from the U.S. Administration for Community Living, the largest grant in its history, NCOA is providing funding and technical assistance to senior centers and hundreds of diverse community-based organizations, enabling them to conduct tailored outreach, host vaccine clinics, and offer services many older adults need to get vaccinated, such as transportation and assistance in scheduling appointments. Learn more about NCOA’s Vaccine Uptake Initiative. NCOA will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis through March 1, 2023, or until funds are exhausted. The goal of this NCOA funding opportunity is to increase the number of older adults and people with disabilities receiving COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations. The need is great in Florida. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 74% of older adults in Florida have not received the COVID-19 bivalent booster.1 NCOA is honored to support the Senior Friendship Centers in Sarasota County in their important role of increasing the uptake of vaccines among diverse and vulnerable older adults. We commend Senior Friendship Centers for helping to protect seniors from severe illness, hospitalization, and death from influenza and COVID-19. NCOA strongly encourages senior centers and other community-based organizations to apply for these grants and be part of a nationwide campaign to ensure older adults and people with disabilities get the latest COVID and flu vaccines.

Now her family gets vaccinated every year By Jacqueline Howard, CNN 6 minute read Published 7:26 AM EST, Tue January 17, 2023 Link Copied! Layla, 3, and Parker, 6, hold a photo of their half-sister, Cayden, who died of the flu in 2014. Courtesy Jessica Richman CNN — Jessica Richman felt fear rush over her – again. In October, she watched her 3-year-old daughter, Layla, become unusually lethargic, develop a high fever and start to have shortness of breath. It was a painful reminder of her other daughter, Cayden, who died of the flu in December 2014. Cayden had been the same age as Layla. “It was very similar symptoms to Cayden. So, of course, I jumped into high gear,” Richman said. When Layla’s symptoms began on Halloween, Richman took her to an urgent care clinic in their hometown of Newport News, Virginia. “Her heart rate was elevated. Her fever was very high. They kept her there for most of the afternoon to observe her,” Richman said. “I explained to the doctor that was there that I have lost a 3-year-old daughter to the flu, so this was very scary for me. He really took that to heart.” Layla’s medical team diagnosed her with influenza and gave her Motrin for her fever and the antiviral Tamiflu to treat the infection. “She felt better fairly quickly, within 24 hours,” Richman said. Jessica Richman with her family. Jessica Richman Richman’s experience during this flu season was dramatically different than in 2014, when she lost her beloved Cayden. One key difference: Cayden was unvaccinated in 2014. Layla got her vaccine in September. “I really think that the vaccine played a big role,” said Richman, who serves as secretary for the nonprofit Families Fighting Flu. Even though Layla became sick when she encountered the flu virus weeks after vaccination, “she recovered quickly,” Richman said, adding that no one else in their household – which also includes her husband, Matt, and their 6-year-old son, Parker – caught the flu from Layla. All of them had been vaccinated before Layla’s illness. ‘No one seemed to think that this was flu’ The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 16,000 people have died of flu this season, and at least 79 deaths have been in children. Seasonal flu activity continues to be very prevalent across the United States but has been declining in most areas in recent weeks. Still, public health officials encourage people to get their annual flu vaccine as the best way to protect against that virus. Young woman blowing nose and checking temperature. Konstantin Postumitenko/Adobe Stock Flu activity still high but continued to decline before Christmas, CDC data shows Many people who don’t get their seasonal flu shot are not necessarily anti-vaccination. They simply might not have had the time. That was the case for Cayden in 2014. That year, Richman and Cayden’s father got their flu shots, but Cayden’s vaccination had to be rescheduled because she had a cold at the time. “Because I also at the time was ill-informed about the flu, I didn’t feel that it was super urgent to go and immediately get her flu shot as soon as she was well,” Richman said. “I kind of put it off.” One Thursday some weeks later, Cayden wasn’t her usual talkative and bubbly self. The 3-year-old, affectionately known as CadyBug, was fatigued and developed a cough. She stayed home from daycare with her father, and he took her to the pediatrician’s office. The doctor thought Cayden’s symptoms were probably from a cold virus and sent her home without testing for the flu, Richman said. The next morning, Cayden still had a fever. She was coughing and kept asking for water. Her father took her back to the pediatrician’s office but was sent home again. “No one tested her for the flu. No one seemed to think that this was flu,” Richman said. “She was sent home that Friday afternoon.” CDC video Seasonal flu: What you need to know When they got home, Cayden’s symptoms worsened. “She deteriorated very, very fast. It was in a matter of hours,” Richman said. “It was very deep, shallow breaths. She was not breathing correctly.” Richman said that she was driving home from work when she got a chilling phone call from Cayden’s father: Cayden had stopped breathing during her nap. He had called 911. Richman arrived home to find emergency vehicles in front of her house and paramedics working on Cayden. “She could not be resuscitated at the house,” Richman said. “In the ambulance ride, they had not told me at the time that she could not be resuscitated, but I could tell because I was riding in an ambulance and there was no noise. So I knew that it was over.” When Cayden died, her parents still had no idea that it was because of the flu. “It wasn’t until we received an autopsy that I clearly understood that it was the flu that caused her lungs to fill with mucus until she could no longer breathe,” Richman said. “I had no idea what happened until we got the autopsy back.” Before Cayden’s tragic death, her mother was unaware that the flu could turn fatal. “I was completely taken aback,” she said. “I had no idea that that could ever happen.” Nearly a decade later, Richman and her family get their flu shots together each year in remembrance of Cayden. They wear pink and share social media posts about it, using the hashtag #pinkforcadybug, since pink was Cayden’s favorite color. How the flu can turn deadly The most common symptoms of flu are fever, body ache and shaking chills. In some cases, it can cause lower respiratory tract infections known as pneumonia or directly infect heart cells and brain cells, causing inflammation of those organs, Dr. Tara Vijayan, an infectious disease doctor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an email. She added that inflammation can result in the body’s own cells dying.

Treating patients with severe flu is a frequent but difficult experience for Dr. Ali Khan, who specializes in internal medicine at one of the primary care network Oak Street Health’s Chicago locations. “It is an incredibly difficult infection to watch as a clinician,” Khan said, adding that flu infections can turn deadly when someone gets a superimposed bacterial infection like pneumonia or develops severe sepsis. “We get folks who are coming in to hospitals with seizures or with encephalitis caused by the flu. Folks who are coming in with significant muscle injury and breakdown, like the kind that you get when you’re quite dehydrated and overly fatigued,” he said. “Suffice to say, I’ve seen this far too many times than I’d ever like to see as a clinician.” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. It’s not too late to get this season’s flu shot if you haven’t done so, Khan said. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” he said. “Absolutely, you can still get vaccinated.” Vijayan had similar sentiments. “Our flu rates were unexpectedly high in the late fall and it does seem to be leveling off, but I would absolutely be concerned about another rise in cases this winter,” she said. “It is absolutely not too late to get the flu shot.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Why are egg prices still so hard to crack?The eggs are expensive because the chickens are sick.by Emily StewartJan 17, 2023, 7:50 PM UTCFacebookLinkWhy eggs are so pricey, explained (sort of) by chickens. Getty Images/Peter Garrard BeckEmily Stewart covered business and economics for Vox and wrote the newsletter The Big Squeeze, examining the ways ordinary people are being squeezed under capitalism. Before joining Vox, she worked for TheStreet.A few months ago, I asked Vox readers what price increases bothered them most amid our current economic environment of high inflation. The most common answer, far and away, was eggs — a relatively small-ticket item, but a staple, and one whose price hikes were annoying as hell to many consumers. That was back in August 2022. Now, the egg price situation is even worse.According to data provided by Urner Barry, which follows the food commodity market, the average price on a dozen “Midwest large” eggs was up to $5.46 as of late December 2022, well above the $0.89 it was at at the start of 2020, before the pandemic hit, and even above other highs in the low $3 range last summer. Following the peak egg demand that comes with the holiday season, prices have started to cool off, falling back to $3.64 as of January 17.“There is almost invariably a drop in demand after the holiday baking period, which, in turn, causes wholesale prices to drop,” said Karyn Rispoli, who covers the egg market for Urner Barry, in an email. “This year’s decline has been rather sharp though because of the heights from which the market is adjusting.”Sign up for The Big Squeeze newsletterEmily Stewart’s column exposes the ways we’re all being squeezed under capitalism. Sign up here.Still, the egg prices many people are seeing at the grocery store are eye-popping. And in some parts of the country, such as California, eggs are extra pricey and in some cases, hard to find. Eggs have been part of the US economy’s inflation story for months. Beyond the cost of one individual egg at the store, you also have to remember that eggs are an ingredient in so many items, from pet food to baked goods and beyond. So when the cost of eggs rises, that can put pressure on a lot of things.So what’s going on right now? Here’s a little rundown.The bird flu is badEggs are mainly extra expensive right now because chickens keep getting sick from a super deadly avian influenza, largely spread by wild birds migrating. The last time the bird flu hit so strong, in 2015, it sent egg prices soaring. Now, that’s happening again, and it’s proving more persistent than last time around.“In 2015, the virus kind of stopped once the weather got hot and the spring migration finished, and the repopulation was fully able to get going. [In 2022], it’s come back in the fall with the winter migration,” said Brian Moscogiuri, a global trade strategist at Eggs Unlimited. “There’s a huge shortfall”As of early December, there were about 308 million “layers,” meaning hens laying eggs for consumption, in the US. That’s down from 328 million the year prior. “Typically, you need about one bird per person to have a close-to-balanced supply and demand with US consumption,” Moscogiuri said. “So we have, what, 331 million people in this country? You can see right there, there’s a huge shortfall.”As Vox’s Kenny Torrella explained, nearly 58 million birds in the US, most of them egg-laying hens, have died from the bird flu over the past year, well above the previous record of 50 million from 2015. Once a farm or facility is infected with the virus, it spreads like wildfire and is almost always deadly. Regardless, US regulations require farmers to depopulate their operations once bird flu is detected, meaning the birds with and without the virus have to be killed off.“They have to clean and disinfect the entire facility, and then they have to test [the facility] in order to repopulate [to make sure the virus is cleared],” Moscogiuri said. Egg producers have gotten better at repopulation, having learned from experience in 2015, but as mentioned, the current outbreak is much more persistent than the last. Related:Bird flu is driving up egg and turkey prices — and killing millions of animals. Why won’t we vaccinate against it?The bird flu outbreak in 2022 coincided with a hot season for eggs with consumers, leading to a bit of a perfect storm on prices. “The latest outbreak wave came at a point when the industry seasonally adjusts the egg-laying flocks to meet the increasing demand for eggs associated with the winter holiday season,” the USDA wrote in a recent research note. “Lower-than-usual shell egg inventories near the end of the year, combined with increased demand stemming from the holiday baking season, resulted in several successive weeks of record high egg prices.”Inflation is still a problem and the economy is a little wonkyWhile the bird flu is the primary cause in the current surge in egg prices, there are other factors in play, too — factors that have dogged the egg market and the broader economy for months now. Inflation appears to be cooling in some areas, but it’s still high, and a lot of things are more expensive.“Just like with all the other items in the grocery store, there’s all this inflationary pressure, with interest rates, with oil, with feed prices, with raw materials, with packaging, cartoning, transportation. You have labor issues and costs associated with labor,” Moscogiuri said.I wrote an explainer on eggs and inflation in early 2022 that got at a lot of these issues. The cost of an egg is over half feed, Sam Krouse, vice president of business development at MPS Egg Farms, which is headquartered in Indiana, told me at the time. As the costs of corn and soybean meal fluctuate, so do egg prices. Changes in the prices of fuel and packaging — cartons and corrugated boxes and plastic wrap — can impact the ultimate price of eggs. Demand affects things, too. The holiday season may be over, but Easter, another time of the year where consumers get into eggs, is just around the corner.Egg prices are starting to come back down, though what’s happening on the wholesale market is not always directly and immediately reflected in the grocery aisleIt is often more expensive to be nice to chickens, which can lead to higher prices for cage-free eggs. In California, a law went into effect last year that requires that all eggs sold in the state be from cage-free hens. Massachusetts has a new law in place tightening standards around egg production, and some corporations have made cage-free commitments as well. As the Los Angeles Times noted recently, cage-free hens can be somewhat likelier to come into contact with wild birds that can infect them with bird flu, though both cage-free and enclosed chickens have gotten the virus at similar rates. (It’s worth noting that amid the current egg market weirdness, specialty eggs have sometimes been the better deal, but that’s generally not the case.)Will eggs have a great fall?As mentioned at the top, egg prices are starting to come back down, though what’s happening on the wholesale market is not always directly and immediately reflected in the grocery aisle. As the Wall Street Journal notes, some grocery stores have tried to keep egg prices “competitive,” even if that means sacrificing some profits, because they’re a consumer staple and good for getting people in the door. For the many stores that have hiked prices, there will likely be delays in bringing them back down, too.“There is usually a two-to-three-week lag between wholesale pricing and what consumers see in terms of retail pricing,” Rispoli said. “That, however, assumes that retailers are passing those lower costs on. Since many retailers were selling eggs below cost when the market soared to record highs last month, they may be slower to react on the way down.”The good news, if you’re a real egg head (I’m sorry), is that generally there are eggs on the shelves. The Journal reports that there have been “spotty shortages” of eggs, but not one that’s highly pervasive and widespread. Some regional grocery chains in places such as North Carolina and Colorado have dealt with occasional shortages, or in some cases, specialty or organic eggs have been a little harder to come by. Overall, though, egg producers have been more nimble at repopulating their farms and recovering from bird flu outbreaks than they were in 2015.All that being said, the weather will soon start warming, meaning wild bird migration begins once again, creating more potential for infections. Producers are getting better at protecting their flocks from bird flu, but they’re not perfect. (In addition, as Torrella notes, maybe the way to be really good here is to start giving the chickens a vaccine.) In the egg world, the worry isn’t that winter is coming, it’s that spring is. “Hopefully, repopulation is continuing and more production is on its way up, and we don’t see any more [bird flu] as we go back into this spring migration again, and the worst is behind us,” Moscogiuri said. “But we really don’t know.”You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

In an epidemiological alert issued last Wednesday, PAHO stressed the importance of controlling infection in birds as the key measure to reduce the risk to humans and recommended that countries strengthen surveillance for seasonal and zoonotic influenza in animal and human populations. The Organisation also reiterated its guidelines on early laboratory diagnosis in human and animal samples and the respective investigation of cases and contacts, and recommended that these and other surveillance, prevention and control actions be carried out in coordination between the health, agriculture and environmental sectors. In the region, the influenza A(H5N1) virus was first identified in domestic and wild birds in December 2014 in North America. Since then and until the first week of January 2023, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela have detected outbreaks of this virus in domestic, poultry and/or wild birds. Infections of this virus in humans, which can often have severe symptoms, have been much less frequent. But whenever avian influenza viruses circulate among birds, there is a risk of sporadic human cases. So far, two human infections have been confirmed in the region: the first in April 2022 in the United States and the second on January 9, 2023 in Ecuador. In general, human cases are occasional and, when they have occurred, have not spread easily from person to person. However, the risk of establishing sustained human-to-human transmission exists and could eventually lead to an outbreak or even a pandemic. People at risk are those exposed to infected birds (domestic, wild or captive), such as poultry keepers and personnel involved in outbreak control. Health care workers are also at risk of infection if adequate prevention and control measures are not observed. PAHO recommends the use of personal protective equipment and other hygiene and sanitation measures.

Photograph: Mark Thomas/AlamyHealth This article is more than 1 year oldFlu and pneumonia deaths a quarter higher than usual in England and WalesThis article is more than 1 year oldFigures for December up on typical year but overall mortality rate for 2022 below average, latest data showsCarmen Aguilar García and Pamela DuncanFri 20 Jan 2023 14.43 GMTLast modified on Fri 24 Nov 2023 15.15 GMTShareAlmost 3,000 people died in England and Wales due to pneumonia and influenza in December, a quarter higher than in a typical year, in what is expected to be the worst flu season in a decade.Flu and pneumonia were the leading cause of “excess death” in England in December with 574 extra deaths, 26% above the average, while flu deaths in Wales were 11% higher and the fourth most common cause of death that month.Despite this, full-year figures for 2022 show the mortality rate fell below average for the first time since the Covid pandemic reached the UK in early 2020, with fewer people dying across the two countries last year when age and the size of the population was taken into account. Just 4% of deaths had Covid as the primary cause last year, compared with 11% in 2021.The data also shows that 14% more people died in households last year than is typical, indicating the increase in home deaths that took place during the Covid pandemic is continuing. There were 2% fewer deaths in hospitals and only 0.3% more deaths in care homes.More than 576,000 people died in 2022, an increase of 6% compared with the five-year-average – 2020 was excluded because of an atypically high number of deaths as a result of Covid – the latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows.But, when the size and the age structure of the population (the age-standardised mortality rate) is considered there were 0.7% fewer deaths in England and 1.1% fewer in Wales than the average, giving 2022 the third lowest rate since 2001.The mortality rate in 2022 was the third lowest since 2001Weekly surveillance reports published by the UK Health Security Agency show flu infections reached a three-year-high this winter.There are, however, signs that a spike in flu cases has now peaked: the latest NHS England figures showed a 35% drop in the number of beds required for flu patients in the second week of 2023 – the first significant drop in the winter to date. However, the number of 3,447 beds is still 84 times higher than in the same week in 2022.The number of critical care beds occupied by flu patients also fell slightly to an average of 221 beds in the week to 15 January. This was higher than the number required for Covid patients in the same week (191) as a combination of the prevalence of the Omicron variant of Covid and the success of the vaccine rollout has made contracting the virus generally less dangerous than it once was.Separate figures released by the ONS earlier in the week showed there were 1,383 deaths due to flu and pneumonia (as opposed to the virus/infection being a secondary cause of death) during the first week of January, the highest figure in three years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were almost 6,400 more people dying in the last month of the year than expected, up by 14% compared with the average of the last five years (5.8% up in England and 9.4% up in Wales using the age-standardised mortality rate).NHS figures show that about one in seven beds across England were occupied with Covid or flu patients at the beginning of January, with as many as one in five beds in some trusts. Bed occupancy rates were very high in most of the trusts, while a lack of social care beds meant about 14,000 beds were occupied with patients medically fit to be discharged.Some of England’s hospital trusts have more than two in five beds with a patient with Covid or influenza or someone who could be discharged to home or a care home.The figures are still small compared with the height of the pandemic, but it gives an indication of how sick some people are getting as a result of the viruses this winter.Explore more on these topicsHealthFluHospitalsEnglandWalesDeath and dyingShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘Long flu’: study finds flu patients at higher risk of longer-term illness14 Dec 2023UK detects its first human case of swine flu strain 27 Nov 2023Respiratory infection clusters in China not caused by novel virus, says health ministry26 Nov 2023England to deny Covid and flu jabs to under-65s despite fears for NHS this winter8 Aug 2023Universal flu vaccine may be available within two years, says scientist25 Nov 2022Flu season in England is worst for a decade, says health secretary9 Jan 2023Ambulance staff reportedly urged to conserve oxygen amid ‘twindemic’30 Dec 2022Flu continues to spread in England with number of hospital patients up 79%30 Dec 2022Most viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"There were 121 deaths where influenza was mentioned on the death certificate, up from 91 in the previous week."This is the highest weekly number of flu deaths registered in over 20 years."Unprecedented pressuresJillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme the flu figure was "sobering" but added that flu was now at a moderate level in Scotland."The highest number of deaths in over 20 years - a lot of that will be because we've seen so much flu," she said. "It's a small percentage but a very high number of people who were affected with flu."It's on the back of an extraordinary surge of flu incidents in the December period. "Thankfully incidents of flu have come down. It's now at moderate levels in Scotland which is very welcome. But we are seeing the effect of that surge translate now into deaths. "Every one of those could have been considered to be an avoidable death."Ms Evans said the Covid figures were also the result of an earlier surge."We know that there's a lag," she told the programme. "The numbers are high - and higher than last week - but we should start to see a stabilisation in deaths."But also, thankfully, incidents of Covid in the community are starting to come down too."More headlines from ScotlandShe said the number of people being vaccinated against flu and Covid had slowed down considerably and reminded people it was never too late to get a flu vaccination."I think vaccination is something we can all do," she said. "Let's not forget the deaths from Covid [at the beginning of the pandemic] and how vaccination has made such an impact on that."She added: "All the respiratory illness that we're seeing and people that are still in hospital just adds another layer to very busy hospitals."We're not out of the woods as far is winter is concerned and I suspect we'll not be out of the woods for several weeks yet."Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: "This year we have seen an extraordinary number of flu cases. Safe, effective vaccines for offer the best protection to those most at risk of serious illness from Covid-19 and flu and I would urge anyone eligible to get vaccinated as soon as possible."Uptake for the winter vaccine programme is very encouraging with Scotland delivering more Covid jabs per head of the population among over-50's than any other UK nation. However, although uptake is high, there is no room for complacency."The figures come 10 days after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish hospitals were almost full as she acknowledged that the NHS was facing unprecedented pressures.She said the increase in winter viruses, including flu, had played a part, along with backlogs caused by the Covid pandemic and Brexit-related staff shortages.Meanwhile, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Scotland, Dr Iain Kennedy has warned that the NHS in Scotland is "broken" and cannot survive in its current form. He called for a "national conversation" on the future of the health service.Related topicsScotlandNHS ScotlandFluCoronavirusRelated internet linksNational Records of ScotlandThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished2 hours agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished2 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

Influenza (flu) is an acute and contagious respiratory tract infection caused by influenza type A (H3N2) and type B viruses. RSV is another respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. In a statement, the Ministry of Health noted that the flu season is ongoing and will run through March. “Persons are also encouraged to remain at home until fully recovered and to wear masks to prevent the transmission of the virus if contracted,” the statement said.

In a traditional ceremony hosted by the Saint Lucia Tourism Authority, the season was officially launched with the arrival of the Celebrity Summit and Rhapsody of the Seas, bringing 4,485 passengers and 1,756 crew members to the island. Saint Lucia Cruise Port partnered with the Tourism Authority to provide lively steel pan entertainment for guests as they disembarked to create a festive welcome. Hon. Dr. Ernest Hilaire, Minister for Tourism, Investment, Creative Industries, Culture, and Information shared optimistic projections for this season’s cruise arrivals. In 2023, the port welcomed 614,980 passengers aboard 264 calls. In 2024, Saint Lucia Cruise Port expects to receive approximately 823,132 passengers aboard 459 calls. This number would surpass the current passenger record of 789,176 cruise visitors (aboard 443 calls), set in 2019. Lancelot Arnold, General Manager of Saint Lucia Cruise Port, expressed his enthusiasm during his remarks at the ceremony held at the Pointe Seraphine berth. “We are thrilled to welcome Captain Evangelos Saitis of the Celebrity Summit and Captain Per Olov Mathias Sebom of the Rhapsody of the Seas back to Saint Lucia. The start of this cruise season presents us with a wonderful opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to enhancing the guest experience, supporting our cruise line partners, and collaborating with local industry stakeholders to ensure our mutual success. We are looking forward to a busy and exciting cruise season with a positive outlook for our company and community.” Representatives from Invest Saint Lucia, Export Saint Lucia, the Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority, and Foster & Ince/Platinum Port Agency also participated in the event.

These events, held in early October, were designed to inform and engage residents about the project, which focuses on reconstructing safe educational and cultural spaces as part of Sint Maarten’s ongoing recovery efforts post-Hurricane Irma. This phase of the FRLP includes rebuilding Sister Marie Laurence and Charles Leopold Bell schools, as well as reconstructing the St. Maarten Library. With the demolition of the three buildings approaching, the consultations provided a platform for neighborhood residents, educators, and community representatives to ask questions, share any concerns and provide input on different aspects of the project. Attendees discussed how the project might affect their communities and offered suggestions for improvements. At the Sister Marie Laurence premises in Middle Region, the project team reassured neighborhood residents concerned with demolition and noise that these issues would be addressed in the Contractor-Environmental and Social Management Plan (C-ESMP), a plan designed to mitigate and reduce any negative effects on both the community and the environment during construction. This plan will include measures to maintain road access and traffic flow, whilst also minimizing disruptions such as noise and dust pollution. The project team explained that the C-ESMP would be finalized once the demolition contract is signed, and a start date of the demolition work is confirmed. At the St. Maarten Library session held at the John Larmonie Center, the consultation was highly interactive, with participants asking questions about future programs and the design of the new library spaces. The design firm, KS&P was present, and the FRLP project team explained that once concept drawings are ready, another meeting would be scheduled for community feedback. Residents also expressed concerns about asbestos in the old building. The project manager clarified that an external company conducted assessments, and no asbestos was found. During the consultation for Charles Leopold Bell School held at Carl’s Unique Inn, there were concerns about the safety of the school’s sports court, currently located near a busy road. The community suggested that the court be relocated to the rear of the school for improved safety. The project team explained that further discussion with MECYS would be needed, as the current mandate for the sports field focuses on repairs, rather than new construction. Additionally, some attendees were confused about a previous asbestos report. The project team assured everyone that all necessary environmental assessments had been conducted, and confirmed there was no asbestos at the three project sites. Ursel Biabiany, the Stakeholder Engagement Coordinator of the NRPB explained to the community that the NRPB remains dedicated to addressing concerns raised during these consultations and keeping the public informed. “We take the community’s feedback seriously and work closely with all project stakeholders to ensure that the demolition and rebuilding process prioritizes public safety and community concerns.” “We have made considerable efforts to engage the public, including distributing flyers door-to-door and answering questions directly. This open dialogue has led to productive feedback from the local community, which will help shape our plans moving forward.” Demolition of each building is expected to last two months, with work set to begin in early 2025. The design phase for the Library and Charles Leopold Bell School will take about seven months, wrapping up by the second quarter of 2025. Following the design phase, contractors will be selected according to World Bank procurement guidelines, and construction is anticipated to start in the first quarter of 2026, lasting up to a year. To address the concerns of the community, the project team will closely monitor vibrations from demolition activities. Before the work starts, assessments of nearby homes and businesses will be conducted to document their current condition. This will allow the project team to identify potential damage that could be caused during demolition, reassuring residents that their properties are protected. Claret Connor, NRPB Director, assures the community that the organization is committed to reconstructing educational and cultural facilities that meet modern standards. “These consultations have been invaluable in allowing us to engage with residents directly and take their feedback into account as we work towards delivering safer, stronger, and more sustainable public facilities that will stand the test of time.” Further consultations are planned, including private meetings for residents with specific concerns. NRPB invites continued feedback from the community via email frlp@nrpbsxm.org and encourages residents to stay informed through regular project updates on www.nrpbsxm.org/frlp. Any complaints or grievances can be sent to https:pbsxm.org/complaints-procedure/ The Fostering Resilient Learning Project is implemented by the National Recovery Program Bureau on behalf of The Government of Sint Maarten under the Trust Fund, which is financed by the Government of the Netherlands and managed by the World Bank.

Juliana O’Connor-Connolly said the Cabinet remains “constitutionally quorate and therefore fully able to function.” In a media statement, the Premier said the Cabinet had its weekly meeting on Friday, to discuss business agenda, and to fulfill “our constitutional duty”, with a majority of five sitting Ministers. “The sacred duty of elected office remains top of mind for myself and my colleagues, despite the uncertainty of the present circumstances. Our earnest and primary desire is to maintain stability within our Government, for the benefit of the people we service, and to maintain the confidence of you, the public, and those who conduct business with us,” the Premier declared. On Thursday, the Ministers who left the Cabinet were: Deputy Premier, Andre Ebanks, Katrine Ebanks-Wilks, Sabrina Turner, and Parliamentary Secretary, Heather Bodden. Their resignations have left the United People’s Movement (UPM) without a majority, it now has seven members, three short of a Parliamentary majority. In a press release, the former Deputy Premier, described their leaving the Cabinet, as “untenable,” as in recent months, “in particular, the level of dysfunction and disorganisation, and a lack of professionalism, place the country at risk of erroneous decision making and reputational damage, which could have long term adverse consequences,” he said. Adding that there was lack of parity between Ministers who are not afforded the same level of “transparency and involvement” to make informed decisions in the “best interest” of the people, he declared that it is leading to the “erosion of due process. “Unchecked disrespect, particularly towards women in caucus,” the former Premier outlined, noting that many meetings failed to “foster objective analysis, or to provide a forum for respectful exchange of different views,” Mr. Ebanks stated. The Islands’ Parliament has 19 members, and the Government needs at least 10 to have a majority. The coalition administration is now unable to past any legislation, due its minority status. Governor, Hon. Jane Owen, said she is in “discussions” with the Premier, and assured that “our public service continues to discharge their duties to ensure continuity of service to the public,” the Governor said, while the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) said the Government is on the brink of “collapse,” and cautioned against any “chaotic coalition” being put in place. This all unravels as the Cayman Islands are under Hurricane Warning; impact with Tropical Strom Raphael is expected tonight.

In an epidemiological alert issued last Wednesday, PAHO stressed the importance of controlling infection in birds as the key measure to reduce the risk to humans and recommended that countries strengthen surveillance for seasonal and zoonotic influenza in animal and human populations. The Organization also reiterated its guidelines on early laboratory diagnosis in human and animal samples and the respective investigation of cases and contacts, and recommended that these and other surveillance, prevention and control actions be carried out in coordination between the health, agriculture and environmental sectors. In the region, the influenza A(H5N1) virus was first identified in domestic and wild birds in December 2014 in North America. Since then and until the first week of January 2023, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the United States and Venezuela have detected outbreaks of this virus in domestic, poultry and/or wild birds. Infections of this virus in humans, which can often have severe symptoms, have been much less frequent. But whenever avian influenza viruses circulate among birds, there is a risk of sporadic human cases. So far, two human infections have been confirmed in the region: the first in April 2022 in the United States and the second on January 9, 2023 in Ecuador. In general, human cases are occasional and, when they have occurred, have not spread easily from person to person. However, the risk of establishing sustained human-to-human transmission exists and could eventually lead to an outbreak or even a pandemic. People at risk are those exposed to infected birds (domestic, wild or captive), such as poultry keepers and personnel involved in outbreak control. Health care workers are also at risk of infection if adequate prevention and control measures are not observed. PAHO recommends the use of personal protective equipment and other hygiene and sanitation measures.
