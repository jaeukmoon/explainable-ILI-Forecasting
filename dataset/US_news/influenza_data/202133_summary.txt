- Offspring born to pregnant mice infected with influenza A virus are more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections in early life.
- Maternal influenza infection can affect the immune responses of offspring.
- Offspring born to influenza-infected mothers experience stunted growth and increased vulnerability to infections such as influenza B virus and MRSA.
- The vulnerability to infection in neonates is associated with reduced hematopoetic development and immune responses.
- Alveolar macrophages of offspring exposed to maternal influenza have a reduced capacity to clear second-hit pathogens.
- Impaired pathogen clearance in offspring can be partially reversed by adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from healthy offspring born to uninfected mothers.
- Maternal influenza infection may impair immune development and increase susceptibility to early life infections in offspring.
