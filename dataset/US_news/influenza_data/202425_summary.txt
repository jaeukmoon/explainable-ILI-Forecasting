Avian Influenza Outbreak: The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial and backyard flocks in the United States. They have been working to identify and respond to detections, as well as mitigate the impact on poultry production and trade.
Seasonality and Migration: Detections of avian influenza are higher in the fall and spring due to wild birds spreading the virus as they migrate.
Surveillance and Biosecurity: APHIS is working with state animal health officials to conduct surveillance for avian influenza in commercial, backyard, and wild birds. They are also encouraging bird owners to practice strong biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
Scale of the Poultry Industry: The United States has over 378.5 million egg-laying chickens, and in 2023, over 9.4 billion broiler chickens and 218 million turkeys were processed.
Importance of Biosecurity: Minimizing contact between wildlife and domestic birds and preventing the spread of the virus between premises is crucial in controlling avian influenza outbreaks.
