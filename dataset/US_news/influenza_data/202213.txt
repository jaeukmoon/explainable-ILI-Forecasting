Yet, global influenza circulation has been heavily suppressed by public health measures and travel restrictions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, the influenza B/Yamagata lineage has not been conclusively detected since April 2020, and A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoria viruses have since circulated with considerably less genetic diversity. Travel restrictions have largely confined regional outbreaks of A(H3N2) to South and Southeast Asia, B/Victoria to China, and A(H1N1) to West Africa. Seasonal influenza transmission lineages continue to perish globally, except in these select hotspots, which will likely seed future epidemics. Waning population immunity and sporadic case detection will further challenge influenza vaccine strain selection and epidemic control. We offer a perspective on the potential short- and long-term evolutionary dynamics of seasonal influenza and discuss potential consequences and mitigation strategies as global travel gradually returns to pre-pandemic levels.

Natural selection acts on a global scale due to rapid and widespread global circulation2. This effectively eliminates previously dominant antigenic variants and results in limited circulation of antigenically similar viruses within each subtype/lineage at a given point in time. However, the pace of antigenic selection varies over time for influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes and influenza B virus (IBV) lineages due mainly to population-level fluctuations in immune pressure. This confounds vaccine strain selection, which relies on the prediction of antigenic evolution3. To facilitate bi-annual selection of candidate vaccine viruses, the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) coordinates influenza surveillance from 138 National Influenza Centers (NICs) and diagnostic and reference laboratories in 108 countries4. Current seasonal vaccine formulations are either trivalent or quadrivalent, with either three or four representative strains including IAV subtypes A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and either one or both IBV lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata.Seasonal influenza viruses exhibit stronger seasonal cycles in temperate zones, with surges of infections in winter. Seasonal trends are weaker in tropical zones, with increased circulation evident in both the rainy season due to increased humidity and in cooler, drier months5,6. Seasonal temperate cycles are maintained through continuous reintroduction from tropical regions and opposing hemispheres, causing local transmission chains to emerge and perish in community settings7,8. Transmission chains arising from a single introduction (transmission lineages9) dissipate at a greater frequency outside of peak seasonal circulation, although some may persist from one season to the next2,10. In tropical regions, influenza viruses exhibit more complex multi-peak dynamics, impacted by patterns of global circulation and evolution11. The interplay between the different seasonal influenza virus subtypes and lineages varies temporally and geographically, leading to significant variation in population immunity to each influenza virus.Analysis of global sequence data has shown that (i) tropical and subtropical regions in Asia sustain transmission lineages for a longer duration than temperate regions, providing more opportunities for antigenic drift2, and (ii) A(H3N2) lineages do not generally persist between seasons in temperate regions but are reseeded annually7,8,12, whereas transmission lineages of A(H1N1), B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria can circulate for several years in temperate and sub-tropical regions2. Population density and regional interconnectedness play an important role in maintaining viral metapopulations8,12. However, the genetic and antigenic diversity of seasonal influenza has been severely impacted by dramatic changes in global migration and travel since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Streamgraph showing temporal changes in influenza lineage circulation.Lineage prevalence was estimated using sample collection dates of all sequences submitted to the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from December 2018 to August 2021. Lineages detected since April 2020 are labeled in black; lineages that have not been detected since April 2020 are labeled in gray.Full size imageSince April 2020, most countries have seen historically low seasonal influenza virus circulation13,14 attributable to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as travel restrictions, quarantine on arrival, social distancing, school and workplace closures, mask wearing, surface disinfection, and enhanced hand hygiene. NPIs have similarly disrupted the circulation of other common respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus15,16,17,18 by limiting opportunities for reintroduction and local transmission. Prolonged suppression of seasonal influenza virus circulation, compounded by regional inequities in vaccine distribution19 and potential vaccine complacency, supply chain disruptions and misinformation20 amid fewer cases, will reduce population immunity and increase severity of future influenza virus epidemics. Accumulating evidence indicates protection against influenza infection, acquired through infection or vaccination, wanes over the course of a single season21. At the individual level, circulating antibodies decline over six months22, and the half-life of T-cells for cellular responses lasts eight to 14 years23. Accumulation of susceptible individuals during milder seasons results in more intense subsequent seasonal epidemics24. The consequences may be most dire for children with lack of exposure to influenza, as immunological imprinting (also referred to as “original antigenic sin”) during childhood influenza A and B infections25,26,27 impacts patterns of susceptibility and circulation in subsequent years18. Epidemiological studies, corroborated by multiple modeling and immunological studies27,28, show lifelong immune memory to first childhood influenza infection confers lifelong homosubtypic protection at the cost of heterosubtypic protection. Prolonged suppression of seasonal influenza circulation during the 2020s will lead to greater susceptibility in this birth cohort due to lack of exposure by natural infection.As COVID-19 vaccination rates increase in the coming months, the use of NPIs to limit transmission will gradually decline. Domestic and international travel will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels29, enabling a resurgence of influenza virus circulation. Through phylogenetic analysis of available influenza sequence data and case reports submitted to WHO GISRS we consider the short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 control measures on the epidemiology and evolution of seasonal influenza viruses.ResultsA global reduction in seasonal influenza virus case detectionAnalysis of the GISRS FluNet database4 to 1 August 2021 shows an unprecedented global reduction in seasonal influenza cases since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (Fig. 2). Routine influenza testing was disrupted during the initial stages of the pandemic amid the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Nevertheless, many countries continued or resumed influenza testing and reporting by mid-202015,30,31, and the dramatic decline in influenza virus detection cannot be explained by this transient disruption in laboratory testing. During the 2017/2018 to 2019/2020 Northern Hemisphere winter seasons, the number of influenza positive cases peaked around 40,000–60,000 per week. In early February 2020, cases in the Northern Hemisphere fell from a peak of ~50,000 cases per week to <100 cases per week in May 2020 and remained below 100 weekly cases until September 2020, a 99.8% reduction (Fig. 2). During the first half of 2021, case numbers increased marginally to 200–400 cases per week. Similarly, in the Southern Hemisphere, activity during the 2017–2019 seasons peaked between 1500 and 3500 positive specimens per week, but the 2020 season was notably absent and the expected rise in seasonal influenza cases has yet to occur in 2021. Remarkably, <12 influenza positive cases per week were reported from May 2020 to July 2021 in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Virological surveillance of seasonal influenza viruses.A Time series comparing FluNet data on seasonal influenza activity in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from 2015 to July 2021, with the COVID-19 pandemic shaded in gray.

Note: y-axis scales differ in each panel.Full size imageReduction in seasonal influenza virus diversity and the likely elimination of B/YamagataCo-circulation of diverse A(H3N2) and B/Victoria viruses and antigenic drift within some co-circulating clades have necessitated frequent updates to the vaccine strain components in recent years. Since their emergence in 1968, A(H3N2) viruses have, on average, evolved distinct antigenic variants every 3–7 years with rapid elimination of previous antigenic variants32,33. However, leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, a major A(H3N2) genetic bottleneck had not occurred for a number of years34 (Figs. 1 and 3). The continued circulation of an A(H3N2) clade 3c3.A, a lineage which dates back to 2013, has been implicated in reduced production of neutralizing antibodies in adults with childhood exposure to A(H3N2) 28, and it has been hypothesized that further accumulation of antigenic changes may result in A(H3N2) divergence35. Like A(H3N2), the genetic diversity of B/Victoria expanded from 2015 to 2018, with seven subclades co-circulating prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with less antigenic diversity than A(H3N2). In contrast, the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) viruses have shown slower antigenic drift, with 6b1/183P-5a as the dominant A(H1N1) clade amid a number of antigenically related subclades, and B/Yamagata viruses have exhibited weak antigenic selection in recent years, further reducing their prevalence over time36.Fig. 3: Comparison of seasonal influenza virus evolution before and since COVID-19 emergence.A Evolutionary relationships and divergence times of HA genes inferred using maximum likelihood (see Online Methods section). Tips are colored by WHO clade designations. Phylogenetic trees of major clades that continued to circulate during 2020/2021 (marked in A) are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1–4, including A(H3N2) clades A1b/94N and A1b/186D; A(H1N1) clade 6b1.A/187A lineages in West Africa; and B/Victoria lineages from several regions around the world. B Timeline of recently circulating seasonal influenza virus HA clades from mean estimated divergence time to most recent sequence. Time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is shaded in gray.Full size imageFrom April 2020 through July 2021, only 2521 influenza A(H3N2) virus cases were reported from 57 countries in FluNet (Supplementary Dataset 1), with outbreaks apparent in West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire (n = 123) and Senegal (n = 119)), South Asia (Bangladesh (n = 209), India (n = 455), Pakistan (n = 162), and Nepal (n = 107)), and Southeast Asia (Cambodia (n = 108), Laos (n = 268), and Vietnam (n = 162)). Only 590 A(H3N2) sequences from this 16-month period were deposited in GISAID, a > 97% reduction in A(H3N2) sequence data globally in comparison to the previous 16 months. Of the eight A(H3N2) subclades that circulated during 2019/2020, three have not been detected since April 2020 (A3, A1b/135K, and A1b/197R), while 3c3.A, A1b/94N, A1b/186D, A1b/131K, and A1b/137F continued to circulate in 2021 (Figs. 1 and 3).Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of seasonal influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) sequences since SARS-CoV-2 emergence illustrates the circulation of geographically and genetically distinct A(H3N2) outbreaks in parts of West Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Dataset 2). Clade A1b/137F viruses were detected sporadically in Bangladesh, Laos, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, and Yunnan province in China (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Dataset 2). A(H3N2) clade A1b/186D was detected primarily in West Africa (Supplementary Fig. 1), while clade A1b/94N was detected across Asia and Oceania (Supplementary Fig. 2). In particular, A1b/94N viruses were frequently detected in India since May 2021. The phylogeny of clade A1b/94N reveals six related clusters that originated independently prior to March 2020. First detected in Cambodia, one lineage circulated in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Southeast Asia from July to February 2020. A second distinct A1b/94N lineage was detected in the Australian Northern Territory from individuals returning to Australia and in quarantine during February–March 2021 and from neighboring Timor-Leste during July 2020–March 2021, suggesting regional circulation during 2020/2021 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Three other A1b/94N lineages, represented by only one or two identical HA sequences, were detected in Japan on 2 March 2021, Bangladesh on 28 September 2020, and Côte d’Ivoire on 24 November 2020. While most A1b/94N lineages have been regionally contained, one A1b/94N lineage with common ancestry dating back to 2019 in South Asia has been detected in India, Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Kenya, Singapore, the United States, and several European countries during 2020 and early 2021 (Figs. 3A and 4, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Dataset 2).Fig. 4: Geographic distribution of influenza HA sequences before (left) and after (right) COVID-19 emergence.From April 2020 to July 2021, A(H3N2) (590 sequences from 32 countries), A(H1N1) (254 sequences from 18 countries), and B/Victoria (834 sequences from 34 countries) were available for analysis. In comparison to the 16-month period before April 2020 (December 2018 to March 2020), there was a reduction in sequences of 97% for A(H3N2), 99% for A(H1N1), 92% for B/Victoria, and 100% for B/Yamagata. Last updated on 24 August 2021; for an interactive visualization of current seasonal influenza circulation, we refer the reader to the Nextstrain67 platform.Full size imageFew A(H1N1) cases have been detected since April 2020 (Fig. 2), mainly in Ghana (n = 235), Togo (n = 226), the United States (n = 170), and Russia (n = 165) (Supplementary Dataset 1). Nevertheless, the 254 available sequences in GISAID reflect cryptic circulation of all previously circulating A(H1N1) clades into early 2021. Three independent lineages of clade 6b1.A/187A viruses circulated in West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo) during 2020, along with a few 6b1.A/156K and 6b1.A/183P-5a viruses (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Since May 2021, clade 6b1.A/156K viruses were primarily detected in India, while the other A(H1N1) clades in circulation have been detected sporadically around the world (Fig. 4).An ongoing B/Victoria epidemic in China accounts for the majority of all seasonal influenza viruses detected in 2020/2021 globally (Supplementary Dataset 1). Since November 2020, China has consistently detected over 400 B/Victoria cases per week. While B/Victoria clades V1A.1 and V1A.2 have not been reported for over 16 months, five other B/Victoria clades (V1A, V1A.3, V1A.3/133R, V1A.3/150K, and V1A/165N) continue to circulate (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic analysis shows the circulation of two distinct lineages of clade V1A.3/150K since late 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Initially detected in China in September 2019, one V1A.3/150K lineage has been intermittently detected in other parts of the world up to March 2020. The other circulating lineage of clade V1A.3/150K has been detected since late 2020 in parts of China, Bangladesh, West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Russia, and most recently in Singapore during June 2021 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Dataset 2). Several highly similar HA sequences were detected in West Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, suggesting limited intercontinental transmission of V1A.3/150K viruses has resumed (Supplementary Fig. 4). The B/Victoria clade that was dominant prior to March 2020 globally, V1A.3/133R, was infrequently detected from April 2020 to May 2021, mainly from China, Kenya, the United States, Brazil, and Japan (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Dataset 2). Similarly, clade V1A B/Victoria-lineage viruses, which circulated globally in 2019, were only detected small numbers in China, Kenya, and Sweden since April 2020 (Supplementary Dataset 2). Clade V1A/165N has been reported infrequently since 2017, and the most recent sequence was detected in Zhejiang province in China on March 2021, suggesting low-level circulation of this B/Victoria clade. In summary, V1A.3/150K has been detected globally, especially in China, Bangladesh, and Singapore during recent months and will likely continue to dominate. Other B/Victoria clades (e.g., V1A, V1A.3/133R, V1A/165N) have been regionally detected, albeit at lower frequencies, since April 2020 and may eventually be replaced by descendants of the apparently fitter V1A.3/150K viruses.Notably, in February 2022, WHO reported that no confirmed B/Yamagata detections had been reported since March 202037, which suggests transmission of B/Yamagata has not been sustained.Transmission dynamics and geographic hotspots of seasonal influenza virus circulationWe generated large-scale phylogenetic trees of HA sequence data from 2018–2021 to determine the number of independent lineages that originated from viruses circulating during March 2020. Over 60 residual transmission lineages were detected in both IAV and B/Victoria (52% singleton sequences), a majority of which occurred amongst the major clades described above (A(H3N2) A1b/94, A(H1N1) 6b1.A/187A, and B/Victoria V1A.3/150K) (Fig. 5). Most residual transmission lineages were derived from viruses circulating within the same country, province, or geographic region (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Dataset 3). These results affirm the lack of global dissemination of seasonal influenza viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal smaller regions with high population densities that can independently sustain influenza virus transmission lineages for extended periods. Furthermore, while detection of A(H3N2) and B/Victoria viruses derived from pre-COVID-19 influenza virus lineages increased during the first two months of 2021, new detections have since decreased, suggesting many residual transmission chains may have terminated at the end of the 2020/2021 Northern Hemisphere season. Two major lineages continue to be detected in mid-2021, B/Victoria V1A.3/150K was most prevalent, and to a lesser extent, A(H3N2) A1b/94N (Supplementary Dataset 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 4).Fig. 5: Cluster size and duration of influenza transmission lineages that originated before the COVID-19 pandemic.Each colored bar represents a monophyletic transmission lineage inferred from maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of seasonal influenza HA gene sequences in GISAID (see Online Methods section). Labels indicate sequence counts per transmission lineage.Full size imageA(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B/Victoria viruses detected during late 2020–early 2021 largely circulated in West and Central Africa. These outbreak reports are supported by genetic sequences, and many of the observed transmission lineages have been regionally maintained since before COVID-19. According to the COVID-19 control policies of individual countries38, internal movement restrictions were enacted across all countries in West Africa by 13 April 2020, and international travel restrictions were in place across the region by 30 March 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, by late July 2020, most countries in West Africa had lifted domestic travel restrictions, and by August 2020 international travel was allowed with some restrictions. A(H3N2) HA gene phylogenies suggest these control measures effectively restricted cross-border spread of influenza viruses, because sequences from Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to January 2021 cluster by country, suggesting containment of virus circulation within each country (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, most Southeast Asian nations maintained relatively stringent domestic and international travel restrictions during 2020/2021, except for Laos and Cambodia, where COVID-19 suppression was followed by A(H3N2) influenza virus outbreaks in 2020. While international travel measures impacted influenza virus migration patterns, an analysis of control-measure stringency and influenza case reports in fourteen countries in Asia and Africa with substantial influenza activity showed no correlation between the stringency of public health interventions and domestic transmission of influenza (see Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 6). A caveat to note is that the stringency index does not reflect the efficacy of control measures or population compliance.DiscussionSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO influenza surveillance data reflect a substantial reduction in global influenza virus circulation. Lack of exposure to influenza will lower population immunity and increase the severity of large epidemics upon a future global resurgence. Notably, countries in North America and Europe with strong influenza surveillance have only sporadically reported the influenza viruses in circulation, including several that have caused outbreaks in Africa and Asia, and B/Yamagata lineage viruses appear to have become extinct around mid-2020. Despite an overall increase in influenza surveillance, WHO reports39 variable effects due to COVID-19. Influenza surveillance benefited due to rapid capacity building and training efforts to respond to SARS-CoV-2, however disruptions occurred at national or regional levels due to healthcare resource allocation and health care-seeking behavior. Generally, demographic details such as age are not available for all countries, many cases are missed due to timing of infection, and severe cases requiring primary care or hospitalization are more likely to be detected and reported. Furthermore, reference laboratories use various detection methods and may only submit a representative subset of their surveillance data alongside any cases that cannot be subtyped by conventional methods. Not all cases are confirmed by isolation or genomic characterization, and of those sequenced, only a portion are submitted to sequence databases such as GISAID. However, to offset issues with completeness of submitted record40, our analysis was limited to the primary data fields, and regional circulation was inferred using a combination of case numbers and virus genetic relationships.Roughly one-quarter or more of seasonal influenza cases are caused by IBVs41, and in recent decades the two IBV lineages have caused comparable proportions of influenza cases. Historically, B/Yamagata viruses have caused a greater rate of infection in temperate regions and have infected adults at a greater rate than children, whereas B/Victoria viruses have infected more children than adults41. However, the long-term impact of B/Yamagata elimination on the evolutionary dynamics of IBV is uncertain. Recently, Vieira et al.24 examined historical patterns of IBV lineage frequencies in New Zealand using statistical modeling and showed that fluctuations in lineage dominance and lineage cross-protection explains contrasting age distributions of B/Yamagata versus B/Victoria lineages. As IBV lineages offer some cross-protection42,43, the extinction of B/Yamagata will leave a higher proportion of individuals susceptible to IBV, enabling faster B/Victoria antigenic evolution.It is important to note, the threat of re-introduction of apparently extinct influenza virus lineages could still pose a risk in coming years, as happened with the reemergence of A(H1N1) in 197744 following a 19-year hiatus since the 1958 A(H2N2) pandemic (Fig. 6). If B/Yamagata does not reemerge in the next year or so, it may need to be treated as a high consequence pathogen to prevent reintroduction, similar to A(H2N2) viruses which have not circulated since 1968 and are now held and handled in the higher level BSL-3 laboratory biosecurity levels45. Future B/Yamagata positive samples will require urgent confirmation and characterization to be able to better determine the mechanisms that could sustain such low levels of virus circulation – for example, immunocompromised individuals can carry infection for several weeks or months and potentially accumulate additional mutations46,47,48 – or to rule out the possibility that these were in fact false-positive test results.Fig. 6: Historical circulation of influenza viruses in the last century.Dots indicate emergence of pandemic strains that replaced previously circulating influenza viruses.Full size imageAlthough two IAV subtypes and two IBV lineages have co-circulated in recent decades, prior to the re-emergence of A(H1N1) in 1977, only a single IAV subtype and a single IBV lineage circulated among humans (Fig. 6). In the early 1980s, IBV diverged from the ancestral B/Lee lineage into two antigenically distinct lineages49. The survival of two IBV lineages is attributed to the geographic isolation of B/Victoria in China in the 1990s, followed by a global resurgence during 2000-200250. The continued endemicity of geographically disparate transmission lineages of A(H3N2), A(H1N1), and B/Victoria (compounded by limited availability of clinical isolates) confounds the accuracy of candidate vaccine virus selection, and further accumulation of antigenic changes could lead to long-term co-circulation of antigenically distinct lineages, as occurred for IBV. However, the concomitant reduction in population-level immunity towards seasonal influenza suggests global resurgence of any residual viruses could occur in the future and continued vigilance is required.The emergence of pandemic influenza viruses A(H2N2) in 1958 and A(H3N2) in 1968 from animal reservoirs resulted in the rapid and complete elimination of previously circulating seasonal influenza A subtypes (Fig. 6) in part due to a lack of pre-existing immunity, which enables novel strains to out-compete their predecessors. However, while the recent emergence of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic virus caused elimination of A(H1N1)77 viruses (last detected in 2010; GISAID), seasonal A(H3N2) and IBV viruses sustained transmission throughout the pandemic. Mild and short-lived NPIs temporarily suppressed circulation of A(H3N2) and IBVs, and a combination of immune-driven selection and relatively slower antigenic evolution of A(H1N1)7736 likely contributed to its elimination. By 2011, seasonal circulation of all four subtypes had resumed, though A(H3N2) evolutionary patterns were significantly altered following co-circulation with 2009 A(H1N1) viruses35.A previous analysis of global sequencing data highlighted the propensity for sub-tropical regions in Asia to sustain transmission lineages and act as source populations in the emergence of influenza antigenic variants2. However, limited sequence and surveillance data were available from Africa at that time. Surveillance capacity in West Africa has since increased with direct support from the WHO and US CDC. In the context of pandemic disruptions to influenza circulation, surveillance in West Africa highlights the potential importance of this region for sustained transmission of influenza and suggests that this region may play a key role in the circulation and maintenance of seasonal influenza lineages along with larger population centers located in India, China, and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, recent studies that showed correlation between stringency and national-level influenza transmission were from countries with no influenza activity since pandemic emergence31,51,52,53, with the exception of Cambodia that showed A(H3N2) activity during 202054. Our study in contrast analyzed countries with significant influenza activity to find no correlation between the stringency of community measures and domestic influenza transmission indicating effectiveness of community measures in these countries was low.We speculate that heterogeneity in COVID-19 vaccination rates and control policies will slow the global resurgence of influenza, delay competition among existing influenza lineages and enable further divergence of spatially separated lineages, but these individual influenza lineages will eventually expand, compete, and once again circulate more widely. Upcoming influenza seasons could therefore be compounded in severity as immunity wanes over time for all age groups24. Moreover, the continued evolution of regionally distinct lineages increases the risk that the antigens included in the vaccine will not be representative of the viruses that ultimately circulate, thereby reducing vaccine effectiveness.Knowledge gained from influenza epidemiology and evolution under COVID-19 epidemic control underscores the importance of heightened vigilance and continued influenza vaccination programs as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the potential consequences of recent changes in seasonal influenza virus lineage diversity. Based on observed genetic diversity and endemicity of circulating lineages, continued travel restrictions will limit the number of regional introductions, and prolonged pandemic mitigation strategies could further impact future seasonal influenza virus circulation and evolution. Ongoing global COVID-19 vaccination rates indicate that middle-income countries may be sufficiently vaccinated by the start of 2022; thus, continuation of mitigation strategies may become impractical, and global travel could return to pre-COVID-19 levels in the near future. As international travel is important for sustaining seasonal influenza transmission36,55, genomic surveillance at border crossings (using the infrastructure developed for COVID-19) could monitor importation from regions that maintain endemic circulation of seasonal influenza. As illustrated by influenza sequence and surveillance data from 2020 and 2021, East, South, and Southeast Asia have had sustained A(H3N2) and B/Victoria transmission lineages, and West Africa has maintained A(H1N1) circulation.The uncertainty in future seasonal influenza circulation provides further incentive for rapid advancement of universal influenza vaccines that confer broad protection against multiple IAV or IBV lineages56,57,58. Indeed, the mRNA vaccine technology used against COVID-19 could be rapidly produced, modified, and deployed59,60 with the potential to alleviate many of the concerns presented in this manuscript. Ultimately, regardless of the influenza vaccine technologies deployed and their coverage, surveillance remains the key to better understanding and controlling influenza infections in the immediate future.MethodsEpidemiological trends of seasonal influenza-positive cases and samples tested between January 2015 and July 2021 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 6) were inferred from influenza notifications submitted to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) 4, obtained using FluNet-Scraper (https://github.com/MagnusBook/flunet-scraper). All human seasonal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequences collected from December 2018 to July 2021 were downloaded from GISAID (Supplementary Dataset 4) and aligned by HA subtype/lineage using MAFFT v.7.2261. Preliminary maximum-likelihood phylogenies were estimated with FastTree v.2.162. Root-to-tip regression analyses of phylogenetic branch lengths and sampling dates were used to control phylogenetic data quality in TempEst v.1.5.363, and sequences <900 nt were excluded. After adding HA reference sequences (recommended vaccine strains from 2010 to 2021), the final dataset included 15,526 A(H3N2), 16,020 A(H1N1), 9,743 B/Victoria, and 1029 B/Yamagata sequences.Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times of seasonal influenza HA genes were estimated using IQ-TREE v.264 and the least-square dating method65. Large-scale maximum likelihood analyses using all available HA sequence data were generated by FastTree v.2.162 with the generalized time reversible nucleotide substitution model. Branch support was assessed by Shimodaira-Hasegawa test66, and lineages were labeled according to WHO clade designations. Residual influenza virus lineages were estimated by counting individual monophyletic clades that derived from branches prior to March 2020. The R package ‘ggstream’ v.0.1 was used to map temporal changes in sampling of seasonal influenza clades, and ‘rworldmap’ v.1.3 was used to plot world maps.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

For Indiana, the outbreak dates back to February 7, 2022, when samples were collected from a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County and submitted to the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine for testing. The testing was initiated after the birds in the affected barn began to appear lethargic and had markedly decreased water consumption followed by increased mortality. The initial samples tested positive for avian influenza at the ADDL. Under standard protocols, those initial results were reported to the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH), which authorized prompt transport of the samples to the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where they were confirmed to be HPAI on February 9. This was the first report of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020 and the first in Indiana since 2016. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has been a hot topic recently as more cases have been identified in both commercial and backyard poultry flocks. As of Wednesday, March 30, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of HPAI in flocks in five other states, including a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Berkshire County, Massachusetts; a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Johnson County, Wyoming; a commercial poultry flock in Johnston County, North Carolina; a non-commercial, backyard chicken flock (non-poultry) in Franklin County, Ohio; and a non-commercial, backyard chicken flock (poultry) in Kidder County, North Dakota. Thankfully, there has not been a new case identified in Indiana since March 2. So, what is Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza? HPAI is an extremely contagious, multi-organ systemic disease of poultry often leading to death. The disease is caused by some subtypes of the type A influenza virus. Wild birds are common providers of test samples, as avian influenza circulates freely in those populations without any outward signs of sickness in the birds. In Indiana, as of the end of March, there have been four confirmed infected commercial turkey flocks in Dubois County and two in Greene County, with the total number of infected birds amounting to 171,224 commercial turkeys. The control areas surrounding Dubois County sites have been lifted as of March 23, meaning the commercial farms with infected flocks are no longer under quarantine, weekly surveillance testing is no longer required, and movement permits have been eliminated. The United States houses the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, of which the ADDL at Purdue is an essential part. The USDA APHIS states, “With the recent detections of the Eurasian H5 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds and domestic poultry in the United States, bird owners should review their biosecurity practices and stay vigilant to protect poultry and pet birds from this disease.” Dr. Geoffrey Lossie, ADDL avian diagnostician, clinical assistant professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Department of Comparative Pathobiology, and director of veterinary extension, who coordinated testing at ADDL during this year’s HPAI outbreak, provides valuable advice on the disease with recommendations for poultry farmers in handling suspected cases in their own flocks. Q&A WITH DR. GEOFFREY LOSSIE Is avian influenza communicable to humans? Avian influenza is considered a zoonotic (disease transmitted from animals to humans), however each strain is different in terms of whether or not it may affect people. There have been no cases in humans associated with the current strain of HPAI, and the situation is monitored carefully by the Department of Health as part of the outbreak investigation. A statement by the USDA sums it up best, “According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern.” How can one protect their flock? The best thing to do is prevent interactions with wild waterfowl/shorebirds (the natural hosts for avian influenza). This goes as far as not frequenting places that waterfowl congregate such as public parks and fishing areas. Waterfowl hunting is also a high-risk activity, as those hunters could unknowingly bring back avian influenza to their flocks if they have them. I would also encourage poultry owners to keep all extraneous visitors, especially those with their own poultry, off their premises. Anytime someone interacts with your poultry, it’s a possible exposure event, so best not to let others interact with your poultry. It’s also important for poultry owners not to interact with other keeper’s birds. Owners should not share poultry equipment or tools between each other as these can act as “fomites”, inanimate objects that can harbor transfer of virus if it is present. These recommendations are part of what we call biosecurity. Click here to view additional information provided by the USDA on this topic. Are suspected cases reportable to the USDA or respective state department of agriculture? How is that done? The best contact is the state veterinary regulatory authority. In Indiana, for example, that would be the Indiana Board of Animal Health. I realize that it may be difficult to find which entity is the state veterinary regulatory authority. In Ohio, for example, the Ohio Department of Agriculture Division of Animal Health would be the agency to contact. There is a national toll-free number through USDA APHIS to call if you think your flock may have avian influenza: 1-866-536-7593. What are symptoms to watch for? With the current strain of HPAI that is circulating, the biggest thing to watch for is sudden death in your flock. HPAI can wipe out an entire flock in a short amount of time, with a majority of birds dying within 24-72 hours. Often times specific clinical signs are not noted before birds start dying. You might notice birds isolating themselves and they will likely stop eating and drinking, followed soon by birds beginning to die off. Who can test for avian influenza, and is there any treatment? Avian influenza can only be tested by a licensed veterinarian. As avian influenza is considered a foreign animal disease, it is vital that any suspected case be vetted by the state veterinary regulatory authority or the USDA. While private practitioners can be vital in reporting flocks that may be infected, you should not wait to see your regular veterinarian if you suspect your flock has avian influenza. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for avian influenza, and any detection of the virus begins a rigorous state and federal response that requires depopulation of the affected flock.

In response to the high transmissibility and large proportion of asymptomatic infections, public health strategies involved non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask use in public, social distancing, and lockdowns. Study: SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenoviruses. Image Credit: CROCOTHERY/Shutterstock A recent paper examines the occurrence of other respiratory viral infections during this period in patients already infected with SARS-CoV-2. Introduction As the pandemic seems to be on the wane, at least temporarily, it is recognized that other respiratory infections are likely to rebound from their extremely low rates of incidence to pre-pandemic levels. This is because NPIs aimed at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will also decrease the spread of these other endemic viral pathogens. Conversely, with the relaxation of such restrictions, these other viruses will probably begin to circulate again, along with SARS-CoV-2, leading to a rise in coinfections. The current study, published in The Lancet, aims to shed light on the outcomes of such coinfections. What did the study show? The investigators explored over 200,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults in the UK. The study was carried out between February 6th, 2020, and December 8th, 2021. In almost 7,000 cases, the patients were tested for concomitant influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or adenovirus infections, with approximately 580 positive tests. Among these, about 230 also had influenza, 220 had RSV, and 135 had adenovirus infections along with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with influenza virus coinfection had higher chances of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) than those with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. In all cases of influenza and adenovirus coinfection, a fatal outcome was more likely. When the results were applied to hospitalized patients, in general, using appropriate adjustments, the presence of influenza was found to be a risk factor for IMV as well as death during the hospital stay. What are the implications? This is the largest study so far of adult patients with COVID-19 who were also tested for other endemic respiratory viruses. The participants included over 580 patients with such coinfections, identified over a period of 18 months. Related StoriesStudy finds nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces severe COVID-19 and long COVID risks in high-risk patientsSARS-CoV-2 hijacks host proteins to escape immune clearanceRecruitment underway for a clinical trial testing new vaccine against respiratory virusesSince the patients in the study were all hospitalized, the role played by the severity of COVID-19 in predisposing to testing for coinfections with other respiratory viruses must be accounted for. Despite this, the presence of influenza coinfection continued to be significantly associated with a higher risk of IMV than SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. This was not true of adenovirus or RSV coinfection when compared either to coinfection with influenza/SARS-CoV-2 or coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 alone. Most of the cases of respiratory virus coinfection are assumed to have been due to community transmission and to have been present when the patient was hospitalized. However, the major part of the study occurred before the advent of COVID-19 vaccines, indicating the effect of the influenza virus or the COVID-19 vaccine on the outcome, whether in those with SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection or those with SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. The study findings thus add to the sum of knowledge about the outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with influenza, adenovirus, or RSV coinfection. The expected rise in the number of respiratory virus coinfections with the relaxation of measures to contain the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 further emphasizes the need for the flu shot as well as the COVID-19 vaccine. Secondly, the need to detect the presence of flu in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 may suggest that testing is a good way to identify those at risk. Journal reference: Swets, M. et al.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on March 30, 2022 Close Photo: USDA Due to the rapidly rising numbers of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), consumers may be looking at a shortage of eggs this Easter. Egg production has not fully recovered from disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the supply has stabilized, it is still well below pre-pandemic numbers. "U.S. egg producers have been hard-pressed to align supplies with market demand over the last two years," says Brian Earnest, lead animal protein economist with CoBank Knowledge Exchange. "The U.S. layer flock typically expands ahead of the surge in demand for Easter and contracts during the summer months. But recent losses due to HPAI combined with high feed costs and other challenges are severely limiting flock size management." U.S. egg layer flocks had previously expanded faster than anticipated target growth in 2019, but have declined more than 5% in years since, stemming from a shift in consumer behavior in 2020. Despite grocery demand, egg producers were not set up to shift their distribution patterns, according to a new research brief from CoBank. More than 11 million layer hens have been lost to HPAI since the outbreak that started on February 8, with individual operations losing up to 5.3 million birds. READ MORE: Keep up-to-date with the HPAI numbers The USDA AMS Weekly Shell Egg Demand Indicator reports five days of inventory on hand, which puts the United States egg inventory at a light to moderate amount of eggs. The report also states, "Wholesale prices for cartoned eggs continue to rise over concerns about the potential impact of avian influenza on supply ahead of Easter." With an expected continuation in the reduction of layer flocks, supplies may not be able to accommodate the consumer demand for eggs, especially at regional levels, according to the brief, and consumers may be expected to absorb the increase in cost.

"The main reason for depopulating commercial poultry or turkeys is to try and contain the spread because it can spread quite easily," Tara Harrison, with North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, told WRAL.The avian flu "is devastating to farmers and to the birds they raise. HPAI does not discriminate between migratory birds, small backyard flocks or commercial poultry farms, and we urge all poultry owners to take precautions," Jim Chakeres, executive vice president, Ohio Poultry Association, said in a statement to USA TODAY. “It is important to know that both USDA and CDC confirm that HPAI cannot be transmitted through meat or eggs and that it is not a public health concern."According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent bird flu detections do not present an immediate public health concern.

COVID-19 29 March 2022 By Julia RobinsonAdvertisement Advertisement Copy link to page Download PDF The need for invasive mechanical ventilation increased by more than four times for patients who had COVID-19 and influenza simultaneouslyShutterstock.comPatients infected with both COVID-19 and influenza at the same time are more than four times more likely to require ventilation support and more than twice as likely to die, compared with just having COVID-19, research published in the Lancet has suggested.The study was delivered as part of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium’s Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium; the largest study to look at COVID-19 and other endemic respiratory viruses.The researchers examined the clinical outcomes of 212,466 patients co-infected with COVID-19 and either influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or an adenovirus, who were admitted to hospital in the UK between 6 February 2020 and 8 December 2021.Tests for respiratory viral co-infections were recorded for 6,965 patients with COVID-19 and, overall, viral co-infection was detected in 583 patients. Of these, 227 had influenza viruses, 220 had RSV and 136 had an adenovirus.After carrying out a weighted multivariable regression analysis, the researchers calculated that, for patients who had co-infection with influenza and COVID-19, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation increased by more than four times (odds ratio [OR] 4.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00–8.49). In contrast, those with COVID-19 and co-infection with adenovirus or RSV did not have an increased need for mechanical ventilation.In terms of in-hospital mortality, for those with COVID-19 and influenza, the risk was more than two times higher (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.07–5.12) when compared with those who only had COVID-19. The risk of mortality was also found to be increased in those who had co-infection with adenoviruses (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.67–3.33).The authors said that the findings had “several” implications for policy.“First, our results provide further support for vaccination against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.“Second, they suggest that testing for influenza viruses is important in hospital in-patients with COVID-19 to identify patients at risk and a cohort of patients who might have different responses to immunomodulatory and antiviral therapy.”Kenneth Baillie, professor of experimental medicine at the University of Edinburgh, which was involved in the study, said the findings would be particularly important as countries decrease the use of social distancing and containment measures.“We found that the combination of COVID-19 and flu viruses is particularly dangerous,” he said.“We expect that COVID-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections. That is why we should change our testing strategy for COVID-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely.” Last updated 29 March 2022 15:27CitationThe Pharmaceutical Journal, PJ, March 2022, Vol 308, No 7959;308(7959)::DOI:10.1211/PJ.2022.1.136667 Please leave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.You may also be interested in Chair of UK COVID-19 Inquiry commends pharmacists’ ‘superb work’ during the pandemic COVID-19 Inquiry must consider pharmacy resilience in case of future pandemics, says RPS Boots offers private COVID-19 vaccination service at almost £100 per jab Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement About us A to Z subjectsServices Services Advertising and branded content Subscribe Supported contentSupport Support Article access rules Community guidelines For authors and referees Website FAQs Using the new PJ Logging in as a RPS member Preferences and newsletters How to use the PJ app PJ app FAQs Technical supportPublications Publications The Pharmaceutical Journal International Journal of Pharmacy Practice Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research RPS Pharmacy & Pharmacology ReportsPartners Partners Pharmaceutical Press MedicinesComplete Pharmacy Knowledge ONtrack Pharmacy Knowledge Student PJ JobsContact Contact Contact us Permissions and reprintsFollow us Follow us Social media and communities hub Download our app Cookie policy Terms and conditions Subscription T&Cs Copyright Privacy Policy Acceptable use policy © 2024 Royal Pharmaceutical SocietyReduced protection of RIPK3-deficient mice against influenza by matrix protein 2 ectodomain targeted active and passive vaccination strategies | Cell Death & Disease Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Here, we compared the immune protection of active vaccination with a universal influenza A vaccine candidate based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) and of passive immunization with anti-M2e IgG antibodies in wild type and Ripk3−/− mice. We observed that the protection against IAV after active vaccination with M2e viral antigen is lost in Ripk3−/− mice. Interestingly, M2e-specific serum IgG levels induced by M2e vaccination were not significantly different between wild type and Ripk3−/− vaccinated mice demonstrating that the at least the humoral immune response was not affected by the absence of RIPK3 during active vaccination. Moreover, following IAV challenge, lungs of M2e vaccinated Ripk3−/− mice revealed a decreased number of immune cell infiltrates and an increased accumulation of dead cells, suggesting that phagocytosis could be reduced in Ripk3−/− mice. However, neither efferocytosis nor antibody-dependent phagocytosis were affected in macrophages isolated from Ripk3−/− mice. Likewise following IAV infection of Ripk3−/− mice, active vaccination and infection resulted in decreased presence of CD8+ T-cells in the lung. However, it is unclear whether this reflects a deficiency in vaccination or an inability following infection. Finally, passively transferred anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies at higher dose than littermate wild type mice completely protected Ripk3−/− mice against an otherwise lethal IAV infection, demonstrating that the increased sensitivity of Ripk3−/− mice could be overcome by increased antibodies. Therefore we conclude that passive immunization strategies with monoclonal antibody could be useful for individuals with reduced IAV vaccine efficacy or increased IAV sensitivity, such as may be expected in patients treated with future anti-inflammatory therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases such as RIPK inhibitors.

Currently, yearly vaccination is considered the most effective measure to prevent or reduce disease caused by influenza A and B viruses. Seasonal influenza vaccines are mostly based on inactivated influenza viruses and their composition is reevaluated yearly for each hemisphere to follow the antigenic drift of the circulating influenza viruses. Influenza vaccines based on the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of influenza A, have been proposed as possible alternatives for currently licensed influenza vaccines [2, 3]. Immunization of laboratory mice with M2e displayed on a virus-like particle (VLP) protect against a potentially lethal influenza A virus (IAV) challenge [4]. This protection can be transferred by serum, requires a functional Fcγ receptor compartment and is mediated by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis [4, 5]. Phase I studies with M2e-based vaccine candidates have been completed, which suggested that such vaccine candidates are safe and immunogenic in healthy volunteers (e.g., NCT00819013) [6]. Whether M2e-based prophylactic vaccination strategies prevent or reduce disease caused by IAV infection in humans remains to be determined. A controlled IAV challenge study in healthy volunteers revealed that a dose of 40 mg/kg of a human anti-M2e IgG1 monoclonal antibody was associated with a significant reduction in the total influenza symptom score compared to the placebo treated group [7]. To date, preclinical and clinical M2e-based influenza A vaccine development efforts are continuously being explored [8].Cell death signaling pathways contribute to the innate immune defense against infectious diseases. One key player in some of these pathways is Receptor-Interacting serinehreonine-Protein Kinase 3 (RIPK3) [9]. Indeed, RIPK3 is involved in the protection against IAV infection by several mechanisms [10,11,12,13,14]. RIPK3 kinase activity, for example, is implicated in TNF-and ZBP1-mediated necroptosis, while as a scaffold it is implicated in apoptosis upon IAV infection [14]. Beyond its involvement in the protection against IAV infection, the contribution of RIPK3 to vaccine-induced immune protection conferred by active vaccination strategies has not been addressed. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity of active vaccination with M2e-VLPs and the protective potential of passive transfer of M2e-specific IgG monoclonal antibodies in wild type and Ripk3-deficient mice against an IAV challenge.ResultsRIPK3 is required for protection against IAV following active vaccination with M2e-VLPTo evaluate if active vaccination remains effective in a host that is susceptible to IAV infection, we immunized Ripk3−/− mice with a broad-spectrum influenza A vaccine candidate based on M2e, and subsequently challenged these mice with a lethal dose of IAV (Fig. 1). The Ripk3−/− mice and their Ripk3+/+ littermates were primed and immunized with the M2e-VLP vaccines or with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), as a negative control. As expected at this high IAV challenge dose, there is no difference between unvaccinated Ripk3−/− versus Ripk3+/+ mice [14]. Almost all Ripk3−/− mice, though vaccinated died soon after infection (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 2A), while most Ripk3+/+ littermates survived. This indicates that RIPK3 not only is involved in the protection against IAV infection [14, 15], but is also crucial for the efficacy of vaccination against IAV.Fig. 1: Ripk3-deficient mice are not protected against IAV lethal infection following active vaccination with M2e-VLP despite similar serum levels of M2e-specific antibodies and viral clearance.A Active vaccination with M2e-VLP particles was administered with Alhydrogel® adjuvant intraperitoneally. Age-matched Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice received either 5 µg/mouse M2e-VLP with Alhydrogel® adjuvant vaccination or just the Alhydrogel® adjuvant dissolved in PBS (vehicle) 3 weeks and 6 weeks before infection. Lethal challenge was done with the mouse-adapted influenza X47 with either 2 × LD50 (virus batch 1) or 0.5 × LD50 (virus batch 2). The experiment was repeated four times independently and data were pooled. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier. A log-rank test verified significant differences between Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice post-vaccination; ****p-value< 0.0001 (GraphPad Prism 8). Similar numbers of female and male mice were used comparing both genotypes (19 females, 3 males Ripk3+/+ versus 21 females, 6 males Ripk3−/−). The body weight readout of this experiment is provided in Supplementary Fig. 2A. B RIPK3-deficient mice effectively produce specific antibodies against M2e: Age-matched Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice were primed (6 weeks before infection) then immunized (3 weeks before infection) 10 μg M2e-VLP with Alhydrogel® adjuvant or received PBS with Alhydrogel® adjuvant (vehicle). Serum samples were prepared two weeks after each immunization. Titers of IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b and total IgG against M2e were measured after the immunization were determined by ELISA. The legend shows the M2e-specific antibody titers obtained for individual mice (dots) of each group from three independent experiments. C Virus clearance from the lungs post vaccination is independent from RIPK3-deficiency: On day 6 post-infection, lungs were harvested and lung homogenates were assessed for viral titers by TCID50. Data for pooled lung homogenates from different mice (two independent experiments) of the same group are shown. The means for TCID50 are shown for each group as indicated in the legend. Error bars represent SD. D Overview of the active vaccination strategy and the results obtained in Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice.Full size imageBoth the innate and acquired immune responses are required for an effective immune response post active vaccination [16]. Therefore, we checked whether the absence of protection of RIPK3-deficient mice following vaccination would be due to impaired production of specific anti-M2e antibodies (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, sera taken from Ripk3−/− mice isolated 2 weeks after the boost with M2e-VLP revealed similar levels of M2e-specific IgG antibodies as the Ripk3+/+ littermates. This finding suggests that besides the antibody production post immunization, other mechanisms contribute to effective vaccination which would be lacking in RIPK3-deficient mice. Active vaccination with M2e-VLP decreases viral titers in the lungs upon IAV challenge [4]. Since RIPK3 is important for viral protection we examined whether viral titers would be different in vaccinated Ripk3-deficient and—proficient animals. At day 6 post-infection, we measured viral titers in the lungs of non-vaccinated and vaccinated mice. We observed that in non-vaccinated mice, the viral loads were similar between the Ripk3+/+ and the Ripk3−/− mice. However, both in Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice vaccination reduces the viral load, however, this tendency is less outspoken in Ripk3−/− (from mean 1.1 × 107 to mean 6.9 × 106, or a reduction of about 40%) compared to the Ripk3+/+ mice (from mean 1.34 × 107 to mean 2 × 106, or a reduction of about 90%) (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that the lack of protection after vaccination in Ripk3−/− mice might be due to increased virus loads in the lungs as a consequence of decreased vaccination efficacy or increased IAV sensitivity and virus propagation.IAV-associated inflammation is reduced in vaccinated Ripk3 −/− miceIn order to understand the underlying phenomena explaining the difference in vaccination efficiency in Ripk3−/− and Ripk3+/+ mice, we determined immune cells infiltration in the lungs following vaccination and infection. Indeed immune cell infiltration is required for protection against IAV lethal infection [17]. We observed that the lung inflammation score of non-vaccinated and vaccinated Ripk3−/− showed a similar tendency for reduced inflammation by histology and injury score (Fig. 2A), less immune infiltrates (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and a higher amount of dead cell as detected by TUNEL staining compared to littermate controls (Fig. 2B). However, quantification of these parameters did not reveal significance because only discrete areas are affected (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. 1B). It was previously shown that IAV-specific CD8+ T cell numbers were significantly diminished upon infection in Ripk3−/− mice compared to littermate controls [10]. These CD8+ T are important for the support and efficient effector immune response. Here, we also observed that in the lung the number of CD8+ cells was more pronouncedly decreased in the vaccinated Ripk3−/− mice compared to the vaccinated Ripk3+/+ littermates (Fig. 2C, D). All these observations suggest that the Ripk3−/− mice may have an impaired innate immune response against IAV leading to reduced protection or enhanced sensitivity.Fig. 2: Immune cells infiltration in the lungs is required for protection against IAV lethal infection.A Vaccinated and non-vaccinated Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice challenged with lethal IAV dose challenge (2 × LD50; virus batch 1) were sacrificed at 6 days post-infection and their lungs were collected and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Representative images of individual mice revealed less inflammation in the vaccinated Ripk3−/− mice compared to their Ripk3+/+ control. B Vaccinated and non-vaccinated Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice challenged with lethal IAV were sacrificed at 6 days post-infection and their lungs were collected. C Representative images displaying TUNEL positivity (red) and cells nuclei (blue) are shown in (B) and CD8 positivity (red) and cell nuclei (blue) is shown in (C). A tendency to accumulate more dying-cells in the lungs of Ripk3−/− mice compared to their Ripk3+/+ controls is observed. D The extent of lung inflammation and injury score was blindly scored (0 - no inflammatory cell infiltration; normal alveolar septa; 1 - mild peribronchial/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in parts of the lung; normal alveolar septa; 2 - moderate peribronchial/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration in parts of the lung; mild thickening of alveolar septa; 3 - severe alveolar and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in parts of the lung; moderate thickening of alveolar septa; 4 - very severe alveolar and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in parts of the lung; severe thickening of alveolar septa; 5 - very severe alveolar and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration throughout the lung; severe thickening of alveolar septa). TUNEL positivity and for CD8 positivity was scored with a software 0.2.3. and QuPath software 0.3.0. respectively. Graphics and statistical analysis were done with GraphPad Prism 8. Comparisons were done with Mann–Whitney test in GraphPad Prism 8.Full size imageOne possibility is that RIPK3 might be implicated in immune cell infiltration and removal of dead cell corpses reflecting a possible deficit in the capacity of executing efferocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis due to reduced recruitment of phagocytes or reduced phagocytic efficacy, or a combination of both. However, Ripk3-deficient peritoneal and alveolar macrophages are as competent as littermate control to perform efferocytosis and antibody-dependent phagocytosis, respectively. Indeed, we found that RIPK3 deficiency does not affect the capacity of peritoneal macrophages to engulf dexamethasone-treated apoptotic thymocytes (Fig. 3A). Since Fc receptors and alveolar macrophages have been demonstrated to be crucial for the protection against lethal IAV infection by passive transfer of anti-M2e IgG [5], we also examined a possible impairment of the process of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). To this end, we developed a method in which M2e-coated polystyrene beads mimicking infected cells were incubated with primary alveolar macrophages isolated from Ripk3+/+ or Ripk3−/− mice in the presence or absence of M2e-specific antibodies. We observed that Ripk3 deficiency does not affect the capacity of alveolar macrophages to engulf M2e-coated beads with or without antibodies, demonstrating that RIPK3 is also dispensable for ADCP (Fig. 3B). Therefore we conclude that very likely the reduced recruitment of immune cells combined with the enhanced sensitivity of RIPK3-deficient mice for IAV infection [10,11,12,13,14] may explain the observed reduced survival of Ripk3−/− mice following vaccination.Fig. 3: RIPK3-deficient macrophages are competent to perform efferocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.A Primary peritoneal macrophages isolated from Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice were co-incubated in 1:5 ratio with apoptotic (dexamethasone-killed, DEX) or non-apoptotic (no DEX) thymocytes stained with pH-sensitive dye, CypHER 5E. Live cell imaging was performed with IncuCyte® S3 (Sartorius). Representative images of macrophages which engulfed DEX-treated or no DEX-treated thymocytes become positive for CypHER 5E (red) can be seen. The difference between Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− at 8 h of co-incubation is shown as fold change relative to the no DEX control (three independent experiments). B M2e-coated fluorescent polystyrene beads were incubated in 2.5:1 ratio with primary alveolar macrophages isolated form Ripk3+/+ or Ripk3−/− mice in the absence or presence of 0.1 μg/mL of isotype control antibody, Anti-SHE or an anti-M2e mouse IgG2a monoclonal antibody (Mab65) specific antibody, Anti-M2e. Live cell imaging was performed with Operetta high content imaging system and analysis was done with Harmony software. The difference between Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− at 8 h of co-incubation is shown as fold increase in antibody-mediated phagocytosis relative to no antibody control (three independent experiments). Significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction (GraphPad Prism 8). Error bars represent SEM.Full size imageIncreased doses of passive immunization with Anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies can completely protect Ripk3-deficient micePassive transfer of anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies protects mice against IAV infection [18]. We wondered whether the increased sensitivity to IAV lethality in Ripk3-deficient mice could be rescued by passive transfer of anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies providing a protective alternative for inefficient active immunization in Ripk3−/− mice. In case of a lethal dose of IAV infection (5× LD50), wild type littermates were completely protected by passive transfer of a moderate dose of anti-M2e antibodies (10 µg/20 g or 0.5 mg/kg), while almost half of the Ripk3−/− mice succumbed (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. 2B). Cox regression did not reveal any significant difference (p = 0.517) between female and male mice exhibiting partial protection in Ripk3−/− during passive vaccination. However, when higher amounts of anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies (50 µg/20 g or 2.5 mg/kg) were used in the passive transfer in combination with the same viral dose for challenge (5× LD50), then all Ripk3−/− mice were also completely protected (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 2C). If mice were infected with a lower viral dose (here 2.4× LD50) in combination with the standard dose of anti-M2e (10 µg/20 g or 0.5 mg/kg) we also reached complete protection in Ripk3−/− mice (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 2C). Altogether these passive vaccination results in conditions of decreased anti-viral protection show a balance between the capacity of passively transfer M2e antibodies to cope with infection and the dose of infection (Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that a deficiency in an antiviral response gene such as Ripk3 could be compensated by sufficient levels of passively administered monoclonal antibodies.Fig. 4: Increased doses of passive immunization with Anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies can completely protect Ripk3-deficient mice.A The administration of a standard dose Anti-M2e (0.5 mg/kg) and challenge with lethal IAV (5 × LD50; viral batch 3) (four independent experiments, total number of mice indicated between brackets). The passive immunization with monoclonal Anti-M2e was done i.p. one day before the i.n. infection with IAV. Survival was monitored daily for up to 18 days post-challenge. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier (GraphPad Prism 8). Similar numbers of female and male mice were used comparing both genotypes (18 females, 15 males Ripk3+/+ versus 18 females, 17 males Ripk3−/−). The body weight readout of this experiment is provided in Supplementary Fig. 2B. Cox regression did not reveal any significant difference (p = 0.517) in survival between female and male mice. B The combination of passive immunization with a standard Anti-M2e dose (0.5 mg/kg) and a decreased (but still lethal) IAV dose (2.4 × LD50; viral batch 3) was performed three times (total number of mice indicated between brackets). The combination of passive immunization with an increased dose of Anti-M2e (2.5 mg/kg) and lethal IAV dose (5 × LD50; viral batch 3) in three independent experiments (total number of mice indicated in the legends). The passive immunization with monoclonal Anti-M2e was done i.p. one day before the i.n. infection with IAV. Survival was monitored daily for up to 18 days post-challenge. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier (GraphPad Prism 8). The body weight readout of this experiment is provided in Supplementary Fig. 2C. C Scheme of passive immunization and main conclusions. Overview of the results in terms or survival of Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice are shown in approximative percentages based on the results in panels (A and B). Similar numbers of female and male mice were used comparing both genotypes (27 females, 14 males Ripk3+/+ versus 26 females, 13 males Ripk3−/−).Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we examined whether a state of fairly enhanced sensitivity to IAV infection in Ripk3−/− mice [14], would affect the efficacy of active immunization with M2e viral antigen or passive immunization by transfer of anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies. Since RIPK3, both as a kinase and a scaffold protein, is implicated in many cellular processes such as necroptosis, apoptosis, inflammasome activation, and pyroptosis induction, its loss may be associated with a reduced induction of an anti-viral state in an infected host. This could be a model for populations at risk for severe IAV infection such as elderly, children, pregnant women, and immunodeficient patients [19, 20]. To date, a potential correlation between RIPK3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and an increased susceptibility to IAV in human hosts has not been investigated. Additional investigation needs to be done to explore this possibility. Given the development of RIPK1 and RIPK3 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases [21,22,23], our work reveals an important caveat. Future patients receiving such RIPK inhibitors may be immunocompromised and could benefit from monoclonal antibody therapy overcoming any deficits in influenza immunity. We and others showed that, at least in mice, RIPK3 is an important mediator of protection against IAV infection [10, 14, 15, 24,25,26]. However, we have reported previously that this sensitizing effect of RIPK3 deficiency is only limited to a certain level of viral challenge. Indeed, morbidity and lethality after a high IAV challenge Ripk3−/− mice were comparable to those in their Ripk3+/+ littermates [14].Interestingly, active immunization of Ripk3−/− mice with recombinant M2e-VLPs could raise equal titers of M2e-specific serum IgG antibodies as compared to immunization of Ripk3+/+ mice, but this apparently does not result in a protective effect against a lethal influenza challenge. The full ability of Ripk3−/− mice to produce antibodies against M2e suggests that other factors than M2e-specific antibodies contribute to an efficient antibody-mediated protection. We found that non-vaccinated and vaccinated Ripk3−/− mice display reduced immune cells infiltration in the lungs and accumulate more dying cells post infection compared to their wild type littermates. Conceptually, these phenomena could be due to decreased ADCP and efferocytosis. However, our experiments did not reveal a difference in these processes in peritoneal and alveolar-derived macrophages from Ripk3+/+ littermates and Ripk3−/− mice. Since the Ripk3−/− mice are able to produce normal levels of M2e-specific antibodies following M2e-VLP immunization, humoral immune responses following active immunization are not impaired in Ripk3-deficient mice. However, despite these equal levels of protective antibodies, a differential response was observed following viral challenge between Ripk3−/− mice and Ripk3+/+ littermates. The former showed a tendency for increased viral loads following vaccination, decreased inflammation score, reduced infiltration of CD8+ immune cells, and accumulation of dead cell corpses in the lungs, suggesting that the innate arm is compromised in Ripk3-deficient mice. We do not exclude that other immune cells important in the IAV clearance such as neutrophils and NK cells could also be reduced in the vaccinated Ripk3−/− mice contributing to their inability to efficiently respond to active vaccination.Although most of the differences in viral load, inflammation, and cell death parameters in the lung between the vaccinated Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice only showed a tendency and were not significant, the combination of these three parameters can have a crucial impact on the lethal phenotype observed in Ripk3−/− mice despite vaccination. Also, we cannot exclude that there might be a difference in the induction of M2e-specific T cells [25]. Altogether, our work supports two potential, non-exclusive scenarios for the enhanced sensitivity of Ripk3−/− mice in the active vaccination model. One possibility is that non-humoral arms of vaccine-induced immunity are impaired under RIPK3 deficiency leading to reduced numbers of CD8+ T-cells. The other possibility reflects a cell-autonomous role of RIPK3 in controlling IAV infection up to mid-range IAV doses. In order to examine whether the immunocompromised Ripk3-deficient mice could still be protected by antibodies, we delivered anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies prior to IAV infection. The transfer of high dose of anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies protects the Ripk3−/− mice from a lethal IAV infection [18] while a moderate dose does not. Passive transfer with anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies was shown to limit viral load in the infected lungs which can modulate the susceptibility of the Ripk3−/− mice to the IAV making them less susceptible to the same dose of infection [14, 26],. It is clear from our experiments that modulation of the viral dose in the lungs is crucial for the survival of Ripk3−/− mice [14]. Protective host strategies against IAV infection consist in the capacity to rapidly recognize and eliminate the virus or to quickly regain fitness by reducing the negative impact of infection [27]. It seems that Ripk3−/− mice are not able to reduce the pathogen burden when it reaches a certain threshold, and eventually succumb to the infection [14]. Interestingly, active vaccination helps them to produce antibodies, but not to sufficiently to reduce viral titers, therefore Ripk3−/− mice, are not protected by this vaccination. However, when passive immunization is used at a high dose, this could decrease viral burden and rescue the Ripk3−/− mice from lethal IAV infection.The reduced infiltration of immune cells and CD8+ cells observed in Ripk3−/− mice may also be explained, at least partly, by reduced vascular permeability. Indeed, Ripk3−/− mice have reduced endothelial permeability affecting tumor migration into the lung using a B16 melanoma model [28]. It is therefore conceivable that a similar endothelial mechanism may also contribute to reduced diffusion of antibodies in lung tissue and BAL fluid, in line with the reduced efficacy of humoral protection despite identical titers following active vaccination and with the higher amount of monoclonal antibodies required for protection following passive vaccination. To examine such a role of RIPK3 in the endothelial compartment during active and passive vaccination, one would need to perform experiments in endothelium-specific Ripk3−/− mice.This finding provides a clinically relevant option for patients at risk which may not respond to active vaccination and argues that in antiviral compromised organisms the passive vaccination may bypass the affected innate immune system. For example, one study on adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness during the 2017–18 influenza season in the USA showed that the deduced influenza vaccine effectiveness in hospitalized immunocompromised patients was as low as 5% compared to 41% in the immunocompetent individuals [28]. Furthermore, emerging data show that monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for the treatment of IAV infections in the future [29, 30], whenever vaccines are not effective. Some of these antibodies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [31]. These monoclonal antibody-based anti-IAV strategies may also be required to cope with the actual COVID-19 pandemic and the continuous occurrence of variants.Material and methodsMiceRipk3−/− and littermate controls Ripk3+/+ were kindly provided by Vishva Dixit (Genentech, San Francisco). The Ripk3−/− animals were congenic to the C57BL/6N background. All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a conventional animal house. 7–13 weeks-old mice were used in all experiments. All animal experiments were performed under conditions specified by law (European Directive and Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 1993) and reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals (EC2016-17).Active vaccination with M2e-VLP and virus challengeAge-matched Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice were intraperitoneally injected two times with 5 µg of purified M2e-VLP in the absence or presence of Alhydrogel® adjuvant (Brenntag Biosector Specification, total volume, 200 µl). The M2e-VLP 1965, expressed by and purified from recombinant E. coli cells, was used for active vaccination and comprises 1–162 amino acids of HBc and they are able to entrap bacterial RNA [31]. Control mice received a vehicle containing Alhydrogel® adjuvant in PBS, pH 7.4. The two injections were given at 3-week intervals. Three weeks after the last immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted of X47 influenza virus. Depending on the viral batch preparation the challenge following active vaccination was with a lethal dose of either 2 × LD50 [1 × LD50 corresponding to approximately 30 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)] (virus batch 1) or 0.5 × LD50 (1 × LD50 corresponds with 80 plaque-forming units or pfu) (virus batch 2). The virus was administered intranasally in a total volume of 50 µl to mice anesthetized by ketamine (44 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Mice were either monitored for survival and weight loss over a period of 18 days. We used the following 4 scores of clinical symptoms: 0 = no visible signs of disease; 1 = slight ruffling of fur; 2 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility; 3 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility, rapid breathing; 4 = ruffled fur, minimal mobility, huddled appearance, rapid and/or labored breathing indicative of pneumonia and body temperature below 32 °C. For the combination of body weight loss by 30% and a clinical score 4 the mice were considered moribund and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation (EC2016-17).Serum preparation and analysis of the production of antibodies against M2eBlood samples were obtained from every mouse, before immunization, after the first boost, and after the second boost. Serum was prepared and the presence of M2e-specific antibodies was determined by ELISA, as described previously [4].Passive transfer of Anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies and virus challengePurified Anti-M2e IgG monoclonal antibody (clone mAb 65) [18] or isotype control were i.p. injected at 0.5 mg/kg or 2.5 mg/kg as indicated in the figure legends (200 µl/mouse) in naive mice. After 24 h, the mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (44 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) and challenged by intranasal administration of 50 μl of different doses of mouse-adapted X47 (H3N2) IAV, as indicated in the figure legends. For passive immunization experiments challenges were performed with lethal doses of 2.4 × LD50 or 5 × LD50 of a viral batch in which 1 × LD50 corresponds to 175 pfu (virus batch 3). Mortality and body weight loss were monitored for up to 30 days after challenge.TCID50 assayTCID50 assays were used to determine the amount of infectious virus in lung homogenates of each condition. MDCK cells cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.4 mM Na-pyruvate were seeded in 96-well plates to reach confluence overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were washed in serum-free medium and incubated with 10-fold dilutions of virus samples containing 1 μg/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma). After 6 days, the presence of virus in each well was determined by agglutination of chicken erythrocytes. TCID50 values were calculated based on the Reed and Muench method [32].Lung histologyLungs were collected from indicated mice sacrificed on day 6 post-infection. Tissues were covered in cryo-embedding media, kept in liquid nitrogen until completely submerged, then stored at −80 °C until ready for sectioning. 4 mm sections were cut with a cryotome and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescence, sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at RT, washed with PBS, then incubated in “permeabilisation solution” containing 0.05% TX-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice (4 °C). Cell death was analyzed with an in situ cell death detection kit (TMR-red, Roche) after antigen retrieval either alone or followed by staining with anti-CD45 (AB 10558 Abcam) and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG DyLight488 (ThermoFicher ref: 35553). Anti-CD8a (AB 217344, Abcam) was used 1/100 combined with a secondary Goat anti-Rabbit IgG AF568. Hoechst 33342 was used to stain nuclei. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopy was performed using ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1. Samples were analyzed with Zen 3.2. blue edition (Zeiss) and quantified with QuPath software 0.2.3.Macrophage isolationResident peritoneal macrophages were obtained by flushing the peritoneal cavity of mice with 10 ml of cold PBS containing 5% FCS. Collected cells were spun down and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM Na-pyruvate, L-glutamine, penicilin/strepomycin (100 U/100 Ag/ml), HEPES, β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mM non-essential amino acids. The cells were plated at a concentration of 4.5 × 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Floating cells were washed away the next day and remaining peritoneal macrophages were used 2 days after isolation. Alveolar macrophages were collected from mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal (pentobarbital; 125 mg/kg in PBS; Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark). A small incision was made in the trachea to put a lavage cannula in the trachea. Lungs were lavaged three times with 1 ml of HBSS with 0.05 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was kept on ice. Collected cells were centrifuged, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM Na-pyruvate, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/100 Ag/ml), HEPES, β-mercaptoethanol, and seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in a 96-well plate. Cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 2 h before phagocytosis assays.Beads preparation and ADCPAmine-modified polystyrene beads (Polysciences) were pre-activated with 8% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde for 4 h at room temperature. Beads were conjugated with 10 µg/ml of M2e peptide and 0.2 mg/ml of Alexa Fluor N-hydroxy-succinimide ester dyes (Life Technologies) on a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C. After quenching in PBS containing 0.5 M glycine for 2 h, beads were used for ADCP assays. Beads were incubated in 2.5:1 ratio with freshly isolated alveolar macrophages in the absence or presence of 0.1 μg/ml of isotype control antibody, anti-SHE (IgG2a isotype control MAbs directed against the small hydrophobic protein of human respiratory syncytial virus) [33] or M2e-specific antibody [34, 35]. Live cell imaging was performed with Operetta high content imaging system and analysis was done with Harmony software (PerkinElmer).Efferocytosis assayThymocytes were isolated from 4 to 6-week-old mice and induced to undergo apoptosis with 20 µM dexamethasone for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Thymocytes were then stained with CypHer5E (GE Healthcare), counted, and added to adherent peritoneal macrophages at a macrophage: apoptotic target ratio of 1:5. Live cell imaging was performed and analyzed with IncuCyte® S3 (Sartorius).

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 28-Mar-2022 NUS-Monash University collaboration produces universal flu vaccine candidate Peer-Reviewed Publication National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine image: Graphical Abstract view more Credit: NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine Influenza, commonly referred to as “flu”, is a major global public health concern and a huge economic burden to societies. Seasonal influenza epidemics afflict between 13 to 100 million individuals annually, including three to five million cases of severe illness and 300,000 to 600,000 deaths worldwide. This represents a top global public health concern and an extraordinary economic burden to all societies. Pandemics are less frequent, but are generally more severe and pose a greater threat. Over the past century, there have been at least four devastating pandemics caused by the Influenza A virus which took the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals. Although vaccination arguably represents the most effective way to prevent influenza, current vaccination strategies suffer from certain limitations, chief of which require current influenza vaccines to be updated annually to match circulating strains. This results in low vaccination take-up rates and poor coverage due to inaccurate prediction of circulating strains. Broadly protective, “universal” flu vaccines that do not need to be updated annually have therefore been pursued. The highly conserved M2e peptide is a leading universal flu candidate; this peptide shares a conserved sequence with nearly all known human Influenza A strains. However, its limited ability to trigger a strong and long-lasting immune response has represented a major roadblock in its clinical development. Researchers from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore and Monash University in Melbourne have published a paper in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America where they successfully leveraged on a novel vaccine platform to deliver M2e to immune cells. This allowed them to prove that a single shot immunisation containing M2e was able to trigger long-lasting immune responses that could protect effectively against multiple strains of the flu. The team was also able to demonstrate that this vaccination approach significantly enhanced protective immune responses in the context of pre-existing flu immunity. This scenario is particularly relevant in adult and elderly populations, where individuals have been exposed to flu viruses multiple times in the past and have low levels of M2e-specific antibodies in their blood circulation. This vaccine approach has the potential to minimise the amount of M2e vaccine antigen (substance that triggers the body’s immune response against that itself) and the number of injections required for effective and long-lasting protection. It also removes the need for strong adjuvants (a substance which enhances the body's immune response to an antigen), reducing potential side-effects, particularly in more vulnerable populations. Beyond the flu, this vaccine platform could be employed to tackle a multitude of diseases, including infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of developing versatile, powerful platforms for the rapid deployment of vaccines against any highly virulent diseases. This new finding could lend itself to further development of vaccines for this, or any future, novel diseases. The team is currently working on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate using the same strategy. “This journey has been very exciting. All of this work is the result of a long-standing and strong partnership with A/Prof Mireille Lahoud at Monash University’s Biomedicine Discovery Institute (BDI), and the support from both institutions,” said Associate Professor Sylvie Alonso from NUS Medicine. Assoc Prof Alonso is the co-Director of the Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme (ID TRP) at the School and has a keen interest in vaccines and therapeutics. “We are excited to continue our strong collaboration with A/Prof Sylvie Alonso at NUS. In the world we live in, this vaccine platform provides a key opportunity for developing vaccines and immunotherapies to meet future global health threats”, said Associate Professor Mireille Lahoud, who leads the Dendritic Cell Receptors Laboratory at Monash BDI.

In contrast, weighted ORs for RSV and adenovirus, respectively, were 0.78 and 0.64 for mechanical ventilation and 0.60 and 1.53 for death.In a University of Edinburgh press release, senior author Kenneth Baillie, MBChB, PhD, said that the study findings will be important as many countries reduce the use of COVID-19 public health measures such as physical distancing."We expect that Covid-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections," he said. "That is why we should change our testing strategy for Covid-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely."The researchers called for further promotion of COVID-19 and flu vaccinations, as well as testing of hospitalized COVID-19 patients for the flu to identify at-risk patients and those who might have different responses to immune system-modifying and antiviral treatments. "It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late," coauthor Calum Semple, PhD, of the University of Liverpool, said in the release.Coauthor Peter Openshaw, MBBS, of Imperial College London, said that viral coinfections are rare but do occur and that vaccinations against COVID-19 and the flu are a must because the two work in very different ways. "The way that these two infections are treated is also different, so it's important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection," he said.

(CBC)Social SharingAs COVID-19 restrictions end and New Brunwickers try to find the way back to "normal," the message from politicians and health authorities has often been this: We're going to have to learn to live with it.After all, some say, we've learned to live with the flu.But that comparison worries Colin Furness.COVID-19 and flu are not the same, said Furness, an infection control epidemiologist from Ontario who has been watching New Brunswick's experience with the pandemic. "There's an enormous danger to treating COVID like a respiratory virus and then holding it up against the flu," he said. "I really do blame governments, and to some extent public health authorities for not being clear about the nature of the dangers posed by COVID," said Furness. "And it's frustrating to me that your average Canadian sees COVID as a moderate-risk respiratory virus. That couldn't be further from the truth."While COVID-19 has a respiratory phase, it is not a respiratory virus and it can cause serious long-term — even permanent — damage.Scientists are still working to understand the lingering effects of the disease, including the loss of brain tissue and damage to vital organs. "Flu is none of that," said Furness. "Flu is a respiratory virus. And if it doesn't kill you, it disappears completely." COVID stats eclipse the fluInfluenza statistics don't come close to what New Brunswick is seeing with COVID. The most recent statistics available from the Department of Health are for Week 10, which was March 6 to 12. In that week, there were no cases of influenza reported and not a single hospitalization due to the flu. The same goes for week 10 last year. In fact, there have only been 18 influenza cases reported so far this flu season. In 2020, just before the pandemic was declared, Week 10 saw 228 new cases of the flu and 28 new hospitalizations. In 2019, Week 10 brought 102 new cases and 18 new hospitalizations. As of March 12, there have been no deaths reported from the flu in the current flu season. The same goes for the same period in 2021. By this time in 2020, there were six deaths, and in 2019, there were 20. By comparison, just last week, there were 13 COVID-related deaths in New Brunswick, while more than 7,000 new cases were reported, nearly 600 health-care workers were off sick, and nearly 150 people were hospitalized with COVID. Despite the huge difference in numbers, Dr. Brenda Wilson, a public health physician and a professor of community health at Memorial University, understands why people make comparisons to the flu. For many people who get COVID, it feels pretty much like the flu, she said. But for others, roughly 10 to 30 per cent of all cases, COVID "is going to turn into something else. And that's why it's not like the flu." Wilson said what COVID does physiologically to the body "is well beyond what you would typically get with the flu." Plus, the long-term effects of COVID won't be known for years. 'Just like the flu'Premier Blaine Higgs has frequently mentioned that his symptoms were like a flu or cold, while the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has repeatedly said the province will continue to monitor COVID-19 the same way it monitors influenza. Furness said monitoring COVID like the flu is a dangerous thing. First of all, he said health officials aren't really good at monitoring the flu. "And if that's how we're treating COVID, we will have very little sense of what kind of population immunity we have for the next wave. We'll have very little sense of what variants might be developing. It's quite concerning to be as blind to COVID as we feel OK being blind to flu."Scaling back testing and monitoring also has unintended consequences, Wilson said.Dr. Brenda Wilson is a public health physician and a professor of community health at Memorial University. (CBC)Doing so sends an implicit — if not explicit — message that everything is under control and the pandemic is over. Wilson said that's when people start to relax. "And that encourages even more spread. So the whole decision to change testing may come from a good, rational analysis of how best to use your health care resources, but it does come with a lot of signals to the population." Furness thinks testing and reporting of COVID should return to previous levels. But to do that, said Furness, means governments would have to admit that they "made a gigantic mistake and created a lot of harm and suffering — and governments don't like saying that."It's staggering to me that we have paired a refusal to measure with a refusal to take the most basic protections. So we're pulling both back at the same time, which is essentially like pretending COVID isn't there. But it is and is going to cause a great deal of harm to some people, people who are particularly vulnerable." That includes children under five, the elderly, and people who have significant health issues. "For all of those people, life has gotten really terrifying because if we're not measuring it, we're not controlling it. And worse, we're responding by pretending that it's not there," said Furness. N.B. reports 13 new COVID-related deaths in past week, increase in hospitalizations When health officials aren't keeping a close watch over the disease, he said they won't know when added measures are needed. "So that's the real problem of choosing to be blind — is that it completely paralyzes our ability to do even basic things to protect people."The other casualty, said Furness, is vaccinations. "What we find is when governments are providing a narrative that COVID is no big deal … people stop getting vaccinated. And that is a huge mistake. Vaccination remains one of the most important things we can do to keep the population safe, especially vulnerable people within the population." Despite constant reminders by Russell and Health Minister Dorothy Shephard, vaccination rates in New Brunswick have plummeted. Furness said it's happening across the country. He said those who are concerned have already been vaccinated, and those dead-set against it, never will. In the middle, is a group that can still be convinced that getting vaccinated is the right thing to do.Suggesting to people COVID is like the flu or a cold won't convince them to get the shot, said Furness. Instead, it'll probably lead them to believe the threat has passed. ABOUT THE AUTHORMia UrquhartMia Urquhart is a journalist with CBC New Brunswick, based in Saint John.

This has held true for a century; and moreover, recent work from the United Kingdom correlates reductions in carriage‐promoting social behaviours with a reduction in IMD incidence, suggesting that public health policies aimed at influencing behaviour might further reduce this disease.4 These observations resonate in 2022 as we reflect on the impact of broad scale public health measures taken during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Influenza and invasive meningococcal disease In recent times, the interplay between IMD and influenza has become increasingly understood.5 This correlation was demonstrated in a multi‐country analysis of the coincident seasonality of both infections, and supported by evidence that surges in influenza infections were followed by acute increases in IMD incidence.6,7 Both infections are spread between humans in proximity. The nasopharyngeal epithelial injury associated with influenza infection secondary to neuraminidase or immune dysfunction may permit colonist Neisseria meningitidis to invade and cause disease.8 In a study of IMD and influenza peaks in the United States between 1989 and 2009, correlation was identified in 19 of 20 seasons, with influenza H3N2 and H1N1 peaks being highly synchronised while pandemic influenza H1N1, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus peaks were not.5 Notably, spikes in case numbers of seasonal influenza are typically reported in winter, as are cases of IMD. The correlation of disease spikes in Australia of confirmed cases of these diseases is pronounced, with 33 of 36 statistically detectable IMD case count spikes at 6 standard deviations concordant with independently detected spike periods for influenza between 2006 and 2021 (Box 1). In Australia, both IMD and influenza are notifiable to government under legislation, and in 2020 and 2021, coincident with the global COVID‐19 pandemic, both IMD and influenza case numbers were the lowest since records began. We posit that this reduction in case numbers can be attributed to the series of intersecting public health policies and practices, including COVID‐19 prevention. The corollary of these interventions was the substantial reduction in notifications of other transmissible diseases, including pertussis and invasive pneumococcal disease.9 Further, IMD and influenza vaccination programs that have been systematically rolled out across Australia have also been influential in disease control (Box 2). COVID‐19 pandemic public health measures and their impact on IMD and influenza Broad‐ranging public health policies were introduced in Australia in response to the emergence of COVID‐19. These aimed to limit the spread of the disease by improved hygiene and physical distancing. Policies that limited crowding, including education about and enforcement of personal and social distancing measures, limitations on gathering sizes, and school closures, were enacted to prevent person‐to‐person transmission. Additional state‐level border closures, and local‐level lockdowns relating to hotspots likely further hindered the movement of pathogens. International travel restrictions limited the importation of infections from overseas. Given the pathophysiological association between influenza and N. meningitidis, it is perhaps not entirely unexpected that the implementation of COVID‐19 restrictions has had a muting effect on IMD cases. Before restrictions were implemented in Australia in March 2020, there were 12 cases of IMD reported in January 2020, 13 cases in February 2020, then six cases in March 2020.9 Following restrictions, there were on average < 7 cases per month for the remainder of 2020.9 For the corresponding first quarter period for 2021 (January to March), after the introduction of restrictions, the reported IMD case numbers were substantially lower than for the corresponding period in 2020, with 18 cases recorded.9 During years when spikes in influenza have been seen, IMD case numbers have been considerably higher. The impact of COVID‐19 public health policies on influenza has been previously documented in Australia and overseas.10 The number of laboratory‐confirmed influenza notifications from Australia in 2020 was 21 354,9 and 748 in 2021 (personal communication, National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, Australian Government Department of Health), substantially less than the 313 465 cases detected in 2019.9 In 2020, the vast majority (94%; 20 061/21 354) of influenza cases were reported from January to March, before the broad public health strategies and policies were implemented against COVID‐19. Of note, rates of other viruses transmitted via the respiratory route also decreased, including measles, varicella and rubella.11 Impact of vaccination practices and policies in Australia on IMD rates Since 2003, progressive vaccine rollouts in Australia have influenced IMD rates. Vaccination programs targeting meningococcal serogroups and also those targeting influenza are relevant to IMD case reduction. Regarding meningococcal vaccination, several formulations are available in Australia, providing coverage against serogroups A (quadrivalent), B (recombinant), C (monovalent, quadrivalent, combination), W (quadrivalent) and Y (quadrivalent). The availability and funded delivery of the different vaccine classes has broadened over the past two decades, and has influenced the characteristics of seasonal meningococcal spikes. Meningococcal serogroup C vaccination has demonstrably reduced national IMD rates,12 with a National Immunisation Program (NIP) funded monovalent vaccine available since 2003. The effect has been considerable, with IMD notifications falling from a peak 3.5 cases per 100 000 population (in 2001 and 2002) to 0.8 cases per 100 000 in 2019, before the COVID‐19 pandemic.9 Since 2018, the change from monovalent serogroup C to serogroup A, C, W and Y vaccination expanded coverage on the NIP for infants and then adolescents.13 This change followed initial jurisdictional level responses to serogroup W outbreaks and an increase in serogroup Y disease from 2017.12 Meningococcal serogroup B vaccination has been registered for individuals aged 2 months and over since August 2013. From October 2018, it was funded for eligible children including those residing in South Australia, where serogroup B disease rates are high, and then to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants nationally via the NIP on 1 July 2020. As such, only a very small proportion of the population is vaccinated, and impact is small. Seasonal influenza vaccination in Australia has been progressively expanded over the past several decades in terms of funded coverage as well as strain coverage. Annual influenza vaccination has been offered under the NIP since 1997,14 and is currently recommended to all people aged 6 months and older.13 Presently, seven quadrivalent influenza vaccines are registered for use, containing two influenza A and two influenza B viral strains.15 Influenza vaccination reduces the frequency and severity of influenza infection, and it seems feasible that it would also reduce the likelihood of an individual developing IMD. Implications for policy and practice in Australia and globally The constellation of practices and policies in Australia targeting IMD and influenza over the past two decades, culminating in the extensive COVID‐19 public health measures commencing in 2020, coincided in the lowest rates of IMD and influenza since national records were kept. This outcome has likely manifested through a range of mechanisms. Several key public health lessons pertaining to these policies and practices have been learnt. The first lessons relate to changes in IMD vaccination policy and seasonal influenza vaccination uptake. Expanded meningococcal vaccination coverage nationally has correlated with progressive reductions in serogroup‐specific IMD. Ongoing efforts are required to continue targeting serogroups that prevail, notably serogroup B. Moreover, in recognising the clear correlation between influenza and IMD spikes, measures that prevent influenza, including seasonal influenza vaccination, may play an important role in IMD case mitigation in the future. Additional lessons relate to the impact of public health measures targeting COVID‐19 that have had wider benefits in terms of reduction of transmissible diseases. The broad‐scale public education strategies aimed at disrupting transmission dynamics, including restricting travel, improving hand hygiene practices, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, and mask wearing, have directly or indirectly influenced case numbers. There is little doubt that general awareness of infection control principles and practices has been raised in the population. This reinforces recent findings that changing social behaviours might further reduce rates of IMD, and is consistent with the historic findings from controlled defence settings,3 but also demonstrates that reductions in case numbers can be achieved in a broader social context and on a far greater scale. Lessons are still being learnt with regard to the impact of COVID‐19 itself on IMD. However, based on data available to date, there appears to be little firm evidence suggesting that COVID‐19 itself is associated with IMD, given the decline in IMD cases seen during the COVID‐19 pandemic period, and particularly during the surge of cases seen with SARS‐CoV‐2 variant of concern Omicron. Moving forward, while the combination of factors that have driven IMD and influenza in Australia to their lowest levels on record in 2020 and 2021 may not continue to conspire, the public health lessons will hopefully not be forgotten.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article The intranasal live attenuated flu vaccine is just as safe for children with asthma as the intramuscular inactivated vaccine, a small clinical trial suggested. Within 42 days of vaccination, 10.8% of children who received the intranasal quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) experienced an asthma exacerbation compared with 14.7% of those who received the intramuscular quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4; risk difference -0.0390, 90% CI -0.1453 to 0.0674), reported C. Buddy Creech, MD, MPH, of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, and colleagues. Regardless of asthma severity, LAIV4 remained noninferior to IIV4, the group noted in Pediatrics. Among those with mild asthma, one of 25 kids who received the LAIV4 experienced an asthma exacerbation versus three of 16 in the IIV4 group, the researchers reported. In children with moderate to severe asthma, exacerbations occurred in seven of 49 in the LAIV4 group and seven of 52 in the IIV4 group. "These data add to the compelling safety record of LAIV in children, including those with persistent asthma," they wrote. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the frequency of asthma-related symptoms, including nighttime awakening, unscheduled albuterol use, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness, within 14 days of administration. Additionally, there were no significant differences in changes in peak expiratory flow rate, or changes in childhood asthma control test or asthma control test scores from baseline through 42 days. Currently, the CDC recommends against the nasal spray vaccine for children and people with asthma, citing an increased risk of exacerbations. A previous study had suggested that the LAIV was associated with increased risk of asthma and reactive airway disease in children under 36 months of age, but subsequent studies have found no difference in risk between the LAIV and IIV, Creech and team explained. "Building off these previous studies, our prospective study suggests that LAIV may be appropriate for some children with asthma," they noted. "These data support reexamining precautions to using LAIV4 in children with asthma, which could be particularly important during influenza pandemics, at times when IIV4 supplies are limited, in situations of public/school mass vaccination clinics using LAIV, or for children with significant needle aversions," they added. The study was conducted over the 2018 and 2019 flu seasons at three U.S. sites. It initially only included children ages 5 to 11 with a current diagnosis of persistent asthma who were otherwise in good health, but expanded to include children ages 5 to 17 in its second year. The primary outcome of asthma exacerbation after 42 days was defined as an episode for which the participant sought medical care or a new prescription for corticosteroids. The study was designed to enroll 270 participants, but only enrolled 151 over two seasons. The median age of the enrolled participants was 9 years, and 58% were boys. Systemic reactogenicity events in the 14 days after vaccination were not different between the LAIV4 and IIV4 groups, with the exceptions of myalgia (P<0.001) and sore throat (P=0.051), which were more common in the IIV4 group. Creech and colleagues noted that the late release of the LAIV in 2018 due to efficacy concerns reduced provider and parental confidence, affecting their sample size.

Khalid Ijaz1, Raymond W. Nims2, Julie McKinney1 & …Charles P. Gerba3 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 12, Article number: 5247 (2022) Cite this article 3531 Accesses 1 Citations 39 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects AntimicrobialsApplied microbiology AbstractThe clothes laundering process affords numerous opportunities for dissemination of infectious virus from contaminated clothing to appliance surfaces and other household surfaces and eventually to launderer’s hands. We have explored the efficacy of laundry sanitizers for inactivating coronaviruses and influenza viruses. Virucidal efficacy was tested using standardized suspension inactivation methods (EN 14476) or hard-surface inactivation methods (ASTM E1053-20) against SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E), influenza A virus (2009-H1N1 A/Mexico), or influenza B virus (B/Hong Kong). Efficacy was measured in terms of log10 reduction in infectious virus titer, after 15 min contact time (suspension studies) or 5 min contact time (hard surface studies) at 20 ± 1 °C. In liquid suspension studies, laundry sanitizers containing p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX) or quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) caused complete inactivation (≥ 4 log10) of HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV-2 within 15 min contact time at 20 ± 1 °C. In hard surface studies, complete inactivation (≥ 4 log10) of each coronavirus or influenza virus, including SARS-CoV-2, was observed following a 5-min contact time at 20 ± 1 °C. Respiratory viruses may remain infectious on clothing/fabrics and environmental surfaces for hours to days. The use of a laundry sanitizer containing microbicidal actives may afford mitigation of the risk of contamination of surfaces during handling of the laundry and washing appliances (i.e., washer/dryer or basin), adjacent surfaces, the waste water stream, and the hands of individuals handling clothes contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, or other emerging enveloped viruses.

It could be argued that laundry detergent, in association with elevated water temperatures, has sufficient microbicidal efficacy that an additional agent (i.e., the sanitizer) is not required. There are several factors to consider, however, when addressing this issue. The clothes-washing process is complex, and consists of multiple steps capable of reducing pathogen load1,2. These steps include: (1) removal, through the action of the detergent and the water rinse; (2) inactivation by the detergent; and (3) possible thermal inactivation by the water used for soaking and rinsing. From a virucidal point of view, it may be assumed that detergent inactivation should apply primarily to lipid-enveloped viruses3,4, while removal should apply to all viruses (i.e., both lipid-enveloped and well as non-enveloped). Extent of thermal inactivation will be dependent upon the temperature of the water used for the wash and rinse portions of the washing cycle, and upon the target virus. Usually, 40 °C or higher is recommended for eliminating bacterial and viral pathogens2. In the case of cold (20 to 23 °C)5 and warm water (≤ 40 °C)2 cycles, minimal inactivation attributable solely to heating (i.e., thermal inactivation alone, in the absence of detergent) of SARS-CoV-2 would be expected over the time course of a washing cycle3,6,7. Removal of non-inactivated virus simply transfers infectious virus from one location to another, possibly contaminating other surfaces and the waste-water stream5. The wastewater (gray water) stream may be reused in some households for landscape irrigation, flushing toilets or other purposes8. Another consideration is that some types of clothing can only be hand-washed and, in some regions of the world, hand-washing of clothing is the only option available9. Even in North America ~ 6% of laundry is still hand washed9. To reduce the risks from pathogens and for a higher level of assurance of interrupting the spread of highly pathogenic viruses via contaminating clothing and environmental surfaces associated with the clothes laundering process, the use of EPA-registered laundry sanitizers, surface hygiene agents, and hand hygiene agents may be warranted10,11. This is especially true during a viral outbreak such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic now being experienced and the emergence of mutational variants with increased morbidity or transmissibility (e.g., the Delta and Omicron variants).A few marketed laundry sanitizing agents have been characterized as antibacterial. We were unable to identify reports of the ability of such products to inactivate viruses in general, or SARS-CoV-2, in particular. In the present study, we have examined the virucidal efficacy of a selection of formulated microbicidal active-containing laundry sanitizers against four enveloped viruses: coronaviruses, including the alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) and the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2), and the orthomyxoviruses influenza A and B. The suspension testing methodology described in international standard EN 14,476:2013 + A2:201912 and the hard surface testing methodology described in ASTM International E-1053-20 13 were employed. As mentioned above, there are multiple opportunities for dissemination of virus during the laundering process, and not all of these are addressed by the actual efficacy for viral removal and inactivation by the detergent and water-based washing and rinsing process. Other risks may best be mitigated through use of additional hygiene agents, including possibly laundry sanitizers, surface hygiene agents, and hand hygiene agents10,11. The rationale for conducting both suspension and hard surface testing was that laundry sanitizers are intended not only to sanitize the washed clothes but also the surfaces of the washing machines exposed to potentially contaminated clothes/washinse solutions (Fig. 1).Figure 1Schematic view of the machine clothes laundering process, indicating possible risk points for enveloped virus accumulation and cross-contamination. These cross-contaminations can potentially be mitigated by application of additional targeted hand/surface hygiene agents26,33.Full size imageMethodsChallenge viruses, host cell lines, and reagentsVirucidal efficacy testing against alpha- and beta-coronaviruses and influenza viruses A and B was performed for commercially available laundry sanitizer products per standardized hard surface and suspension methods. Details on the challenge viruses and the host cell lines used for propagation of viral stocks and for in vitro cell-based infectivity assays are shown in Table 1. This table also indicates the culture media used for propagating the cells and the contract testing organizations that performed the virucidal efficacy testing.Table 1 Viruses and detector cell lines used.Full size tableStandardized suspension efficacy testing methodologyVirucidal efficacy evaluations of laundry sanitizers against coronaviruses suspended in liquid matrices were conducted per EN 14476:2013 + A2:201912. The challenge matrix in each case was cell culture medium containing an organic load. The microbicidal active ingredient concentrations in the products as tested, contact times, exposure temperatures, and the organic loads evaluated, are each indicated in Table 2. A brief description of the methodology follows: One-mL soil load at 10 × concentration was mixed with an equal volume of virus. Eight mL of formulated microbicidal active-containing laundry sanitizer, at concentration sufficient to achieve the final concentration listed in Table 2, were added. The resulting solutions were subjected to vortex mixing. The test solutions were held for the indicated contact times at 20 ± 1 °C. Following the exposure periods, the test solutions were immediately neutralized by adding ice-cold neutralizing agent, defined in Table 2, to stop the virucidal reactions. In certain cases, as indicated in Table 2, the neutralized samples were passed through a Sephadex LH-20 gel filtration column to reduce cytotoxicity to the detector cells used in assessing any residual infectious virus. Neutralized test solutions were serially ten-fold diluted in a dilution medium (culture medium; defined in Table 1) and inoculated onto host cells to assay for infectious virus titer using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay.Table 2 Virucidal efficacy of laundry sanitizers tested per EN 14,476:2013 + A2:2019 on SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV 229E in suspension studies in the presence of an organic load.Full size tableStandardized hard surface efficacy testing methodologyVirucidal efficacy evaluations of laundry sanitizers against viruses experimentally deposited on a prototypic non-porous surface (glass) were conducted per ASTM E1053-2013. The microbicidal active ingredient concentrations, contact times, exposure temperatures, and the organic loads evaluated are indicated in Table 3. A brief description of the methodology follows: An aliquot of 0.4 mL of virus plus soil load was added onto a pre-sterilized 10-cm2 glass Petri dish and spread over the surface of the carrier. The virus was allowed to dry at ambient temperature. The laundry sanitizer under evaluation (2.0 mL) was added onto the dried viral film to completely cover the virus film. The carriers were then held for the indicated contact times at 20 ± 1 °C. Neutralizing agent (2.0 mL) was then added, and the viral inoculum/sanitizereutralizer mixture was scraped off the dish using a cell scraper. The neutralized test solutions were passed through a gel filtration column to reduce cytotoxicity to the host cells. The neutralized samples were serially ten-fold diluted in a dilution medium defined in Table 3 and inoculated onto detector cells to assay for infectious virus using the TCID50 assay.Table 3 Virucidal efficacy of a laundry sanitizer tested per ASTM E1053-20 against coronaviruses and influenza viruses dried on a glass surface in the presence of a 5% fetal bovine serum organic load.Full size tableCalculation of log10 reduction in titer, survival half-lives, and time required to reach fabric virus burdens below the estimated human infectious dose50 (ID50)Virucidal efficacy data obtained from suspension inactivation and non-porous surface (glass) inactivation studies have been presented in terms of log10 reduction in titer of the virus, with titers being calculated using a 96-well plate cell infectivity assay. Scoring for viral titer was based on viral cytopathic effect (CPE) in the host cell monolayers. The results have been expressed in units of log10 tissue culture infectious dose50 per mL (TCID50/mL), calculated per Reed and Meunch14. Log10 reduction in titer values have been obtained by subtracting the post-treatment titers from the corresponding positive control titers. Limits of detection for the detection assays applied in some cases, due to residual cytotoxic effects of the formulated microbicidal active-containing laundry sanitizers following neutralization. Such limits of detection have been accounted for in determination of log10 reduction values.Survival half-life (t½) values of viruses on experimentally contaminated fabric articles were reported or have been calculated from the reported data for SARS-CoV-26,15,16,17,18,19 or influenza virus H1N120,21. Biphasic linear regression plots (log10 titer vs. time) of the survival data were used to calculate the terminal survival half-lives (t½), as t½ = 0.301/-m, where m = the slope of the terminal phase of the plots. The times required to reduce virus burden to levels below an estimated human infectious dose50 (ID50, that is, the dose causing infections in 50% of those exposed) were calculated, assuming an initial viral burden of 1 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU). The times required to reduce the initial viral loads in the fabric by 1 log10 (D) were calculated by multiplying the terminal t½ values × 3.33 (one t½ = 0.301 log10 reduction in titer). The use of terminal half-life in such calculations in acknowledged to overestimate, to some extent, the times required for decay of the virus to levels lower than the ID50. These calculations, therefore, represent a more conservative approach than, for instance, calculations based on use of the initial t½ value or a calculated monophasic t½ value.A human dose–response curve for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been empirically determined, so an exact value for the human ID50 has not been reported. An ID50 of ~ 250 PFU was estimated, on the basis of mouse infectious dose50 values obtained for the betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-1)22 and SARS-CoV23. The time required to bring the fabric virus burden to 100 PFU (i.e., below the estimated ID50) was calculated as 4 log10 reduction × the time (D) required to achieve 1 log10 reduction in titer. This calculation was performed, as an illustrative example, to put the survival t½ data into perspective. It is acknowledged that the assumptions made were not based on empirical data in humans.The human ID50 for influenza virus has been estimated, based on human volunteer studies, to be in the range of 0.6 to 3.0 TCID50, when administered in aerosols, and orders of magnitude higher when applied to the nasal mucosa24.ResultsSuspension virucidal efficacy testingThe results of testing of the virucidal efficacy of laundry sanitizers for viruses in suspension per EN 14476:2013 + A2:201912 are displayed in Table 2. After a contact time of 15 min at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C, the p-chloro-m-xylenol (PCMX)-based laundry sanitizer, at a final active concentration of 0.033% in hard water, resulted in > 5 log10 inactivation of both HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV-2. Under the same conditions, two quaternary ammonium compound (QAC)-based laundry sanitizers, tested at a final concentration of ~ 0.06% in hard water, resulted in ≥ 5 and > 4 log10 inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.Hard surface virucidal efficacy testingThe results of testing, per ASTM E1053-2013, of the virucidal efficacy of a QAC-based laundry sanitizer for coronaviruses and influenza viruses experimentally dried on a glass surface in the presence of a 5% fetal bovine sera (FBS) organic load are shown in Table 3. The results indicate complete inactivation (i.e., to the limit of detection of the assay) of each coronavirus and influenza virus following a 5-min contact time at 20 ± 1 °C. No lot-to-lot variability in virucidal efficacy was noted in these studies, which evaluated 2 to 3 independent product lots side-by-side under the same experimental conditions.Literature data on survival (persistence) of viruses on fabricsSeveral studies of the survival (persistence of infectivity) of SARS-CoV-2 experimentally dried onto fabrics have been reported in the recent literature6,15,16,17,18,19,25. The data sets have been generated by determining infectious SARS-CoV-2 extracted from the fabric after various time periods following experimental contamination. The survival t½ values (times required to reduce the virus titer by one-half) were reported in the cited literature or were, in some cases16,17,19 calculated from reported raw data to reflect biphasic or monophasic decay values, as appropriate to the reported data sets. In some cases (e.g., the data of Virtanen et al.25), survival t½ values were not reported or able to be calculated from the reported data. Studies of the survival (persistence of infectivity) of influenza virus experimentally dried onto fabrics also have been reported20,21.The viral persistence data are displayed in Table 4. We attempted to put the survival data into perspective by estimating the duration of time needed for the infectivity of the viruses to decay to levels lower than an estimated human ID50. Once fabrics are contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses, these data suggest infectious virus may persist on the fabrics for minutes to days. While not displayed in Table 4, data on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1 on non-porous or porous surfaces have been reviewed recently26,27.Table 4 Literature values for terminal survival half-life (t½) of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus H1N1 on clothing/fabrics.Full size tableDiscussionThe virucidal action of the clothes laundering process including drying in the electric dryer involves a combination of mechanical removal, microbicidal inactivation (detergent), and possible thermal inactivation. These occur even in the absence of added laundry-sanitizing agents. We are not suggesting or recommending, in the present article, that laundry sanitizers are required for sanitization of clothing contaminated by an enveloped virus. Laundry sanitizers may, however, be used during the pre-soak cycle to sanitize both the clothing articles being laundered, as well as the clothing-contact surfaces of the washing machine using targeted surface/hand hygiene agents (Fig. 1). There are other high-touch environmental surfaces (HITES) in the clothes-laundering area that are vulnerable to viral cross-contamination via the intermediacy of the launderer’s hands. These include appliance-operating knobs, clothes-folding surfaces, and even the operating controls and surfaces of drying appliances. The potential of virus dissemination to these primary and secondary surfaces (Fig. 1) may be mitigated, to some extent, by use of a laundry sanitizer capable of inactivating virus in wash solutions and dried on clothing-contact surfaces of the washing machine. However, a more holistic approach10,11 to interruption of viral dissemination during clothes laundering takes into account additional targeted interventions, such as surface and hand hygiene agents. Laundry sanitizers in combination with higher temperature may also be useful for enhancing the efficacy of the laundry process for inactivating non-enveloped viruses10,11, although that possibility has not been addressed in the current studies.In the studies described here, we have employed both suspension and hard surface inactivation methodologies. The suspension method (BS EN 14476)12 was used to model the inactivation of virus in the wash and rinse solutions generated during clothes washing. Organic loads were employed in the testing to challenge the viral inactivation, although, in practice, any organic load associated with the virus would be expected to be greatly removed or diluted during the soaking, washing, and rinsing process. The hard surface method (ASTM 1053-20)13 involved drying of virus onto glass carriers to model inactivation of viruses dried on a hard, non-porous, surface, such as the metal tumbler of a washing machine, and transferred to and dried upon appliance door handles and operating knobs (Fig. 1). An organic load (5% FBS) was used to simulate the challenge associated with inactivating a virus dried in a soil matrix.The standardized method ASTM E2274-1628, though appropriate for evaluating the efficacy of a laundry sanitizer, necessitates the use of a laundry tumbler. Such equipment is not normally available within a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory such as that needed for working with highly pathogenic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.The question of survival of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on fabric has been evaluated previously. The results, to date, are shown in Table 4, and have been put into perspective by relating the survival t½ data to possible initial viral burden and an estimated human ID50. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected on fabric articles (pillow covers, duvet covers, sheets, and towels) taken from the quarantine hotel rooms of two patients three h after being tested positive for the virus30. Note that expected clothing/fabric SARS-CoV-2 burdens recoverable from naturally contaminated laundry items, in terms of infectious units, have yet to be empirically determined31, and this remains a knowledge gap. Similarly, the actual value of the ID50 for SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined32. Having said this, the data in Table 4 suggest that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on clothing may remain infectious for hours, and in the presence of a soil matrix, may remain infectious for days. Data for influenza viruses suggest that these also may remain infectious for hours on contaminated clothing.Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory evidence is accumulating33 that suggests that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive patients shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 which can contaminate patient clothing, potentially cross-contaminating clothing of patient contacts and environmental HITES. Depending on the duration of time between contamination of a clothing article and laundering of the contaminated article, further contamination of the laundry appliance and the wash solutions with infectious virus is therefore possible. Manual (as opposed to machine) clothes washing, which still occurs to some extent even in developed countries, presents additional opportunities for contamination of secondary surfaces with infectious virus34. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 dried upon a hard surface (such as steel laundry tumbler) may remain infectious for days, based on a review of the survival data from the literature26. Similarly, data for survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin15,35 indicate that the virus may remain infectious on contaminated skin for hours. The half-life of SARS-CoV-2 at 25 °C on human skin was found to be 3.5–4.2 h, while a half-life of 0.8 h was determined for influenza virus A35. Harbourt et al.15 reported that the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 on swine skin was 3.5 h at 22 °C. These survival data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious on hard surfaces and human skin for hours to days, while influenza virus remains infectious for minutes to hours. This informs the need for hand and appliance hygiene practices to limit potential spread of virus (Fig. 1).A recent study has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can survive in wastewater, with a decay half-life of 0.49 d at ambient temperature36. These results are in agreement with empirical data indicating the persistence in wastewater of infectious mouse hepatitis virus-1 (a betacoronavirus), SARS-CoV (a betacoronavirus), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (an alphacoronavirus)37,38, and for the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E39. There is a possibility, therefore, of cross-contamination of otherwise virus-free clothing when washed together with a SARS-CoV-2-contaminated clothing article. Such possibilities could be mitigated through the use of an appropriately formulated laundry sanitizer with demonstrated efficacy for inactivating coronaviruses.To suggest utility under field-use conditions, the concentrations of a formulated microbicidal active-containing laundry sanitizer tested in laboratory virucidal efficacy studies should be relevant to those obtained during clothes-washing when the laundry sanitizer is used as instructed. The QAC-containing products evaluated in Table 2 (suspension inactivation studies) are intended to be used in a pre-wash soak cycle (using a 1:42 dilution) for viral inactivation, relative to the concentration in the products themselves. The PCMX-containing product is intended to be used either in the wash cycle or in the pre-soak cycle. In either case, the product is recommended to be used a 1:50 dilution for 15 min contact time. The use concentrations and times have therefore been modeled appropriately in the suspension tests in Table 2. Under these conditions, inactivation of HCoV 229E or SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of soil load was complete, to the limit of detection of the assay used to determine titer. In all cases, > 4 log10 inactivation was observed. The products examined in hard surface inactivation studies (Table 3) were also very effective, causing ≥ 3 to ≥ 5.0 log10 inactivation of influenza viruses and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 in 5 min contact time.ConclusionsThe risk of continued infectivity of virus on clothing/fabrics, once contaminated, is informed by survival data for those viruses on clothing, which suggest that virus may remain infectious for hours to days. There are multiple opportunities for dissemination of virus during the laundering process, and not all of these are addressed by the actual efficacy for removal and inactivation of the detergent and water-based washing and rinsing process. Other risks (Fig. 1) may best be mitigated through use of additional targeted hygiene agents, including possibly laundry sanitizers, surface hygiene agents, and hand hygiene agents.Laundry sanitizers are used to enhance the efficacy of pathogen inactivation that may potentially occur during the manual or machine clothes washing and rinsing processes. A laundry sanitizer, added either during the pre-soak or wash stages of the washing process, may afford inactivation of viruses over that expected of the laundry detergent or hot water rinse alone, especially for non-enveloped viruses not expected to be inactivated by detergent11. In the case of the formulated microbicidal active-containing laundry sanitizing products evaluated in this study, the additional efficacy for inactivation afforded against the enveloped viruses SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus amounted to ≥ 3 to ≥ 5 log10. These data suggest that use of a laundry sanitizer may afford additional mitigation of the risk of cross-contamination of the washing appliance (be it machine or basin), adjacent surfaces, the wastewater stream, and the hands of individuals engaging in washing of clothes contaminated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, or other emerging enveloped viruses.

We demonstrate that genetic alteration of the glycan heparan sulfate (HS) in CD11c + cells via Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutation, which inhibits HS sulfation in a major antigen presenting cell population, reduces lung inflammation by A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) influenza in mice. Mutation was also characterized by a reduction in lung infiltration by CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the late infection/effector phase, 9 days post inoculation (p.i.), without significant differences in lung CD8 + T cells, or Treg cells at an earlier point (day 5) following infection. Induction of under-sulfated HS via Ndst1 silencing in a model dendritic cell line (DC2.4) resulted in up-regulated basal expression of the antiviral cytokine interferon β (IFN-β) relative to control. Stimulating cells with the TLR9 ligand CpG resulted in greater nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) phosphorylation in Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells. While stimulating cells with CpG also modestly increased IFN-β expression, this did not lead to significant increases in IFN-β protein production. In further IFN-β protein response studies using primary bone marrow DCs from Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant and Cre− control mice, while trace IFN-β protein was detected in response to CpG, stimulation with the TLR7 ligand R848 resulted in robust IFN-β production, with significantly higher levels associated with DC Ndst1 mutation. In vivo, improved pathogen clearance in Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice was suggested by reduced IAV AA5H nucleoprotein in lung examined in the late/effector phase. Earlier in the course of infection (day 5 p.i.), mean viral load, as measured by viral RNA, was not significantly different among genotypes. These findings point to novel regulatory roles for DC HS in innate and adaptive immunity during viral infection. This may have therapeutic potential and guide DC targeted HS engineering platforms in the setting of IAV or other respiratory viruses.

The dominant types causing seasonal epidemics of disease are influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV)1. In IAV, nuclear export protein and a segmented RNA genome coated with nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are enclosed within the matrix protein layer. The envelope anchored hemagglutinins, neuraminidases, and matrix ion channels facilitate host cell entry2. During an IAV infection, airway macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines in a manner that may eliminate IAV and its components. If unregulated, intense inflammatory cytokine release may contribute to poor clinical outcomes by inducing airway congestion, impaired gas exchange, secondary bacterial pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome with its complications3. On the other hand, a balance of cellular influx and effector mechanisms are important for viral clearance and acquired immunity.Pathogen clearance and immunomodulation can be harmonized by antigen presenting cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) that orchestrate both innate and adaptive immunity. Following exposure to IAV components or phagocytosis of IAV-infected cells, myeloid DCs may recognize components of the IAV genome and other pathogen and damage associated motifs through endosomal toll like receptor (TLR) pathways4. Sensing of viral infection additionally occurs through TLR3, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and TLR7 (recognizing IAV ssRNA), among others; and this results in activation of both downstream pro-inflammatory signaling events along with expression of type-I interferons4,5,6. Even exogenous stimulation of other TLR pathways (e.g., TLR9 via exogenous CpG) have been shown to facilitate DC activation and anti-IAV responses7, although lung DCs may theoretically be less responsive than myeloid DCs (based on TLR9 expression) to such exogenous stimulation8. Signaling by several TLRs includes downstream activation of NF-κB, which in turn upregulates antiviral cytokine, type 1 interferon (IFN-I) (α/β) expression9. IFN-β induces the signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, which upregulates IFN stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication within infected cells10. Additionally, IFN-β recruits natural killer (NK) cells to eliminate IAV infected cells at the site of infection11. Cross-talk between NK cells and DCs also promotes lymphoid-directed DC migration and initiation of IAV-specific T cell immunity by IAV antigen presenting DCs12.The functions of DCs may be tuned by the structure of cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are linear polysaccharides that are generally sulfated and linked to proteoglycan (PG) core proteins; and are involved in various biological processes including cell adhesion, signaling transduction, and pathogen recognition13,14,15. In recent work, we showed that a DC-directed genetic alteration of heparan sulfate (HS) GAG enhances antigen/MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex) presentation and cytotoxic T cell responses in tumor bearing Ndst1f/f CD11cCre+ mutant mice compared to wildtype (Ndst1f/f CD11cCre−) control mice16. N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (Ndst1) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes N-deacetylation and the N-sulfation of glucosamine during modification steps involved in the biosynthesis of nascent HS glycan chains in the Golgi complex13. Utilization of the CD11c Cre promoter results in efficient deletion in conventional DCs, and also some monocyte/macrophages and NK cell populations in mice17, which could result in altered HS in both DCs as well as alveolar macrophages in the lung. Deletion of Ndst1 in macrophages (which has been demonstrated in Ndst1f/f LysMCre + mutants)18 interestingly leads to upregulation of IFN-β expression. Moreover, deficiency in syndecan-4, a major DC-surface HSPG, results in a more enriched NK cell population in tumors19.In addition to a possible mechanism involving “boosting” of IAV specific antigen presentation to responsive T cells in the setting of under-sulfated HS on DCs, these findings prompted us to query whether targeting the fine structure of DC HS might also regulate IFN-β, and augment IAV-clearance while modulating the level of inflammation during IAV infection. In the current study, we phenotypically examined the degree of inflammation along with unique tissue T-cell responses, while functionally characterizing IAV-nucleoprotein levels in the lungs of IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant and Cre− wildtype control mice examined in the early and late IAV infection phases. Using Ndst1 knock-down in a model DC line DC2.4, we investigated mechanistic details including NF-κB p65 subunit phosphorylation and IFN-β expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in response to a model TLR9 ligand, CpG. We extended studies to primary marrow-derived DCs, wherein we assessed IFN-β protein responses to CpG and to an IAV relevant TLR7 ligand. Lastly, CD4+/FOXP3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) and CD8+ T cell phenotypes were examined in lungs of IAV-infected wildtype and mutant mice.ResultsA CD11c + cell directed Ndst1 mutation reduces IAV-associated lung inflammation in mice in the effector phaseWhile inflammation is a necessary part of the innate immune response upon IAV infection, it can result in morbidity and mortality through airway congestion, impaired gas exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and as a substrate for secondary bacterial pneumonia if unchecked3. To determine the level of inflammation in the lungs of IAV-infected wildtype Ndst1f/f CD11cCre − and mutant Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mice, histopathology specimens were reviewed by a trained pathologist blinded to genotype. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from the lungs of mice 5- and 9-days post-inoculation (p.i.) with IAV, examining the early-infection and late/effector phases, respectively20. Indices of inflammatory intensity, determined from the most inflamed zone of each lung section, as well as spatial inflammation (as a percentage of total lung area on whole-lung histologic sections) were then determined. H&E-stained lung sections harvested on day 9 p.i. demonstrated less infiltration of inflammatory cells into a predominantly airway-centered distribution of inflammation in the mutant mice compared to that of wildtype mice (Fig. 1A,B). We noted approximately 50% and 70% reductions in inflammation intensity and spatial inflammation, respectively, in the lungs of mutant mice compared to those of wildtype mice (from n = 5 mutant and n = 6 wildtype mice; P < 0.05 for differences) (Fig. 1C). In mice for which lung sections were harvested at 5 days p.i. there were no significant differences in inflammatory intensity and spatial inflammation between wildtype and mutant mice (from n = 3/genotype; Supplemental Fig.S1). A summary of histologic inflammation scoring, including mean values +/− SD, that tabulates data from Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig.S1 (for studies at day 9 and day 5 p.i.) is presented in Supplemental Table 1. Weights of wildtype and mutant mice were tracked throughout the course post-inoculation, and plotted in Supplemental Fig.S2. Interestingly, while there were no significant differences in mouse weight trends through the early course post-inoculation, final weight analyses at day 9 p.i. showed that among two experiments (n = 10 mice/genotype), 7/10 wildtype mice demonstrated > 10% weight reduction relative to baseline, while only 3/10 mutants showed such a reduction (P = 0.07 for difference by Chi-square statistic). Moreover, the mean % weight reduction beyond 10% was significantly greater in wildtype mice compared to that in mutants (5.6% versus 2.9%; P < 0.001 for difference).Figure 1The magnitude of IAV lung inflammation is reduced in Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice, with inhibition in inflammation compared to that in Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− wildtype controls at day 9 post-inoculation. Mutant and wildtype mice were inoculated with an intranasal dose of 20 PFU of PR8 IAV (n = 5 mutant and n = 6 wildtype). At day 9 post-inoculation (p.i.) lungs were harvested, inflated, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. (A) Representative images of H&E-stained lung sections from IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− wildtype mice are shown, with representative 400X photomicrographs from inflammatory zones shown below each section (scale bar = 1 mm for low-power whole-lung images; bar = 50 μm for 400X photomicrographs). (B) Images of H&E-stained lung sections and representative photomicrographs from IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice. (C) Histopathology from lung sections was analyzed by a trained pathologist blinded to genotype; and mean inflammatory index for each lung (estimated on a 0–3 scale of severity by the pathologist) was normalized from inflammatory scores of inflamed areas on lung sections. Inflammatory indices were assessed through analyses of both pathologic intensity of inflammation (left) as well as the mean spatial inflammatory involvement of lung sections (right). Spatial inflammatory involvement for any given lung section (percentage of section with any inflammation) was also initially determined through quantification by counting blinded to genotype. Mean +/− SD for the measures normalized to wildtype is shown on the graph (*P = 0.03 and *P = 0.02 for differences in means for intensity and spatial measures, respectively).Full size imageNdst1 silencing enhances CpG-dependent NF-κB phosphorylation in DC2.4 cellsDCs may sense the CpG dinucleotide motif as a model TLR9 ligand that leads to classical downstream TLR signaling events including phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK complex, translocation of liberated NFκB into the nucleus, and initiation of IFN-β transcription4,7. Phophorylation of NFκB impacts transcriptional activity of NFκB through modulating transcription of target genes and other transcriptional factors21. Phosphorylation of NFκB p65 subunit in particular leads to these functional changes by induction of a conformational change, p65 ubiquitination and stability, and interactions with other factors21. We determined the levels of phosphorylated p65 (phosphorylation at S536) and total p65 protein in control and Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells treated with and without CpG by western blotting. Control and Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells were serum starved for one hour prior to CpG stimulation to mimic the nutrient deprived condition during viral replication. We demonstrated that Ndst1 inhibition in DC2.4 cells significantly augments CpG-dependent NFκB phosphorylation (approximately 1.7 -fold) compared to that of control DC2.4 cells (P < 0.01 for difference; Fig. 2A,B). Similar patterns were shown in non-starved cells (not shown), although the relative degree of augmentation in CpG responses by mutant cells was greater under serum-starved conditions.Figure 2Ndst1 silencing results in increased NFκB activation in response to CpG and interferon-β expression in DC2.4 cells as well as augmented interferon-β protein production in primary Ndst1 mutant DCs stimulated by the TLR7 ligand R848. (A) CpG-dependent NFκB activation is significantly augmented by Ndst1 silencing of DC2.4 cells, designated si(Ndst1), compared to that of si(Control) DC2.4 cells (i.e., scrambled RNA treated controls). Specifically, the level of phosphorylated NFκB subunit p65, as measured by western blotting, was indexed to the corresponding total p65 value; and the graphed values for each condition (at baseline and at 1 h post stimulation) are shown normalized to that of un-stimulated si(Control) cells in the graph (mean of n = 3 experiments, *P = 0.03 and **P < 0.01 for indicated differences in means; paired T-test). (B) A representative Western blot from one NF-κB activation experiment is shown to the right of the graph in (A), illustrating bands for phospho-p65 and total p65 collected from DC2.4 cells stimulated with 1 μM CpG for 15 min and 1 h (with data for baseline and 1 h stimulation plotted in the graph); and stimulation in the absence or presence of Ndst1 silencing denoted by “–” or “ + ” above each lane (full length blot shown in Supplemental Fig. S8). (C) Interferon-β quantitative PCR results for basal/unstimulated DC2.4 cells as well as cells stimulated with CpG. Among unstimulated cells: Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells demonstrate a significant increase in interferon-β expression (IFN-β) relative to that of control cells. Percent IFN-β expression was normalized to GAPDH expression in the respective cells, and responses for each condition are normalized to the response by resting si(Control) DC2.4 cells. Graph shows mean +/− SD from triplicate runs; **P < 0.01 for difference in means for si(Control) versus si(Ndst1) cells. Stimulation with CpG showed increased IFN-β expression responses by both control and Ndst1-silenced cells (to 1 μM CpG). While expression responses to 18 h CpG exposure were significant compared to baseline for both si(Control) and si(Ndst1) cells (***P < 0.001 or **P < 0.01 for respective differences in means relative to baseline), they reached essentially equivalent expression levels by the 18 h exposure time point (right bars on Fig. 2C graph). (D) IFN-β protein production into the culture medium was examined by ELISA assay in primary Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant or Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− control bone marrow DCs in response to either (i) presence versus absence of 1 μM CpG stimulation overnight (high dose/ maximum stimulation from prior studies); or (ii) presence (up to 10 μg/ml) versus absence of overnight stimulation with the TLR7 agonist R848. While we were able to measure only minimal IFN-β protein responses upon CpG stimulation, with no significant differences compared to basalesting cells (graph portion at left), primary DCs responded with significant IFN-β production in response to R848 at the 1.0 or 10 μg/ml range, with markedly greater responses associated with DC Ndst1 mutation (right portion of graph; ***P < 0.001 and **P < 0.01 for differences in indicated mean values).Full size imageNdst1 silencing results in increased basal interferon-β expression in DC2.4 cellsIFN-β is an antiviral cytokine that inhibits viral replication within an infected cell and recruits NK cells to the infection site to eliminate IAV-infected cells10,11. We transfected DC2.4 cells with vehicle (scrambled siRNA) control, “si(Control)” and Ndst1 siRNA, “si(Ndst1),” and we examined basal levels of IFN-β expression by qPCR. DC2.4 cells are immortalized DCs generated by transducing bone marrow isolates of C57BL/6 mice with retrovirus vectors expressing murine granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and the myc and raf oncogenes22. IFN-β copy number normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) demonstrated about four-fold increase in IFN-β expression in Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells in comparison with that of control cells (Fig. 2C, left bars corresponding to basal un-stimulated cells; P < 0.01 for difference in means). Ndst1 deletion efficiency in the cell line is shown in Supplemental Fig.S3. In a separate assay, DC2.4 cells were stimulated in culture using CpG, and while expression of IFN-β was significantly increased by CpG stimulation in both Ndst1 silenced DC2.4 cells and control cells by qPCR (P < 0.01 for mean expression responses relative to control; Fig. 2C), we could not reproducibly detect increases in IFN-β protein in cell lysates by western, although low levels without significant differences were detected by ELISA assay in the culture cell medium (Fig. 2D, left side of graph).Interferon-β protein response to TLR7 stimulation is augmented in Ndst1 deficient primary bone marrow DCsWe next examined IFN-β protein production by primary bone marrow DCs (BMDCs) purified from Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant and Cre− wildtype mice. While we were unable to detect significant increases in IFN-β protein in either cell lysates or culture supernatant (by Western or ELISA methods) to the TLR9 ligand CpG upon overnight exposure, primary DC responses to the TLR7 ligand resiquimod (R848) resulted in IFN-β production, with significantly greater levels associated with DC Ndst1 mutation (Fig. 2D). In particular, Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant DCs exposed to 24 h stimulation with 1 or 10 μg/ml of R848 generated a marked increase in IFN-β production into the culture medium relative to that of Cre− wildtype control cells (P < 0.01 for difference using either 1 or 10 μg/ml R848 concentration). The maximum response by either mutant or wildtype DCs under the culture conditions used appeared to take place at 1 μg/ml R848, with > threefold response by mutant over that of control cells at that concentration (Fig. 2D, right). We assayed whether for R848 stimulation there might be differences in NFkB responsiveness by mutant and wiltype DCs, and did not note a significant difference in p65 subunit phosphorylation in short-term stimulation assays at 15 min and 1 h post-stimulation (Supplemental Fig.S4).CD11c + cell directed Ndst1 mutation is associated with increased pathogen clearance in lungs of IAV-infected mutant mice in the effector phaseWhile augmented T-cell mediated immunity induced by DCs may promote effector responses to facilitate viral clearance in the late/effector phase of infection by IAV, one of the consequences of upregulated IFN-β responses by Ndst1 mutant DCs may also be inhibition of viral replication. To initially estimate the effect of Ndst1 mutation on viral presence and pathogen clearance, we quantified the amount of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) present in the lungs of IAV-infected wildtype and mutant mice harvested on day 5 and day 9 p.i. by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC). The IAV NP is a structural protein that encapsulates the viral RNA within the matrix protein layer2, and can be used to assess viral presence in tissue. While there was no significant difference between wildtype and mutant in the levels of AA5H IAV NP on day 5 p.i (Fig. 3A, left) (also carried out separately by flow cytometry in Supplemental Fig. S8), we observed almost 40% reduction in the AA5H IAV nucleoprotein in the lungs of IAV-infected mutant mice in comparison with that of wildtype mice at day 9d p.i. (P < 0.05 for the difference in means; Fig. 3A, right). Representative images of IHC-stained lung sections of IAV-infected wildtype and mutant mice at day 9 p.i. are provided in Supplemental Fig.S5. Since IHC studies of viral NP may have limitations in terms of the ability to accurately reflect levels of prior replicating virus in the lung tissue, we probed for the potential to detect replicative virus in lung harvested from mice at the earlier (day 5 p.i.) time point. While virus was not detectable in the tissue by plaque assay, we were able to detect viral RNA by qPCR using primers for the IAV M1/M2 protein23, and additionally upon using primers for PR8 NP24 in separate measurements. Both detection methods yielded similar mean levels of viral RNA from lungs of mutant versus wildtype mice at day 5 post-inoculation (i.e., 5 +/− 6 × 106 versus 4 +/− 6 × 106 PFU per μg lung cDNA for viral RNA purified from whole mutant (n = 6) versus wildtype (n = 4) lungs; and with the PFU equivalent values referenced from a standard curve generated from qPCR cycle-thresholds corresponding to known dilutions of RNA from pure PR8 IAV at a known starting viral titer). It is noteworthy, however, that lungs from 3 of the n = 6 Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice had no detectable viral RNA by qPCR at the day-5 timepoint (albeit with widely variable levels in the other 3 mutants), while lungs from all n = 4 Cre− wildtype mice harbored some level of detectable virus. We thus cannot be certain if this reflects earlier viral clearance in those mutant mice, but this additional observation raises a possibility. We present qPCR data showing cycle thresholds corresponding to expression of IAV M1/M2 protein in lung tissue for each mouse and the referenced standard curve data (showing qPCR cycle thresholds corresponding to known dilutions of RNA from a pure PR8 IAV stock at a known starting viral titer) in Supplemental Table 2 for reference.Figure 3Reduced IAV AA5H nucleoprotein and a lower density of regulatory T cells is found in lung tissue of IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice at day 9 post IAV-inoculation. Lungs from mutant and wildtype animals were harvested, inflated, paraffin embedded, and sectioned, with IHC performed using antibodies specific for IAV AA5H nucleoprotein (NP), with assessments for lung CD8 + T cells, and FOXP3 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) as illustrated. Measurements of AA5H NP density in tissue by IHC as well as T cell densities were carried out blinded to genotype. (A) To assess trends reflecting the early course of infection, analysis of lung sections from Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant versus Cre− wildtype mice was carried out at day 5 p.i. (n = 3 mice per genotype): Mean AA5H viral NP deposits per high power field (HPF) in lung IHC sections +/− SD are plotted in graph at left. No significant difference was found between mean values for groups at day 5 p.i. On the other hand, Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mouse lungs at day 9 p.i. exhibited reduced pathogen presence, as reflected by reduced mean AA5H viral NP deposits per HPF (right graph; with data from n = 10 mice/genotype; *P < 0.05 for difference in means). (B) T cell flow cytometry was carried out to assess the density of CD8 + T cells (% gated from total lung-cell digest) and FOXP3 + Treg cells (as % total lung cells) in whole-lung digests from mutant and wildtype mice at either day 5 p.i. (left graphs) or day 9 p.i. (right graphs) in separate experiments. At day 5 p.i., there were no significant differences between genotypes for either the lung CD8 + T cell density (from studies involving a total of n = 7 wildtype and n = 8 mutant mice) or lung Treg cells (n = 4 wildtype and n = 5 mutant mice); although P = 0.07 was noted for difference in Treg mean values (greater mean Treg density noted in mutant lungs) at that timepoint. At day 9 p.i., while there were no significant differences in mean CD8 + lung T cells, there was a significant reduction in FOXP3 + Treg cells in lungs from mutant mice (n = 5 wildtype and n = 3 mutant mice; ***P < 0.001 for difference in means). (C) In IHC analyses of T cells in lung tissue at day 5 p.i., the mean density of CD8 + T cells per HPF (left graph) as well as that of FOXP3 + Treg cells (right) showed no significant differences in mean values for each genotype (n = 3 mice per genotype). (D) In IHC analyses of lung T cells at day 9 p.i., the mean density of CD8 + T cells was not significantly different among genotypes; however, the density of FOXP3 + Treg cells in the lungs of Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice at day 9 p.i. was significantly reduced compared to that of Cre− control lung tissue sections (right graph; *P = 0.02 for difference in means; n = 3 mice per genotype).Full size imageLung T cell responses during IAV infection demonstrate a late/effector phase Treg cell phenotype in the setting of Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutationWhile a CD4 + subset of Treg cells may induce immune-suppressive functions in the setting of tumor or pathogen responses, Treg cells may also provide a protective role in the setting of pulmonary damage during viral infection25. Along the lines of the latter observation, Treg cells have been implicated in recovery from IAV induced inflammation (including enhancement of germinal center responses)26,27. In excess, however, Treg cells can suppress cytotoxic functions of effector CD8+ T cells that eliminate IAV-infected cells28. In early immunophenotyping, we ran flow cytometry to quantify CD8 + T cells and FOXP3 + Treg subsets on whole-lung digests from mice at day 5 p.i. Quantification of CD8 + T cells in the lungs was comparable among genotypes at this time point (Fig. 3B, left CD8 + T cell graph); and the mean densities of Treg cells in the lung at this time point (Fig. 3B, left FOXP3 + Tregs graph) also did not show statistically significant difference in means between genotypes (although for Treg cells, P = 0.07 for the difference, with a greater mean value found in Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutants relative to that of Cre− controls). There were also no significant differences in total CD4 + T cells from mutant versus wildtype lungs (Supplemental Fig.S6). On the other hand at day 9 p.i., while there were no significant differences in mean CD8 + lung T cells among genotypes, there was a significant reduction in FOXP3 + Treg cells in lungs from mutant mice (P < 0.001 for difference in means). Through IHC T-cell analyses on paraffin-embedded lung sections of IAV-infected wildtype and mutant mice harvested on days 5 and 9 p.i., we characterized and quantified CD8 + T cells and CD4+/FOXP3+ Treg cells in lung tissue, in situ. While no significant difference in Treg cell density was noted at day 5 p.i. (noting a repeated trend toward greater Tregs in mutant lungs at that time point; Fig. 3C, right graph), lungs examined in a separate study carried out to day 9 p.i. were characterized by a density of lung tissue Treg cells that was significantly lower in mutant mice at this late/effector phase time point (P < 0.05 for difference in means; Fig. 3D, right), reflecting findings by flow cytometry at this time point (Fig. 3B, right). In tissue CD8 + T cell analyses, mutation was not associated with significant differences in CD8 + T cells at day 5 or day 9 p.i. (Fig. 3C, left and Fig. 3D, left).DiscussionBalance between pathogen elimination and immunomodulation is critical for survival outcomes during IAV infection3. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that a DC-directed Ndst1 mutation may boost pathogen clearance and favorably modulate inflammation in IAV-infected mice. In the current study, we demonstrate that IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice exhibit significantly reduced inflammation in the lungs compared to those of IAV-infected Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− wildtype mice in the effector phase (day 9 p.i.) while there was no significant difference between wildtype and mutant mice in the early infection phase (day 5 p.i.) (Fig. 1A–C; Supplemental Fig.S1). The reduced inflammatory phenotype found at day 9 p.i. may be partly due to a more rapid/efficient cycle of early effector activity and ultimate immunologic resolution (and possibly augmented DC-mediated antigen presentation) and downstream effector T cell responses in the setting of under-sulfated DC HS. This is reminiscent and consistent with antigen-mediated responses we have noted in the setting of the same mutation during anti-tumor responses in neoplasia models16. However, unique effects on TLR dependent DC signaling and associated anti-viral effector pathways must also be considered.Possibly, the reduced inflammatory phenotype may also be due to upregulated expression of the antiviral cytokine IFN-β, and may be further supported by enhanced TLR-dependent NF-kB activation, as demonstrated through CpG-dependent NF-κB p65 subunit phosphorylation in Ndst1 silenced DCs (Fig. 2A,B). Phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 subunit leads to a conformational change influencing p65 ubiquitination, stability, and interactions with its ligands21. IFN-β activates the STAT signaling pathway, leading to expression of IFN stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication within infected cells and other downstream signaling components including interleukin-10 (IL-10)10. While we measured a boost in IFN-β expression in vitro in resting Ndst1-silenced DC2.4 cells (Fig. 2C, compare expression in control-to that of Ndst1 silenced basal/un-stimulated cells), in vivo cell-specific measurements and tissue levels may be of interest because other myeloid cells, including macrophages, have demonstrated some degree of conditional allele deletion in CD11cCre targeted mice16,17. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, this may be carried out in future studies examining broader production of the type-I IFN family by glycan-targeted antigen presenting cells in-situ, possibly in advanced in-tissue studies. Another study reported elevated levels of IL-10 expression in bone marrow derived macrophages from Ndst1f/f LysMCre + mice compared to those from wildtype Cre− controls18, indicating that reduced inflammation may be at least partly achieved through inhibition in macrophage activation29, and possibly a protective effect against lung damage that may be induced by optimizing levels of type I IFN, while recognizing that excessive type I IFN expression in the lung may be detrimental30,31. If the mutation augments protective role(s) by macrophages, known to exist in the setting of IAV infection32, given additional possible effects on macrophages in the setting of CD11c driven Ndst1 mutation, this might also be considered a protective factor in this unique phenotype. In the prior study18, Ndst1 deficient macrophages appear to release IFN-β, which is typically regulated by binding to wildtype fully-sulfated HS (thus sequestered by the fully sulfated glycan). Mutation appears to release IFN-β for greater action/availability to activate downstream STAT1 signaling in the macrophage18. Possibly similar mechanisms may occur in parallel in both DCs and macrophages (including alveolar macrophages) in the setting of Ndst1 mutation. Indeed greater IFN-β productionelease into the medium may also be a consequence of inhibiting HS-dependent sequestration in the setting of HS mutation/under-sulfation when IFN-β production/stimulation takes place (e.g., with robust TLR7 dependent IFN-β stimulation in the setting of mutation; Fig. 2D). Finally, while preliminary studies of NK cell density in the lungs of Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice harvested on day 5 p.i. did not show a significant difference from that of wildtype mice (data not shown), it is of interest to further investigate the potential regulatory role of HS in DC-NK cell crosstalk in the priming of immune responses to IAV infection in future studies.Interestingly, we observed a reduction in IAV viral particles, as measured by AA5H NP in the lungs of mutant mice compared to those of wildtype mice at day 9 p.i., However no significant difference was shown on day 5 p.i. (Fig. 3A). In the latter studies, carried out to examine an earlier timepoint post-inoculation, we also quantified the AA5H viral NP in mutant and widtype tissues by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig.S7). From these findings, and from additional measurements of viral RNA by qPCR at day 5 p.i. in separate studies reported in the Results section, DC associated Ndst1 mutation does not appear to have a profound effect on inhibiting viral replication in the early infection phase, while the mutation may possibly augment IAV clearance in the late infection/effector phase. In terms of NP detection in IHC studies, we also recognize that while NP presence in IHC tissue is alone not sufficient to reflect viral replicative potential in tissue at a given time point, the NP IHC studies may reflect the prior presence of virus. It is thus possible that a low level of viral replication that persists in the wildtype in the day 5–6 dpi period and slightly beyond (which could leave a greater density of IHC positive NP “remnant” protein in the tissue by day 9) may result in comparatively lower NP positive material in the mutant due to increased viral clearance taking place over that same period of fading viral replication in the protocol IAV model.The mutant phenotype may be partly explained by upregulated IFN-β production and/or increased NF-κB activation, as shown in Ndst1 silenced DCs under distinct assays using TLR7 or TLR9 ligand stimuli (Fig. 2), and associated with an increased DC-maturation phenotype33,34. We have observed this phenotype in mutant DCs in prior work, where cultured Ndst1 deficient primary DCs more frequently showed greater expression of maturation markers CD86/MHC-II16. Type I IFN also modulates an ability of DCs to cross-present to CD8+ T cells35,36. This may also be mechanistically relevant to a recent finding that Ndst1 mutant DCs possess enhanced antigen presentation capability16. With this in mind, it should also be noted that IAV-infected DCs become less capable of presenting IAV-antigen, resulting in impaired CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses9,37,38. Possibly, the mutation may thus be important in limiting the effects of this vulnerability in the setting of IAV infection. Perhaps an increase in IFN-β expression may also facilitate pathogen clearance by cross-presentation mediated cytotoxic T cell immunity rather than limiting intracellular viral replication at the infection site in mutant mice.With specific regard to IFN-β, we could demonstrate low-level IFN-β expression by model DCs in culture that respond to CpG stimulation. While responses by mutant and wildtype DCs appear to be comparable, Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant DCs demonstrate augmented basalesting IFN-β expression by qPCR. For primary DCs isolated from mutant and wildtype mice (and for DC2.4 cells), this did not translate into robust protein responses in terms of IFN-β protein produced into the culture medium, as measured by a sensitive ELISA based method. However, upon testing primary DC responses to an IAV relevant TLR7 ligand (R848), Ndst1 mutation resulted in significant and robust increases in IFN-β protein into the medium (Fig. 2D). This is important since increased responses by mutant DCs to TLR7 stimulation, for which the natural ligand is IAV ssRNA6, would imply that IFN-β mediated anti-IAV responses may potentially play a relevant mechanistic role in facilitating IAV clearance during active infection in the mutant. This may also be important in facilitating inflammatory resolution. We should note that upon testing NF-κB responses to R848, measuring phospho-p65 responses to short-term (15 min and 1 h) R848 exposure in cultured primary DCs, there were no significant differences noted for mutant versus wildtype cells (Supplemental Fig. S4). It is difficult to know whether differential R848 responses by mutant versus wildtype cells in terms of overnight IFN-β production into the medium (markedly elevated in the mutant) versus short-term phospho-p65 signaling responses are due to different effects that glycan under-sulfation has on one downstream TLR7 intracellular signaling pathway (e.g., nuclear IFN-β expression via IRF7 activation) versus another (e.g., inflammatory/cytokine responses via TAK1-mediated NF-κB and MAPK pathways)39. Since the cultured primary cells are a predominant DC population, with some percentage of other non-cDC CD11c + subsets to a lesser extent (including up to 15–20% macrophages in our hands), it is possible that differential responses may reflect a dominant R848 effect of IFN-β production in one subset. Alternatively, among all Ndst1 deficient CD11c + cultured primary cells, one very intriguing possibility is that dominant IFN-β release into the medium by mutant cells may result following IFN-β production, where reduced HS-mediated sequestration by Ndst1 mutant cells may increase IFN-β release and availability, as referenced in prior studies on Ndst1 mutant macrophages18, above. It is beyond the scope of this work to fully decipher these differences herein, but nevertheless, the latter consideration leaves intriguing mechanistic possibilities for mutant DCs in vivo responding to ssRNA/TLR7-ligands in the microenvironment following IAV infection.Regulatory T cells (Tregs) expand upon IAV infection, and are believed to suppress antiviral immunity40,41, while an appropriate level may be necessary to prevent excessive pulmonary inflammation and damage25,42. A reduction in the FOXP3+ Treg population in the lungs of IAV infected mutant mice on day 9 p.i. (shown by flow cytometry in Fig. 3B, right and IHC in Fig. 3D, right) may potentially contribute to a boost in IAV clearance, also shown on day 9 p.i. (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, earlier in the course of infection (day 5 p.i.), there was no such reduction in lung Treg cells in the mutant; and if anything, there was a trend toward augmented Treg cells in mutants at this earlier phase (corresponding FOXP3 + T cell graphs in Fig. 3B, and Fig. 3C, right), which may also be important for anti-viral germinal center responses25,27. Strikingly, toward the resolution phase at day 9 p.i., the presence of lung Treg cells is significantly reduced in the setting of mutation (in both flow cytometry and IHC studies; Fig. 3B, far right as well as Fig. 3D, right). It is also important to consider how increased IFN-β production by mutant CD11c + cells in culture might relate to increased IAV clearance. While our measurements of increased IFN-β production by mutant DCs in culture is limited to cell-based assays, it is possible that in the lung during IAV infection, this effect by the CD11c + cells in the infected lung interstitial and/or lymphoid microenvironment of mutant mice may have contributed to ultimately driving more efficient viral clearance in the mutant by the late/effector stage. Although beyond the scope of this work, dedicated studies examining the effects of antigen-presenting cell glycan targeting on IFN-β production and cell-specific effects on Treg cells in the spatial inflammatory lung microenvironment of IAV infection in the effector phase would add additional insights.This data may reveal important antiviral phenotypes and signaling events under a DC-directed Ndst1 silencing platform that may contribute to an effective balance of innate and acquired pathogen clearance functions, while resulting in earlier resolution in inflammation during the effector phase of viral infection. The findings and genetic target validation, along with additional translational studies, might facilitate the development of rational carbohydrate-based immunotherapeutic agents to inhibit influenza A viral lung injury; and possibly an immunologic basis for targeting IAV along with other respiratory viruses.ConclusionsIn this study, we employed a novel CD11c directed Ndst1 silencing platform, and demonstrated a snapshot of how targeting DC surface HS may affect IAV infection-driven inflammation and immunity in mice. In particular, we found reduced inflammation, and what appears to be enhanced IAV clearance along with a suppressed Treg phenotype in lung sections of IAV-infected mutant mice in comparison to that of wildtype mice in the late infection/effector phase. Using Ndst1 silencing in vitro, we demonstrated upregulated basal IFN-β expression, and enhanced CpG-dependent NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in Ndst1 silenced model DCs. At the IFN-β protein level, however, while we could demonstrate only very weak responses to CpG using primary cultured DCs, responses to TLR7 stimulation were robust, and markedly increased in Ndst1 mutant primary DCs. Our findings reveal potentially a glycan-based therapeutic potential for endogenous DC engineering or targeting to boost anti-viral immunity and limit the lung-inflammatory effects of IAV infection and possibly that of other respiratory viruses.Materials and methodsViral strain, mice, and inoculationMouse adopted influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8 IAV) was provided by the J. Teijaro lab, with strain as referenced20. Experiments were performed on 4- to 6-month-old Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant and Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− control littermate mice. We employed mice 4- to 6-months of age to maintain consistency with original pilot studies that showed significant differences in inflammation between mutant and wildtype controls at that age range in a pilot cohort (while also paralleled by coincident limitations in breeding during COVID-19 pandemic conditions). Two additional day 5 post-inoculation studies were carried out as: (i) n = 3 mutant = 3 wildtype, under COVID-19 vivarium limitations for inflammation and initial AA5H and T cell IHC studies; and (ii) n = 6 mutant = 4 wildtype for additional data examining viral load (viral RNA studies) and T cell flow cytometry studies. For other data, the largest total mouse cohort for which mice were assessed for viral load at day 9 post-inoculation (p.i.) was mixed male/female n = 10 mutant (2 male/8 female) and n = 12 wildtype (11 male/1 female), split among 2 separate experiments with subsets examined in inflammation studies. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (UC San Diego). Mice were intra-nasally inoculated with 20 plaque-forming unit (PFU) suspended in 40 μL PBS (Cf: 0.5 PFU/μL) of PR8 IAV. Mice were monitored by body weight and activity over the infection period. The weight trends of wildtype and mutant mice during the course of infection are plotted in Supplemental Fig.S2. On Day 9 p.i., lungs were harvested, inflated, paraffin embedded, and sectioned for histology. We and others have used Ndst1f/f conditional (Cre−) mice as the essential and standard littermate controls to compare phenotype(s) to tissue-specific Cre + mutants (i.e., with cell-specific Ndst1 deficiency in Cre + Ndst1f/f mutants). (We nevertheless reference a Ndst1+/+ Cre+ control that had been employed in cerebral development studies examining Ndst1 conditional mutants, and where a wildtype Ndst1+/+ Cre+ state was used to demonstrate normal Ndst1 expression in mouse cerebral tissue43,44.) All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant Scientific Reports guidelines and regulations, and this includes compliance with ARRIVE guidelines as well as American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guidelines. To quantify lung inflammation, the criteria for measurement of the intensity of inflammation were the application of a possible range from 0 (min) to 3 (max) on relative intensity scale used for estimating degree of inflammation on H&E stained slides by a Pathologist blinded to genotype (whole-lung slide for each mouse). Measurement of the spatial extent of lung inflammation (% area covered) on lung histologic sections was also determined by a Pathologist blinded to genotype (whole-lung slide for each mouse). Values were normalized for graphs (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig.S1) to the mean value for wildtype (Ndst1f/f CD11cCre−) control mice. The values, including normalized data values, are summarized in Supplemental Table 1 as well.HistologyHematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) staining was performed on some slides. Slides for antibody labeling were prepared by deparaffinization, re-hydration, and heated citrate antigen retrieval. Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector) was used to minimize non-specific binding in some studies using biotinylated antibody. Anti-IAV Nucleoprotein AA5H (Abcam) (1:1000 dilution) staining was performed using the M.O.M. Kit per manufacturer instructions (Vector). Anti-FOXP3 (Invitrogen) (1:100 dilution) labeling was carried out in 1% BSA/TTBS solution overnight at 4˚C. Anti-Rabbit Biotin (Vector) at 1:100 dilution in 1% BSA/TTBS solution was added to the tissue sections at room temperature for 1 h. For CD8 staining, anti-Mouse CD8 Biotin (Invitrogen) (1:100 dilution) labeling was carried out in 1% BSA/TTBS solution overnight at 4˚C. Alkaline Phosphatase Streptavidin and Vector Blue Substrate Kits were used for detection (Vector). Quantification of AA5H nucleoprotein as well as T cells in IHC tissue sections was carried out by counting of 5 high power fields (HPF) per histologic section through whole lung by two independent technical associates blinded to slide information.Cell cultureThe bone marrow dendritic cell line DC2.4 (Millipore-Sigma) was cultured in growth medium (RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 55 μM beta-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Primary mouse bone marrow dendritc cells (BMDCs) were derived by harvesting whole bone marrow from either Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice or Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− wildtype controls into cell culture, and differentiating in the presence of GM-CSF for a total of 9 days. For some studies, on day 7 of differentiation, the cells were split into a 12 well dish with 1 mL of GM-CSF supplemented media.siRNA transfectionAdherent DC2.4 cells at 70% confluency were incubated with transfection mixture containing Ndst1 siRNA (Cf: 20 nM) (Integrated DNA technologies) lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM at 37 °C for 6 h. NC1 (scrambled) siRNA was used as a negative vehicle control. Upon removal of transfection mixture, cells were maintained in growth medium overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until use.NFκB phosphorylation and TLR ligand stimulationNdst1 silenced and non-silenced DC2.4 cells were incubated in serum free RPMI-1640 for 1 h, and then treated with 1 μM Class B CpG oligonucleotide (InvivoGen) in serum free RPMI-1640 at 37 °C for the specified time course. In some studies, NFκB phosphorylation was examined by western (described separately) following CpG stimulation, while expression of IFN-β was examined by qPCR (described separately) in other studies. Primary DCs harvested from whole bone marrow from either Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant or Ndst1f/f CD11cCre− control mice were used in separate studies examining ELISA based IFN-β protein produced in the culture medium in response to either the TLR9 ligand CpG or to the TLR7 ligand R848, described separately.Quantitative PCR to assess IFN-β, Ndst1, and viral RNA expressionComplementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from cell and viral samples using RNaqueaous 4-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) and Super Script III First Stand Kit (Invitrogen) based on manufacturer protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with sample mixture of 100 ng of cDNA and primers for IFN-β 1 (according to manufacturer protocol; Biorad PrimePCR), and referenced to GAPDH expression. Primers were also applied for Ndst1 to determine Ndst1 silencing efficiency in some studies. While virus was not detected by plaque assay at day 5 p.i., (carried out as in45) we performed viral RNA qPCR to detect/quantify PR8 IAV viral genomic material from lung samples at that timepoint: For viral RNA qPCR, total RNA was isolated from mouse lung homogenates, and IAV virus (5,000,000 PFU starting material). Two separate primer sets for the H1N1 PR8 nucleoprotein24 and the IAV M1/M2 protein23 were used to quantify PR8 virus from tissue based on referencing to a standard curve generated from dilutions of the PR8 viral stock cDNA for which qPCR cycle thresholds were determined and plotted. Samples were run in the presence of iQ Sybr Green (Bio-Rad) on a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems) quantitative PCR machine. A quantity of 100 ng of mouse lung cDNA was added to each reaction in triplicate for quantitative analysis. Primer sequences were as follows:Ndst1 Primers: 5′-GGACATCTGGTCTAAG-3′; reverse 5′-GATGCCTTTGTGATAG-3′PR8 viral NP primers:5’-GGGTGAGAATGGACGAAAAA-3’; reverse 5’-TCCATCATTGCTTTTTGTGC-3’.PR8 viral M1/M2 primers:5’-GGACTGCAGCGTTAGACGCT-3’; reverse 5’-CATCCTGTTGTATATGAGGCCCAT-3’.Flow cytometryWhole mouse lung was digested in 0.2% collagenase solution in cell culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Tissue was passed though a 70 mm cell strainer at the end of digestion. Red blood cell lysis was performed on filtered material, and the cell suspension was washed in 1% BSA/PBS before antibody labeling. For studies examining for cells harboring the mouse IAV nucleoprotein (NP), samples were labeled with FITC conjugated anti-IAV NP antibody (AA5H; Abcam) at 5 μg/mL for 1 h at 4 °C in 1%BSA/PBS. Cells were washed and assayed on a CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (FlowJo version 10.1). In additional studies aimed to assess inflammatory and T cell responses in the early phase of infection, we carried out analyses of AA5H NP expression in cells liberated from collagenase-digested lung samples in mice day 5 p.i.; and we found no significant difference between IAV NP viral load in mutant versus wildtype lungs at this time point (Supplemental Fig. S7). For flow cytometry examination of T cell subsets from whole lung at day 5 p.i., anti-mouse CD8a PE (Tonbo, 50–0081) was incubated at 2 μg/ml with the lung-digest cells for 1 h on ice. Unlabeled cells and isotype-match secondary antibody were used as controls; and flow cytometry was used to determine % CD8 + T cells in the lung digest cell population. To quantify CD4 + T cells, anti-mouse CD4 antibody (Invitrogen) was used at 2 μg/ml; and antibody against the FOXP3 + T cells (Invitrogen) was used at 2 μg/ml to quantify the Treg subset population (as a % of CD4 + T cells).Protein preparationCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Teknova) containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 µl/ml protease inhibitor cocktail at − 20 °C. After equilibrating at 4 °C, protein was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 m. Concentrations of isolated protein samples were quantified using Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher).ELISA assaysMouse primary bone marrow DCs from Ndst1f/f CD11cCre + mutant mice and Cre− control mice matured in culture in the presence of GM-CSF for a total of 9 days were exposed to Resiquimod (R848) (Invivogen), which was added to the cells at 0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μg/mL in 12-well plates at the start of Day 8, and incubated for 24 h prior to assay on day 9, when cells were collected and spun down for measurement of IFN-β in supernatants. In some assays, cells at day 8 in culture were exposed to CpG (Invivogen; CpG class B ODN) at 1 μM concentration overnight prior to assay at day 9. For assay measurements on culture day 9, 50 μL of supernatant was removed in triplicate, and assayed for INF-β using a LumiKine mINFβ detection kit (Invivogen). The assay was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol using PBS as the coating buffer.Western blottingIsolated protein samples were run on a 4–15% protein gel in Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (BIO-RAD) at 180 V for 30 min and transferred onto 0.2 µm Nitrocellulose filter paper sandwiches (BIO-RAD) in 100 mM CAPS and 20% methanol at < 8 °C and 30 V for 2 h. Membranes were then rinsed with Tween-20/TTBS and blocked in Odyssey Blocking buffer (LI-COR) for 1 h. Primary antibody labeling was carried out with anti-phosphorylated NFκB p65 and anti- NFκB p65 (Cell Signaling 3031S and 4764S, respectively) (diluted to 1:1000; 88 ng/ml in Odyssey Blocking buffer) on a shaker overnight at 4˚C. Membranes were rinsed four times with TTBS for 15 min each, and then labeled with IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (LI-COR) (diluted to 1:10,000 in Odyssey Blocking buffer) on a shaker in the dark at RT for 1 h. Membranes were rinsed with TTBS again, and air-dried in the dark. Final blotting results were resolved using a LI-COR Odyssey system. (Full-length blot image for gel bands shown in Fig. 2B is shown in Supplemental Figure S8.)StatisticsFor most comparisons of mean values, the unpaired student’s T-test was used, while in one analysis comparing group proportions, the chi-square statistic was used. The paired student’s T-test was used in analyses comparing means involving paired data (e.g., comparing paired data from multiple repeated experiments). A value of P < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. ReferencesPaget, J. et al.

These findings were not unexpected, as wild birds can be infected with HPAI but show no signs of illness. Eight other states in the Atlantic Flyway have found HPAI this year in wild birds, with it believed to be widespread in migratory waterfowl on Feb. 19. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed HPAI in non-commercial backyard flocks in Maine and New York.These findings have prompted state and federal officials and the area poultry industry to call for chicken growers and industry personnel to redouble their biosecurity efforts to keep the disease out of backyard and commercial poultry flocks. Poultry owners or those working within the poultry industry should refer to guidance issued by the Delaware Department of Agriculture regarding increased biosecurity protocols. • No person without a direct role in the poultry operation (e.g., feed trucks, fuel deliveries, service people ) should visit poultry farms for the foreseeable future. Local, county, and state governments, as well as allied industries, should cease non-essential visits to poultry farms.• Commercial and backyard flock owners should review their biosecurity plans to reduce the transmission of avian influenza to their birds. Virus transmission can occur through foot and vehicular traffic; secretions from birds’ mouths, nostrils, eyes, excrement; contact with infected droppings; movement of infected birds; and contaminated clothing and equipment. For tips on improving biosecurity, visit https://bit.ly/3Bh6T7p• All keepers of domesticated birds should prevent contact between their animals and areas where wild birds have access.• Report sick poultry or unusual deaths in poultry flocks to the Delaware Department of Agriculture’s Poultry and Animal Health at (302) 698-4500, or after hours for a disease emergency involving poultry, call 302-233-1480. .

Here's What To Do.A cold, the flu or any virus can leave you sniffling long after the illness has run its course. This advice can help you get relief.By Julia RiesOn Assignment For HuffPostMar 31, 2022, 05:45 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGAfter a seemingly two-year lull, non-COVID respiratory viruses are making a comeback. Many of us were able to avoid the common cold or the flu during the pandemic, thanks to the benefits of masking and social distancing. However, as restrictions drop, there has been an uptick in seasonal illnesses — caused by rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other coronaviruses — that typically hit hard in the winter months. Compared to COVID-19, the common cold doesn’t seem so bad — but it can still put you out with a sore throat, stuffy nose and malaise. Most colds only last a week, but even after you recover, your nose and sinuses can remain stuffed up with phlegm. And that lingering congestion can feel like it goes on forever.Advertisement Otolaryngologists call this a postnasal drip. During a head cold, your body produces a ton of mucus to soothe your sinuses and clear out the infection. That mucus doesn’t disappear overnight — it takes time for your body’s immune response to wind down and chip away at the build-up of phlegm. Here’s what causes all that congestion.When a pathogen enters our airways, it latches to cells deep inside our noses and begins to multiply. As the virus does this, it irritates our nasal passages and sinuses, triggering inflammation, said Dr. Christopher Thompson, an otolaryngologist with Providence Mission Hospital in Orange County, California.Advertisement “This signals your immune system to create mucus to wash the virus out of your system,” Thompson said. That mucus, which builds up and creates sinus pressure, also moistens our irritated nose and and sinuses. We actually always have some mucus draining down the back of our throat, but the mucus produced during a cold is much thicker and stickier. It also becomes yellow and green — a sign that our body is, in fact, fending off a virus. Most people will recover from a cold within about seven days, but the congestion sometimes lingers even when the infection itself has cleared, and you might find yourself blowing your nose or clearing your throat for a week or two longer.Advertisement “This is because your body produces a lot of extra mucus to flush the cold virus out of your system,” Thompson said. It takes time for your body to clear out all that mucus, even after the virus itself is no longer in your system. How much mucus your body produces is influenced by a mix of factors, including genetics, the type of virus, and the viral load you were exposed to, said Dr. Brian Kaplan, an otolaryngologist and the chair of the department of otolaryngology at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center.ljubaphoto via Getty ImagesThere are ways to make your congestion dissipate so you're feeling better faster.Are there ways to clear out the congestion?There is no magic bullet to flushing out phlegm, according to Kaplan, but there are a handful of tricks to expedite the process. First thing: Drink plenty of fluids. Doing so will thin the mucus in your nasal and sinus passages and reduce some of that head pressure. Advertisement “The goal is to increase the fluid to put in to the mucous to thin it out and allow it to drain more easily,” Kaplan said. Rest — a step that’s often overlooked — is key to helping your body bounce back quicker. It helps your body allocate more energy toward recovering and less energy toward other tasks or activities. Taking a steam shower or using a humidifier can thin your mucus, reduce inflammation and open up your sinuses. If you have sinus pain or pressure, Thompson recommended placing a warm compress over your nose and eyes. Your Support Has Never Been More CriticalOther news outlets have retreated behind paywalls.

There are also a variety of over-the-counter decongestants and mucolytics that can help thin the mucus — but be mindful of how long you use them for. Taking over-the-counter decongestants for more than three days can actually worsen your symptoms. If your post-nasal drip hasn’t improved within 10 days of your cold, see a doctor. Left untreated, postnasal drip can collect germs and turn into a sinus infection, so you’ll want to have it checked out. Advertisement “The most important thing is to give your body what it needs as it recovers from fighting the infection,” Kaplan said. “Making sure to keep yourself well hydrated, get plenty of sleep, and ensure good nutrition is key.”RelatedsickcongestionCan You Get BA.2 If You've Had COVID Recently?8 Health Issues You Didn't Know Your Pharmacist Can Help WithThe Rare, Underdiscussed Issue Some People Experience After COVID Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping'sBest FindsNewsletter Sign UpThe Good LifeA completely essential daily guide to achieving the good life.Successfully Signed Up!Realness delivered to your inboxBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.
