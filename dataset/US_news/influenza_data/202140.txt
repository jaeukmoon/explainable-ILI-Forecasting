The continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 increases the probability of influenza/SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, which may result in severe disease. In this study, we examine the disease outcome of influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in K18-hACE2 mice. Our data indicate enhance susceptibility of IAV-infected mice to developing severe disease upon coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 two days later. In contrast to nonfatal influenza and lower mortality rates due to SARS-CoV-2 alone, this coinfection results in severe morbidity and nearly complete mortality. Coinfection is associated with elevated influenza viral loads in respiratory organs. Remarkably, prior immunity to influenza, but not to SARS-CoV-2, prevents severe disease and mortality. This protection is antibody-dependent. These data experimentally support the necessity of seasonal influenza vaccination for reducing the risk of severe influenza/COVID-19 comorbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a broad spectrum of severities, ranging from asymptomatic presentation to severe pneumonia. Most of the mildly to critically affected patients show respiratory complications, including moderate to severe pneumonia, which can further progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction in severely ill patients1. Most of these clinical symptoms are associated with the respiratory system, specifically the lungs, resulting in the depleted lung functionality2. Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, such as the age, sex, and obesity have been identified3. However, more research is needed to better understand the involvement of these and other risk factors in severe illness or complications. Whether coinfection with other pathogens may impact disease severity is yet to be elucidated. Previous studies have reported coinfections between SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus4. A meta-analysis of 30 studies including 3834 patients with COVID-19 revealed that overall, 7% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had a bacterial coinfection, while the pooled proportion of viral coinfections was 3%, with respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus (IAV) being the most common5. However, the prevalence and disease outcomes of viral coinfections in the SARS-CoV-2-positive population remain controversial6,7,8,9.IAV is a leading cause of respiratory infection, resulting in respiratory disease10. Complications involving secondary infections with other pathogens, mostly bacteria, significantly exacerbate the risk of severe disease due to IAV and other viral respiratory pathogens11,12,13,14.However, whether coinfection with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 presents more severe disease than a single infection is not clear.In this study, we delineate the interplay between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. For this purpose, we employ transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under control of the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2 mice) to establish a SARS-CoV-2-susceptible murine model15. We show that IAV-infected mice have enhanced susceptibility to developing severe disease upon coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 two days post influenza infection (dpIi). In contrast to nonfatal influenza disease and lower rates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 alone, this coinfection is associated with elevated influenza viral loads in respiratory organs, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced following coinfection. Remarkably, prior immunity to influenza, but not to SARS-CoV-2, prevents severe disease and mortality. Finally, we show that this protection is antibody dependent.Results and discussionSevere mortality in K18-hACE2 mice coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAVTo delineate the interplay between IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infections, we used K18-hACE2 mice to establish a SARS-CoV-2-susceptible murine model15. Non/partially lethal viral doses were chosen for each virus to allow us to distinguish more severe outcomes of coinfection. The doses were determined based on challenge experiments in which K18-hACE2 mice were infected with different doses of mouse-adapted IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8)) or SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). To mimic coinfection, the mice were infected with IAV and subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. While the terms ‘coinfection’ and ‘superinfection’ are often used interchangeably, the use of ‘coinfection’ here refers to a sequential infection with two viruses within a very short time, with the second infection occurring prior to the elimination of the first virus.First, the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested two dpIi during the presymptomatic stage of influenza (Supplementary Fig. 1a). At this stage, mice do not present any disease manifestations, but the viral titer of IAV in the lungs is high16. The IAV-infected mice started losing weight at 5 dpIi and exhibited maximal morbidity at 9–10 dpIi (75% of their initial body weight) (Fig. 1a). At 11 dpIi, all the mice began to gain weight and returned to their initial body weight by 18 dpIi. Remarkably, the mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 at two dpIi exhibited earlier and increased weight loss compared to the mice with IAV infection alone. Moreover, in contrast to the survival and only 38% mortality of the only IAV- and only SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, respectively, all coinfected mice died by 5–7 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection (dpSi) (Fig. 1b, ****p < 0.0001).Fig. 1: Morbidity and mortality in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 following influenza infection.K18-hACE2 mice were infected with IAV (80 PFU/mouse, i.n.), followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (10 PFU/mouse, i.n.) at 2 (a, b), 5 (c, d), or 8 (e, f) dpIi. The percent weight loss following infection is shown (a, c, e). The red arrow represents IAV infection. The blue arrow represents SARS-CoV-2 infection. All measurement data are expressed as mean + standard error (SE). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3; IAV infection compared to coinfection (a, c, e); ****p < 0.0001 (a, c), ns (e). Survival curves are shown (b, d, f): *p = 0.0453; ***p = 0.0007; ****p < 0.0001; IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to coinfection. ns, not significant (p = 0.0779), log-rank test (Mantel-Cox). The figure shows one representative experiment of 4 (a, b), 2 (c, d), and 1 (e, f) experiments performed. The figure includes the IAV-infected group, which consisted of 10 (a, b), 11 (c, d), or 8 (e, f) mice; the SARS-CoV-2-infected group, which consisted of 13 (a, b) or 14 (c–f) mice; and the coinfection group, which consisted of 11 (a, b), 10 (c, d), or 7 (e, f) mice.Full size imageSubsequently, we examined coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 at five dpIi during the early symptomatic stage. The IAV-infected and coinfected mice started to lose weight at 6-7 dpIi (Fig. 1c). However, while the IAV-infected mice reached their maximal weight loss at 8 dpIi (79% of their initial weight), the coinfected mice continued to lose weight until 10 dpIi (73% of their initial weight). Additionally, the recovery period of the coinfected mice was prolonged compared to that of the IAV-infected mice. While the IAV-infected mice reached 97% of their initial weight at 11 dpIi, the coinfected mice reached 94% of their initial weight by 17 dpIi and returned to their baseline weight only 22 dpIi (Fig. 1c). Moreover, coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 at 5 dpIi resulted in 70% mortality compared to the 43% mortality observed among the mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone (p = 0.08) (Fig. 1d). Finally, we assessed coinfection when SARS-CoV-2 was administered in the late-symptomatic stage of influenza disease during which maximal morbidity was detected (8 dpIi, Fig. 1e, f). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 dpIi had no effect on the body weight or survival rate of the mice. These results suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 early upon infection with IAV results in a more severe disease, while a later SARS-CoV-2 infection has no severe effect.In the human population, coinfection is most likely to occur during the asymptomatic period. Additionally, during the asymptomatic stage of influenza disease, as represented by the experiments with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 2 dpIi (Fig. 1a, b), coinfection resulted in the most severe and lethal disease. Therefore, we chose to focus on this stage, and hereafter, coinfection refers to infection with IAV followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 two days later.Increased IAV and decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in coinfected miceTo correlate the severe outcome observed in the coinfected mice and the viral load, the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were quantified in the lungs, nasal turbinates (N.T.), and brains (Fig. 2). A significant increase in the IAV RNA levels was observed in the lungs of the coinfected mice at 4 dpIi, but not at 6 dpIi, compared to those in the mice with IAV infection (4.6-fold increase). In the N.T., a significant increase in the IAV viral titer was observed at both 4 and 6 dpIi (11-fold and 2.3-fold increases, respectively) in the coinfected mice compared to that in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 2b, c), which coincided with the exacerbated disease. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 load was reduced in the coinfected mice compared to that in the SARS-CoV-2-infected mice in both the lungs and the N.T. (albeit nonsignificantly) at 4 and 6 dpIi (Fig. 2d, e). These findings are consistent with previous evidence of pathogenic competition between respiratory viruses, such as influenza and seasonal coronaviruses17,18. A possible explanation for the reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load might be the induction of the innate immune response activated by the IAV infection prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, inhibiting the establishment of infection and replication19,20,21. In addition to innate immunity mechanisms underlying the reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load, IAV infection may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Our data contradict those of a recent study showing that coinfection with IAV enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity22. In this previous study, no significant differences were found in disease manifestations between coinfected K18-hACE2 mice and SARS-CoV-2-monoinfected mice22. However, the SARS-CoV-2 infection dose in our study is 4-log lower than that in the Bai et al.’s study, and no data comparing coinfected mice and IAV-monoinfected mice were presented by Bai et al., making comparison between the two studies difficult.Fig. 2: Increased IAV and decreased SARS-CoV-2 loads in coinfected mice.Schematic timeline (a). K18-hACE2 mice were sacrificed at 4 or 6 dpIi and 2 or 4 dpSi. The IAV RNA load was measured in the lungs (b) and nasal turbinates (N.T.) (c), and the PFU equivalent per organ (pfuE/organ) was calculated. The SARS-CoV-2 loads in the lungs (d), N.T. (e), and brains (f) were determined by a PFU assay. Each symbol represents one mouse (10 mice per group, except 4 mice for brain testing at 4 dpIi). The lines represent the means.

Each image is representative of a group of 5 mice.Full size imageNotably, although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load was reduced in the coinfected mice, the remaining levels were sufficient to trigger the lethal outcome of the coinfection.Histopathological analysis of coinfected K18-hACE2 miceLung pathology was observed in all infected groups and was consistent with the IAV viral load, with the coinfected mice presenting the most severe pathology (Fig. 2g); the lungs of the IAV-infected mice appeared moderately to strongly affected, showing necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium with massive peribronchiolar infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes (Fig. 2g). The SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs showed milder histological changes characterized by minor-to-mild interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and some neutrophils, with no obvious necrosis (Fig. 2g). The lungs of the coinfected mice showed a histopathological pattern similar to that observed in the IAV group but were more severe, including involvement of the lung parenchyma. Small hemorrhages were observed in the interstitium of some samples, and thickening of the pleura was identified in 3 of 5 animals (Fig. 2g). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased morbidity and mortality detected in the coinfected mice are associated with elevated levels of IAV and exacerbated pathology in the respiratory system.K18-hACE2 mice are a valuable model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and have been studied extensively23,24. However, in K18-hACE2 mice, SARS-CoV-2 also enters the brain, which might affect the disease severity15. To examine whether the increased morbidity was brain related, SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured in brain tissues, and was found in only 3 of 10 SARS-CoV-2-infected mice (Fig. 2f; at 4 dpSi). Importantly, no virus was detected in the brains of the coinfected mice, and no brain pathology was apparent at 4 dpSi (Supplementary Fig. 2).Coinfection in AdV-hACE2 mice modelSubsequently, to exclude the possibility that the severe outcome of the coinfected mice is model specific and brain related, we examined an additional independent COVID-19 mouse model, i.e., hACE2-expressing human Ad5 (AdV-hACE2) mice. In the AdV-hACE2 model, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated via the intranasal (i.n.) route with replication-defective adenovirus encoding the hACE2 receptor, resulting in lung-specific pathology25. Similar to the K18-hACE2 mice, the AdV-hACE2 mice were significantly more sensitive to coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 at 2 dpIi (Supplementary Fig. 3). While all monoinfected mice survived the infection, only 9% of the coinfected mice survived (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results support that coinfection lethality is not model specific.Upregulation of inflammation-related genes in the lungs of coinfected miceTo elaborate upon the host response to each monoinfection versus coinfection, we assessed the expression of immune-related genes in the lungs at 4 dpIi and 2 dpSi.The genes tested can be divided into the following groups: the complement system (C1ra, C1rb, C3, and C1s1); antigen presentation (H2-eb1 and H2-k1); recruitment and activation of immune cells (Cd2, Fas, Cd38, Gzma, and Prf1); interleukins (Ils) (Il-1a and Il6); chemokines (Ccl5, Ccl8, Ccl12, and Cxcl10); interferon response (Ifi44, Ifit1, Ifit3, Ifi27l2a, and Irf7); matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps); tissue damage (Mmp3, Mmp8, Mmp9, and Timp1); and a member of the Schlafen (Slfn) family (Slfn4), the ubiquitin-like modifier Isg15, and Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (Zbp1).Overall, in the lungs of the SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, no alterations in the mRNA levels of the tested genes were observed compared to those in the lungs of the uninfected mice (Fig. 3) most likely due to the low infection dose (10 PFU/mouse) and short time post infection (2 days). After the infection with IAV, all tested genes were overexpressed (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection resulted in a significantly larger elevation of gene expression than exhibited upon IAV infection alone, indicating robust induction of the immune system that may have led to exacerbated disease.Fig. 3: Panel of inflammation-related genes with increased expression in the lungs of coinfected mice.Expression of various inflammation-related genes in the lungs.

Efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by intramuscular (i.m.) immunization of SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). This route of immunization induced both humoral and cellular responses (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b, respectively) against SARS-CoV-2 and was sufficient to protect the mice from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig. 4a–c). However, while preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 completely prevented the mortality caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, accounting for 50%, it had no effect on the morbidity and full mortality caused by the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (Fig. 4b, c). To rule out the possibility that the inability of SARS-CoV-2 immunization to rescue the coinfected mice was a result of the i.m. immunization route, we examined another SARS-CoV-2 route of immunization. The acquisition of preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 by the i.n. route (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) did not protect the mice from coinfection (Supplementary Fig. 5), which is similar to the results of infection via the i.m. route, even though both routes of infection induced humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 4).Fig. 4: Prior immunity to IAV but not to SARS-CoV-2 protected coinfected K18-hACE2 mice.a Legend of (b, c). d legend of (e, f). g legend of (h). K18-hACE2 mice were immunized by the i.m. route to SARS-CoV-2 or IAV as indicated in (a, d, g). Thirty days post immunization, immunized and nonimmunized mice were infected i.n. with the indicated virus (b, c, e, f).

(i) Anti-IAV sera rescued K18-hACE2 coinfected mice. Percent weight loss following infection. Mice were coinfected with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 and treated with anti-IAV sera (n = 10), or naive sera (n = 8), or left untreated (n = 7). Sera were administered i.p. 1 day prior to IAV infection. Error bars represent the standard error (SE).Full size imagePrior immunity to IAV protected coinfected K18-hACE2 miceTo determine whether preexisting immunity to IAV can prevent coinfection manifestations, mice were vaccinated i.m. with IAV 30 days prior to the viral infection with IAV and/or SARS-CoV-2. This preexposure to IAV induced both humoral and cellular responses (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b, respectively) against IAV and alleviated the morbidity observed upon infection with IAV (Fig. 4f). Preexposure to IAV had no effect on the survival rate upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4e, p = 0.64). Remarkably, immunity to IAV prevented the severe manifestations and mortality caused by the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. Neither weight loss nor increased mortality was detected in the coinfected mice vaccinated against IAV compared to those in the coinfected mice without preexisting immunity (Fig. 4e, f).These data further support the notion that the severe manifestations of coinfection are not the result of a more severe SARS-CoV-2 disease but rather of IAV.Prior immunity to IAV rescues coinfected mice and is antibody dependentNext, we examined whether the protection of coinfected mice by prior immunization is due to cellular or humoral immunity. First, T-cell depletion was conducted (Supplementary Fig. 7). Mice were immunized by the i.m. route to IAV to induce immunity; after 30 days, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted, the mice were coinfected with IAV and SARS-CoV-2, and the ability of preexisting immunity to rescue the mice in the presence or absence of T cells was tested (Fig. 4g, h). The depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells had no effect on the survival rate of the preimmune coinfected mice. This result suggests that the protection provided by preimmunity to IAV is T cell independent. Next, to delineate the role of anti-IAV antibodies in the protection of coinfected mice, we performed passive transfer of anti-IAV sera to coinfected mice. Anti-IAV antibodies rescued the coinfected mice (Fig. 4i), indicating that the protection was indeed antibody dependent.Altogether, our data show that IAV-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection results in severe and lethal disease in mice. The severe manifestations were associated with an elevated IAV viral load, robust induction of innate immunity, and exacerbated pathology in respiratory organs. Importantly, prior humoral immunity to influenza, but not to SARS-CoV-2, prevented disease and mortality, suggesting that influenza intervention by prior vaccination may prove valuable in reducing the risk of severe influenza/SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity.MethodsCellsVero E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586TM) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC® CCL-34™) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM nonessential amino acids, 2 nM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 12.5 units/ml nystatin (Biological Industries, Israel). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere.VirusesThe SARS-CoV-2 isolate Human 2019-nCoV ex China strain BavPat1/2020 was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten (Charité, Berlin) through the European Virus Archive – Global (EVAg Ref-SKU: 026 V-03883). The viral stocks were propagated (4 passages) and titrated in Vero E6 cells. The genome sequence has been deposited at the GISAID EpiCoV coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 platform database under the identifier EPI_ISL_3838266.IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) was propagated by injecting 0.1 ml of a 1:100 diluted viral stock (2048 hemagglutination units, HAUs) into the allantoic sac of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, ~9 ml of virus-rich allantoic fluid was collected. The HAU value was determined using chicken erythrocytes, and virus titers were determined by a plaque assay using MDCK cell monolayers26.Ad-GFP-hACE2 (code ADV-200183) was purchased from Vector Biosystems Inc. (Malvern, PA, USA).All viruses were aliquot and stored at −80 °C until use.Animal experimentsAll animal experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility. The animal handling was performed in accordance with the regulations outlined in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act and the conditions specified in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, 2011). The animal studies were approved by the ethical committee for animal experiments of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) (protocol numbers M-29-20, M-39-20, M-40-20, M-41-20, M-36-21, and M-37-21). Female K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (B6. Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J; #034860) and female and male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) (6–8 weeks old) were maintained at 20−22 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 10% under a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The animals were fed commercial rodent chow (Koffolk Inc.) and provided tap water ad libitum. Prior to infection, the mice were kept in groups of 10. The mice were randomly assigned to the experimental groups.For the PR8 and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viruses were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2% FBS (Biological Industries, Israel). Anesthetized animals (ketamine 75 mg/kg and xylazine 7.5 mg/kg in PBS) were infected by i.n. instillation of 20 µl (PR8: 80 PFU/mouse, SARS-CoV-2: 10 PFU/mouse).For the infection with Ad-GFP-hACE225, C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 mg of an anti-IFNAR (interferon-α/β receptor) monoclonal antibody (mAb) (LEINCO Technologies, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA, code I-401-100) in 0.5 ml. After 24 h, 20 µl of Ad-GFP-hACE2 were administered to the anesthetized mice. After 3 days, the mice were treated i.n. with 80 PFU of PR8, and after 2 days, the mice were treated i.n. with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (all i.n. administrations were performed under anesthesia).Animal immunizationFor the SARS-CoV-2 immunization, i.n. instillation of 2 PFU/mouse or i.m. injection of 103, 104, 105, or 106 PFU/mouse SARS-CoV-2 was performed. For the IAV immunization, the mice were vaccinated i.m. with 106 PFU/mouse. The immunized mice were infected 30 days post immunization.Determination of the viral load in organsThe viral loads were determined at 2 and 4 dpSi or 4 and 6 dpIi. In the coinfected group, the viral load was determined at 4 and 6 dpIi (2 and 4 dpSi). Each group included 10 mice, except for the experiments examining brains at 2 dpSi, which included a group of 4 K18-hACE2 animals. The lungs, N.T., and brains were harvested and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The organs were processed for titration in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Tissues were homogenized (ULTRA-TURAX® IKA R104) for 30 s in 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed centrifugation (270g, 10 min, 4 °C) and collection of the supernatants for virus titration. Processed tissue homogenates were divided for immediate RNA extraction for the IAV RNA determination and gene expression analysis or kept at −80 °C until further processing for the viral titration (used for SARS-CoV-2 PFU assay).The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was determined using a PFU assay27. Serial dilutions of extracted organ homogenates from mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or coinfected with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 were prepared in infection medium (MEM containing 2% FBS) and used to infect Vero E6 monolayers in duplicate (200 µl/well). The plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow viral adsorption. Then, 2 ml overlay (MEM containing 2% FBS and 0.4% tragacanth; Merck, Israel) were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were fixed and stained with 1 ml/well crystal violet solution (Biological Industries, Israel). The number of plaques per well was determined, and the SARS-CoV-2 PFU titer was calculated.The IAV RNA level was determined using real-time RT-PCR (see below).Quantitative real-time RT-PCRRNA was extracted with a viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The IAV RNA loads in the lung and N.T. were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Real-time RT-PCR was conducted with a SensiFAST™ Probe Lo-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline, 78005) and analyzed with a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The PFU equivalent per organ (pfuE/organ) was calculated from a standard curve generated from virus stocks. The quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers and probes used for the detection of PR8 were PR8-PA-FW: CGGTCCAAATTCCTGCTGA; PR8-PA-RW: CATTGGGTTCCTTCCATCCA; and PR8-PA-Probe: CCAAGTCATGAAGGAGAGGGAATACCGCT.Total RNA extracted from the lungs of mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 or coinfected at 2 dpSi and 4 dpIi was used to measure the differential expression of genes by qRT-PCR using corresponding specific primers printed on 96-well plates (Custom TaqMan Array Plates, Applied BiosystemsTM) as previously described28. Briefly, 1 µg of cDNA was synthesized from RNA using a Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were subjected to qPCR with TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix (7500 Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used to normalize the fold change of each gene compared to the mock-infected control at the same time point, which was calculated as ∆∆CT.HistopathologyFor the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) general histopathology evaluation, 6 dpIi (4 dpSi) mice (n = 5 per group) were anesthetized and then perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The lungs and brains were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 2 weeks. The fixed tissues were sent to ‘Patho-Logica’ (Rehovot, Israel) for processing and analysis. Serial coronal 4 µm thick sections were obtained, and selected sections were stained with H&E for light microscopy examination. Pictures were taken using an Olympus microscope (BX60, serial No. 7D04032) equipped with a microscope camera (Olympus DP73, serial No. OH05504) at objective magnifications of X4 and X10.Plaque reduction neutralization testThe SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody levels were determined using a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)27. Briefly, all sera were heat inactivated at 60 °C for 30 min, then serially diluted twofold in 400 µl of infection medium, mixed with 400 µl of 300 PFU/ml SARS-CoV-2, and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1 h. Then, 200 μl of each serum/virus mixture was added in duplicate to Vero E6 cell monolayers, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A virus mixture without serum was used as a control. Two milliliters overlay were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were fixed and stained with 1 ml/well crystal violet solution. The number of plaques per well was determined, and the serum dilution that neutralized 50% of the virions (NT50) was calculated using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc.).ELISpot assaysFor the detection of IFNγ-secreting cells from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or IAV, the mice were sacrificed 7 or 25 days post immunization, respectively. The spleens were dissociated in GentleMACS C-tubes (Miltenyi Biotec), filtered, separated on Ficoll-Paque (GE), and washed with medium. Then, 4 × 105 cells from each sample were plated into 96-well ELISpot plates in duplicate in the presence of peptides representing H-2Kb immunodominant epitopes at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The naive samples consisted of pools from 2 mice. The frequency of IFNγ-secreting cells was determined using a Mouse IFN-γ Single-Color ELISpot kit (Cellular Technology Limited, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The frequency of cytokine-secreting cells was quantified with an ImmunoSpot S6 Ultimate reader and analyzed with ImmunoSpot software (Cellular Technology Limited, Germany). The following Db-restricted antigens were used for the stimulation:influenza PR8-derived peptide: NP366–374 ASNENMETMSARS-CoV-2-derived peptide: Spike 539-546 VNFNFNGLFor all assays, antigen-free cells supplemented with medium were used as a negative control.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayNunc MaxiSorp enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were coated with PR8 virus (whole virus, sucrose purified) in carbonate/bicarbonate solution (Sigma, Israel Cat. C3041) at 4 °C overnight. Plates were blocked with TSTA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6 + 140 mM NaCl + 0.05% Tween 20 + 2% BSA) for 60 min at 37 °C. Following blocking and washing with PBST buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20), the plates were incubated with a naive or PR8 preimmune mouse serum diluted from 1:400 to 1:52,800 for 1 h at 37 °C. Following washing, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used (diluted 1:1000) as a secondary antibody (Sigma, Israel, cat. A5153). P-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma, Israel, cat. N2770) was added after washing, and the optical density was measured (SpectraMax 190 microplate reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, O.D. at 405 nm) after 60 min of incubation at room temperature. The anti-PR8 IgG values were determined by subtracting twice the value of the control (sera from naive mice) from the examined sample.In vivo T cell depletionRat anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5, ATCC TIB-207) and CD8 (clone 2.43, ATCC TIB-210) antibodies were produced and purified in our laboratory. Anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies were administered (200 µg per i.p. injection) to K18-hACE2 mice 1 day (−1 day) before viral infection and every 2–3 days during the first 12 days of the experiment. The CD4 or CD8 depletion was verified by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 7).Flow cytometrySplenocytes were collected as described for the ELISpot assay. The cells were stained with Aqua Live/Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher, L34966), blocked with an anti-CD16/32 FcγR antibody for 15 min and subsequently stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies for 30 min. The following antibodies from e-Bioscience (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used: PE anti-CD3ε (clone 145-2C11, diluted 1:200), Alexa Fluor 700 anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5, diluted 1:800), and APC anti-CD8 (clone 56–6.7, diluted 1:800). All washing procedures were performed using flow buffer composed of PBS, 2% FBS and 0.05% NaN3. The samples were collected using a Fortessa Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar).Passive immunizationSix to eight week-old female K18-hACE2 mice were immunized against IAV by i.m. injection of PR8 (106 PFU/mouse). Four weeks later, sera were collected and pooled, and the levels of anti-PR8 IgG antibodies in the anti-IAV sera were determined. The sera were administered (i.p. 200 µl/mouse) 1 day prior to infection with IAV. Mice were coinfected as described above.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

That’s the word from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC reports the percent of outpatient visits for respiratory illness has trended upward. “The numbers are increasing, and I expect us to have a usual flu season this year,” Dr. William Sistrunk, infectious diseases physician at Mercy Hospital Springfield, told KY3 News in Springfield, Mo. “We can’t compare to last year, because we did not have a flu season at all.” The success of nearly quashing the flu in the most recent season, however, could now have the effect of wreaking havoc among the unvaccinated. Dr. Farrin Manian, infectious disease specialist at Mercy Hospital St. Louis, tells the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “If there’s a lot of influenza in a community, and we are exposed to it, our immune system can build up some ammunition, and that can spill over to next year’s flu season as well. But last year, we didn’t have that, so the main concern people have is that since our immune system didn’t see much influenza, then it’s possible that it’s not going to be as robust for this year’s influenza regardless of what strain it might be.” Dr. Sistrunk says he expects the influenza season this year to peak in December or January, so now’s the time to get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already – and it’s possible to get both the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines on the same day. “The symptoms of flu are very similar to COVID-19,” said Dr. Sistrunk. “So it’s important to differentiate exactly what virus you have if you have symptoms so you can be appropriately treated.” Dr. Aamina Akhtar, an infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer at Mercy Hospital South, strongly advises people take no chances. "There are several things we can do to protect ourselves from the flu, but flu shots are the first line of defense,” Dr. Akhtar said. “They're not perfect, but they do offer proven protection and can lessen the effects of the flu virus if you do catch it.” Dr. Akhtar added flu shots are especially important for vulnerable people, such as anyone with a chronic health condition, the elderly and children. Children often aren't as diligent at washing their hands, covering their coughs and other steps to prevent spreading the flu virus, which makes giving them their flu shot extra beneficial. “In addition, it’s important for people to understand that a COVID vaccine will not protect against the flu, and vice versa,” said Dr. Paul Bean, a hospitalist and chief of medical affairs at Mercy Hospital Fort Smith. Each vaccine works differently, and he encourages those who have not received their COVID vaccinations to do so ahead of the impending flu season. “Getting influenza and COVID at the same time will be catastrophic for some patients and would likely make any one disease much more severe,” Dr. Bean said. The CDC, along with the Food and Drug Administration, agree that it’s OK to receive flu and COVID vaccines (including a booster) at the same time, which may be easier and more convenient for many people. Likewise, it’s fine to space them out. Flu and COVID symptoms are similar. Cough, muscle aches, fatigue, fever, sore throat and runny nose often are present in both. A loss of taste or smell is common with COVID. If someone is experiencing any of the above symptoms, they should contact their primary care physician. The viruses are spread in similar ways, so continued masking, social distancing and frequent hand washing can help prevent the spread of both. “Masking will help reduce flu transmission like it did last year,” Dr. Bean added. “I’ve heard some patients say they’ve never gotten a flu shot before, so why get one now?” Dr. Akhtar said. “The simple answer: COVID. The Delta variant has been aggressive and that, in addition to flu, could really lay people low. There’s no reason to take the risk. We’ve seen too many people die this past year. Our bodies can only take so much. Our immune systems need as much help as they can get. It’s imperative to get a flu shot this year, along with your COVID vaccine, if you haven’t already gotten them.” Learn more about flu vaccines here and COVID vaccines here. Mercy 14528 S.

This may result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, and lead to further transmission in the community. We aimed to derive early predictors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue. The study comprised 126 patients with COVID-19, 171 with influenza and 180 with dengue, who presented within 5 days of symptom onset. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests. We used logistic regression models to identify demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers in classifying COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 versus dengue. The performance of each model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Shortness of breath was the strongest predictor in the models for differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza, followed by diarrhoea. Higher lymphocyte count was predictive of COVID-19 versus influenza and versus dengue. In the model for differentiating between COVID-19 and dengue, patients with cough and higher platelet count were at increased odds of COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomitingausea were indicative of dengue. The cross-validated area under the ROC curve for all four models was above 0.85. Clinical features and simple laboratory markers for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza and dengue are identified in this study which can be used by primary care physicians in resource limited settings to determine if further investigations or referrals would be required.

Caused by a novel human coronavirus now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has since spread rapidly on a global scale. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic, and expressed deep concern about the alarming levels of spread and severity2. Confirmation of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection requires detection of the virus in respiratory samples by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients ranges from asymptomatic to mild non-specific acute symptoms such as fever, dry cough and fatigue3. Close to 20% of COVID-19 cases may be severe4.Influenza is prevalent globally and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality from respiratory viral infections5 while dengue is prevalent in tropical countries with geographic expansion6. Dengue is also known as not only the leading cause of fever in returning travelers in non-endemic countries, but also the main source for triggering autochthonous transmissions7,8. Since clinical presentations of these common viral infections are non-specific, it is difficult for primary care physicians to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue. This may result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, and lead to further transmission in the community. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, doctors in both dengue endemic9,10,11 and non-endemic countries where influenza may be the most relevant differential diagnosis for COVID-195,12, should maintain a high level of suspicion and be provided with effective tools to differentiate these three infections.Singapore is a tropical city state with several endemic viral infections. Influenza circulates year round with bimodal peaks typically observed in April-July and November-January13. Dengue epidemics of increasing magnitude have occurred in a five- to six-year cycle affecting more adults than children14. As of 15 June 2020, a total of 40,818 cases of the COVID-19 including 26 deaths have been reported in Singapore15. It is of concern that two local cases of COVID-19 with false positive dengue serology were reported in Singapore without travel or contact history16.In this study, we compared clinical presentations and laboratory parameters of patients with COVID-19, influenza and dengue. We constructed predictive models using logistic regression with the aim to assist doctors in differentiating COVID-19 from influenza and dengue based on clinical features and simple laboratory investigations to determine if further investigations or referrals would be required.MethodsCohort descriptionOur study population comprised laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from an ongoing prospective cohort, and influenza and dengue patients from previous studies. Briefly, prospective recruitment of COVID-19 patients took place from January to April 2020 at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which is a purpose-built facility designed to strengthen Singapore’s capabilities in infectious disease management3. All COVID-19 suspect cases, i.e., clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness or acute respiratory illness of any severity, were sent to NCID and other hospitals via dedicated ambulances for testing and isolation during the study period.Influenza patients were selected from a retrospective study of those who presented at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), the primary centre for screening, treatment and isolation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases from April to June 2009 in Singapore17. Dengue patients were selected from a prospective cohort study where adult patients presented with acute undifferentiated febrile illness to TTSH from January 2010 to September 201218.Data collection and confirmatory testingAt first presentation to the hospital, demographic data, symptoms and signs were collected. Full blood count, renal and liver function tests were performed. SARS-CoV-2, influenza and dengue viruses were detected in respiratory samples or venous blood by RT-PCR tests3,17,18. Data of 215 patients with COVID-19 (all with wild-type strain), 200 with H1N1(pdm09) or seasonal influenza, and 300 with dengue (predominantly dengue virus serotype 2) were extracted. As our objective was to derive early predictors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue, we analysed only symptomatic patients who presented to hospital within 5 days after symptom onset.Ethics considerationThe study procedures were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (NHG DSRB), Singapore approved the studies (A Multi-centred Prospective Study to Detect Novel Pathogens and Characterize Emerging Infections (E/12/917), Prospective adult dengue study (E/09/432) and Characterization of influenza in local setting including novel influenza A 2009 cases (E/09/344)). Data for COVID-19 patients were collected with waiver of informed consent granted by MOH under the Infectious Diseases Act as part of COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Research samples and data for the prospective COVID-19 and dengue cohort studies were collected with written informed consent approved by NHG DSRB. Data from influenza patients were collected with waiver of informed consent approved by NHG DSRB as stated earlier.Statistical analysisFisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables and Mann–Whitney U test to compare continuous variables between any two groups. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was taken as P < 0.05.We used multivariable logistic regression models as predictive tools to differentiate between COVID-19 and influenza, and COVID-19 and dengue. We followed the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) 2015 guideline19.Two multivariable models were fitted for differentiating COVID-19 versus influenza (flu models 1 and 2) and COVID-19 versus dengue (dengue models 1 and 2): flu model 1 and dengue model 1 contained demographics and symptoms, whereas flu model 2 and dengue model 2 included laboratory parameters in addition to demographics and symptoms.For the analysis on COVID-19 versus influenza, the proportion of missing data for laboratory parameters ranged from 3.4% (10 out of total 297 observations) for WBC count, haemoglobin, platelet, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count, to 28.3% (84 observations) for albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The variables for flu models 1 and 2 were selected through stepwise use of Akaike’s information criterion. Multicollinearity was then checked using variance inflation factor (VIF) for the final predictor variables included in these 2 multivariable models, which ranged from 1.01 to 1.25.For the analysis on COVID-19 versus dengue, the proportion of missing data for laboratory parameters ranged from 3.3% (10 out of total 306 observations) for WBC count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet, neutrophil count and lymphocyte count, to 9.2% (28 observations) for AST. As the data for differentiating COVID-19 versus dengue exhibited separation, finite estimates of adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and Wald confidence intervals (CI) could not be obtained. Hence, we applied Firth’s modified score procedure to estimate OR and derived CI using the profile-penalized likelihood function20. The variables in dengue models 1 and 2 were selected by backward stepwise approach using penalized likelihood ratio tests. The VIF for the final predictor variables ranged from 1.01 to 1.23 for dengue model 1, and it ranged from 1.31 to 3.67 in dengue model 2 when laboratory parameters were included.We assessed the predictive performance of the multivariable logistic regression models using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the ROC (AUC). As the evaluation of the predictive performance of a set of independent variables using the original sample may yield an overly optimistic estimate of how the results would generalize to an independent set of data, we applied a tenfold cross-validation to obtain a more realistic estimate of AUC for each model.ResultsThis study comprised 126 patients with COVID-19, 171 with influenza and 180 with dengue, who presented within 5 days after symptom onset. The demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The median age of COVID-19 patients was older compared with influenza and dengue patients. A lower proportion of COVID-19 patients were male compared with dengue patients. The proportion of COVID-19 patients having comorbidities was higher compared with dengue patients but not with influenza patients.Table 1 Demographics of COVID-19, influenza and dengue patients.Full size tableThe clinical features of patients with COVID-19, influenza and dengue at presentation are shown in Table 2. Shortness of breath and diarrhoea were more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients, while fever, cough, running nose and sore throat were less common. Cough, shortness of breath, running nose and sore throat were more common in COVID-19 patients than in dengue patients. A lower proportion of COVID-19 patients had fever, diarrhoea, muscle aches, fatigue/malaise, abdominal pain, bleeding, conjunctivitis, headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomitingausea compared with dengue patients. We also provided an infographic of percentage of COVID-19, influenza and dengue patients with each symptom at presentation. It can be seen that COVID-19 and influenza patients have similar symptoms, while dengue patients present with symptoms that are significantly different from the other two groups (See Supplementary Table S1).Table 2 Clinical features at presentation of COVID-19, influenza and dengue patients.Full size tableThe vital signs and laboratory parameters of patients with COVID-19, influenza and dengue are shown in Table 3. COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and creatinine compared with influenza patients whereas their lymphocyte count and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were higher. WBC, platelet, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and albumin were higher in COVID-19 patients than dengue patients. The levels of haemoglobin, haematocrit, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine were lower in COVID-19 patients than dengue patients.Table 3 Vital signs and laboratory parameters of COVID-19, influenza and dengue patients.Full size tableThe multivariable logistic regressions differentiating COVID-19 from influenza are shown in Fig. 1. In flu model 1 containing demographics and symptoms, older age (aOR 1.09; 95% CI 1.07–1.12), shortness of breath (aOR 18.29; 95% CI 2.28–411.81) and diarrhoea (aOR 13.70; 95% CI 2.33–128.89) increased the odds that the patient had COVID-19, while fever, cough, running nose and vomitingauseas were indicative of influenza. In flu model 2 containing demographics, symptoms and laboratory parameters, older age (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.07–1.13), shortness of breath (aOR 50.66; 95% CI 3.09–1391.20), diarrhoea ((aOR 8.59; 95% CI 1.67–67.62) and higher lymphocyte count (aOR 1.93; 95% CI 1.09–3.46) were predictive of COVID-19, while cough, running nose and lower neutrophil count were indicative of influenza.Figure 1Final covariates in multivariable logistic regression for differentiating COVID-19 versus influenza: (A) model 1 on demographics and symptoms, (B) model 2 on demographics, symptoms and laboratory Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)l for having COVID-19 are shown on log10 scale.Full size imageFigure 2 shows the multivariable logistic regression analysis differentiating COVID-19 versus dengue.

In dengue model 2 containing demographics, symptoms and laboratory parameters, patients who had cough (aOR 51.48; 95% CI 4.47–4,662.18), higher platelet count (aOR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.09) and higher lymphocyte count (aOR 213.28; 95% CI 9.65–98,867.53) were at increased odds of COVID-19, while cough, headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomitingauseas were indicative of dengue.Figure 2Final covariates in multivariable logistic regression for differentiating COVID-19 versus dengue: (A) model 1 on demographics and symptoms, (B) model 2 on demographics, symptoms and laboratory parameters.

The cross-validated AUC of dengue model 1 without laboratory parameters and of dengue model 2 which included laboratory parameters for differentiating COVID-19 versus dengue were 0.995 (95% CI 0.989–1.000) and 0.997 (95% CI 0.993–1.000) respectively (Fig. 4).Figure 3Receiver operating characteristic curves with cross-validation for flu model 1 (demographics and symptoms) and model 2 (demographics, symptoms and laboratory parameters) for differentiating COVID-19 versus influenza.Full size imageFigure 4Receiver operating characteristic curves with cross-validation for dengue model 1 (demographics and symptoms) and model 2 (demographics, symptoms and laboratory parameters) for differentiating COVID-19 versus dengue.Full size imageDiscussionEarly identification of COVID-19 suspected cases is critical for effective surveillance and successful containment of disease spread. Cases who are not diagnosed correctly and in a timely manner may lead to further transmission of the virus21. It is imperative to make available a rapid, sensitive, and affordable point-of-care screening test in the primary care setting for early detection of COVID-1922. There is possible cross-reactivity between dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which can lead to false-positive dengue serology among COVID-19 patients and vice versa because of possible similarities between SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in the HR2-domain of the spike-protein and the dengue envelope-protein23. In September 2020, the WHO published an interim guidance on the use of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in countries or areas that are experiencing widespread community transmission, where the health system may be over-burdened, and where it may not be possible to test all or any suspect cases by RT-PCR tests. It is recommended to use the Ag-RDT for the suspected symptomatic cases unless the person is a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case24. To ensure that suspected cases are detected as early as possible, primary care physicians who serve as the first point of contact in the healthcare system need a reliable predictive tool to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral infections such as influenza and dengue at first presentation.In this study, we built logistic regression models using clinical features and simple laboratory investigations to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue (Figs. 1 and 2). In view of the lower sensitivity of flu model 1 when only symptoms were considered for differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza (Fig. 3), it is important to consider full blood count for further assessment where appropriate. Our study revealed that shortness of breath was the most important symptom for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza. Patients with cough and higher platelet count were more likely to have COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomitingausea were indicative of dengue. These clinical features and simple laboratory parameters can serve as a guide for preliminary screening especially for primary care physicians in Singapore and other tropical countries where dengue is endemic and influenza virus circulates all-year round.Decision algorithms for differentiating dengue, influenza and other febrile illnesses have been reported before25. There were a few studies on prediction models for diagnosis of COVID-19, however, these included measurement of cytokines, computed tomography scan or genome sequencing26. Sun et al. had come up with algorithms for estimating the risk of COVID-19 among patients who presented to NCID for SARS-CoV-2 testing, which included a subset of the same cohort of COVID-19 cases in our study, but the duration of symptom onset was not taken into consideration and controls included all SARS-CoV-2 negative patients regardless of final diagnosis27. In the study by Sun et al., the AUC of the logistic regression model that predicted COVID-19 was 0.65 when only demographics and clinical variables were considered, whereas the models with laboratory and exposure-risk variables included had higher AUCs of 0.88 to 0.9127.As our study relied on simple parameters to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue, the predictors identified from the multivariable logistic regression models may guide primary care physicians, who serve as the first point of contact with the healthcare system, in deciding who should be tested with RT-PCR tests or Ag-RDTs especially in the absence of travel history to high-risk countries and epidemiological links16. In countries and remote regions where confirmatory diagnostic capabilities are limited28, clinical features and simple laboratory parameters identified in this study may be used as one of the criteria for isolation of suspected cases to prevent further transmission arising from prolonged delay from symptom onset to isolation29.There are a few limitations in our study. We included patients who presented to hospital within 5 days of symptom onset, hence the findings may not be applicable to those presented late for medical care. Patients who were not suspected or sufficiently ill to be referred to hospitals were excluded. The patients in our study were recruited in three different periods as it was not feasible to recruit influenza and dengue patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020; (i) there was a drastic decline in influenza activity and (ii) non-COVID-19 related research activities were put on hold to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission. There may be differences in clinical features and laboratory parameters at presentation due to the predominant strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus among COVID-19 patients, virus serotypes among dengue patients, and virus strains among influenza patients circulating at different time points. Few COVID-19 cases co-infected with dengue had been reported thus far in Singapore, Thailand and French island of Mayotte30,31,32. Case series of pneumonia patients co-infected with COVID-19 and influenza were also reported in China33. In Singapore, after the implementation of public health measures for COVID-19, a marked decline in influenza activity had been reported34. There is an urgent need for clinical, epidemiological and laboratory studies to be undertaken to better understand the interactions between COVID-19, influenza and dengue.In conclusion, we have shown that multivariable models based on clinical features and simple laboratory markers for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza and dengue, which possess good predictive performance can serve as a useful tool for primary care physicians to determine if further investigations or referrals would be required. The findings from our study would need to be further validated, so as to address the knowledge gaps of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

But with schools and businesses reopened, international travel resuming and far less masking, there’s no way to predict how bad a flu season the U.S. might expect this winter.But officials are worried because a different respiratory virus, named RSV, that usually attacks young children in the winter instead roared back last summer as soon as people started dropping their masks.“Is that a harbinger of a worse influenza season? We don’t know, but we certainly don’t want a ‘twindemic,’ both Covid and influenza,” said Dr. William Schaffner of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.And if you still need a Covid-19 vaccination — either first shots or a booster dose — you can get it at the same visit as a flu shot.The CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccination for just about everyone starting with 6-month-old babies. Influenza is especially dangerous for older adults, children under age 5, people with chronic health problems such as diabetes, asthma or heart disease, and during pregnancy.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicLast fall, about as many Americans overall got their flu vaccination as they did before the pandemic — about half of the eligible population, according to CDC data released Thursday. But Walensky was dismayed by a slight drop in child flu vaccinations last year — and at widening racial and ethnic disparities. Last year, 43 percent of Black Americans and 45 percent of Hispanics got a flu vaccination compared to 56 percent of whites.The CDC expects vaccine makers to deliver 188 million to 200 million doses of flu vaccine. Most Americans with insurance can get one without a co-pay. Options include regular shots, shots that aim to give older adults a little extra protection, and a nasal spray. All offer protection against four different flu strains that global experts predict are the kinds most likely to spread this year.At the same time they get vaccinated against flu, officials also urged older adults and people with chronic illnesses to ask about getting a vaccine against a type of pneumonia that is a frequent complication.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.The Associated PressThe Associated PressAboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoFlu season paired with COVID-19 presents the threat of a ‘twindemic,’ making the need for vaccination all the more urgent Menu Close Home Edition Africa Australia Brasil Canada Canada (français) España Europe France Global Indonesia New Zealand United Kingdom United States Edition: Available editions Global Africa Australia Brasil Canada Canada (français) España Europe France Indonesia New Zealand United Kingdom United States Get newsletter Become an author Sign up as a reader Sign in Search Academic rigour, journalistic flair A bad flu year on top of the pandemic could mean trouble for already-stressed hospitals.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As winter looms and hospitals across the U.S. continue to be deluged with severe cases of COVID-19, flu season presents a particularly ominous threat this year. We are researchers with expertise in vaccination policy and mathematical modeling of infectious disease. Our group, the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, has been modeling influenza for over a decade. One of us has been a member of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the CDC’s Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network. Our recent modeling work suggests that last year’s tamped-down influenza season could lead to a surge in flu cases this coming season. Anti-COVID-19 strategies reduced flu too As a result of the numerous measures put in place in 2020 to curb transmission of COVID-19 – including limiting travel, wearing masks, social distancing, closing schools and other strategies – the U.S. saw a dramatic decrease in influenza and other infectious diseases during the last flu season. Flu-related deaths in kids dropped from nearly 200 in the 2019-2020 season to one in the 2020-2021 season. Overall, the 2020-2021 flu season had one of the lowest recorded number of cases in recent U.S. history. While flu reduction is a good thing, it could mean that the flu will hit harder than normal this winter. This is because much of the natural immunity that people develop to disease comes from the spread of that disease through a population. Many other respiratory viruses demonstrated a similar drop during the pandemic, and some of those, including interseasonal respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, have increased dramatically as schools have reopened and social distancing, masking and other measures have declined. Deciphering viral transmission Immunity to influenza involves multiple factors. Influenza is caused by several strains of an RNA virus that mutate at various rates each year, in a manner not unlike the mutations that are occurring in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The level of a person’s existing immunity to the current year’s strain of flu depends on several variables. They include how similar the current strain is to the one that a child was first exposed to, whether circulating strains are similar to previously experienced strains and how recent those influenza infections were, if they occurred. And of course human interactions, such as children crowding together in classrooms or people attending large gatherings – as well as the use of protective measures like wearing a mask – all affect whether a virus is transmitted between people. There are also variables due to vaccination. Population immunity from vaccination depends on the proportion of people who get the flu vaccine in a given season and how effective - or well matched - that vaccine is against the circulating influenza strains. Health care workers treat a 45-year-old unvaccinated COVID-19 patient at a medical center in Tarzana, Calif. The ongoing pandemic, coupled with the looming flu season, could trigger what doctors call a ‘twindemic.’ APU GOMES/AFP via Getty Images No precedent exists for a ‘twindemic’ Given the limited spread of influenza in the general U.S. population last year, our research suggests that the U.S. could see a large epidemic of flu this season. Paired with the existing threat of the highly infectious delta variant, this could result in a dangerous combination of infectious diseases, or a “twindemic.” Models of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases have been at the forefront of predictions about the COVID-19 pandemic, and have often proved to be predictive of cases, hospitalizations and death. But there are no historical examples of this type of dual and simultaneous epidemics. As a result, traditional epidemiological and statistical methods are not well suited to project what may occur this season. Therefore, models that incorporate the mechanisms of how a virus spreads are better able to make predictions. We used two separate methods to forecast the potential impact from last year’s decrease in influenza cases on the current 2021-2022 flu season. In recent research of ours that has not yet been peer-reviewed, we applied a modeling system that simulates an actual population’s interactions at home and work, and in school and neighborhood settings. This model predicts that the U.S. could see a big spike in flu cases this season. In another preliminary study, we used a traditional infectious disease modeling tool that divides the population into people who are susceptible to infection, those infected, those recovered and those who have been hospitalized or have died. Based on our mathematical model, we predict that the U.S. could see as many as 102,000 additional hospitalizations above the hundreds of thousands that typically occur during flu season. Those numbers assume that there is no change from the usual flu vaccine uptake and effectiveness starting this fall and lasting through the flu season. Individual behaviors and vaccination matter A typical flu season usually produces 30 million to 40 million cases of symptomatic disease, between 400,000 and 800,000 hospitalizations and from 20,000 to 50,000 deaths. This prospect, paired with the ongoing battle against COVID-19, raises the possibility of a twindemic overwhelming the health care system as hospitals and ICUs in some parts of the country overflow with critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our research also highlighted how young children could be particularly at risk since they have lower exposure to previous seasons of influenza and thus haven’t yet developed broad immunity, compared with adults. In addition to the burden on children, childhood influenza is an important driver of influenza in the elderly as kids pass it on to grandparents and other elderly people. However, there is reason for optimism, since people’s behaviors can change these outcomes considerably. For instance, our simulation study incorporated people of all ages and found that increasing vaccination among children has the potential to cut infections in children by half. And we found that if only 25% more people than usual are vaccinated against influenza this year, that would be sufficient to reduce the infection rate to normal seasonal influenza levels. Across the U.S., there is a lot of variability in vaccination rates, adherence to social distancing recommendations and mask-wearing. So it is likely that the flu season will experience substantial variation state to state, just as we have seen with patterns of COVID-19 infection. All of this data suggests that although vaccination against influenza is important every year, it is of utmost importance this year to prevent a dramatic rise in influenza cases and to keep U.S. hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.

That could spell trouble during COVID.Ryan W. Miller | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Health experts urge vaccine as flu season nearsMasking and other precautions against the coronavirus had an added bonus last winter as flu cases dropped to historically low levels. But with schools and businesses reopened, travel resuming and far less masking, flu could make a comeback. (Sept. 30)APMore than 4 in 10 Americans aren't sure about or aren't planning on getting a flu shot this year, a new survey found, in a worrying trend public health experts say could exacerbate a worse-than-average flu season.Last year's worries around a "twindemic" of influenza and COVID-19 overwhelming hospitals around the nation luckily went unfounded after a historically mild flu season.But with COVID-19 vaccinations affording many people a return to more "normal" lives of socialization and in-person work during flu season, hospitals and health systems could be strained in parts of the country where vaccination against both viruses remains low, doctors say."We're particularly concerned because COIVD is out there," said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. "Flu will come back this year. And we don't want to further stress our already very stressed health care system."And while COVID-19 cases are declining nationally, there are parts of the country "where a large proportion of the population is undervaccinated against COVID," Schaffner said. "COVID is going to remain active in those parts of the country. And then if you add influenza to that, I think in parts of the country, we could have a tough winter."'We face the same threat this year': Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 casesA survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults commissioned by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases found that while more than 60% of Americans agreed the flu shot was the best way to prevent flu deaths and hospitalizations, 44% said they were unsure about or not planning to get a flu vaccine this year.The causes of flu vaccine hesitancy may be less political than the divides driving COVID-19 vaccine skepticism, Schaffner said. They're a yearly practice, and unlike vaccines for polio or measles, which have virtually eradicated those diseases in the United States, the flu sticks around.The top reason cited for flu vaccine hesitancy by surveyed adults was that it doesn't work very well.Schaffner said while the flu vaccine is by no means perfect, it still provides significant protection against hospitalization and death."It would be great if we had a vaccine that was even more effective than what we have," said Dr. Thomas Holland, an infectious diseases specialist at Duke University Hospital. "But the fact remains that the most effective way, the best tool that we have to prevent influenza infections and hospitalizations and deaths is still the annual vaccine."Everything you need to know about flu shots: When should I get one? What about the COVID booster?Survey respondents also said they wouldn't get a flu shot because they never get the flu, were worried about side effects, did not consider flu to be a serious illness, or were worried about getting flu from the vaccine.The flu vaccine cannot give people the flu, and side effects indicate a proper immune response in the body. It also can be received at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Holland said about half of Americans get a flu shot in a typical year. But immunity wanes much more quickly compared with COVID-19 vaccines, and flu viruses change yearly, requiring annual shots. However, with so few people exposed to the influenza virus last season, people won't have the potential added defense against illness that natural immunity can bring, he said.The 2020-2021 flu season was practically nonexistent. Public health and clinical laboratories reported 2,038 flu cases during the season from Sept. 27, 2020, to April 24, according to the CDC. Schaffner said much of that decline was due to social distancing and mask-wearing practiced around the country to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With many of those restrictions eased, Schaffner expects flu to return.The return of many children to classrooms poses a significant threat of transmission, he added, given children shed flu virus much more and for longer periods than adults.Got the sniffles? Colds are rushing back. Here's how to tell if it's COVID-19.One potential benefit of the pandemic has been an increased willingness of people to stay home when sick rather than powering through an illness and potentially spreading it to others, Holland said.The survey found 45% of Americans said they were more likely to stay home from work or school when ill because of the pandemic. A majority also said they would wear a mask at least sometimes during this flu season.To boost vaccination numbers, Schaffner said physicians need to make the flu shot a priority in their messaging. Often, it is an afterthought at the end of a visit."Health care providers of all kinds have to be not just influenza vaccine recommenders, they have to be influenza vaccine insisters," Schaffner said.Contributing: Adrianna Rodriguez Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 20243 steps to prepare your herd for influenza season, By Micah Jansen, DVM, veterinary manager at Zoetis Pork. - Swineweb.com - Complete Swine News, Markets, Commentary, and Technical Info Facebook Linkedin Mail Twitter Newsroom Topics Animal Health Insights AG-Finance Ag-Tech Sponsored By SwineTech Biosecurity Solutions Canada Eastern Canada Pork Producers Page Western Canada Pork Producers Page Facilities & Equipment Feed Packer & Processing Podcasts Swine Genetics Technical Research & Papers United States Illinois Pork Producers Page Indiana Pork Producers Page Iowa Pork Producers Page Minnesota Pork Producers Page Nebraska Pork Producers Page Ohio Pork Producers Page Veterinary Expertise Opinions Markets Sponsored By CIH Swine TV Product Features People & Profiles Industry Perspectives Search Media Partners Swine Hall Of Fame Media Coverage Hall of Fame Swine Web App About Professional Services Dairy Beef Poultry Canada – default Media Partners Swine Hall Of Fame Media Coverage Hall of Fame Swine Web App About Professional Services Dairy Beef Poultry FacebookLinkedinMailTwitter Canada – default Newsroom Topics Animal Health Insights AG-Finance Ag-Tech Sponsored By SwineTech Biosecurity Solutions Canada Eastern Canada Pork Producers Page Western Canada Pork Producers Page Facilities & Equipment Feed Packer & Processing Podcasts Swine Genetics Technical Research & Papers United States Illinois Pork Producers Page Indiana Pork Producers Page Iowa Pork Producers Page Minnesota Pork Producers Page Nebraska Pork Producers Page Ohio Pork Producers Page Veterinary Expertise Opinions Markets Sponsored By CIH Swine TV Product Features People & Profiles Industry Perspectives Elanco Animal Health PigTek Connections October 2024 PigCentral™ Management System from PigTek Search Home Illinois Swine Commentaries 3 steps to prepare your herd for influenza season, By Micah Jansen,...

By Jim Eadie - October 4, 2021 FacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedinReddItEmailPrintTumblrTelegramMixVKDiggLINEViber Source: PigHealthToday.com Pigs can contract influenza anytime during the year but more influenza circulates in the fall and winter months. That’s why producers should prepare ahead of the traditional flu season, according to Micah Jansen, DVM, veterinary manager at Zoetis Pork. Here, she shares her top three management strategies for producers and veterinarians to give herds the best chance of being protected against the virus this fall: Step 1. Determine the herd’s present status “Do we already have flu circulating in the herd? If so, that’s probably already causing problems on its own,” Jansen said. “Knowing what’s present in your herd will help you identify what interventions to put in place.” Step 2. Look for new introductions If there is increasing circulation of virus in the region, a new introduction of a different strain is possible, Jansen explained . “During the active flu season, we might see new strains coming in. And if we have more than one strain present within a herd, there is the potential for reassortment to occur. That could allow the flu virus to evade the pig’s immune system because it’s creating a new strain of influenza,” she said. If clinical signs like coughing are evident, producers and their veterinarians need to step up surveillance and increase monitoring, Jansen added. These situations should be investigated in case of a new introduction of flu. Step 3. Protect the sow herd Vaccine use within the sow herd is extremely important, Jansen stressed. “Whether you’re using autogenous or commercial vaccines, whether you’re administering it pre-farrow or whole-herd, vaccinating sows for influenza will result in lower prevalence of positive pigs at weaning,” she said. “The side benefit is that if there is a new introduction of an influenza strain after the vaccine has been administered, we can see a reduction in clinical signs,” she added. Vaccination creates a benefit to the sow herd from a respiratory health standpoint, as well as in terms of reproductive performance. “When sows are not having to take a hit from the flu virus, there’s less reduction of reproductive performance as well,” Jansen said.

We Asked Three Experts. By Julia Craven Oct 04, 20214:10 PM It’s flu shot season. Seth Herald/Getty Images Tweet Share Share Comment Tweet Share Share Comment Last week, I got my annual flu shot. I can’t remember a year when I’ve experienced any of the known side effects of the flu vaccine. Typically, I get my shot and I go about my business. But this time was different. I was fatigued and had noticeable arm pain for about three days afterward. It turns out, I was not alone. After seeing anecdotal evidence of what Atlantic writer Amanda Mull called an “extra spicy” shot, I called three infectious disease doctors to ask them if there really are more intense reactions this year. Their responses have been edited and condensed for clarity. Julia Craven: Is the flu shot “worse,” meaning people might experience stronger side effects, this year? Advertisement Arnold Monto, an epidemiology professor at the University of Michigan: People are sensitized to side effects because they received COVID vaccines, which are known to produce side effects. They’re more likely to be looking for or perceiving something as side effects that they wouldn’t have bothered to [notice] before. A reasonable percentage of people get a sore arm [from the flu vaccine], but beyond that, the percentage of people who have any kind of side effect is quite low. That data really doesn’t fluctuate from year to year. All the flu vaccines are quadrivalent this year, meaning that they contain four strains of the influenza virus. How could this affect symptoms? Nasia Safdar, the medical director for infection prevention at the University of Wisconsin Hospital: It really shouldn’t. Quadrivalent vaccines have been available and most of us have been getting those for years. There is a high dose flu vaccine that is recommended for people who are older, and the arm tenderness might be a little bit more and it takes a little bit longer to recover. Advertisement William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center: The entire influenza vaccine manufacturing industry has been moving toward quadrivalent vaccines for a decade. And this year, everybody is there in all their formulations. That’s great since every vaccine will protect against four strains of the influenza virus. Quad is associated with about the same array of side effects as the older trivalent vaccine. Still, I’m very curious about this and look forward to getting more data as the vaccination season rolls out. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Could the side effects some people report feeling be more robust because many of us have avoided being sick for 18 plus months? Safdar: I haven’t seen any data to support that. Advertisement Schaffner: The answer is we just don’t know because we haven’t had a precedent for this. There’s also speculation wondering, once the flu virus starts up again, will it cause more extensive disease because we have been less experienced with influenza through the last season. Again, there’s no clear indication that’s the case, but it’s an interesting question. And I’m afraid the answer to it is we’ll have to wait and see. Are there any concerns that this flu season will be worse? Safdar: We are concerned that it could be worse because earlier this year and last year we didn’t have much of a flu season at all—probably because schools were not in person and everybody was masking and staying home. There was that lost opportunity to develop immunity, which happens every year, and so this year, yes, it may well be worse. Advertisement Monto: Many people have speculated that since we didn’t really have a flu season last year, that this current winter may be a catch-up season. But that is only a hypothesis. One thing I think we can say reasonably confidently is that if we do see a flu season, it’s not going to be early. If we were going to see an early flu season starting around Thanksgiving, we would see the beginning of it all happening now. When should people get the flu shot this year? Safdar: Earlier is better. September and October are good times. It takes two weeks for your body to generate antibodies after the vaccine so you don’t want to leave it until too late. Sometimes people think they should wait until they see evidence of influenza circulating and that’s probably too late.

It Could Be Steering Patients Wrong. The Future of Safer Tobacco Use Is Here. Why Aren’t Democrats On Board? Why is it important to get the flu shot even if you’re still taking COVID precautions such as masking and not eating indoors? Schaffner: Influenza is this other very nasty respiratory virus that affects people across the age spectrum. It affects older people and people with underlying illnesses of any age. And, each year we have children—including completely healthy children—die of influenza. Anything we can do to prevent that along with easing the impact on the health care system, which is already being impacted by COVID, is great. The most common reason people do not get vaccinated is they don’t think this vaccine is all that good. We recognize that it varies in effectiveness from year to year, depending on the virus and the composition of the vaccine. But most people do not appreciate that even if you get the flu after getting the vaccine, you’re much less likely to have severe disease; it makes your disease milder. You’re less likely to require hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and you’re less likely to die.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print Back to Each Breath Blog Each Breath Blog Back to Each Breath Blog by Editorial Staff | October 5, 2021 Topics: COVID-19 Flu & Cold iframe video Watch Video As flu season sets in, there are a lot of questions surrounding how the flu shot may interact with the COVID-19 vaccine. Though last year saw record-low numbers of flu cases, this year experts believe that it will return and could be severe, mostly due to people returning to normal activities such as work and school. “COVID-19 has been a reminder of the vital importance of lung health. I encourage all Americans, and especially adults with chronic health conditions, to get their flu shot this year and every year.” said American Lung Association Chief Medical Officer Albert Rizzo, M.D. He and Dr. Juanita Mora helped us answer some of the most pressing questions about getting the COVID-19 and flu vaccines.Q: Do I need the flu shot if I have had the COVID-19 vaccine? Will the shots interfere with each other?The flu and COVID-19 are different diseases so you need both vaccines to be protected from each one. A flu shot provides a specific ‘key’ that unlocks a strengthened immune response to protect against influenza. And a COVID-19 vaccine provides a different ‘key’ that also unlocks a strengthened immune response to protect against COVID-19. There is no master key that works for all viruses, so getting vaccinated against both infectious diseases will help keep you healthy. Getting the flu shot will not counteract the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.Q: Can the flu vaccine reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19?We are still learning, but according to a recent study published but The American Journal of Infection Control, patients who received a flu shot were found to have 24% lower odds of testing positive for COVID-19. According to that same study getting the flu vaccine can make your innate immune system more robust- making it stronger to fight COVID-19. This in turn may decrease hospitalizations, emergency department visits and more severe COVID-19 complications such as respiratory failure. In children less than 12 years of age where we don't have an approved COVID-19 vaccine yet, so it is recommended now more than ever that the flu vaccine is prioritized for them this year.Q: Can I get the flu and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time?Not only is it safe to get both vaccines, but getting them at the same time could save you time and money. When you get vaccinated at your healthcare provider’s office, local pharmacy, or other clinic for both, you can take less time off work, from school or away from daily activities.Some people may be concerned about the possible side effects caused by each virus. According to the CDC, history shows that getting multiple shots at the same time should not cause worse side effects. But this does not mean that you will not experience any side effects. For instance, you may experience a fever, headache, body aches and other flu-like symptoms. In addition, soreness at the injection site is common for both vaccines, so it may be wise to get one shot in each arm.“The only individuals I would be concerned about getting both vaccines the same day would be those with history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction to injectable drugs,” Dr. Mora commented. In these cases, consult your allergist and separate vaccines by at least 48 hours.Q: What about the booster shot? Does it differ from the initial COVID-19 vaccine and is it safe to get with the flu vaccine?Recently, the FDA approved a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for people with immune compromising health conditions and for people ages 65 and older. But receiving this third dose should not prevent these groups from getting the flu shot. In fact, these groups are also at high-risk for severe flu complications, so it is important for them to consider getting the flu shot and the third dose of their original COVID vaccine.“Based on studies, current vaccines wean in protection after six months which is why CDC has recommended a booster vaccine six months after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines might soon be approved.” Dr. Mora explained. “Amidst the delta variant - it is very important if you qualify to get your booster as well as your flu shot.”Q: Who should get the flu shot?The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu shot every year. This is because the circulating strains change and your body’s immune protection declines over time. This is especially important for people at high-risk for developing serious complications from influenza including older adults, young children, pregnant women and individuals with chronic medical conditions including lung diseases such as asthma or COPD.Q: Should children get the flu shot? Should they get the COVID-19 vaccine?The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in pediatric visits and pediatric vaccinations. This has left children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, including the flu. Talk to your healthcare provider about keeping or bringing your children up to date with their vaccinations.Q: When is the best time to get the flu shot?In general, it takes about two weeks after getting vaccinated for your body to develop the antibodies to provide protection against the flu. That is why you should get vaccinated before the virus spreads in your community. In the U.S., it is generally recommended that you receive your flu shot before the end of October.

In 2020, experts said that both illnesses circulating at the same time could cause a "twindemic." Luckily, vaccines are available for both illnesses. The coronavirus vaccines are safe and effective, and make it incredibly unlikely that a person will experience severe symptoms of the disease. Flu vaccines can be 40% to 60% effective at preventing illness when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the vaccines, and can help keep patients out of the hospital.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & WellnessFlu season is coming fast and could be miserable, studies warnDr. Natalie Azar, NBC News medical contributor, said now is a good time for people to start considering getting their annual flu vaccine. On TODAY, she answered a few common questions people have about the flu vaccine this year.If flu numbers are low, do you really need to get the shot?"You do. We didn't have a lot of flu last year, so we didn't build up any immunity from the flu last year. So experts are a little bit worried it could be worse for us, for that reason," Azar stressed. She added that getting a flu vaccination cuts down on the amount of flu circulating in a community, which benefits everyone.Who should get the flu vaccine?"The recommendation for most adults is to get it in September, by the end of October," Azar said, adding that people in their third trimester of pregnancy should get the flu shot as early as possible since it will confer antibodies to their child."Children can get it any time," Azar said. Any child over the age of 6 months is eligible for the flu shot. Most children over the age of 2 are also eligible for a nasal spray option.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & Wellness7 common questions about the coronavirus answeredOn Sept. 7, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement saying that "all influenza immunization doses" should be completed by the end of October. Some children may require two doses of the flu vaccine, so parents should keep that in mind when planning."Children aged 6 months to 8 years who are receiving flu vaccine for the first time, who have had only one dose ever prior to July 1, 2021, or whose vaccination status is unknown should be vaccinated as soon as vaccines become available so that they can receive two doses four weeks apart by the end of October," said the statement, which also noted that data does not support "delaying vaccination in children."Dr. Lauren Block, a primary care physician and researcher at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, said that it's important not to forget about the importance of flu shots during the pandemic."With COVID here and taking such a toll in terms of morbidity and mortality, we really have to do everything we can to protect ourselves," Block said. "That includes getting COVID vaccines, but also, don't forget about your annual flu vaccine."ThiBlock said that there is no need to wait for any period of time between receiving the coronavirus vaccine and the flu shot. The AAP statement also allowed for coadministration of the COVID-19 vaccine with the flu vaccine."I've had a lot of patients who have had concerns, saying 'I just got my COVID vaccine,' or 'I'm thinking about going for a booster, does that mean I should wait to get my flu shot?' And the answer is no," Block said. "There's no need to wait the 14 days between the (coronavirus and flu) vaccines. It's fine to schedule your flu shot, and if you have not been vaccinated or was recommended for a third dose of the coronavirus vaccine, to get that as soon as possible as well."What if I or my child have COVID-19?According to the AAP, children who have moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 should not be vaccinated until they have recovered from the illness.Block said that no one should receive the flu shot while symptomatic with COVID-19.RelatedHealth & WellnessHealth & WellnessNew study debunks common myth about getting your flu shot every year"Anyone who has COVID should absolutely wait until they're no longer contagious to really go anywhere, and that includes going to get preventive care," Block said. "It's one thing to go get care if you're sick, but if you're getting preventive health care, the CDC says that it takes at least 10 days since the beginning of symptoms for you to no longer be contagious so as a rule of thumb I usually tell my patients to wait two weeks after starting symptoms."However, there is no need to delay vaccination after you or your child have recovered from COVID-19.Is there anyone who shouldn't get the flu shot?Block said that since influenza vaccines are "dead," or don't contain any live virus, people who are immunocompromised or pregnant can safely take them. If you have an allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine, talk to your doctor.Children under the age of 6 months should not get the flu vaccine. Anyone currently experiencing a fever should not get a flu vaccine until their symptoms stop.What is the "super flu" shot?TODAY's Al Roker commented that since he is over 65, he received a high-dose version of the flu shot. The high-dose flu vaccines are intended to give people 65 and older better protection against the flu."The reason that we do that in older people is because when we get older we are not able to amount as robust an immune response," Azar said.Related: This story was updated on Oct. 7, 2021.Kerry BreenKerry Breen is a reporter and associate editor for TODAY.com, where she reports on health news, pop culture and more.

It's more important than ever to get a flu shot this year, with experts warning of a "twindemic" — a potentially deadly combination of COVID-19 and influenza viruses. While being vaccinated against the flu won't totally protect you from COVID-19, it will help prevent you and others from getting sick, which could save lives and help lessen the burden on our healthcare system.Here's everything you need to know to get your flu shot this year and why it's so vital. Important: A 2021 study found that those who got a flu shot in the previous six months were also less likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19. The flu basicsInfluenza — or the flu — is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. The seasonal flu, appearing in the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, is a very common and highly contagious illness. The most common symptoms of the flu include: FeverChillsBody achesCoughHeadacheFatigueGetting a flu shot each year can protect yourself from experiencing these symptoms, or at least reduce their severity. In fact, during the 2018-19 flu season, the vaccine prevented 4.4 million influenza illnesses, 58,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 3,500 deaths due to influenza. How the flu vaccine works Flu shots work by helping your body develop antibodies that can protect you from being infected with an influenza virus. Most flu vaccines are referred to as quadrivalent because they protect you from four different types of flu: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. The flu vaccine is made up of several virus strains, called candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs), that vary by year. There are two ways the flu vaccines can be administered:Injection. The flu shot is most commonly given through an injection with a syringe, usually in the deltoid muscle of your upper arm. For injections, the CVVs are inactivated, meaning they will help your immune system produce antibodies without giving you the actual flu virus. Nasal spray. This vaccine, inhaled through your nose, is often preferable for those who do not like injections. However, it may not be as effective as a flu shot, according to a 2019 study. In addition, for nasal sprays, the CVVs are live but weakened. While it is approved and recommended for those between the age of 2 and 49 years old, it should not be taken by high-risk groups, such as children under the age of 2 or people with pre-existing health conditions.Why the flu shot is important"Many people skip their flu shot thinking it doesn't matter, but an estimated 80% of children who died from the flu did not get their flu vaccine," says Alice Benjamin, APRN, MSN, ACNS-BC, FNP-C, a Los Angeles-based clinical nurse specialist and family nurse practitioner. "In adults, getting an annual flu shot has been shown to decrease your chances of falling seriously sick with the flu by 40% to 60%."Overall, the flu shot is the most effective way to prevent yourself from getting the flu. That doesn't mean it's 100% effective — according to CDC data from February 2020, the flu shot was about 46% effective for the 2019-20 season. But that also shouldn't stop you from getting one. "Let's acknowledge that the flu vaccine is not perfect," says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "But it's the best flu vaccine that modern science can give us. And we can do a lot of good with our pretty good vaccine."By protecting you from getting sick, flu shots also help protect you from more severe health complications. For example, studies have found that heart attacks and strokes may be more likely to occur soon after you have the flu. "If you need another reason to get protection from a flu shot, that's it," Schaffner says.If you're still not convinced, it may be helpful to weigh the pros and cons of getting a flu shot: Getting a flu shot is easy and affordable, and it brings many health benefits with few risks. Yuqing Liu/Insider Flu vaccine side effects There are a few common side effects from the flu shot injection, such as:Muscle soreness, redness, or swelling at the site of injectionHeadacheNausea or stomach painHowever, these side effects are quite mild, and shouldn't last longer than a few days after you get your flu shot. If you get the nasal spray vaccine, you may also experience a runny nose or sore throat. Note: Getting a flu shot will not give you the flu. You can still get the flu after getting a flu shot, but the symptoms likely won't be as severe as they would have been without the vaccine. Who should get a flu vaccine?Everyone who is at least six months old should get a flu shot every year. It's especially important for high-risk groups, such as health care providers, caregivers, and people who are immunocompromised or have chronic medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes.The following groups should also get flu shots, though there may be certain precautions you should be aware of: Infants If your infant is six months old or older, they can and should get a flu shot. Children younger than two years old are at especially high risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu.Infants getting their first flu vaccine or who have only received one dose of the vaccine need to get two injections at least four weeks apart. The CDC recommends that the second dose be administered at the end of October.Kids As with infants, children eight years old and younger who are getting their first flu vaccine or have only received one dose of the vaccine will need two injections at least four weeks apart. Children who are at least two years old can also get the vaccine administered via a nasal spray. However, the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be given to children two to four years old who have asthma, or to children 2 to 17 years old who are taking medications that contain aspirin or salicylate.Seniors Because your immune system weakens as you age, and becomes less effective at producing antibodies to fight off infections, two special types of flu shots are available for people over the age of 65.One is a high-dose vaccine called Fluzone, which you can get wherever most flu shots are available. The other is FLUAD, which is an adjuvanted flu vaccine. This means it promotes a better response by your immune system. Pregnant people If you're pregnant, your weakened immune system makes you more at risk of flu complications. It's important to get a flu shot to protect yourself as well as your baby. The vaccine's flu-fighting antibodies pass through your placenta and will continue to protect your baby for six months.It's safe to get a flu shot during any trimester, as well as when you're breastfeeding. However, pregnant women should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine because it contains a live virus that could enter your placenta and infect the fetus.Who should not get a flu shot? Children younger than six months old and people with certain health conditions should not get a flu shot, the CDC advises.These health conditions include:A severe allergic reaction to a previous flu shot. According to a 2016 study, for every one million flu shots given, there were about 1.3 severe allergic reactions, such as tongue or throat swelling, shortness of breath, or vomiting.Egg allergies. Although the most common flu vaccine contains viruses grown in eggs, people with mild allergic symptoms like hives can safely get it, according to the CDC. If you have a severe allergy, two egg-free flu vaccines are available. You can also get a regular flu shot as long as it's in a medical setting such as a doctor's office or clinic, and is supervised by a health care provider who can treat an anaphylactic reaction.A fever. If you have a fever over 99.5°F, you might want to wait to get a flu shot. Your immune system is already producing antibodies to fight infection, so the vaccine may not be as effective. However, if you have a cold with no fever, it's safe to get a flu shot.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). This is a rare neurological disorder that causes your immune system to damage your nerve cells. Its exact cause is unknown, but it often develops after a respiratory illness or the flu. It is very rare to get GBS after a flu shot, according to the CDC. If you already have GBS, talk to your doctor before getting a flu shot.If you can't get a flu shot, there are other steps you can take to prevent the flu. "When you know the flu is in your community, that's the time to really hunker down," Schaffner says. Wash your hands frequently, practice social distancing, and avoid people who are coughing or sneezing. When to get a flu shot "October is the golden month to be vaccinated," Schaffner says. This will help protect you throughout the entire flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere generally lasts from October to March, peaking in February. If you don't get vaccinated in October, you should still get vaccinated while flu shots are available. Flu shots are usually available from late September to late February. Getting vaccinated early, like in July or August, is not recommended by the CDC, especially for older adults. The flu shot's effectiveness will likely wear off – it only lasts about six months — giving you less protection later in the flu season. Where to get a flu shot Flu shots are widely available at your doctor's office, pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens, and many other locations. Here's how to get one in three simple steps. How to get your flu shot in 3 easy steps Find a flu shot location nearby. In addition to your doctor's office, you can get a flu shot at drugstores like CVS and Walgreens, and at pharmacies in major retailers such as Walmart and Costco. You can find a location near you by visiting VaccineFinder.Check your insurance. If you have health insurance, your flu shot will be free. If you don't have insurance, some employers and colleges offer free flu shots. Your county health department may also provide free shots, especially for seniors.Make sure you bring ID. When you go to get your flu shot, bring your health insurance ID card, if you have one. You may need to also show your driver's license or other ID.Video: Flu myths Insider's takeawayIt's always important to get a flu shot, and it's essential during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, getting a flu shot helps prevent you — as well as the people close to you — from getting sick, needing medical care, or being admitted to a hospital.

October 07, 2021 Though COVID-19 is the virus on everyone's mind, we cannot overlook the importance of staying protected against the influenza virus. Getting the flu vaccine keeps you healthy, prevents you from getting secondary infections, and prevents you from needing to go to the hospital with a serious infection. Tamara Hutchings, a registered nurse at the University Health Centre, shares some advice about the importance of the flu vaccine and how the U of A community can get their shots this year. Flu shots are not mandatory on campus, but are recommended to keep yourself healthy and protect our healthcare system. Any time you are sick it's important to stay home for the health and safety of others. COVID-19 and the flu can have similar symptoms, so this year it's important to address symptoms as if they might be COVID-19. Why is it important to get an influenza immunization (flu vaccine) annually? There are different strains of influenza viruses and they're constantly changing. Every year, the World Health Organization looks at what strains have been circulating in the southern hemisphere during their flu season, and then they make an educated guess about which strains will affect the northern hemisphere. Because of this, the flu vaccine changes every year. Your body makes antibodies specific to different viral strains, and the strains that you were vaccinated against in a previous year may not be what is circulating this year. On top of that, flu vaccines offer no immune memory, and the antibodies that your body makes only have a lifespan of six-to-twelve months. Getting a flu vaccine once does not offer ongoing protection Is the flu vaccine important even if you have been fully vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine? Your body makes antibodies specific to different viruses. If you get the flu vaccine, you have no protection against the COVID-19 virus because it's specific to those four strains that are in the flu virus vaccine. Subsequently, the COVID-19 vaccines do not protect you against any viruses other than the COVID-19 virus. Do you need to wait any time between getting the flu vaccine and other vaccines? No! When COVID-19 vaccines first came out experts were advising to wait between receiving different vaccines, but now studies have shown that there is no need to wait. You can get a flu shot and your COVID-19 shot on the same day at the same time. Why is it important to stay home when you are sick? Any time you are sick, whether it's with the flu, COVID-19, or something else, it's important to stay home for the health and safety of others. COVID-19 and the flu can have similar symptoms, so this year it's important to address symptoms as if they might be COVID-19—including getting tested. If you have any symptoms or are not feeling well, you must stay home and not come to campus. How can someone get a flu vaccine on campus at the U of A this year? Starting October 18, the University Health Center will have a dedicated team administering flu shots every weekday from 8:30 am - 4:20 pm by appointment only. After November 5, the UHC will offer flu shots by walk-in only. Flu shots are also available at the UHC Pharmacy by appointment and by walk-in on a first-come, first-serve basis. Augustana is hosting an on-campus flu vaccination clinic on November 4 from 12:30 - 3:00 pm in the Faith and Life Lounge. Influenza immunization is available at the University Health Centre at no charge to Albertans five years of age and older with a valid Alberta Health Care number. If you have out-of-province or out-of-country health insurance you can request a vaccine appointment by calling 811.

The devices were officially handed over by the WHO Representative to Islamic Republic of Iran Dr Syed Jaffar Hussain to Dr Talat Mokhtari-Azad, Director of the Iranian National Influenza Centre, Head of Virology Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, School of Public Health, during a visit on Wednesday, 29 September 2021, accompanied by a team of WHO experts. The equipment included state-of-the-art devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets and printers, purchased and delivered through donations from the German Federal Foreign Office. They will be used along with the genome sequencing machines in analysing next generation sequencing data and interpreting the results for better understanding of the circulating microbe variants in the country. Genome sequencing is the process of determining the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of the DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time. The support will go a long way in helping to scale up diagnostic and track and trace activities in the country.

To mitigate those risks, we need to understand how networks shaped by trading practices influence disease spread. Yet, those practices are rarely recorded in high-risk settings. Through a large cross-sectional study, we assessed the potential impact of live poultry trading networks’ structures on avian influenza transmission dynamics in Bangladesh. Networks promoted mixing between chickens sourced from different farming systems and geographical locations, fostering co-circulation of viral strains of diverse origins in markets. Viral transmission models suggested that the observed rise in viral prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely explained by intra-market transmission alone, but substantially influenced by transmission occurring in upstream network nodes. Disease control interventions should therefore alter the entire network structures. However, as networks differed between chicken types and city supplied, standardised interventions are unlikely to be effective, and should be tailored to local structural characteristics.

By bringing animals of different species and geographical origins into close contact, markets promote the transmission, evolution, and, possibly, the zoonotic transfer of pathogens carried by marketed animals. In order to control the spread of zoonotic diseases’ through these, attempts have been made to ban live animal markets. Such bans have targeted the marketing of live birds in response to outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9)2, as well as the marketing of wild animals during the SARS1 and the 2013–2016 West African Ebola3 epidemics. The possible role played by a wildlife market in the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to the prohibition of wild animal marketing across China; and voices have called for this prohibition to be extended globally4. However, indiscriminate ban of live animal markets, wild or domestic, is difficult to enforce. Ignoring the trading networks in which those markets are embedded may have unintended social and epidemiological consequences. Firstly, it may adversely affect vulnerable populations whose livelihoods heavily rely on transactions operated through those networks5. Secondly, failing to account for the continuing demand and network actors’ motivations may not eliminate, but alter those networks, driving them underground, thus promoting pathogen dissemination6, ultimately making it even more difficult to monitor and regulate them3.As an alternative to market bans, a range of technical interventions—cleaning and disinfection, ban on overnight poultry storage, usage of personal protective equipment—have aimed at reducing pathogen burden and human exposure in markets, while minimising trade disruption. Although these measures have been effective in Hong Kong7, in other settings the lack of adaptation of those measures to local contexts meant that they had limited effectiveness8,9,10,11. The way in which markets are connected within live bird trading networks is generally ignored, as the networks’ configurations are often undocumented. Yet, in order to mitigate zoonotic and animal disease risks associated with live animal trade more effectively, as well as to detect the emergence of pathogens of public health importance more rapidly, measures need to be based on an understanding of how those networks are structured, and how their configurations influence disease risks.Since its emergence in 2007, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus subtype H5N1 has been circulating endemically in Bangladesh along with multiple other avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes12. Those viruses are ubiquitous in live bird markets13, through which nearly all poultry consumed in Bangladesh transit14. In the absence of systematic recording of live bird traders’ movements, labour-intensive data collection is needed to characterise the networks in which markets are embedded. This usually limits study scale, and, while such studies have been useful to identify epidemiologically relevant features of those networks, they could not unravel their overall structure15,16. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study aimed at assessing the configuration of the live poultry trading networks supplying the two largest Bangladeshi cities, Dhaka and Chattogram. We show how detailed characterisation of the configuration of live poultry trading networks can improve our understanding of AIV transmission dynamics in an endemic area and support the development of more effective surveillance and control programmes. ResultsIn the following, live bird markets are referred to as markets. Through a cross-sectional study, conducted from March to September 2015, we interviewed 1389 vendors holding a permanent stall in one of 119 markets visited in Chattogram and Dhaka (Fig. 1a), and 520 mobile traders supplying live birds to those vendors, either from other markets or farms (sometimes referred to as middlemen). They were asked about their trading practices in the 7 days preceding the interview. In addition, a cohort of 43 vendors and 37 mobile traders was interviewed monthly, in order to assess how their practices varied over a year.Figure 1Type of poultry and chains of actors.

Catchment areas were mapped using maptools57, road distances were computed using gmapsdistance58.Full size imageTypes of poultry sold in marketsWe estimated that more than 97% of poultry transiting through Dhaka and Chattogram’s market stalls were chickens, and less than 0.7% were ducks (Fig. 1b, Tables S3–S7). Other species included geese, quail and pigeons. Chickens were described by network actors according to their type, based on their perceived breed, and production purpose. Overall, broiler, sonali breeds and deshi chickens accounted for 95.1% (2.5–97.5th quantile range, 95% R: 94.8–95.6%) and 86.2% (95% R: 85.8–86.5%) of chickens sold in Dhaka and Chattogram, respectively, and spent hens and cockerels for the remainder. The most frequently traded chicken types were sonalis in Dhaka and broilers in Chattogram (Fig. 1b). Broilers referred to exotic broiler, fast-growing chicken breeds (e.g. Ross, Cobb 500)14. Deshis were indigenous, often non-descript, chicken breeds17. Phenotypically close to deshis, sonalis were a crossbreed (F1 generation of Fayoumi (Female) and Rhode Island Red Male) introduced to Bangladesh in the 90’s by rural development programmes18. Sales of chickens tended to decrease during the rainy season (June–August) (Table S19).Sequences of actorsFrom here onwards, we focus on broilers, sonalis and deshis, the main poultry types traded in the study area. The sequences of actors, defined as the number of successive traders involved in the trade of chickens from farms through to markets differed according to chicken type and city supplied, with relatively shorter sequences of actors for broilers and sonalis than for deshis, and for Chattogram than for Dhaka (Fig. 1c). Likewise, the number of markets through which chickens transited was higher for deshis than for broilers and sonalis, and for Dhaka than for Chattogram (Fig. 1d). Transactions between mobile traders and broiler or sonali farmers were often mediated by another type of actor, feed dealers, especially in Chattogram (Table S21), who supplied farmers with credit and production inputs. They connected farmers and mobile traders, but did not, themselves, transport or store chickens. Deshis were often directly sourced by mobile traders from small-scale, backyard farmers. More than 95% of chickens leaving Chattogram markets (i.e. not transiting through another market stall) were sold to end-users (e.g. consumers, restaurateurs, caterers), and were therefore slaughtered at the market or soon after the end-point transaction. In contrast, in Dhaka, a quarter of broilers, a third of deshis and most sonalis were estimated to be sold to other traders operating outside markets (e.g. hawkers, street shops), and were therefore kept alive for longer periods of time (SI, Table S20).Deshis were sold at a higher price than broilers and sonalis, but prices of all chicken types were lower in Dhaka than Chattogram, despite more actors and markets being involved (Table S16).Almost all mobile traders (97.1%, n = 505) reported trading a single poultry type in the week preceding the interview (Table S9), whereas two-thirds of vendors (65%, n = 486) sold several types at their stall (Table S8), suggesting that mixing between poultry types remained limited until reaching market stalls.Market catchment areasWe explored the networks’potential to mix chickens of different types and from different geographical origins. A catchment area describes the set of upazilas (sub-district) where farms supplying a market, or markets within a city, were located. Broilers were sourced near cities, 70% being transported, from farms to terminal markets, over < 100 km (Fig. 2g). In contrast, most chickens, 59.4–85% according to the type, estimated to originate from Chattogram district and its bordering districts. There was no, or only very limited, overlap between both cities’ catchment areas (Table 1). Dhaka’s three catchment areas (Fig. 2a–c) didn’t overlap as much as Chattogram’s (Fig. 2d–f). Three districts in the north and east of Dhaka and three in the north-west supplied 75.7% of broilers and 82.1% of sonalis, respectively. Origins of deshis were more scattered over northern and north-western districts.Figure 2Origins of chickens sold in Dhaka and Chattogram markets. Catchment areas of Dhaka (a–c) and Chattogram (d–f) are shown for broilers (a,d), sonalis (b,e) and deshis (c,f); (g) cumulative distribution of broilers (blue), sonalis (purple) and deshis (red) sold in Dhaka (solid lines) and Chattogram (dashed lines) according to the distance over which they were transported, from farms to their terminal market; (h,i): hierarchical clustering of Dhaka and Chattogram markets based on the similarity of their catchment areas for sonalis and broilers, the most commonly chicken types in each city, respectively; the distance between any two markets (y-axis) was 1-[Pianka index], with a value of 0 meaning that two markets had similar catchment areas, and a value of 1 that those areas did not overlap.Full size imageTable 1 Pairwise comparison of catchment areas according to the city supplied and the type of chickens traded using Pianka’s overlap indices19.Full size tableIn order to assess potential temporal variations in these catchment areas, 37 mobile traders were asked every month, for a year, about the origins of the chickens they traded over a four-day period, referred to as the interview-period. Mobile traders purchased chickens from an average of 2 upazilas per interview-period. However, some mobile traders frequently changed the upazilas where they purchased chickens from one month to the next, resulting in them visiting a large number of upazilas (mean: 7.5–8.8, up to 17–25 depending on chicken type) and districts (average: 2.4–5.1, up to 5–14) over the study period (Table S17). These visited upazilas were nonetheless within the boundaries of the catchment areas characterised for each chicken type through the cross-sectional study.Most markets’ catchment areas were similar, or substantially overlapped, with the catchment areas of other markets in the same city (Fig. 2h, i, SI Fig. S6). This suggested that, for each chicken type, multiple markets in a city sold chickens sourced from the same geographical areas. We then assessed the potential of chickens from different types and geographical origins to be sold together in a given market. Defining a farmed chicken population as all chickens of a given type farmed in a given upazila (or district), any two farmed chicken populations among those accounting for > 97% of catchment areas supplying each city could be sold together in at least one market (SI, Table S23) In other words, this meant that almost any two chickens supplied to Dhaka or Chattogram, regardless of their type and geographical origin could potentially be traded in the same market.Movements of chickens and traders between markets within citiesAlthough Dhaka’s and Chattogram’s markets show comparable potential for mixing chickens from different farming systems and geographical origins, transaction patterns differed greatly between both cities. In Dhaka, each interviewed mobile trader generally supplied chickens to only one market (60.8%), rarely more than two (12%), and 38.7% of vendors purchased chickens in another market than the one where they operated. In contrast, almost all vendors in Chattogram (98.7%) purchased all their chickens in the market where they operated, and most interviewed mobile traders (59.2%) sold chickens in at least five markets around the city. This resulted in networks of chicken and trader movements between markets in each city being mainly shaped by (i) inter-market transactions in Dhaka and (ii) movements of mobile traders delivering chickens to multiple markets in Chattogram. In Dhaka, out of the 64 markets we surveyed, 47 were involved in inter-market transactions, and connected within a unique component. The network was almost acyclic, and highly heterogeneous, with most nodes (74.5%) being sinks, supplied from an average of two other markets, and 63.9% of inter-market edges originated from the two largest Dhaka markets (Table S24). In Chattogram, only eight of the 55 surveyed markets traded chickens with another market. Accounting for all traders’ movements between markets (i.e. associated, or not, with inter-market transactions) did not affect the overall structure of the network in Dhaka, the degree (i.e. the number of other markets to which a market was connected) distribution remaining right-skewed, with the two largest markets still mediating most connections between other markets. In Chattogram, the resulting network was as large as Dhaka’s, but with four times as many edges, and a symmetrical, thinner-tailed, degree distribution. Both networks showed high clustering coefficients and short path lengths, suggestive of small-world properties (Table S25).Chicken and AIV dynamics in marketsInterviewed mobile traders supplying market stalls with broilers and sonalis reported collecting them from commercial farms the night, or the day, before selling them at markets. Deshis were collected from multiple small-scale backyard flocks, over 2–3 days, to form a batch which was then dispatched to city markets. Based on trading practices reported by vendors, the length of time spent by chickens in markets was estimated to be slightly longer in Chattogram than in Dhaka, and for deshis than for other types (Fig. 3a). However, the turnover was high as the probability of a chicken remaining in a Dhaka or Chattogram market for more than 24 h was 0.09 and 0.14, respectively, and for more than 48 h was 0.01 and 0.03, respectively. This high turnover meant that for AIVs to be sustained in a marketed chicken population, i.e. reproduction number r ≥ 1, β needed to be high (Fig. 3b). β refers here to the average daily number of contacts resulting in infection if involving a susceptible and an infected bird, in a closed population. Depending on the city, β would need to reach 8.1 or 14.3, for a latent period of 12 h, and 17.5 to 32.7, for a latent period of 24 h. A 20-fold increase in the prevalence of infection for newly introduced chickens, as observed in the field with H9 AIV between farmed and marketed chickens13,20, could not be achieved in Dhaka markets for a latent period ≥ 12 h, due to the high turnover of chickens (Fig. 3c).Figure 3Chicken and AIV dynamics in a market.

However, the high turnover of chickens in Dhaka’s and Chattogram’s markets meant that (i) the level of transmission required for a virus to be sustained in a marketed chicken population would need to be higher than transmission rates estimated in the literature for different subtypes and strains21,22,23,24,26,27,28, and (ii) the observed rise in prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely to be explained by intra-market transmission alone. Viral shedding in markets was therefore likely due, at least partially, to infection occurring before chickens reached markets, during their transport, and possibly their collection, from farms. Mobile traders often visit several farms to put together a shipment which they then deliver to markets or other intermediaries, using vehicles which are rarely cleaned thoroughly11. This is likely to promote viral transmission between birds originating from different flocks, transported within the same vehicle, at the same time or sequentially. Likelihood of transmission would further increase as multiple traders are involved. Moreover, chickens from a given shed can be sold through multiple transactions occurring sequentially over a few days29. Successive visits to a farm by traders who enter the shed to collect chickens may result in viral introduction among chickens present in the shed, and which will enter the trading network soon after. This suggests that, in order to reduce viral load in terminal markets, control efforts conducted there should be complemented by interventions targeting farms and mobile traders. These hypotheses, which are suggested by the network configuration and the dynamics of the chicken population transiting through it, would need to be validated by virological data, for instance, through the longitudinal sampling of groups of chickens moved from farms to terminal markets, or field experiments altering the network structure to assess the impact on viral prevalence along the network nodes.The high diversity of AIVs circulating in Bangladeshi markets has been documented30,31,32,33, but the underlying factors influencing these patterns have not been explored. As mobile traders rarely traded several poultry types concurrently, there were limited opportunities for broilers, sonalis and deshis to mix along the trading networks until they reached market vendors’ stalls. Therefore, if a substantial proportion of the viral amplification observed along networks took place before chickens reached terminal markets, as hypothesized above, viruses shed by chickens at market stalls should be a sample of strains circulating in the geographical areas and farming systems where those chickens originated. Such frequent introductions of AIVs from a variety of farming systems and geographical areas may result in greater viral diversity compared to a scenario in which viral amplification only takes place in markets, leading to the persistence of a subset of strains. Almost any two chickens sourced from anywhere in a city’s catchment area had the potential to come into contact in a city’s market, suggesting that any combination of viral strains circulating in the geographical areas and farming systems supplying a city may occur in a market. Such a pattern, of which the actual occurrence needs to be further explored through virological studies and genetic analyses, could promote the co-infection of marketed poultry by genetically diverse AIVs, and, therefore, foster opportunities for viral re-assortment. Indeed, although the observed rise in prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely to be explained by intra-market viral transmission alone, viral transmission was nonetheless likely to occur within markets, especially involving the small fraction of chickens remaining in those markets for > 24 h. Segregating markets, or areas within markets, according to poultry types (associated with different farming system and geographical origin), combined with abovementioned measures aiming to reduce viral load in markets, could reduce the risk of emergence of new variants.Although the supply of deshis involved longer sequences of actors, and longer periods of time spent at mobile traders’ collection centres where chickens are stored until the batch is large enough to be sent to markets, their prevalence of AIV infection was lower than or similar to other chicken types13. This might be explained by lower viral prevalence in backyard farms compared to commercial farms, or greater likelihood to have been exposed to AIVs, and to have developed some immune response, by the time they are sold20. Resistance of local breeds to AIVs has been suggested34,35,36,37, and occasionally explored38,39,40, unlike possible variations in their susceptibility and infectiousness compared with commercial breeds. Also, deshis’ transport conditions differ from those of commercial breeds. While deshis from a large number of households may mix in one shipment, those shipments—large baskets containing 100–120 chickens—are much smaller than for chickens sourced from only a few commercial farms and caged by thousands in trucks. As a result, viral transmission risk during transport may be lower for deshis than for commercial breeds. Field studies would be however required to assess the way in which different modes of transportation may impact on viral transmission.Markets’ catchment areas greatly differed between Dhaka and Chattogram, but, within each city, they greatly overlapped, with markets also being embedded in a small-world network through the movements of their traders, with such a structure possibly promoting rapid viral dissemination41. Markets in the same city were therefore likely to harbour similar viral populations. Surveillance activities aiming to monitor the circulation of AIVs and to detect the emergence of new variants should target multiple cities, with complementary, non-overlapping, catchment areas, but would need to do so only in a limited number of markets in each city. As highlighted by the results of the longitudinal study, mobile traders could source their chickens from a large number of districts and upazilas. This feature may mean that they are able to seize economic opportunities in response to changes in price and availability of chickens, which may be triggered, for instance by natural disasters (e.g. floods), disease outbreaks, or religious festivals. Further work would be required to assess the impact of those constantly changing individual trading patterns on the overall network structure. This may not change the overall shape of a catchment area associated with a particular city—indeed the catchment area is likely to be constrained by locations of production units, competing markets (from other cities) and the balance between transport costs and sales prices often resulting in small profit margins—but it may promote mixing of chickens, and therefore, of their viruses.The trading network structure creates conditions for high viral load and diversity in markets, generating zoonotic disease risk. Indeed, no, or limited, adherence to cleaning and disinfection programmes, limited availability of clean water, use of defeathering machine aerosolizing viruses contribute to the persistence of AIVs shed by poultry in the markets’ environment and exposure of humans visiting markets to these viruses8. Exposure is likely to be the highest for market workers who were observed to operate without any personal protective equipment, despite slaughtering large number of poultry per day and being in direct contact with manure and waste8,42. Therefore, characterising live animal trading networks, in which these markets are embedded, can improve our understanding of their role in generating zoonotic disease risk and our ability to identify the most appropriate targets for risk mitigation interventions. This approach implies a need for technical interventions aiming to re-wire network structures or alter the potential of a network connection to transmit and amplify infectious agents. However, to be successful, the design of these interventions should consider the social and economic processes influencing actors’ behaviours and resulting networks’ structures. This will require conducting ethnographic research that aims to understand the “market architecture” by examining social, economic and power relations within and between network nodes, rather than assuming that these networks are organised in keeping with conventional market models or according to “traditional” modes of exchange43. Here we discuss some hypotheses which may explain the observed patterns, suggesting the need for further studies.The greater proportion of sonali sales in Dhaka suggests a stronger consumer preference for higher valued and more expensive poultry types in comparison to Chattogram where the relatively lower priced broilers make up a higher proportion of sales. Dhaka is the country’s primary destination for internal migration with people drawn to the city seeking higher incomes and year-round employment opportunities absent from other, more rural, areas44. This difference may be linked to changing consumer preferences that accompany higher incomes, education and urbanisation levels, mirroring observations on demand for rice, with the consumption of fine-grain varieties increasing with higher per capita income and education levels in Bangladesh45. Distinct and different forms of urbanisation, characteristic of each of the two cities, may also have influenced observed trading patterns within each city—i.e. the role of wholesalers and inter-market transactions in Dhaka in contrast to mobile traders delivering chickens directly to multiple markets in Chattogram. Classified as a mega-city, Dhaka is not a single entity, but rather an agglomeration of several very large urban settlements46, exhibiting a hierarchy of urbanity which is more complex than in Chattogram where social, geographical, industrial and commercial bases are markedly different. Beyond the differences in size and traffic congestion which may make it more difficult for poultry-carrying vehicles to move across Dhaka and partially explain the limited number of markets visited by mobile traders in this city, this may result in different dynamics with respect to inter-market competition, possibly affecting mobile traders’ trading patterns and prices. Variations in trading patterns and prices in both cities may also result from differences affecting upstream nodes in the respective networks. For instance, the North and North-Western rural populations supplying Dhaka with deshis were poorer and likely selling their chickens at a lower price, compared to populations supplying Chattogram47. These may also reflect different types of exchange relations between actors. As shown with rice marketing for which the dominance and value extraction exerted by merchants upon producers varied considerably across Bangladesh and shaped different circuits of trade43, exchange relations are likely to differ across the country, impacting the network structure. Of particular interest are the interlocked transactions in which farmers are often engaged with feed dealers, with the latter facilitating the sales of their chickens to mobile traders, and, by connecting farmers and mobile traders, literally shaping the network. Finally, the spatial organisation of production is also likely to influence the observed patterns. Indeed, the scale and spatial distribution of production units meant that collecting enough deshis, which are raised in backyard farms, requires visiting large numbers of households spread over large rural areas far away from the consumption centres. This is more labour intensive than collecting broilers raised in large flocks located in the peri-urban vicinity of cities and may explain the longer sequences of actors associated with the trade of deshis. While we mentioned above that the higher proportion of sales of sonalis in Dhaka likely resulted from consumer preference, it may also be influenced by the location of production units, which are highly clustered in North-western districts where this breed was initially introduced by development programmes, i.e. much closer to Dhaka than Chattogram18,48,49.This study had several limitations. In the absence of registries, data collection relied on traders’ recall of their practices in the 7 days preceding the interview. This may have led to under-reporting of infrequent, occasional practices and suppliers. As we did not interview all mobile traders supplying Dhaka and Chattogram, the connectivity of the networks of markets created by traders’ movements in each city may be, therefore, even higher than estimated here. In order to reconstruct the catchment areas of Dhaka and Chattogram markets, and the sequences of actors involved in their supply, practices of non-interviewed mobile traders were imputed based on those reported by interviewed mobile traders operating in similar markets. Imputations will have had most impact on sequences of actors and catchment areas of broilers sold in Dhaka and deshis sold in Chattogram as non-interviewed mobile traders supplied around a quarter of those chickens (Table S21). The accuracy of these imputations depended on the representativeness of our sample of mobile traders. Although the large number of interviewed traders and the similarity of their practices suggested that the main features of the trading networks were captured, we could not assess whether the refusal rate resulted in a selection bias (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.1). Mobile traders and vendors operating in markets outside of Chattogram and Dhaka were not interviewed, except for some deshi traders involved in supplying Chattogram. Based on field observations it was hypothesised, that such vendors were supplied by mobile traders in their markets. These mobile traders were then assumed to have sourced chickens in upazilas and districts around those markets. The estimated lower number of mobile traders included in sequences of actors supplying deshis to Dhaka compared with Chattogram may reflect the fact that some deshi mobile traders operating outside of Chattogram were recruited, contrary to Dhaka, where the length of the sequence of actors may have, therefore, been underestimated.Several factors may have affected the reliability of our estimations of markets’ catchment areas, including the possible biases in the selection of mobile traders mentioned above. Not having interviewed all mobile traders supplying the study area, some upazilas supplying Dhaka and Chattogram may not have been identified. We could not account for the spatial heterogeneity in feed dealers’ practices when estimating the geographical origins of chickens. Nonetheless, the catchment areas presented here were consistent with those presented in a previous study50. In addition, the location of the main areas supplying broilers, sonalis and deshis to both cities49,51,52 correspond to areas where farmed chicken populations are known to be large, suggesting that our estimates are reliable. The catchment areas estimated in this and a previous study50 were, however, static, quantifying their temporal variation, and the factors affecting those, would be important to ensure optimal adaptation of surveillance and control programmes. Due to available data, this study focused on the three main poultry types sold in both cities. However, other poultry species (e.g. geese, ducks, quails) sold less frequently and for a higher price, may remain in markets for longer periods than chickens, and could therefore play a key role in viral reassortment. Future studies should aim to characterise practices associated with the trade of other poultry species and chicken types. Finally, this study focused on live bird markets, through which almost all poultry and poultry products are traded, but both cities counted numerous additional stand-alone live poultry shops, door-to-door vendors and a small but growing number of supermarkets selling chilled or frozen chickens. As the market share of the latter increases, poultry trading networks may change dramatically, and this will affect the pattern of viral transmission and evolutionary dynamics.In conclusion, trading networks differed according to chicken types and cities studied here, but showed similar potential for mixing of chickens, and consequently their viruses, sourced from different farming systems and geographical areas. Viral amplification along the networks was likely fostered by transmission occurring before poultry reached markets in Dhaka and Chattogram. While these results suggest the need for interventions involving improved surveillance and control of AIVs and other zoonotic diseases, they will need to be validated through virological studies, and complemented by ethnographic investigations examining the factors shaping the observed diverse network structures which would need to be considered for risk mitigation attempts to be effective and sustainable.MethodsData collectionThe cross-sectional study was conducted from March to December 2015. Fifty-five and 123 LBMs, as defined in Ref.53, were identified through snowball sampling (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.1) in Chattogram and Dhaka, respectively. All vendors operating in identified markets in Chattogram (n = 55) were recruited (n = 461). Given the larger number of markets in Dhaka (n = 123), 64 were selected through stratified sampling, based on markets’ size and locations. In Dhaka’s markets, vendors were randomly selected, with sample size depending on markets’ size (n = 928) (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.1). Interviewed vendors provided contact details of mobile traders supplying them, who were then recruited. Additional mobile traders were opportunistically recruited in the six Dhaka markets where vendors most frequently reported purchasing poultry from mobile traders. As a result, 340 mobile vendors were interviewed in Dhaka and 191 in Chattogram. Most mobile traders did not know the locations of the farms from which they bought poultry when the transactions were mediated by feed dealers. Typically, a mobile trader sent workers to a feed dealer’s shop, where they were directed to a farm from which they collected poultry. Those workers were often employed on a daily basis and could not be reliably identified. Instead, feed dealers’ contact details were provided by mobile traders, and 80 were purposely selected and interviewed (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.2). Structured questionnaires were designed for vendors, mobile traders and feed dealers to collect information about trading practices, for each poultry type, in the past 7 days: the numbers of traded poultry, their origins and destinations, buying and selling frequency, surplus management and prices. An additional cross-sectional study, which exclusively investigated deshi and duck trading patterns, which were not fully captured by the aforementioned cross-sectional study, was carried out from November 2017 to March 2018, involving 21 vendors and 39 mobile traders supplying deshis and/or ducks to Chattogram markets (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.3). Overall, 520 mobile traders transporting broilers, sonalis and/or deshis were recruited. Finally, in order to investigate temporal variation in trading patterns, a longitudinal study was carried out from September 2016 to August 2017. Every month, participants were asked, twice a month, about the numbers, origins, destinations and prices of poultry they traded over the past 2 days. A total of 43 vendors and 37 mobile traders and 19 feed dealers were recruited, covering the different poultry types and both cities’ market networks (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.4).Ethical approvalInformed consent was given by each participant prior to the interview. The studies were approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare Committee and the Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Science University Ethics Committee and all research was performed in accordance to relevant guidelines and regulations.Data analysisData managementQuestionnaire data were double entered by two people using EpiData 3.1. EpiData’s double-entry and validation functions were used to identify, and correct inconsistencies. Data was then imported into R 3.5.154 for analysis.Reconstruction of the network of transactionsThe numbers of poultry traded weekly between any two actors (i.e. farmers, vendors, mobile traders, feed dealers, end-users) were estimated based on the interview data. The algorithm is detailed in SI (Sect. 1.2.2). In brief, for each poultry type, we first estimated the number of poultry that vendors reported selling to end-users, and then reconstructed the possible chains of transactions up to the farms. In order to ensure that any poultry could not transit multiple times through a given actor, the network was acyclic. Interviewed vendors and mobile traders were categorised according to whom they purchased from and sold poultry to, such that there were no transactions between actors of the same category, and transactions between two categories were directed and not reciprocal. Missing information was addressed by imputations, detailed in SI (Sect. 1.2.2). In summary, practices of non-interviewed vendors in non-surveyed or surveyed Dhaka markets were imputed based on practices of interviewed vendors operating in the same or a similar market (i.e. same size and location). Likewise, in markets (in Chattogram and Dhaka) where actors reported trading poultry with mobile traders, but where no mobile traders were interviewed, practices of those mobile traders were imputed based on practices of interviewed mobile traders operating in similar markets. When poultry were sourced through feed dealers, the number of poultry purchased from farms in a given upazila was computed based on the upazila’s location with respect to the location of the feed dealer’s shop. Based on trading patterns reported through the cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys (broilers and sonalis), and the additional study focused on deshi and duck trade (deshis), we estimated, out of all poultry farms for which feed dealers facilitated transactions, the proportion which were located in (i) the same upazila as their store, (ii) the same district, (iii) a neighbouring district (Supplementary Information, Sect. 2.3). Based on field visits made to markets outside the study area and the opportunistic, unstructured interviews of actors, we assumed that vendors operating in markets outside the study area (and therefore not recruited) purchased chickens from mobile traders in the same markets as theirs. The origins of the chickens supplied by those mobile traders were simulated as described above for feed dealers, using the market’s upazila as the reference location. The impact of those imputations on the resulting network configurations were assessed (Supplementary Information, Sects. 2.2, 2.5). Sequences of actors and chicken population dynamicsFor each chicken type and city supplied, the frequency of chains of actors was computed by simulating 100,000 trajectories using the following algorithm. First, an upazila was randomly selected with a probability proportional to the number of chickens it supplied to the network. An actor was then randomly selected with a probability proportional to the number of chickens they sourced from that upazila. A possible chain of downstream actors through which a chicken transited until reaching a customer (i.e. an end-user or a trader operating outside a market) was thus constructed. For each sequence of actors, we estimated (i) the distances over which a chicken was moved, and (ii) the time spent by chickens in vendors’ flocks in each market of the study area through which it transited. The road distance between any two consecutive sites on a chain was computed using upazilas’ centroids and Chattogram and Dhaka centroids. For any movement between markets in Dhaka or in Chattogram, a standard distance of 15 km was considered. The duration that a chicken spent with vendors in a market was computed by simulating its purchase and sale times, based on practices reported by vendors such as frequency and timing of supply, storage of poultry before offering it for sale, management of poultry left unsold, similarly to Ref.55. The algorithm is detailed in SI (Sects. 1.2.2, 1.2.3). Catchment areasIn order to assess if the level of overlap between two catchment areas, computed with Pianka’s19 niche overlap indices, was greater than what would be expected by chance, we used a permutation test. The p-value was the proportion of simulated indices obtained by randomly permuting upazilas which were as high as or higher than observed indices. City-level catchment areas were computed based on the reconstructed transaction networks, as mentioned above. Surveyed markets were used to impute trading practices in non-surveyed markets so, to estimate market-level catchment areas and avoid overestimating their level of overlap, we only considered markets for which the origins of the chickens offered for sale were identified through traders’ interviews. Hierarchical clustering was performed on markets, with respect to chicken type and city supplied, using \(1-index\) as a measure of distance and Ward’s criteria56.Movements of chickens and traders between markets within citiesTwo networks of contacts with surveyed markets as nodes were built for each city, based on trading practices reported by interviewed actors. They were unweighted, and differed in their definition of edges: (i) a directed network with an edge being present between two markets if at least one actor purchased chickens in one market and sold these in another; (ii) an undirected network with two markets being connected if they were both visited by the same vendor or mobile trader, as such visits may result in viral spread, through the movements of infected chickens or contaminated fomites. The clustering coefficient was the frequency at which two markets connected to the same market were also connected to each other, and the average shortest path length was the average minimal number of edges required to connect any two nodes. If the clustering coefficient was higher, and the average shortest path length similar to those metrics computed for random networks (with the same number of nodes and edges), it would indicate that the empirical network showed small-world properties. AIV transmission dynamicsWe simulated the transmission of avian influenza viruses within a population of chickens in a market using a stochastic compartmental model implemented in discrete time, with an hourly time-step. New chickens entered daily in the market, all at the same time. Their probability of leaving the market was time-dependent, and informed by the distribution of the estimated duration that chickens spent in a market in Dhaka or Chattogram (see above). Chickens could be successively susceptible, pre-infectious, infectious, and removed or recovered—given that the transmission was density-dependent, the infection outcome did not impact the transmission dynamics. The lengths of latent and infectious periods were fixed. The model accounted for transmission through direct contacts and mediated by the environment (as detailed in Ref.55). The probability of a chicken becoming infected at time \(t+\Delta t\) was \(1-exp\left[-\tau \left({I}_{t}+\eta {C}_{t}\right)\Delta t\right]\), with \(\tau\) the daily rate of transmission through direct contacts, \(\eta\) the relative transmission rate from the environment, \({I}_{t}\) the number of infectious chickens and \({C}_{t}\) the environmental load at time \(t\). The basic reproduction number r accounting for chicken dynamics in markets was computed based on the next-generation matrix (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.2.4).Catchment areas were mapped using maptools57, road distances were computed using gmapsdistance58, Pianka’s indices using EcosimR59, and network analysis was carried out using sna60 and igraph61, in R 3.5.154.

However, third doses are currently authorized for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions, or those 65 years of age or older. Marko Geber/Getty Images According to a clinical trial led by researchers at the University of Bristol, individuals can receive a flu shot and their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine simultaneously, Carl Zimmer reports for the New York Times. The preliminary results were released as a pre-print study in The Lancet in September and have not yet been peer-reviewed. Covid-19 booster vaccines are also safe to receive alongside the flu vaccine. However, at this time, third doses are only authorized for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised, have underlying medical conditions, or those 65 years of age or older, reports Kaitlin Sullivan of NBC News. In the new study's trials, doctors recruited 679 volunteers from April to June at 12 sites in Britain. During the study, all volunteers had received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine from either Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca, per the New York Times. Half of the participants received a flu shot when the groups returned for their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while the other half received a placebo. The vaccines were given on the same day, but administered in different arms. The researchers found that 97 percent of participants were willing to receive two jabs at future appointments. After receiving their doses of the vaccines, the research team monitored the study groups for fevers or aches. Side effects were mild to moderate in trials with three types of flu vaccines, per Alistair Smout for Reuters. "This is a really positive step which could mean fewer appointments for those who require both vaccines," says the study's first author Rajeka Lazarus, a vaccinologist at the University Hospital Bristol & Weston, to Reuters. Blood samples from the participants show that various combinations of flu shots and Covid-19 vaccines given simultaneously do not change either shot's effectiveness compared to receiving each jab separately, reports the New York Times. Previously, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended spacing out Covid-19 and flu vaccines by 14 days. But the CDC has revised its guidelines and suggests the wait is no longer needed, reports Emma H. Tobin for the Associated Press. Experts generally recommend staying up to date on vaccines this year because last year's flu season was historically mild since people were staying home and masking up. However, as mask mandates have been lifted and the vaccines have allowed people to return to in-person gatherings, there is no way to tell how intense this year's flu will be, per the AP. "The worry is that if they both circulate at the same time, we're going to have this sort of 'twin-demic,'" Richard Webby, a flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, tells the AP. "The concern with that is that it's going to put extra strain on an already strained health care system." Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Albany Archives: Pandemic shutdowns have happened since 1918 flu epidemic By Matt Malette Albany PUBLISHED 10:08 AM ET Oct. 08, 2021 PUBLISHED 10:08 AM EDT Oct. 08, 2021 SHARE What was dubbed the "Spanish flu" took the world by storm in 1918, and Albany was no exception. The cityâs first cases were reported at the end of September of that year, and instead of being proactive, many, including those in elected and appointed positions, felt it was being blown out of proportion. Dr. Arthur Sautter, Albanyâs city health officer, was skeptical until he saw it with his own eyes. Sautter was hesitant of a city shutdown and instead urged people to avoid crowds, breathe through their noses and get as much fresh air as possible â but it didnât work. In the cityâs first week of October, there were more than 600 cases. On October 8, Dr. Sautter finally recommended closing down all schools, churches and movie theaters, but it was simply too late. Sneezing and coughing without covering your mouth became a misdemeanor. Spitting in public was a $10 fine. In total, there were more than 7,000 flu cases and 450 deaths in October 1918 in Albany alone. At its peak, one person per hour died from it. The 1918 pandemic left Albany scarred. It was so traumatic that many made it a point to never speak about it again.

Experts Weigh InShould Pregnant People Get The Flu Shot? Experts Weigh InIn short, yes. By Mallory CrevelingUpdated: Oct 04, 2021 10:38 AM EDTSave ArticleBSIP//Getty ImagesIf you’ve been online lately, you know there's an overload of info on vaccines and immunity—and how they affect pregnancy. And one big question that pops up around flu season is: Can you get the flu vaccine during pregnancy?The CDC recommends that every single person six months and older get the influenza vaccine every single year (barring those who are allergic to the flu shot itself, of course). But here's the thing: What if you're pregnant? Children under six months shouldn't get a flu shot, per the CDC. So what about a growing fetus? “Any trimester during flu season is okay for the flu shot,” explains Neha Pathak, MD, DipABLM, a board-certified internal medicine and lifestyle medicine physician and medical editor at WedMD. “I've been pregnant three times and have gotten the flu shot in all different trimesters. For my baby that was born in the fall-winter time period, it felt especially good to know I was protecting her with antibodies even before she was born,” Pathak explains. Related StoryHow Long Do COVID-19 Symptoms Last?Check out more information below, for your peace of mind, from trusted experts. Spell it out for me: Should I get the flu shot when I'm pregnant or not?Short answer: The CDC says yes, please get your flu shot. If you're pregnant, you're safe to get the jab at any time. For one, it's for your health. In fact, due to changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy, you might actually be at greater risk of complications from the flu (including hospitalization), so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated so you can avoid that risk.“It's important to recognize that getting the flu is more likely to cause severe sickness during pregnancy compared to people who are not pregnant,” Dr. Pathak says. “People who are pregnant (and up to two weeks postpartum) are at a higher risk for hospitalization from the flu. This impacts the parent's health, but also the health of the baby,” she notes. How does getting a flu shot help protect your baby too?By getting the flu vaccine, you also protect your baby as soon as it’s born, as the antibodies get passed in vitro, according to the CDC. That's really important since babies themselves aren't cleared for a flu shot until they're six months old. Related Story‘How COVID Vaccine Disinformation Preys On Women’In addition to this, fever is one of the most common symptoms of the flu—and in pregnant people, a high internal body temperature can lead to defects in an infant's neural tubes (the structure from which the brain and spinal cord form, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine), which could harm the baby, per the CDC. And while this outcome is very rare, it wouldn’t hurt if you exercised precaution. In short, the flu shot decreases your risk of getting sick with the flu, and thus lowers your risk of high fevers that could impact your baby’s health, Pathak says. What are the risks for parents who end up contracting the flu?“It’s strongly recommended that people get the flu shot,” confirms Rachel Urrutia, MD, assistant professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “The flu can be more severe for pregnant people, compared to other times in a person’s life. The immune system is less strong, and the airways involved in breathing are more swollen, so this can make the flu more serious,” she says.Then, there's the complications from the flu. “Pregnant people have a higher risk of getting pneumonia and being hospitalized,” Dr. Pathak adds. “The flu shot decreases the risk for hospitalization by 40 percent,” she says. And when the health of yourself and your baby is on the line? That 40 percent makes all the difference. Okay, are there any extra precautions pregnant women should take?Yep—the CDC, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), suggests getting the actual flu shot, not the nasal spray.“The nasal spray contains a live virus,” says Dr. Urrutia. “We don’t recommend any vaccines with a live virus for pregnant people," she says. That's not necessarily because the spray will cause the flu, but because pregnant person's immune systems are already lowered, so the active virus could potentially cause a slight fever. Related Story10 Flu Shot Side Effects You Should Know About Keep in mind, however, that some people might still get a low-grade fever (below 100) and feel slightly tired or achey even after the shot, says Dr. Urrutia, and that’s normal. “Your body is creating an immune response to the vaccine,” she says. If your fever goes above 100, or you get other symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath, then get a medical appointment, ASAP.But from there, the precautions pregnant people should take are just like the precautions anyone else should heed—which means not getting the flu shot if you're allergic to it or if you're ill with a fever (just wait 'til you feel better in that case).In addition to the shot, pregnant people should take the typical precautions for sidestepping the flu. That includes your regular germ-avoiding tactics, like washing your hands, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and staying away from other sick people, says Dr. Urrutia.Are there any other important vaccinations pregnant people should get? The most important vaccines to get during pregnancy are the flu shot, the COVID-19 vaccine, and the Tdap vaccine, which can prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, Dr. Pathak says. Related StoryHow Long Does The Flu Shot Last?Here’s why: “COVID infection is dangerous for pregnant people and their unborn babies, so being vaccinated protects parent and baby,” says Pathak. “The Tdap vaccine is best to get during every pregnancy between 27 to 36 weeks. This helps protect the baby from whooping cough in the first few months after birth, when they are most at risk,” Dr. Pathak adds. If you’re still confused about the flu vaccine as well as other immunizations with regard to your pregnancy, check with your doctor about what is best for you before making an appointment.

(Photo: KATV)TOPICS:Arkansas,United StatesPFIZER INC.PfizerHealth Medical PharmaJennifer DillahaArkansansClinical MedicineFlu SeasonLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KATV) — While cases of COVID-19 are on the decline in Arkansas, state health officials fear a more intense flu season could be on its way, and with it, fears of a winter surge in coronavirus cases.Despite the rigorous testing and efficacy of both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, thousands choose to skip both shots. For many, getting the flu shot is part of their yearly routine, but some remain hesitant when it comes to COVID-19."We are hoping that people will get both if they haven't gotten the COVID-19 vaccine already, you can get them at the same time," Dr. Jennifer Dillaha with the Arkansas Department of Health said.On average, 768,105 Arkansans get their flu shot per year. According to the ADH, 765,880 got the flu shot during the 2018-2019 season, 805,505 during the 2019-2020 season and 732,929 during the 2020-2021 season.Since the COVID-19 vaccine was approved in December to the end of last flu season in April 2021, 637,821 Arkansans were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 1,558,345 doses of the COVID-19 were given in total and 335,731 Arkansans were partially immunized.Dillaha said it's especially important for certain groups to get both the flu and COVID-19 vaccine because they're at higher risk of severe disease if they contract either virus."That would include pregnant women, and it would include people with chronic health problems such as diabetes or asthma, and it would include older adults, people who are 65 and older," she said. "School children are very good at spreading respiratory viruses among themselves, including COVID-19, flu is one of them, and there are other respiratory viruses that circulated school."According to the ADH, children can catch the flu more often than adults but they usually aren’t as sick. Parents should keep their sick children at home so they do not spread the flu to others. For older adults and others who are at risk of complications, the flu vaccine can reduce hospitalizations by as much as 70 percent and deaths by 85 percent.From Sept. 27, 2020, to April 20, 2021, 2,180 positive cases of the flu were reported to the ADH. However, reported cases reflect only a portion of the actual numbers of flu cases in the state. Among flu antigen tests last season that could distinguish between influenza A and B virus types, ADH reported 38 percent were influenza A, and 62 percent were influenza B.From Sept. 27, 2020, to April 20, 2021, 252,467 cases of COVID-19 were reported."The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to protect people from getting symptomatic COVID about 80% of the time with the Delta variant in studies that have been done, about 80% of the people who get the COVID-19 will not have symptoms at all," Dillaha said. "With the flu on a good year, about 60% of the people who get the flu shot will not have symptoms at all."Dillaha said 23 flu deaths were reported last flu season, and some of those deaths were reported to have COVID-19 as well. During the 2019-2020 season, Arkansas reported 125 flu-related deaths.During flu season from Sept. 27, 2020, to April 20, 2021, Arkansas reported 4,398 COVID-19 deaths."You just don't want both at the same time, and if people do get the vaccine, their chances of getting the flu are reduced, and the chances that they would end up in the hospital is much reduced," Dillaha said.According to the department of health, nationally, 25-50 million flu infections are reported every year. More than 200,000 people are hospitalized, and 23,600 die.Dillaha said for both viruses, getting vaccinated is key."The great benefit of both of those vaccines, of course, is preventing severe disease, keeping people out of the hospital if they're unlucky enough to get the flu or COVID-19, and then, of course, keeping them alive."Walk-in flu shots are available at open health units across Arkansas.

Most common side effects to watch out forTIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 7, 2021, 16:33 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us 1/8Most common side effects of flu vaccine to watch out forSimilar to the novel coronavirus, the Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. It infects the nose, throat and the lungs and can affect both adults and children alike.A person infected with flu may develop symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose and body aches. In more severe cases, it may induce nausea and gastrointestinal issues.Read more: Severe signs of viral illness and flu you should not ignoreAccording to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, flu cases during the 2020-2021 season were "unusually low". This contributes to the nationwide lockdowns and high levels of vigilance shown by the people. However, with restrictions lifted and people becoming more relaxed (wreckless), not only did global COVID-19 cases surge, but there was also an increase in flu cases.That said, health officials have urged people to not only get themselves vaccinated against the SARs-COV-2 virus, but also against flu.2/8Why should you get your flu shot now?With the onset of COVID-19, there was a major drop in the number of flu cases in India and abroad as compared to the pre-COVID era.According to data, in 2020, the total number of flu cases was 2,752 with 44 deaths as opposed to 28,798 cases and 1,218 deaths in 2019. Besides the decrease in the number of testing, along with the similarities in the symptoms of COVID and flu, doctors believe that masking and social distancing is what curbed the spread of the viruses.Read more: Flu pandemic could be more deadly than COVID: All you need to knowHowever, the recent state of affairs only suggest that people are more relaxed and less concerned about safety measures, which automatically can lead to a rise in the number of flu cases.This is why, medical professionals continue to urge people to receive their flu vaccines on time so as to help lessen the burden of the healthcare system and also to reduce any serious complications.3/8Can you get a flu and COVID-19 vaccine together?COVID-19 is still rampant and it seems like it is here to stay. That said, getting your COVID vaccines is of utmost importance. Simultaneously, you must also take your flu shots immediately.According to updated guidelines about COVID-19 vaccines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you can now get your COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot at the same time as another vaccine, such as the flu shot.Earlier CDC guidelines recommended a hold on other vaccines within 14 days of getting COVID vaccine.4/8Side effects to expect from a flu shot?All vaccines, be it COVID-19 vaccine or a flu shot cause side effects, which diminish over time and are manageable.According to the World Health Organization, "Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body." "This weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen," the health body adds.Following a vaccination, there is an inflammatory response, which in turn leads to certain side effects that are temporary and can be eased.That said, when it comes to flu vaccines, one might experience some mild side effects. Very rarely does a person experience allergic reactions.5/8Pain and soreness at the site of injectionIntramuscular flu vaccines are likely to cause pain at the injection site, which may lead to discomfort. While the soreness may be painful, it will fade away in a day or two. Do not touch the affected area and keep moving your arm from time to time. This will allow good blood circulation around the area.Read more: Flu and dengue cases on the rise amidst COVID-19: Sure shot ways to keep yourself safe from dengue, malaria and chikungunya6/8HeadachesPost vaccination, a person may develop headaches too. While it may interrupt day to day functions, it is not long term and will diminish over time.7/8Mild feverFever is one of the most common and prevalent side effects of vaccines. It occurs due to the inflammatory responses in the body triggered by the vaccine vial.8/8Do nasal flu sprays cause different side effects?When it comes to protecting oneself for flu infections, apart from the intramuscular vaccines, nasal sprays are also available. It is made from weakened flu viruses, which cannot cause any infection.Fever, chills, body aches, cough, runny nose, congestion, fatigue, and sore throat are some of the most common side effects from nasal flu sprays. You may either develop all of these symptoms or just some of them.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousMeet Honey Singh's beautiful new girlfriend Heera Sohhalindia10 nuts and how much protein they containindiaMust-try food experiences in New ZealandFoodHow to grow Methi saag on your kitchen window or balconyindiaAvneet Kaur’s animal print style is a fashion extravaganzaindia10 steps to get out of a toxic relationshipindiaIsha Malviya's most iconic lehenga looksindia​10 classic Pakistani sarees popular among actresses​indiaHow to make protein-rich Paneer Paratha for breakfastFood Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Kamya condemns Vivian; lauds Karan Veer MehraAll you need to know about Kashish-Digvijay's controversyBB18: Sara emotionally touches Eisha & Avinash's feetsBB 18's evicted Arfeen: Vivian was very aloof in the game but..BB 18: Arfeen Khan gets evicted from the showBB 18 promo: Rohit Shetty school Karan Veer MehraBB 18: Kanwar on netizens slamming him for the 'marriage proposal controversy'Bigg Boss 18 promo: Rohit Shetty schools SaraBigg Boss 18: Elvish Yadav comes out in support of Rajat123 Photostories 8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf water​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Sunil Grover facing flak in The Great Indian Kapil Show to Bigg Boss OTT 3 fame Sana Sultan’s wedding; Top TV newsBigg Boss 18: Exclusive- Kanwar Dhillon reacts to netizens slamming him for the 'marriage proposal controversy' with Alice Kaushik; says 'Tawa garam tha aur log roti sekne aa gaye'​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from schoolHow tall are Trump family members​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the world123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

But one of the most interesting features of Spanish Flu was its ‘W’ shaped mortality age profile. This article attempts to look at the age specific mortality of Spanish-Flu and derives lessons related to demography from Spanish-Flu which can help our present Covid-affected world. Age Specific Mortality: Spanish Flu and Covid-19 Fig.1 shows the age specific mortality of Spanish-Flu in the US (Similar to other Spanish-Flu affected states). It can be observed that although mortality is highest among the 60-plus and less-than-5 age groups, the mortality shows a peak among the 20-40 age group. This is uncharacteristic of Pandemics, like say Covid-19 (refer Fig.2), where most deaths occur among the very young and the very old, with a higher survival rate for those in between. This phenomenon acquires significance for Covid-19 pandemic due to its own changing age distribution (Boehmer, et al., 2020). Although the mortality among 20-40 age group doesn’t show a peak for Covid-19, reports from India (TOI, 2021) indicate that the mortality among this group is increasing with time. This development is similar to Spanish-Flu where most of the 20-40 age group deaths occurred during the 2nd and 3rd waves. Death of Working Age Population Since Spanish-Flu was so deadly for 20-to-40-year-olds, it deprived families of their breadwinners and communities of their pillars. This left large number of elderly and orphans with no means of support (Spinney, 2018). The negative labour supply shock and increased wages also accentuated migration to areas hardest hit by the pandemic (Saavedra, 2020). In the context of Covid-19, a potential ‘W’ shaped mortality profile might adversely affect countries that has larger number of dependants and can increase the demand for labour. This may mean that countries open their borders for migrants to bridge the labour supply shock. Importance of Public Health Spanish-Flu affected people from all socio-economic backgrounds. The cognitive shift that nobody is immune, that was caused by the Spanish-Flu, is considered to have ushered in changes to public health strategy in many European Countries. These countries, after recovering from Spanish-Flu, created or re-organised their health ministries, and embraced the concept of socialised medicine– healthcare for all, free at the point of delivery (Spinney, 2018). Similarly, the global outlook to the public health systems needs to become more realistic to reflect the different dimensions of the health crisis that we are facing because of Covid-19. This is especially true at a time when the poor and vulnerable, affected by the virus, are facing difficulties in accessing treatments and other facilities (CDC, 2020). Conclusion The demographic impact of Covid-19 needs more attention in the mainstream discourse. This calls for better data on age specific mortality and targeted policies based on demographic patterns emerging from the data. Covid-19 will very likely impact labour supply and migration, like any other major pandemic, but how it plays out in the context of Covid-19’s demographic impact, border closures and anti-globalization rhetoric is going to be significant. Nonetheless, mortality age profile of Covid-19 has important implications beyond what is obvious on the surface. Works Cited Boehmer, T. K., DeVies, J., Caruso, E., Santen, K. L., Tang, S., Black, C.

How to differentiate between symptoms and what to do when your child is sickTIMESOFINDIA.COM / Oct 9, 2021, 15:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us 1/7What should you do if your child gets sick right now?The changing weather and ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought along an influx of different viruses in play, and led to a repeated uptick of routine infections as well. While we are currently observing a slow rise in COVID-19 cases, there's been a sharp rise in the number of cold, flu, dengue as well as other respiratory infections being reported right now, which also means difficult news for the kids.2/7Why are so many infections rising right now?Not only are kids said to be at risk for COVID with the onset of the third wave, experts worldwide are hinting that there's been a daunting rise in the number of respiratory infections and severe viral infections being reported in the younger population. While kids have remained out of danger for more than a year, being 'unexposed' is now leading to a crisis, and making their immunity even weaker than before, which is leading to a sharp rise in cases. Those who have previously been naturally exposed to any of the infections are now also at the risk of losing out on the immune protection, and contract the illness. But how do you tell symptoms apart, when it comes to kids?With more and more schools opening up and kids resuming pre-pandemic life back, with or without a vaccine, here's how to know if your child's infection symptoms are that of COVID, flu, dengue or just a regular cold, and the next steps to take?3/7How to recognize a COVID infection right nowEven though overall cases are ebbing, with adult vaccinations and natural exposures, kids can still be very much at risk and if a third COVID wave is to come, we could see many pediatric COVID cases gain significance. Having said that, a COVID infection in kids is said to be much milder or asymptomatic in comparison to adults, but still needs to be critically monitored. Be it the Alpha or the Delta variant, the most concerning symptoms of COVID to watch out for in kids, especially with them returning to schools are:-A moderate to high fever, lasting for upto 4 days-Persistent cough and runny nose-Appetite loss, upset tummy-Red-bluish discolouration around fingers and toes, rashes (known as COVID toes)-Nausea-Headaches and body pain-Runny, red eyes-Troubled breathing4/7Symptoms of a dengue infection to spotWith the COVID-19 pandemic, dengue virus has also made a sudden appearance and with a new serotype in prevalence, there's a threat that the new variant, namely the DENV-2 variant could cause severe complications and even lead to a rise in hospitalization. While the symptoms of dengue can come up 4-10 days post the bite of the aedes mosquito, the most common symptoms of the infection, in kids could be-High fever, which doesn't settle quick (reaching over 105 degrees Fahrenheit)-Congestion-Headache, chills and body pain-Nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain-Rashes over the body-Pain behind the eyes -Joint pain, myalgia-Acute fatigue5/7Dangers of the viral fluThe viral flu, too, much like the dengue, has made a comeback in a nastier form. While kids do occasionally catch flu and the viral fever through their growing years, cold and the viral flu right now, during the COVID pandemic can appear in worse forms simply because of 'lost immunity' and previous waning exposure to the virus. Similarly, certain respiratory complications, which were otherwise rarely seen before are seen to afflict the younger population in parts of Europe.With the influenza and viral fever, while there run a great risk of infection transmission, a viral flu can be mild amongst children and present the following symptoms:-A low or a moderate grade fever, lasting for 3-4 days-Cold and runny nose, with or without congestion-Persistent coughing.-Mild body pain, fatigue and weakness.6/7Could there be overlapping symptoms? Which symptoms can help differentiate?With all the three infections, there can be the risk of experiencing similar symptoms, which can delay diagnosis and in some cases, lead to inaccurate or wrong treatments. For one, all the three infections, caused by viruses could lead to common symptoms like a fever, some upper respiratory inflammation and body pain. However, of the three, dengue fever is the most unsettling one, since it's severe and lasts for a longer time.With COVID-19, seldom cough, cold, troubled breathing could be accompanied by a changed sense of taste or smell, with fever. In kids, these symptoms could persist for a shorter time, and fade away on their own, much like a viral fever or flu-like illness. 7/7What should be the next steps to take?If you do suspect your child to be sick, the first steps to take should focus on ensuring ample rest and recovery, isolating them from people around them (especially school) and then get testing done.With symptoms vaguely similar, experts recommend that parents be on the lookout for the onset of symptoms, suspected exposure, if at all other people around them get sick (especially with COVID) and then get a test done accordingly. In certain cases, it might also be recommended to get a COVID and dengue test done, at the same time. The other thing to ensure is to let the kid rest and monitor the symptoms accordingly. While kids can recover well under supervision and symptomatic treatment, look for any symptoms of worsening, or any signs of visible sickness and approach timely help.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousMeet Honey Singh's beautiful new girlfriend Heera Sohhalindia10 nuts and how much protein they containindiaMust-try food experiences in New ZealandFoodHow to grow Methi saag on your kitchen window or balconyindiaAvneet Kaur’s animal print style is a fashion extravaganzaindia10 steps to get out of a toxic relationshipindiaIsha Malviya's most iconic lehenga looksindia​10 classic Pakistani sarees popular among actresses​indiaHow to make protein-rich Paneer Paratha for breakfastFood Next123 Bigg Boss BB18: Kamya condemns Vivian; lauds Karan Veer MehraAll you need to know about Kashish-Digvijay's controversyBB18: Sara emotionally touches Eisha & Avinash's feetsBB 18's evicted Arfeen: Vivian was very aloof in the game but..BB 18: Arfeen Khan gets evicted from the showBB 18 promo: Rohit Shetty school Karan Veer MehraBB 18: Kanwar on netizens slamming him for the 'marriage proposal controversy'Bigg Boss 18 promo: Rohit Shetty schools SaraBigg Boss 18: Elvish Yadav comes out in support of Rajat123 Photostories 8countries where the Indian Rupee makes you feel rich5 reasons to wash hair with boiled guava leaf water​5 fruits that are high in protein (and how to eat them to get maximum protein)​5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Sunil Grover facing flak in The Great Indian Kapil Show to Bigg Boss OTT 3 fame Sana Sultan’s wedding; Top TV newsBigg Boss 18: Exclusive- Kanwar Dhillon reacts to netizens slamming him for the 'marriage proposal controversy' with Alice Kaushik; says 'Tawa garam tha aur log roti sekne aa gaye'​7 things kids want to hear from mom and dad when they return from schoolHow tall are Trump family members​10 Countries with lowest IQ in the world123lifestyle videos03:09Feeling sad and dissatisfied?

Fact Check No, Norway did not reclassify COVID-19 as a flu Image courtesy WhatsApp A misleading social media post claims the country considers COVID-19 no more dangerous than the ordinary flu Update: Paragraph added on 5 September 2021 to include link to Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) website. The ‘COVID-19-is-a-flu’ lie continues to circulate in a new guise. A viral post that looks like a news report claims that Norwegian health authorities have decided that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than “influenza or the cold virus”. The post came to the attention of Namibia Fact Check via WhatsApp and appears to have been circulating in Namibian WhatsApp and other social media groups. The viral post claims the following: Screenshot of a post that has gone viral globally claiming that Norway has reclassified COVID-19 as a flu. This latest false claim comparing COVID-19 to the flu has been debunked by fact checkers since it first started circulating online in late September 2021. The facts The false claim appears to have followed the publication of an interview with a Norwegian public health official that was published by Norwegian news website VG on 20 September 2021. The VG interview was with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) assistant director and vaccine manager, Geir Bukholm. The translated headline and introduction of a story by Norwegian website VG. However, the text of the viral post, which mimics a news report, that emerged on Namibian WhatsApp mirrors an article that was published by a website called ‘World Today News’, according to American fact checker PolitiFact. In an article published on 30 September 2021, PolitiFact indicated that they had interviewed an NIPH official and that it was stated to them that Bukholm “did not say that the coronavirus is no more dangerous than the flu. He said that most vaccinated people who are infected with the virus experience only cold-like symptoms”. ​ “It is not correct that the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has claimed that ‘Covid-19 is no more dangerous than ordinary flu,’” said a spokesperson for the institute.– PolitiFact It is clear from multiple fact check articles of the claim attributed to the Norwegian health official that his statements have been misrepresented by various online media outlets. Furthermore, there is no statement on the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) website speaking to the classification of COVID-19 as no more dangerous than “influenza or the cold virus”.

In an announcement on Saturday afternoon, the hospital revealed that due to the recent spike in fever and Acute Respiratory Infections presented to the Emergency Room and General OPD, the special dedicated GOPD has been established to attend to these cases. The fever GOPD will be attending to fever cases at the Health Center Building inside ADK Hospital and will be open from 4pm to 10pm every day. The establishment of the department will ensure rising cases in viral fever and ARI are attended to efficiently. Individuals who are experiencing symptoms of viral fever and common cold are urged to visit the fever GOPD for consultations. Further, a special Flu Clinic had been established by the Indhira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) on September 26. With an increase in common cold cases, the Flu Clinic was established for those who have symptoms to easily consult. The clinic is located in the Football Association of Maldives (FAM) building and will be open to the public from 8:30am to 10pm every day. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has warned caution in the midst of an alarming increase in wide-spreading common cold infections. Member of HPA’s Technical Advisory Group Dr. Nazla Mustafa revealed that although authorities have been successful in controlling the spread of Covid-19 nationwide, there have been an alarming surge in infections of the wide-spreading common cold. She urged caution, especially from students and their parents. As such, parents and guardians have been urged to refrain from sending children to school should they come down with the flu, as some cases are observed to be severe. Authorities were successful in their efforts to battle a fourth and more infectious wave of the pandemic in early May this year. Further, cases of influenza reported over the past few months have also been increasing. In September, 68 out of 209 samples tested for influenza returned positive to Influenza A.
