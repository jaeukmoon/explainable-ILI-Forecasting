It also delivers disease prevention messages and strengthens One Health networks at the state level and within agricultural communities across America. Background In 2011, after multiple outbreaks of influenza (flu) in people caused by viruses that normally spread in pigs, CDC created the Influenza and Zoonoses Education Among Youth in Agriculture program. This program was created in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Since then, CDC has worked with CSTE and USDA to promote One Health collaborations between federal and state public health and animal health authorities and state youth agriculture groups. Program goals and objectives Improve participant awareness and knowledge of variant and avian (bird) flu virus infections and other zoonotic diseases, including how diseases spread and how to prevent them. Motivate participants to adopt behaviors that can help prevent the spread of zoonotic disease. Help participants better understand the roles public and animal health play in disease prevention and how they work together to achieve the best health for both people and animals. Develop relationships among stakeholders to facilitate more effective and efficient responses to important public and animal health issues (for example, outbreak response). Foster inter-state collaboration around youth zoonotic disease education and outbreak response efforts, with the goal of creating a sustainable regional and national partnership network to implement this work. Increase participant awareness and knowledge of careers in public and animal health. Timeline History of the Youth in Agriculture Program 2011-2012 In response to multiple outbreaks of human illness caused by influenza viruses that normally spread in pigs, CDC’s Influenza Division identified opportunities to work with youth agriculture organizations to raise awareness and reduce the risk of future outbreaks. The Division brought together colleagues from CDC and USDA to discuss the creation of a federal/state network of human and animal health authorities to partner with 4-H and other organizations on zoonotic disease education and prevention. 2012 CDC and USDA piloted the Public Health Youth in Agriculture Education Project in partnership with Georgia 4-H. In less than two years, a curriculum was jointly developed and distributed by Georgia 4-H; the curriculum reached 90,000 youth in the state during the first year. 2014 CDC and USDA partnered with CSTE to provide technical assistance and funding to six health departments to launch state-run collaborations around zoonotic disease with 4-H and FFA. 2016 CDC and CSTE awarded additional funding to five health departments to build on their previous success and expand the project’s reach. This same year, some county fairs in Michigan experienced outbreaks of influenza A (H3N2) variant virus (also known as “H3N2v”). The existing partnership facilitated collaboration with youth agriculture clubs during the response. 2017- present CDC and CSTE awarded annual funding to at least 6 health departments and academic institutions each year to further expand the project’s reach. The program has developed stronger One Health collaborations and relationships among human and animal health stakeholders. Partners have produced dozens of resources, courses, activities, and materials to promote youth education. Resources CDC and CSTE created a resource library that includes in-person courses, online learning modules, activities, posters, and other print materials for fair settings, animal exhibits, and more.

Here we describe a pipeline to characterize and triage influenza viruses for their pandemic risk and examine the pandemic potential of two widespread swine origin viruses. Our analysis reveals that a panel of human sera collected from healthy adults in 2020 has no cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against a α-H1 clade strain (α-swH1N2) but do against a γ-H1 clade strain. The α-swH1N2 virus replicates efficiently in human airway cultures and exhibits phenotypic signatures similar to the human H1N1 pandemic strain from 2009 (H1N1pdm09). Furthermore, α-swH1N2 is capable of efficient airborne transmission to both naïve ferrets and ferrets with prior seasonal influenza immunity. Ferrets with H1N1pdm09 pre-existing immunity show reduced α-swH1N2 viral shedding and less severe disease signs. Despite this, H1N1pdm09-immune ferrets that became infected via the air can still onward transmit α-swH1N2 with an efficiency of 50%. These results indicate that this α-swH1N2 strain has a higher pandemic potential, but a moderate level of impact since there is reduced replication fitness and pathology in animals with prior immunity.

Influenza viruses exhibit strong host species preferences, which limits interspecies transmission, but they can evolve specific traits that allow sustained transmission within a new species. Although the major natural global reservoir of influenza virus is wild aquatic birds1, swine are an important natural host and can act as a mixing vessel for reassortment of the eight viral gene segments of influenza A viruses from different host species. For example, the most recent H1N1 influenza virus pandemic from 2009 (H1N1pdm09) emerged from swine following reassortment events2,3. Emergence of future pandemic strains is a continuing threat necessitating the monitoring and characterization of currently circulating swine viruses.Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the antigenicity of the surface viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA and NA are important determinants of virus infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, and host specificity and evolve seasonally due to antigenic drift. In swine, three endemic subtypes predominate: swH1N1, swH1N2, and swH3N2 (Fig. 1A), which have roughly equal detections over the last four and a half seasons4. In the United States, the H1 classical swine lineage (1A) is divided into clades including α-H1 (1A.1), β-H1 (1A.2), and γ-H1 (1A.3), while the pre-2009 human seasonal-origin swine lineage (1B) includes the δ-H1 (1B.2) clades5. The majority of circulating swine strains distributed across the United States are classified within three genetically and antigenically distinct clades from the H1 1A classical swine lineage (1A.1.1.3, 1A.3.3.2, 1A.3.3.3: Fig. 1B, C and Supplementary Fig. 1)4,6. Since the 2010-2011 influenza season, there have been 18 H1N1, 35 H1N2 and 439 H3N2 infections in humans with variants of swine origin in the United States, with six from the α-H1 clade and 21 from γ-H1 clade (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html).Fig. 1: Influenza A virus detected in swine between January 2019 and September 2023 in the USA.A Influenza A virus subtype detection proportions.

C Detections of α-swH1N2 (alpha) and γ-swH1N1 (gamma) influenza A virus in swine across the United States between 2019 and 2021. Data retrieved with permission from ISU FLUture65 on September 30, 2023.Full size imageThe current genetic diversity of influenza A virus (IAV) in swine reflects reassortment between avian-, swine-, and human-origin viruses, resulting in multiple lineages of the eight gene segments that continue to reassort among endemic swine strains. The subsequent antigenic drift of HA and NA while circulating in swine may result in viruses to which the human population may have little to no immunity7. Given the potential threat of such swine influenza viruses to humans, we created a decision tree to guide the characterization and pandemic risk assessment of endemic swine IAV (Fig. 2). Using a combination of both in vitro and in vivo methods, this decision tree capitalizes on the extensive research that has been conducted since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on the molecular properties that promote efficient airborne transmission of influenza8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.Fig. 2: Decision tree of influenza virus pandemic threat assessment.Boxes include in vitro and in vivo methods to characterize influenza virus strains. Yeso questions allow triage of strains into different pandemic risk assessment categories.Full size imageIn this work, we assess the pandemic potential of the γ-H1 (1A.3.3.3) clade strain A/swine/Minnesota/A02245409/2020 (herein referred to as ‘γ-swH1N1’) and an α-H1 (1A.1.1.3) clade strain A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020 (herein referred to as ‘α-swH1N2’) using this pipeline. These swine IAV clades were prioritized based on: detection frequency (Fig. 1B); geographical distribution (Fig. 1C); reported human variant events; significant loss in cross-reactivity to human seasonal vaccines or pre-pandemic candidate vaccine virus antisera7; limited detection by human population sera7; and interspecies transmission from pigs to ferrets21. We show that α-swH1N2 possesses more pandemic potential than γ-swH1N1 due to a lack of immunity in human serum samples, in vitro viral characteristics, and its ability to transmit via the air to both naïve ferrets and ferrets with prior immunity to seasonal influenza virus strains. Although α-swH1N1 can transmit between immune animals, its replication and disease severity appear to be reduced, suggesting that the impact of α-swH1N1 on human populations may be limited.ResultsCross-reactivity of human sera against swine influenza virusesA pandemic virus represents an antigenic shift, where a large proportion of the population is vulnerable due to a lack of immunity to this novel strain. To assess the presence of cross-reactive influenza virus-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, Box 1), human sera collected from healthy adults in Pennsylvania during the fall of 2020 were sorted by birth year and used in hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) (Fig. 3A) and neutralization assays (Fig. 3B). The prevalence of HAI and/or neutralizing antibodies against γ-swH1N1, α-swH1N2, or H1N1pdm09 was determined, and a threshold HAI titer of 40 was used as it is generally recognized as corresponding to a 50% reduction in the risk of infection22,23. H1N1pdm09 and γ-swH1N1-active antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies were found across all birth year cohorts tested, whereas no HAI titer or neutralizing antibodies were detected against α-swH1N2 in any of the birth years tested (Fig. 3A, B). In addition, sera from individuals who recently received an influenza virus vaccine were tested to analyze samples with peak immunity from circulating antibodies (Fig. 3C). Recently vaccinated individuals had neutralizing antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and γ-swH1N1, but not α-swH1N2 (Fig. 3C). Based on the decision tree (Fig. 2, Box 1), the presence of cross-reacting antibodies against γ-swH1N1 would funnel the virus to a lower pandemic risk, while α-swH1N2 would require further characterization. However, for this study, we proceeded to characterize both γ-swH1N1 and α-swH1N2 to provide empirical evidence for the decision tree criteria.Fig. 3: Cross-reactivity of human sera to swine γ-H1N1 and α-H1N2 influenza viruses.Pooled sera from the indicated number of humans for each decade of birth were tested for antibodies to H1N1pdm09 (red bars), γ-swH1N1 (purple bars), and α-swH1N2 (green bars) by HAI (A) and neutralization (B) assay. Data are presented as mean values +/− standard deviation (SD) from two biological replicates. Solid line in A indicates an HAI titer of 40, which corresponds to a 50% reduction in the risk of influenza virus infection. C Sera from individuals (N = 6) vaccinated in October 2021 (14 to 21 days post-vaccination) were assessed for cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. Each dot represents an individual sample and is an average of 2 technical replicates. The colored lines represent the mean values between all the individual biological samples. For A–C, dashed lines indicate the limit of detection for each assay.Full size imageMolecular characterization of swine strainsThe H1N1pdm09 HA segment is of swine-origin from the classical H1 lineage3. To examine the similarities between the three strains, amino acid differences of the γ-swH1N1 (Supplementary Fig. 2A) and the α-swH1N2 (Supplementary Fig. 2C) HA were mapped onto the H1N1pdm09 HA structure. The γ-swH1N1 HA has 46 amino acid differences as compared to the H1N1pdm09 HA, while α-swH1N2 has 86. Similarity between γ-swH1N1 and H1N1pdm09 HA likely accounts for the cross-neutralizing and cross-receptor blocking antibodies present in human serum (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2A, purple residues). Diversity in the α-swH1N2 HA is greatest in the globular HA head domain, at sites surrounding the receptor binding site (RBS) (130-strand, 140-loop, 150-loop, 190-helix and the 220-loop24) (Supplementary Fig. 2C, green residues). The otherwise conserved RBS is responsible for engaging cell surface sialic acids (SA). In the 130-strand, α-swH1N2 has a two-amino acid deletion (Supplementary Fig. 2D, yellow residues), which may impact antibody binding. Additionally, γ-swH1N1 and α-swH1N2 have an additional putative glycosylation site at the same position on the side of the HA head domain, whereas α-swH1N2 has a second putative glycosylation site near the apex of the HA and its three-fold axis of symmetry (Supplementary Fig. 2A, C, pink residues). The evolution of glycosylation sites is thought to contribute to immune escape by shielding antigenic sites on HA25,26,27. During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, differences in the number of putative glycosylation sites between H1N1pdm09 and seasonal viruses were associated with the lack of cross-neutralizing antibodies28. Differences in amino acids and glycosylation sites in the α-swH1N2 HA head could contribute to the lack of detectable cross-reactive antibodies observed in Fig. 3 compared to the γ-swH1N1 or alter receptor preference.Receptor preference of influenza A viruses is a critical host adaptive property and one known to be important for successful adaptation of influenza viruses to the human population29. Human and swine influenza viruses are known to have an α2-6 SA preference, while avian influenza viruses have an α2-3 SA preference. Analysis of H1N1pdm09 and recently circulating human seasonal H3N2 viruses suggests that human viruses adapt to preferential recognition of extended glycans capped with α2-6 SA29,30,31,32,33. Analysis of α-swH1N2 receptor specificity using a glycan array with a focused panel of α2-3- and α2-6-linked sialoside glycans showed a strict specificity for glycans with α2-6 sialic acids. For N-linked glycans extended with 1-3 LacNAc (Galβ1-4GlcNAc) repeats, clear preference is shown for extended glycans with two (#46, #49) or three (#47, #50) LacNAc repeats over those with a single LacNAc repeat (#45, #48) (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table 1). Thus, the α-swH1N2 virus exhibits a receptor specificity well adapted for human-type receptors.Fig. 4: In vitro characterization of swine γ-H1N1 and α-H1N2 influenza viruses.A Binding of α-swH1N2 virus to a sialoside microarray containing glycans with α2-3 or α2-6 linked sialic acids representing avian-type and human-type influenza receptors, respectively. Bars represent the fluorescence intensity of bound α-swH1N2. Glycan structures corresponding to numbers are shown on the x-axis are found in Supplementary Table 1. Signal values are calculated from the mean intensities of 4 of 6 replicate spots with the highest and lowest signal omitted. B Replication of swine influenza virus in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) air-liquid interface cell cultures. HBE cell cultures were infected in triplicate with 103 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious dose 50) per well of H1N1pdm09, γ-swH1N1, or α-swH1N2. The apical supernatant was collected at the indicated time points and virus titers were determined on MDCK cells using TCID50 assays. A ratio of swine virus titer relative to H1N1pdm09 titer at 24 and 48 h of all HBE patient cell cultures is shown. Each dot represents an average of three technical replicates per HBE culture, and seven biological replicates from different HBE patient cultures are displayed. Data are presented as mean values +/− SD of the seven biological replicates each with three technical replicates. C Stability of α-swH1N2 influenza virus in small droplets over a range of relative humidity (RH) conditions. Ten 1 uL droplets of pooled virus from panel B were spotted into the wells of a tissue culture dish for 2 h. Decay of the virus at each RH was calculated compared to the titer of ten 1 uL droplets deposited and immediately recovered from a tissue culture dish. Log10 decay of HBE-propagated H1N1pdm09 (black) and α-swH1N2 (green) is shown and represents mean values (±SD) from eight biological replicates performed in three technical replicates. D H1N1pdm09 (gray, N = 8) and α-swH1N2 (green, N = 4) viruses were incubated in PBS solutions of different pHs for 1 h at 37 °C. Virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay and the EC50 values were plotted using regression analysis of the dose-response curve. The reported mean corresponds to at least four independent biological replicates, each performed in three technical replicates. E The NA activities of H1N1pdm09 (gray) and α-swH1N2 (green) were determined using an enzyme-linked lectin assay with fetuin as the substrate. Viruses were normalized for equal infectivity and displayed data are the mean (±SD) of three independent biological replicates performed in technical duplicates.Full size imageTo assess fitness of swine viruses to replicate within the human respiratory tract, replication capacity of γ-swH1N1 and α-swH1N2 was determined in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) patient cell cultures grown at an air-liquid interface (Fig. 4B). Multiple human HBE cultures were tested, and an H1N1pdm09 virus control was included in all experiments. The ratio of swine virus titer over H1N1pdm09 virus titer for each HBE culture is reported. The representative γ-swH1N1 strain replicated approximately half as well as H1N1pdm09, whereas the representative α-swH1N2 strain had a titer ratio of 0.71 and 0.81 at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that, regardless of deletions in the RBS 130-loop (Supplementary Fig. 2D, yellow residues), α-swH1N2 replicates to levels similar to H1N1pdm09 (Fig. 2, Box 2) and would support α-swH1N2 being selected for additional characterization of parameters correlated with efficient human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses (Fig. 2, Box 3).Airborne transmission requires viral persistence in expelled aerosols and droplets, which can be influenced by environmental conditions, including relative humidity (RH)34 or respiratory secretions like HBE airway surface liquid35,36. To study the impact of RH on influenza virus viability, droplets of H1N1pdm09 and α-swH1N2 viruses propagated from HBE cultures in Fig. 4B were exposed to different RH conditions. HBE-propagated H1N1pdm09 and α-swH1N2 experienced very little decay in infectivity at all RH tested (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that α-swH1N2 expelled in small droplets in the presence of human respiratory secretions remains viable over a range of RH conditions, which is important for efficient airborne transmission and viral persistence.In addition to receptor binding, HA-mediated membrane fusion between the viral envelope and cellular endosome is required for viral entry and is driven by pH changes. A conformational change in the HA from human influenza viruses is triggered between pH 5.3 and 5.5, while avian HA proteins are triggered at a higher pH range of 5.5 to 6.2, suggesting that human adaptation necessitates increased acid stability37. To determine the pH at which HA undergoes its conformational change, an acid stability assay was performed on H1N1pdm09 and α-swH1N2, as a surrogate for the pH of fusion20,38. The pH that reduces the viral titer by 50% (EC50) for α-swH1N2 was 5.3, which was similar to H1N1pdm09 at 5.0 (Fig. 4D), indicating that α-swH1N2 has a pH of fusion comparable to human influenza viruses, which is below pH 5.5.The neuraminidase activity of the NA receptor is necessary to cleave SA from the host cell surface and release the virus. A functional balance between HA and NA is necessary for airborne transmission of swine viruses18,19,39. Higher NA activity has also been implicated in the efficient airborne transmission of H1N1pdm09 compared to its swine precursor strains, which had very little NA activity12. To measure NA activity, we used an enzyme-linked lectin assay with fetuin as a substrate and a bacterial neuraminidase standard. The NA activity of α-swH1N2 was observed to be similar to that of H1N1pdm09 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these in vitro results indicate that α-swH1N2 has the molecular features consistent with a virus capable of airborne transmission and requires further characterization.Swine α-H1N2 airborne transmission in ferretsFollowing the decision tree criteria (Fig. 2), we next characterized α-swH1N2 in vivo for the efficiency of airborne transmission in the ferret model (Fig. 2, Box 4). Epidemiologically successful human seasonal influenza viruses transmit to naïve recipients after a 2-day exposure40. Using this methodology, experimentally infected α-swH1N2 donors were housed with naïve recipients in cages where the animals were separated by a divider. A successful transmission event was defined as recovery of infectious virus in recipient nasal secretions or seroconversion at 21 days post-infection (dpi). In the infected donors, α-swH1N2 was detected in nasal secretions on 1, 2, 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 5A, green bars). Four of four recipients without prior immunity shed α-swH1N2 starting 2 days post-exposure (dpe) (Fig. 5A, gray bars). All recipient animals seroconverted at 14 dpi, with increases in antibody titers the following week (Supplementary Table 2). These data indicate that α-swH1N2 transmits efficiently to animals without prior immunity within a short 2-day exposure, similar to published reports of H1N1pdm0940.Fig. 5: Swine α-H1N2 transmits efficiently via the air after a short exposure.A Schematic of experimental procedure to naïve recipients. Shaded gray box depicts exposure period. Four donor ferrets were infected intranasally with α-swH1N2 (α-swH1N2 INF), as in Methods. Recipient ferrets with no prior immunity (naïve recipients) were placed in the adjacent cages at 24 h post-infection for two continuous days. B Schematic of procedure, whereby four ferrets were infected with H3N2 A/Perth/16/2009 strain (H3N2-imm) 137 days prior to acting as recipients to α-swH1N2 infected donors. Four donor ferrets were infected with α-swH1N2 and H3N2-imm recipients were placed in the adjacent cage 24 h later. C Schematic of procedure, whereby four ferrets were infected with H1N1pdm09 (H1N1pdm09-imm) 126 days prior to acting as recipients to α-swH1N2 infected donors. H1N1pdm09-imm recipients were placed in the adjacent cage 24 h later. Nasal washes were collected from all ferrets on the indicated days and titered for virus by TCID50 (tissue culture infectious dose 50). Each bar indicates an individual ferret. Pairs of ferrets are matched with the shading type within the bar. For all graphs, the number of recipient ferrets with detectable virus in nasal secretions out of four total is shown; the number of recipient animals that seroconverted at 14- or 21-days post α-swH1N2 exposure out of four total is shown in parentheses. Gray shaded box indicates shedding of the donor during the exposure period. The limit of detection is indicated by the dashed line. Schematics in A–C were created with BioRender.com.Full size imagePandemic influenza viruses do not emerge in immunologically naïve populations as most individuals have experienced influenza by the age of 541. We have previously established a pre-immune ferret model that can be used to assess the pandemic potential of emerging strains in the context of prior immunity40. To determine the impact of pre-existing immunity on the transmission efficiency of α-swH1N2, four recipient ferrets were first infected with the H3N2 A/Perth/16/2009 strain (‘H3N2-imm recipient’) or H1N1pdm09 (‘H1N1pdm09-imm recipient’). Roughly 4 months later, once the response to the primary infection was allowed to wane40,42,43,44,45, these ferrets were then exposed to infected α-swH1N2 donors for 2 days (Fig. 5B and C). In replicate 1, four of four H3N2-imm recipients shed α-swH1N2 at 4 dpe (Fig. 5B), whereas only two of four shed virus in replicate 2 (Supplementary Fig. 3). All H3N2-imm recipients that shed virus also seroconverted with increasing antibody titers over time (Supplementary Table 2). All four of four H1N1pdm09-imm recipients seroconverted at 13dpe and had rising antibody titers at 20 dpe (Supplementary Table 2). Intriguingly, only one of four H1N1pdm09-imm recipients shed detectable levels of α-swH1N2 (Fig. 5C). It is possible that shedding of virus was missed in the recipients either because the nasal wash samples were not taken at 3 dpe or that replication of the virus was occurring in a place that was not sampled by the nasal wash, such as the mid-turbinates, nasopharynx, trachea, or lungs. However, based on serology we can conclude that all four H1N1pdm09 pre-immune animals were infected (Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest that α-swH1N2 can transmit to animals with prior immunity, which categorizes α-swH1N2 into the higher pandemic risk. However, whether naturally infected ferrets with prior immunity could spread the virus onward is unclear.Potential α-swH1N2 pandemic severityPerson-to-person airborne transmission is a concern for pandemic emergence and can be experimentally assessed using transmission chain experiments. Given the lack of detectable shedding of α-swH1N2 in three of four H1N1pdm09-imm recipients yet seroconversion in all four recipients in Fig. 5C, we examined whether H1N1pdm09-imm recipients would shed enough virus to onward transmit α-swH1N2 to naïve recipients. Two independent replicate transmission chains were performed with four α-swH1N2 infected donors being exposed to H1N1pdm09-imm recipients in the adjacent cage for 2 days. The exposed H1N1pdm09-imm recipients (R1) were then transferred to a new cage to act as donors to naïve recipients (R2) (Fig. 6A). In the first replicate (Fig. 6B), two of four R1 ferrets shed α-swH1N2, whereas in the second replicate (Fig. 6C), all four R1 ferrets had α-swH1N2 in their nasal secretions. Much of the viral shedding was observed on day 3 post exposure, which may account for the absence of robust shedding in Fig. 5C. When R1 ferrets became donors (Fig. 6B, C, pink box), only 50% of the infected donors transmitted α-swH1N2 onward to influenza immunologically naïve recipients. To further examine the ability of α-swH1N2 to transmit from H1N1pdm09-imm ferrets in the context of pre-existing immunity, a transmission chain experiment was performed using R2 recipients with H1N1pdm09 immunity (Fig. 6D). To ensure that the exposure window of viral shedding of R1 was captured, rapid antigen tests were performed immediately following the nasal wash; when positive, that animal was transferred into a cage to act as a donor animal to an H1N1pdm09 R2 immune ferret (Fig. 6D). In this study, all three R1 became infected and of these three α-swH1N2-infected H1N1pdm09-imm R1 recipients only one onward transmitted to the H1N1pdm09-imm R2 recipients (Fig. 6D). Seroconversion only occurred in R1 and R2 recipients that shed detectable α-swH1N2 virus (Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest that onward transmission of α-swH1N2 is possible, even in the context of pre-existing immunity, contributing to a higher risk potential of α-swH1N2.Fig. 6: Swine H1N2 virus transmission chain.A Schematic of transmission chain experiment in B and C (image created with BioRender.com). Four ferrets were infected with H1N1pdm09 (R1) 127 days before being exposed to a donor that was infected with α-swH1N2 24 h prior. After a 2-day exposure, H1N1pdm09-imm recipients were transferred to a new transmission cage to act as the donors. The transfer of each R1 animal was done without knowledge of its infection status. A naïve recipient (R2) was immediately placed in the adjacent cage and exposed for 2 days. The transmission chain experiment was performed two independent times. Nasal secretions were collected for all animals on the indicated days post-infection or post-exposure, with each bar representing the virus titer shed by an individual animal for replicate 1 (B) and replicate 2 (C). Pairs of ferrets can be matched based on the patterns in the bars. Gray shaded boxes indicate the days upon which the α-swH1N2 infected (α-swH1N2 INF) donor was exposing the H1N1pdm09-imm recipient (R1), and the pink shaded box indicates the days upon which R1 was acting as the donor to R2. Limit of detection is denoted by a dashed line. The numbers in parentheses indicate the proportion of animals that seroconverted. D Donors were infected with α-swH1N2 24 h prior to exposing H1N1pdm09-imm recipients. Nasal washes from R1 recipients were collected and immediately tested using a rapid antigen test. Once positive for influenza virus antigen, the H1N1pdm09-imm R1 recipient was moved into a new transmission cage to act as the donor and expose an H1N1pdm09-imm R2 recipient for 2 days. # indicates the 2-day window in which each of the R1 ferret exposed the R2 recipients.Full size imageWe next examined the impact of prior influenza virus exposure on α-swH1N2 replication and pathogenesis; ferrets with no prior immunity, pre-existing immunity against H3N2 (H3N2-imm) or H1N1pdm09 (H1N1pdm09-imm) were intranasally infected with α-swH1N2 and their nasal secretions were collected over time. No difference in α-swH1N2 titers was observed between H3N2-imm ferrets and those with no prior immunity from 1-3 dpi, however, H3N2-imm ferrets cleared α-swH1N2 by 5 dpi (Fig. 7A). This observation is consistent with our previous reports of a reduced viral shedding period in animals with heterosubtypic immunity40,46. Interestingly, ferrets with pre-existing H1N1pdm09-imm shed significantly less α-swH1N2 virus on 1, 2, and 3 dpi as compared to ferrets with no prior immunity (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7: H1N1pdm09-immune ferrets have reduced α-swH1N2 viral titers in nasal secretions and tissues.A Ferrets with no pre-existing immunity (α-swH1N2, N = 4) or those infected with H3N2 137 days prior (H3N2/α-swH1N2, N = 4) were intranasally infected with α-swH1N2. The mean ± SD viral titers from nasal secretions are shown with each circle representing an individual animal. Two-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine statistically significant differences. B α-swH1N2 mean ± SD viral titers from nasal secretions from animals with no prior immunity (α-swH1N2, N = 8) or those infected with H1N1pdm09 126 days prior (H1N1pdm09/α-swH1N2, N = 4). Two-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine statistically significant differences. C Respiratory tissues from α-swH1N2 infected ferrets with no prior immunity (green; N = 10), H3N2 prior immunity (orange; N = 4), or H1N1pdm09 prior immunity (blue; N = 2) were collected at 5 dpi. Graphs show the mean hatched bar ± SD of viral titers for all biological replicates presented as individual data points. SP-soft palate, NT-nasal turbinates. (D) Respiratory tissues from α-swH1N2 infected ferrets with no prior immunity (green; N = 4) or H1N1pdm09 prior immunity (blue; N = 4) were collected at 3 dpi. Graphs show the mean hatched bar ± SD of viral titers for all biological replicates presented as individual data points. Two-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine statistically significant differences. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection for all graphs.Full size imageTo characterize tissue-specific α-swH1N2 replication, infected ferrets from panels 7A and 7B were sacrificed at 5 dpi and the respiratory tract was collected for viral titration (Fig. 7C). In ferrets with no prior immunity, robust replication was detected in the lungs, trachea, soft palate, and nasal turbinates, whereas H3N2-imm ferrets only had detectable α-swH1N2 in the soft palate (Fig. 7C). H1N1pdm09-imm ferrets had completely cleared α-swH1N2 from their respiratory tracts on day 5, as no detectable infectious virus was detected in any of the collected tissues (Fig. 7C). Since viral titers from nasal washes were already reduced in these animals by 3 dpi, we next assessed viral replication in the respiratory tract at this time point. H1N1pdm09-imm and non-immune ferrets were infected with α-swH1N2 and sacrificed on day 3 (Fig. 7D). H1N1pdm09-imm ferrets had detectable α-swH1N2 in the respiratory tract, although viral titers were significantly less in the lungs and nasal turbinates compared to animals without prior immunity. Taken together, these data indicate that prior H1N1pdm09 immunity can reduce the viral load in the ferret respiratory tract and decrease time to clearance of α-swH1N2.To extend the observation on viral titers, we compared the lung pathology of α-swH1N2-infected ferrets with no prior immunity to those with H1N1pdm09 pre-existing immunity (from Fig. 7D). Regardless of immunity, at 3 dpi α-swH1N2-infected ferrets had bronchial glands that were multifocally necrotic and contained neutrophils as well as peripheral lymphocytes, whereas uninfected ferrets had intact glands and no inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 4). The bronchioles from infected ferrets with no prior immunity were ulcerated and had evidence of macrophage and neutrophil accumulation within the airway lumen, whereas, H1N1pdm09-imm ferrets were similar to uninfected ferrets in that their bronchioles were clear of cellular debris with intact ciliated columnar lining epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, H1N1pdm09-imm alveolar interstitium had large airways that were clear with mild to moderate peripheral lymphocytic infiltrates and blood vessels that were multifocally surrounded by edema and lymphocytic infiltrates (Supplementary Fig. 4). In the absence of prior immunity, the large airways of the alveolar interstitium were partially ulcerated and filled with immune cells, and the alveolar spaces were filled with fibrin edema (Supplementary Fig. 4). These data indicate that pre-existing H1N1pdm09 immunity can reduce the pathology caused by α-swH1N2 infection.Lastly, we examined the clinical outcomes for α-swH1N2 infected ferrets during these studies by cataloging the activity, weight loss, and other signs of the animals47. Intranasally α-swH1N2-infected ferrets with no prior immunity and H3N2-imm displayed a similar number of symptoms, while intranasally infected H1N1pdm09-imm ferrets displayed almost no symptoms (Fig. 8A). Ferrets with no prior immunity displayed a greater range of symptoms than those with pre-existing immunity (Fig. 8C). In airborne-infected animals, all ferrets, regardless of immunity, displayed a similar mean total number of symptoms (Fig. 8B), which included similar clinical signs over multiple days such as reduced activity scores, nasal discharge and weight loss (Fig. 8D). Overall, ferrets intranasally or airborne infected with α-swH1N2 had mild symptoms, which varied by the category of symptoms. Taken together, although α-swH1N2 can still transmit between immune animals, its replication and severity of symptoms appear to be limited by prior immunity.Fig. 8: Pre-existing H1N1pdm09 immunity reduces swine α-H1N2 influenza virus clinical signs.A The symptoms for each intranasally α-swH1N2-infected ferret from Figs. 5 and 6 having either no prior immunity (N = 22), H1N1pdm09-imm (N = 6) or H3N2-imm (N = 4) were added together to assign each animal a cumulative score. Each dot represents the cumulative symptoms score for a single ferret. Two-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine statistically significant differences (*p = 0.0452). B The symptoms for each airborne α-swH1N2-infected ferret from Figs. 5 and 6 having either no prior immunity (N = 7), H1N1pdm09-imm (N = 10) or H3N2-imm (N = 4) were added together to assign each animal a cumulative score. Each dot represents the cumulative symptoms score for a single ferret. C Percent number of intranasally infected ferrets from panel A displaying each symptom on the indicated days post-infection. D Percent number of recipient ferrets from B displaying each symptom on the indicated days post-exposure.

Swine viruses are particularly concerning, given their agricultural importance that places them within close physical proximity to humans and the wide diversity of swine influenza strains48. Current risk assessment of pandemic threats is done through the WHO and CDC risk assessment tools49,50, which use subject-area expert opinion to assign weighted scores for various categories and limited experimental data derived from multiple different in vitro and in vivo sources. In this study, we present a streamlined, adaptable strategy to experimentally triage influenza viruses that reduces the need for complete virus characterization since certain criteria must be met before proceeding to the next box in the decision tree. This pipeline represents a breathable framework that can and will be updated as additional data from characterization studies are conducted.Using our decision tree, we analyzed representative circulating swine H1 strains from the alpha and gamma genetic clades that have a wide geographic distribution, are frequently detected in swine populations in the United States (Fig. 1C), and have exhibited sporadic human spillover events51. Previous representatives of the α-swH1N2 clade were shown to have antigenic distance from human vaccine strains, reduced recognition by human sera from two different cohorts6, and transmitted efficiently from infected pigs to naive recipient ferrets52. While highly efficient at controlling antigenically similar influenza viruses, antibodies directed towards HA become less effective over each subsequent flu season as surface glycoproteins rapidly mutate through antigenic drift. No cross-neutralizing antibodies were detected against α-swH1N2 in H1N1pdm09- or H3N2-imm ferrets (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that an initial infection with human seasonal viruses does not produce antibodies that cross-neutralize, and this was consistent with our human serum data (Fig. 3). Interestingly, human sera across all birth years tested had variable levels of anti-N2 antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 5), which may suggest that this NA-based immunity could provide some level of protection in a subset of the population53,54,55,56. Our prior work previously determined that prior immunity can influence the susceptibility to heterosubtypic viruses in a mechanism not mediated by neutralizing antibodies40. Thus, prior immunity from divergent strains can impact susceptibility of viruses through the air. We found that α-swH1N2 transmitted efficiently through the air to ferrets regardless of immune status, but the severity of disease after experimental infection with α-swH1N2 was lower in animals with prior immunity. A similar phenomenon may explain the lower-than-expected morbidity and mortality of the 2009 pandemic in humans57.Protection against emerging influenza virus strains in hosts without neutralizing antibodies can be conferred from CD8+ T cells, which recognize conserved internal influenza virus proteins. Although prior adaptive immunity may not prevent influenza virus infection, CD8+ T cells that display cross-reactivity against different subtypes of influenza virus have been linked to more efficient clearance of virus and faster recovery from illness58,59,60. Indeed, prior immunity to human seasonal viruses was not protective against α-swH1N2 airborne infection (Fig. 5B, C). Encouragingly, experimentally infected ferrets with pre-existing immunity were able to clear α-swH1N2 faster and H1N1pdm09 immunity resulted in an overall decrease in virus shedding over time (Fig. 7B) and decreased lung pathology early during infection (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, the lack of disease severity in immune animals may also provide an opportunity for this virus to spread undetected and gain a foothold in the population, creating a pandemic risk. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this α-swH1N2 virus strain poses a higher pandemic risk than γ-swH1N1 that warrants continued surveillance efforts to capture zoonotic events and an increased campaign to vaccinate swine against this H1 clade to reduce the amount of virus in source populations.MethodsGenetic analysis and strain selectionAll available swine H1 HA sequences from the USA collected between January 2019 and December 2021 were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Research Center (BV-BRC)61. These data (n = 2144) were aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended human seasonal H1 HA vaccine sequences and candidate vaccine sequences. The swine and human IAV HA sequences were aligned using mafft v762, and a maximum likelihood phylogeny for the alignment was inferred, following automatic model selection, using IQ-TREE v263 and visualized using smot v1.0.064 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The evolutionary lineage and genetic clade of each swine HA gene was identified using the BV-BRC Subspecies Classification tool, and the predominant clades and their geographic distribution were identified4,65. The 1 A and 1B lineages were detected in the USA and the genetic clades 1A.3.3.3 (38%, n = 806), 1B.2.1 (29%, n = 622), 1A.3.3.2 (12%, n = 263), 1A.1.1.3 (11%, n = 233), 1B.2.2.1 (5%, n = 109) and 1B.2.2.2 (3%, n = 69) represented 98% of detections. Given human variant detections, evidence for interspecies transmission, a significant reduction in cross-reactivity to human seasonal vaccines or candidate vaccine viruses, and limited detection by human population sera, we prioritized the 1A.1.1.3 and 1A.3.3.3 clades for characterization7,21. Representative selections within these clades were identified by generating an HA1 consensus sequence and identifying the best-matched field strain to the consensus that had an NA and internal gene constellation that reflected the predominant evolutionary lineages detected in surveillance (1A.1.1.3/α-swH1N2, A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020, 97.2% to HA1 consensus: and 1A.3.3.3/γ-swH1N1, A/swine/Minnesota/A02245409/2020, 98.5% to consensus). Furthermore, the selected viruses had NA and internal gene patterns that matched the predominant evolutionary lineages detected between 2019–2021 (https://flu-crew.org/octoflushow/). The 1A.1.1.3/α-swH1N2 was paired with a N2-2002A gene with a TTTTPT internal gene constellation, and the 1A.3.3.3/γ-swH1N1 was paired with a N1-Classical gene with a TTTPPT internal gene constellation.Cells and virusesMadin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (ATCC, CCL-34) were maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine. Primary HBE cell cultures were derived from human lung tissue that were differentiated and cultured at an air-liquid interface using a protocol approved by the relevant institutional review board at the University of Pittsburgh66. The influenza A virus strains, A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020 (α-swH1N2, 1A.1.1.3) and A/swine/Minnesota/A02245409/2020 (γ-swH1N1, 1A.3.3.3) were obtained from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) repository for the USDA IAV-S surveillance system. Reverse genetic derived strains of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) were a generous gift from Dr Jesse Bloom (Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, Seattle). The eight plasmids were transfected using Mirus TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent into 293 T cells (ATCC). Supernatants were collected at 72-h post-transfection and used to infect a monolayer of MDCK cells to produce a cell passage stock of virus.TCID50 assayMDCK cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plate three days prior to the assay. Cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by addition of 180 μL of Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with Anti-Anti, L-glutamine and 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. 20 μL of virus was diluted in the first row and tenfold serial dilutions on cells were performed. The assay was carried out across the plate with the last row as the cell control without virus. The cells were incubated for 96 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and scored for cytopathic effect (CPE).Serological assaysHemagglutination inhibition (HAI) was used to assess the presence of receptor-binding antibodies to HA protein from the selected viruses in human sera. Briefly, one-part sera were treated with three parts receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) overnight at 37°C to remove non-specific inhibitors. The following day, the sera was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and six parts of normal saline added. In a V-bottom microtiter plate, two-fold serial dilutions of RDE-treated sera were performed and incubated with eight hemagglutinating units of virus for 15 min. Turkey red blood cells were added at a concentration of 0.5% and incubated for 30 min. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited hemagglutination was determined to be the HAI titer. The titer of neutralizing antibodies was determined using the microneutralization assay. Human or ferret sera was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and serially diluted 2-fold in a 96-well flat-bottom plate. 103.3 TCID50 of influenza virus was incubated with the sera for 1 h at room temperature before being transferred to a 96-well plate on confluent MDCK cells. Sera was maintained for the duration of the experiment and CPE was determined on day 4 post-infection. The neutralizing titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum required to completely neutralize the infectivity of 103.3 TCID50 of virus on MDCK cells. The concentration of antibody required to neutralize 100 TCID50 of virus was calculated based on the neutralizing titer dilution divided by the initial dilution factor, multiplied by the antibody concentration.Glycan arrayGlycan arrays were prepared as previously described33,67. Briefly, glycans were prepared at 100 µM in 150 mM Na3PO4 buffer (pH 8.4) and printed onto NHS-activated glass microscope slides (SlideH, Schott) using a MicroGridII (Digilab) contact microarray printer equipped with Stealth Microarray Pins (SMP3, ArrayIt). Residual NHS was blocked by treatment with 50 mM ethanolamine in 50 mM borate buffer, pH 9.2 for 1 h and washed with water. Slides were centrifuged to remove excess water and were stored at −20C. For analysis of receptor specificity glycan arrays were overlayed with culture fluid containing intact influenza virus prepared in MDCK cells for one hour at room temperature. Slides were then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and water, followed by incubation with biotinylated Galananthus Novalis Lectin (GNL; Vector Labs) at 1ug/mL in 1X PBS for 1 h67. Sides were washed with PBS and overlayed with 1 µg/ml Streptavidin-AlexaFluor488 (LifeTech) for 1 h and washed with PBS and water. Slides were then scanned using an Innoscan 1100AL microarray scanner (Innopsys). Signal values are calculated from the mean intensities of 4 of 6 replicate spots with the highest and lowest signal omitted and graphed.Replication kineticsFour different HBE patient cell cultures were used (HBE0344, HBE0338, HBE0342, HBE0370). The apical surface of the HBE cells was washed in PBS and 103 TCID50 of virus was added per 100 μL of HBE growth medium. After 1 hour incubation, the inoculum was removed and the apical surface was washed three times with PBS. At the indicated time points, 150 μL of HBE medium was added to the apical surface for 10 min to capture released virus particles. The experiment was performed in triplicate in at least three different patient cell cultures. Infectious virus was quantified by TCID50 using the endpoint method68, as described above.Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)The neuraminidase activity was determined using a peanut-agglutinin based ELLA. A 96-well ultra-high binding polystyrene plate was coated with 25 μg/mL of fetuin diluted in coating buffer overnight at 4 °C and the excess fetuin was removed using wash buffer (0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20). Two-fold serial dilutions of 107.5 TCID50/mL virus stock or 62.5 mU/mL Clostridium perfringes neuraminidase (to standardize the viruses between different plates) were performed in a 96-well plate. Serial dilutions were then transferred to the plates coated with fetuin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Plates were thoroughly washed 6 times with wash buffer and incubated in the dark at room temperature with peroxidase-labeled peanut agglutinin solution for 2 h. O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate was added for 10 min to and the reaction was stopped using sulfuric acid. Absorbance was read at 490 nm. NA activity was assayed in duplicate and performed in three independent replicates.pH inactivation assayThe pH of inactivation assay69 was used to determine the pH at which HA undergoes its irreversible conformational change. 10 μL of virus stock was incubated in 990 μL of PBS adjusted to the indicated pH values for 1 h at 37 °C and immediately neutralized by titering on MDCK cells using the TCID50 endpoint titration method68 to determine the remaining infectious virus titer. The pH that reduced the titer by 50% (EC50) was calculated by regression analysis of the dose-response curves. Each experiment was performed in triplicate in at least three independent biological replicates.Stability of stationary dropletsDesiccator chambers containing saturated salt solutions of potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, magnesium nitrate or sodium chloride were equilibrated to 23%, 43%, 55% of 75% relative humidity (RH), respectively. Ten 1 μL droplets of HBE-propagated virus were spotted onto a 6-well plate in duplicate and immediately incubated in the desiccator chamber for 2 h. Chambers were maintained in a biosafety cabinet for the duration of the experiment and a HOBO UX100011 data logger was used to collect RH and temperature data. After 2 h, the droplets were collected in 500 μL of L-15 medium, which was titered on MDCK cells using the TCID50 endpoint method68. Decay was determined by subtracting the titer of the virus aged for 2 hours from the titer of the virus that had been deposited and then immediately recovered.Animal ethics statementFerret experiments were conducted in a BSL2 facility at the University of Pittsburgh in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approved protocol 22061230). Animals were sedated with isoflurane following approved methods for all nasal washes and survival blood draws. Ketamine and xylazine were used for sedation for all terminal procedures, followed by cardiac administration of euthanasia solution. Approved University of Pittsburgh Division of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) staff administered euthanasia at time of sacrifice.Human subjects research ethics statementHuman serum samples used in this study were collected from healthy adult donors who provided written informed consent for their samples to be used in infectious disease research. Participants responded to a notification about the study from flyers and/or website announcements, so a self-selection bias is possible if individuals who elected to participate in research were more likely to receive their annual influenza vaccinations. This should not have introduced bias with respect to community influenza exposures based upon age. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved this protocol (STUDY20030228). All participants were consented by trained staff and self-reported their age, sex, race, ethnicity, residential zip code, history of travel and immunization. HBE cultures are obtained from deidentified patients under an approved protocol from The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (STUDY19100326) and provided from the tissue airway core to for these studies.Ferret screeningFour- to six-month-old male ferrets were purchased from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA, USA). All ferrets were screened by HAI for antibodies against circulating influenza A and B viruses, as described in ‘Serology’ section. The following antigens were obtained through the International Reagent Resource, Influenza Division, WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA: 2018–2019 WHO Antigen, Influenza A (H3) Control Antigen (A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016), BPL-Inactivated, FR-1606; 2014–2015 WHO Antigen, Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 Control Antigen (A/California/07/2009 NYMC X-179A), BPL-Inactivated, FR-1184; 2018–2019 WHO Antigen, Influenza B Control Antigen, Victoria Lineage (B/Colorado/06/2017), BPL-Inactivated, FR-1607; 2015–2016 WHO Antigen, Influenza B Control Antigen, Yamagata Lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013), BPL-Inactivated, FR-1403.Ferret infectionsTo generate ferrets with pre-existing immunity against seasonal influenza viruses, ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 in 500 μL (250 μL in each nostril) of recombinant A/California/07/2009 or A/Perth/16/2009. These animals were allowed to recover and housed for 126 to 137 days before acting as a recipient in a transmission experiment or being similarly infected with A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020.Transmission studiesThe transmission cage setup was a modified Allentown ferret and rabbit bioisolator cage12,32. For each study, four ferrets were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 in 500 μL (250 μL in each nostril) of A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020 to act as donors. Twenty-four hours later, a naïve or immune recipient ferret was placed into the adjacent cage, which is separated by two staggered perforated steel plates welded together one inch apart with directional airflow from the donor to the recipient. Recipients were exposed to the donors for 2 days with nasal washes being collected from each donor and recipient every other day for 11 days. For the transmission chain experiment (Fig. 6), after the initial 2-day exposure, the recipients were transferred to the donor side of a new transmission cage where a naïve recipient ferret was on the other side of the divider. These animals were subsequently singled housed following 48 h. To prevent accidental contact or fomite transmission by investigators, the recipients were handled first and extensive cleaning of gloves, sedation chamber, biosafety cabinet, and temperature monitoring wand was performed between each pair of animals. Sera from donor and recipient ferrets were collected upon completion of experiments to confirm seroconversion. To ensure no accidental contact or fomite transmission during husbandry procedures, recipient animal sections of the cage were cleaned prior to the donor sides, with one cage being done at a time. Fresh scrapers, gloves, and sleeve covers were used for each subsequent cage cleaning. Clinical symptoms such as weight loss and temperature were recorded during each nasal wash procedure and other symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, activity, diarrhea or nasal discharge were noted during any handling events. Once animals reached 10% weight loss, their feed was supplemented with A/D diet twice a day to entice eating. Clinical scoring was previously described in ref. 47. Briefly, disease signs were noted for each infected ferrets every day that a procedure was performed and included activity score 2 (alert but not playful), activity score 3 (neither alert nor playful), mild nasal discharge, sneezing or coughing, weight loss (10% to 15%) or diarrhea. The total number of disease signs was added together for each intranasally or airborne infected ferret over the course of the study to provide the cumulative signs score.Tissue collection and processingThe respiratory tissues were collected from euthanized ferrets aseptically in the following order: entire right middle lung, left cranial lung (a portion equivalent to the right middle lung lobe), one inch of trachea cut lengthwise, entire soft palate, and nasal turbinates. Tissue samples were weighed, and Leibovitz’s L-15 medium was added to make a 10% (lungs) or 5% (trachea) w/v homogenate. The soft palate and nasal turbinates were homogenized in 1 mL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium. Tissues were dissociated using an OMNI GLH homogenizer (OMNI International) and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min. Influenza virus titers were determined by endpoint TCID50 assay68 as described above. The lungs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and subsequently processed in alcohols for dehydration and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The sections were examined ‘blind’ to experimental groups to eliminate observer bias by a board-certified animal pathologist (LHR).

Fresh natural milk on a farm. Given the 2024 multistate outbreak of H5N1 influenza among U.S. dairy cows, federal authorities recommend against drinking unpasteurized (raw) milk. What The amount of infectious H5N1 influenza viruses in raw milk rapidly declined with heat treatment in laboratory research conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. However, small, detectable amounts of infectious virus remained in raw milk samples with high virus levels when treated at 72 degrees Celsius (161.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 seconds—one of the standard pasteurization methods used by the dairy industry. The authors of the study stress, however, that their findings reflect experimental conditions in a laboratory setting and are not identical to large-scale industrial pasteurization processes for raw milk. The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine In late March 2024, United States officials reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 among dairy cows in Texas. To date, 95 cattle herds across 12 states have been affected, with three human infections detected in farm workers with conjunctivitis. Although the virus so far has shown no genetic evidence of acquiring the ability to spread from person to person, public health officials are closely monitoring the dairy cow situation as part of overarching pandemic preparedness efforts. Given the limited data on the susceptibility of avian influenza viruses to pasteurization methods used by the dairy industry, scientists at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories sought to quantify the stability of H5N1 virus in raw milk when tested at different time intervals at 63℃ (145.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 72℃, the temperatures most common in commercial dairy pasteurization processes. The scientists isolated HPAI H5N1 from the lungs of a dead mountain lion in Montana. Then they mixed these viral isolates with raw, unpasteurized cow milk samples and heat-treated the milk at 63℃ and 72℃ for different periods of time. The samples were then cell-cultured and tested to determine if live virus remained and if so, how much. They found that 63℃ caused a marked decrease (1010-fold) in infectious H5N1 virus levels within 2.5 minutes and note that standard bulk pasteurization of 30 minutes would eliminate infectious virus. At 72℃, they observed a decrease (104-fold) in infectious virus within five seconds, however, very small amounts of infectious virus were detected after up to 20 seconds of heat treatment in one out of three samples. “This finding indicates the potential for a relatively small but detectable quantity of H5N1 virus to remain infectious in milk after 15 seconds at 72℃ if the initial virus levels were sufficiently high,” the authors note. The scientists stress that their measurements reflect experimental conditions, should be replicated with direct measurement of infected milk in commercial pasteurization equipment and should not be used to draw any conclusions about the safety of the U.S. milk supply. Additionally, a limitation of their study was the use of raw milk samples spiked with H5N1 virus, whereas raw milk from cows infected with H5N1 influenza may have a different composition or contain cell-associated virus that may impact heat effects. The authors conclude that although gastrointestinal infections with HPAI H5N1 virus have occurred in several species of mammals, it remains unknown whether ingesting live H5N1 in raw milk could cause illness in people. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concludes that the totality of evidence continues to indicate that the commercial milk supply is safe. While laboratory benchtop studies provide important, useful information, there are limitations that challenge inferences to real-world commercial processing and pasteurization. The FDA conducted an initial survey of 297 retail dairy products collected at retail locations in 17 states and represented products produced at 132 processing locations in 38 states. All of the samples were found to be negative for viable virus. These results underscore the opportunity to conduct additional studies that closely replicate real world conditions. FDA, in partnership with USDA, is conducting pasteurization validation studies – including the use of a homogenizer and continuous flow pasteurizer. Additional results will be made available as soon as they are available. Article F Kaiser et al.

Artwork by Malcolm Houston. Zoonotic diseases occur when harmful germs in an animal spread to people. Many examples of these exist throughout history, including the original SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in East Asia in 2002. In that outbreak, bats were the source of the zoonotic disease. Since then, researchers have found many more viruses within bat populations, though bat influenza viruses appear to have a distinct evolutionary history from influenza viruses circulating in birds or humans. In a multinational collaboration, St. Jude scientists recently found that at least one influenza strain isolated from bats resembles a more recent crossover event, with characteristics of both mammalian and avian viruses. The findings, published recently in Nature Communications, suggest bats may be an intermediate influenza host, posing a zoonotic infection risk to humans. “We showed bats are a real source of viruses that do have zoonotic threat to humans,” said senior co-corresponding author Richard Webby, PhD, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions. “We’ve seen that time and time again, and though we didn’t think bats were a big player in the circle of flu infections across species, these findings suggest maybe they are.” Influenza viruses use two proteins to enter and exit cells: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), respectively. There are 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes, with specific combinations associated with a primary host, such as H1N1, which primarily infects mammals. Most bat flu viruses are H17N10 or H18N11, evolutionarily distinct from those in other mammals or birds. The study found an influenza virus taken from an Egyptian bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in 2017 appeared to have avian flu traits. Prior research with the new Egyptian virus showed it was H9N2, suggesting a novel crossover event between birds and bats. “This virus looked like a more recent transmission of a virus typically found in chickens,” Webby said. “It was an unusual finding in that it wasn’t one of these typical bat flu viruses. It was an avian flu virus that jumped back into bats, and then it clearly had been in bats for a bit of time because it had picked up a number of mutations.” Those mutations motivated further investigation to determine if the virus posed any threat to other mammals, such as humans. A new intermediate host for zoonotic influenza virus Influenza virus did not originally evolve to infect mammals. Instead, influenza virus’ natural reservoir is waterfowl. Most avian-adapted viruses have attachment proteins that bind to molecules specific to bird cells, as opposed to their analogs in humans. To reach humans, avian influenza must first enter an intermediate host with both avian and mammalian molecules for the attachment protein to bind; then, the virus can recombine into novel H and N combinations with mutations that enable binding to molecules from both hosts. Swine contain both these features, making them standard intermediate hosts for flu viruses between birds and humans. Findings from the study showed the bat-derived virus contained features of both mammalian and avian-adapted viruses despite only having one of the features typically thought required to drive this evolution (the mammalian molecules that bind the attachment protein). “We found bats are another potential intermediate host where a virus from the source of most Influenza A virus, birds, can occur,” Webby said. “Upon avian virus replication, bats can at least make the virus lean towards being more mammalian-like.” Many biological characteristics of the virus appeared mammalian-like. It showed greater resistance to acidic conditions and an ability to replicate in human lung cells and mouse lungs. In addition, the virus could not infect mallard duck cells, a significant reservoir for H9N2 viruses. It also replicated in a better model for human respiratory disease, ferrets, and could transfer using both direct contact and airborne transmission between ferrets. “The ferret-to-ferret transmission is probably the most concerning element we found,” Webby said. “It is a property usually associated with mammalian-adapted and, particularly, human-adapted viruses. For the few H9N2 viruses previously identified that could infect mammals, they required direct contact.” No clear threat to humans yet While some of the findings are concerning, the virus also had some more avian-like traits, indicating that it is not ready for a jump to humans. The viral replication in the human lung was more similar to an avian virus, only replicating well in a rare and difficult-to-access cell population. “The upper respiratory tract in humans doesn’t harbor many of the receptors that avian viruses like, but the lower respiratory tract does,” Webby said. “In terms of replication in these tissues, the virus does seem more avian-like, which is good because it means they are less likely to infect humans well.” The study is a first step in assessing the novel influenza strain. Without knowing how widespread the strain is in bats, any potential crossover remains difficult to predict. With the number of mammalian adaptations, the new bat virus represents a higher risk than a normal H9N2 virus in birds. However, further exploration will enable scientists to better understand what kind of threat, if any, it may pose. The virus’s very existence, however, indicates a more general principle — we do not currently know every potential species from which a zoonotic influenza virus may emerge. “Between this virus and the ongoing H5 pandemic virus [bird flu], influenza is showing us that there may be a much wider array of hosts than we thought,” Webby said. “I think we’re now starting to realize that the spectrum of flu hosts is wider and does include bats, and these flu viruses have some mammalian properties. But they’re clearly not all the way there yet.” About the author Senior Scientific Writer Alex Generous, PhD, is a Senior Scientific Writer in the Strategic Communications, Education and Outreach Department at St. Jude.

Collection dates for the latest detections range from May 6 to May 12. In a notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) on the earlier 11 detections in house mice and a red fox from Roosevelt County, New Mexico, officials said the animals were collected from a location where highly pathogenic avian flu had been detected in poultry.Positive tests in cats from 4 statesAlso today, APHIS reported four more H5N1 detections in domestic cats, including one from Oklahoma, which hasn't recently reported the virus in poultry or in dairy cows.The detection in Oklahoma occurred in Harmon County, located in the southwestern part of the state on the border with Texas. The cat is Oklahoma's first detection in a mammal. The sample was collected on March 20, and the virus is a reassortant between the global 2.3.4.4b H5N1 clade and a North American wild bird lineage.The three other H5N1 detections in domestic cats—sampled in late May— were in Michigan's Clinton County, where H5N1 had been found in dairy herds, and in Idaho's Jerome County, where H5N1 has been detected in poultry, alpacas, and dairy herds. The fourth new detection was from a cat from Colorado's Morgan County. So far, the virus has been reported in 21 domestic cats.

Vaccination with standardized NA concentration may offer broader and longer-lasting protection against influenza infection. In this regard, we aimed to compare the potency of a NA displayed on the surface of a VLP with a soluble NA. The baculovirus expression system (BEVS) and the novel virus-free Tnms42 insect cell line were used to express N2 NA on gag-based VLPs. To produce VLP immunogens with high levels of purity and concentration, a two-step chromatography purification process combined with ultracentrifugation was used. In a prime/boost vaccination scheme, mice vaccinated with 1 µg of the N2-VLPs were protected from mortality, while mice receiving the same dose of unadjuvanted NA in soluble form succumbed to the lethal infection. Moreover, NA inhibition assays and NA-ELISAs of pre-boost and pre-challenge sera confirm that the VLP preparation induced higher levels of NA-specific antibodies outperforming the soluble unadjuvanted NA.1 IntroductionVaccination offers a crucial defense against influenza virus infection and its possible complications. Every year the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends specific strains to be part of the influenza vaccines. Currently licensed vaccines are standardized solely in terms of the hemagglutinin (HA) content (1) and do not induce robust anti-neuraminidase (NA) immunity (2). The inclusion of standardized amounts of correctly folded NA either as soluble or included in a VLP may induce a more balanced immune response that also focuses on NA which may lead to a better antigenic match between vaccines and circulating viruses (3) and might potentially increase efficacy whenever the HA of the vaccine strain does not sufficiently resemble the virulent strain.The WHO estimates that there are still approximately a billion cases of seasonal influenza each year, along with 3–5 million severe cases and around half a million deaths. Pregnant women, individuals with chronic illness, those receiving immunosuppressive treatments, the elderly (over 65 years of age), and young children (under 5 years of age) are the groups with the highest risk of developing severe disease or complications from an influenza A virus infection (4–6). HA and NA surface glycoproteins are the primary targets of protective antibodies and the most antigenic and highly variable influenza virus components (7–9). The degree of similarity between these proteins of circulating viruses and those included in the vaccines is an important element that determines the efficacy of influenza immunization (10, 11). Making efficient vaccines becomes a significant challenge when taking into account that the HA and NA surface antigens are constantly evolving to avoid the antibody-mediated immunity induced by infection or vaccination, which is commonly referred to as antigenic drift (12). Although, it has been highlighted that NA evolves independently from and to some degree slower than the HA (13, 14), current influenza virus vaccines so far have not considered the potential of broadening the immune reaction and protection (2, 15) by adding NA. In fact, several studies agree that influenza vaccination would be more effective and potentially produce broader and longer-lasting cross-protection by including a specified quantity of correctly folded NA (16–21). When adding NA to an existing vaccine, addition of extra adjuvants should be avoided, since increased reactogenicity could arise as a consequence. While soluble proteins often are inefficiently immunogenic when unadjuvanted, particle structures often induce immune response without the presence of adjuvanting agents (22).Here, and based on previous work (22–24), we have generated VLPs in insect cells, that are based on self-assembly and budding of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) gag protein, and display N2 NA on their surface. N2 was chosen because of the high diversity of H3N2 viruses in the human population and the resulting typically low vaccine effectiveness (25). These VLPs were expressed and purified using a platform downstream process based on Capto-Core 700™ flow-through chromatography followed by Capto-Heparin™ affinity chromatography (26) combined with ultracentrifugation and were then tested in the mouse model. VLPs displaying NA as described here could, in the future, be added to seasonal influenza vaccines to increase immune responses to NA.2 Materials and methods2.1 Cells and virusesTnms42 cells (Trichoplusia ni derived) free of any alphanoda virus contamination (27) and Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were maintained in HyClone SFM4Insect (Cytiva) supplemented with 0.1% Kolliphor P188 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 27°C. For propagation of baculovirus (BV) stocks in Sf9 cells, the media was supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco).The challenge virus A/Switzerland/9715293/13 (H3N2) is mouse-adapted (28). The virus used in NA inhibition was A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2). There are 13 amino acid differences between the A/Kansas/14/2017 strain (vaccine) and the A/Switzerland/9715293/13 strain (challenge virus) in terms of NA sequence. This includes a gain of an N-linked glycosylation motif of Kansas17 in position 245/247 and a loss of a glycosylation motif relative to Swiss13 in 329/313. Both viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) at 37°C for 48 h.2.2 Molecular cloning and recombinant baculovirus generationFor the recombinant N2 exposed on the surface of a VLP, the nucleic acid sequence of the influenza N2 from A/Kansas/14/2017 (GenBank: MG974452.1) was synthesized as gBlock Gene (GenScript), PCR-amplified, and cloned into the pACEBac2 acceptor vector (Geneva Biotech) under control of the AcMNPV p10 promoter. The HIV-1 gag gene sequence (GenBank: K03455.1) was cloned into the pIDC donor vector (Geneva Biotech) (23). The two vectors were fused using Cre recombination to obtain a multigene expression vector encoding the influenza NA and the HIV-1 gag protein. A vector solely harboring the HIV-1 gag expression cassette was employed as control. The recombinant soluble NA protein used in this study was designed according to the previously reported construct N2-MPP (29), which contains an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a hexahistidine purification tag, the MPP (measles virus tetramerization domain), a thrombin cleavage site, and the globular head of the N2 protein from A/Kansas/14/2017 (GenBank: MG974452.1, aa 77 to 471). The N2-MPP was synthesized as gBlock Gene (GenScript), PCR-amplified, and cloned into the pACEBac2 vector (Geneva Biotech) under the control of the AcMNPV p10 promoter. Vectors encoding the N2-MPP, only HIV-1 gag and N2-HIV-1 gag were transformed into chemical competent E.coli DH10EMBacY (Geneva Biotech) for Tn7-based transposition of the expression cassettes into the bacmid. To generate recombinant BV, the isolated bacmids were transfected into Sf9 cells using the FuGene HD transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The BV was propagated in Sf9 cells to a passage 3-stock to generate higher titers.2.3 Recombinant proteins and VLP expression in baculovirus-insect cell systemTo express the proteins either as soluble or VLP, Tnms42 cells were cultivated at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. Cell cultures were infected with the respective BV working stock at a multiplicity of infection of three. The recombinant N2-MPP, gag-only VLP, and N2-VLP were harvested from Tnms42 cell expression supernatants 72–96 h post-infection. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min, followed by another at 1000g for 10 min.2.4 Purification of N2-MPP and N2-VLPThe soluble N2-MPP protein was purified by gravity-assisted flow purification protocol in disposable columns (30). Briefly, the cleared supernatant was incubated with Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin (Qiagen) for 2–4 h at room temperature (RT) while shaking. The resin-supernatant mixture was then passed over 10 mL polypropylene columns (Qiagen) and washed 4x with 15 mL of washing buffer (50 mM Na2HCO3, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8). Finally, the protein was eluted with 8 mL of elution buffer (50 mM Na2HCO3, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 8). The protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultracel-15 centrifugal filter with a cut-off of 30 kDa (Millipore) and the buffer was exchanged to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. For the VLPs, a platform purification method (26) was combined with ultracentrifugation to concentrate the material. The clarified supernatant was filtered with a 0.8 µm sterile polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) syringe filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For removal of host cell DNA, a medium-salt active nuclease (M-SAN; ArticZymes) treatment was performed (31) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For pre-purification, a column packed with Capto™ Core 700 resin (Cytiva) was employed. The supernatant clarified, filtered, and treated with endonuclease was loaded onto the column previously charged with buffer A (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 M NaCl, pH 7.2) and equilibrated with 5% of the same buffer (equivalent to 100 mM NaCl). The flow-through was collected and loaded into a column packed with Capto™ Heparin, pre-charged with buffer A, and equilibrated with 5% of the buffer A. The Capto™ Heparin column was washed with 3 column volumes (CV) of 100 mM NaCl, and elution was performed by applying a linear salt gradient from 100 mM to 2000 mM NaCl over 20 CV in order to separate VLPs from other particles. The chromatography was performed with an ÄKTA Pure 150 M2 instrument equipped with a sample pump S9 and a fraction collector F9-C (GE Healthcare). VLPs were then concentrated via ultracentrifugation at 70,000 x g for 2 h using an SW28 rotor (Beckman). The protein concentration of the soluble protein was quantified using the Quickstart Bradford Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad) with a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve. The protein concentration of the N2 on the VLPs was determined by comparing a dilution of VLPs with a known concentration of a recombinant N2 protein. Particle concentration was determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), with a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) alongside a 488 nm laser module.2.5 Double-stranded DNA content and infective particle titerThe contamination on supernatants and purified VLPs was determined as follows. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was determined by Quant-iT PicoGreen™ dsDNA kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plate was read in a GeniusPro Plate Reader (Tecan). Quantification of infective BV titer was performed by tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) on Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells in early/mid-log phase were dispensed into a 96-well plate at a concentration of 0.4 x105 cells per well. Samples were analyzed in triplicates and three-fold serial dilutions were performed. A volume of 25 µL of each virus dilution was added to the plates with the attached Sf9 cells and then incubated for 5 days at 27°C. Plates were examined with a Leica DM IL LED Inverted Laboratory Fluorescence Microscope (Leica Microsystems). A modified equation from Reed and Muench was used for calculating the TCID50 and a Poisson distribution-derived factor was employed for conversion to pfu (32).2.6 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotProtein identity was assessed by western blot. Samples were separated on an SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. For the bio-sulfosuccinimidyl substrate (BS3, Thermo-Fisher) crosslinker, the proteins were treated with the crosslinker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the SDS-PAGE 5 µL of the respective purified samples were mixed 1:1 with 2 x Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad) supplemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The samples were heated at 95°C for 15 min prior to loading on the SDS-PAGE gel (4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX™ Precast Protein Gels, BioRad). Protein bands in the gel for the SDS-PAGE were stained with Flamingo fluorescent Protein Gel Stain (BioRad). For Western Blot, after SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) which were subsequently blocked overnight (ON) at 4°C with 3% milk (AmericanBio) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (PBS-T). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with the corresponding primary antibody: rabbit anti-influenza A virus H3N2 NA primary antibody (Invitrogen); rabbit anti-baculovirus vp39 (ProteoGenix); mouse anti-HIV-1 p24 (abcam); rabbit anti-Histone H3 (abcam); diluted 1:1000. Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated (Thermo-Fisher) or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated (Thermo-Fisher) was added at a 1:30,000 dilution. Finally, bands were visualized with a premixed nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3’-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) solutions (BioRad).2.7 NA-activity assayTo determine the NA activity of the purified proteins, an NA-star assay (Thermo Fisher) was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. The N2-MPP and N2-VLP proteins were diluted to a starting concentration of 1 µg in 50 µL of the provided assay buffer. Two-fold serial dilutions were performed and then incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Then, the substrate was added, and the plate was incubated for 30 min at RT. To measure the chemiluminescence the accelerator solution was added, and the plate was immediately read using a Synergy H1 Hybrid multimode microplate Reader (BioTek). For quantitation of neuraminidase activity, the signal was divided by noise (value from negative controls) and signaloise value versus enzyme amount were plotted.2.8 Immunoelectron microscopyFor particle visualization, samples were prepared as described in Hausjell et al. (2023) (33). Briefly, formvar-coated copper grids were floated on VLP suspension diluted 1:50 in particle-free water. Following fixation with 2% glutaraldehyde, samples were floated on blocking buffer (5% BSA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer; pH 7.4) for 10 min. Grids were then incubated on a rabbit anti-Influenza A H3N2 NA primary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:50. Antigen-antibody reaction was visualized with a donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with 10 nm gold (Abcam) diluted 1:50. For double labelling, grids were incubated on the same rabbit anti-influenza A H3N2 NA primary antibody and a mouse monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 p24 (abcam) diluted 1:50. As secondary antibodies to detect mouse anti-p24, donkey anti-mouse conjugated with 6 nm gold particles (Jackson immuno 715–194-150) was used. Subsequently, negative staining was performed with uranyl acetate replacement stain (UAR_EMS Stain, EMS-Electron Microscopy Sciences). For visualization, a Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV was used.2.9 Animal workAll animal experiments were carried out under protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all animal experiments, female 6–8-week-old DBA/2J mice (Jackson laboratories, n=5 per group) were used. Mice were intramuscularly vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen separated into the following groups: 1.0 µg of N2-MPP, 1.0 µg or 0.3 µg of N2-VLP, 3.0 µg of an irrelevant protein (BSA) or 2 x 109 only gag-VLPs (particle amount equivalent to 1 µg of the N2-VLP vaccination) three weeks apart. Mice were then challenged with 25x mLD50 of A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2, mouse-adapted). Weight loss and survival were monitored over 14 days. Blood was obtained on day 21 and day 49 after prime immunization. Mice were humanely euthanized if they lost 25% or more of their initial body weight.2.10 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Highly binding polystyrene 96-well plates (Microwell™ MaxiSorp™ flat bottom plates, Sigma-Aldrich) were coated with 50 µL/well of the N2 recombinant protein at a concentration of 5 µg/mL in PBS (pH 7.4; Gibco) ON at 4°C. The next day, the coating solution was removed, and the plates were blocked with 200 µL/well of blocking buffer consisting of 3% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5% milk (AmericanBio) in PBS-T for 1 h at RT. The blocking solution was removed, and the serum collected on d21 and d49 was added. The serum was diluted 1:50 in PBS, serially diluted 1:3, and then incubated for 2 h at RT. After serum incubation, the plates were washed 3x with PBS-T and incubated with the secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) (31430, Invitrogen). The secondary antibodies were diluted 1:3,000 in blocking buffer and added to the plate (50µL/well) for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed 3x with PBS-T, and 100 µL/well of SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) developing solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL/well of 3 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). The plate was read using a Synergy H1 Hybrid multimode microplate Reader (BioTek) at an optical density of 490 nm. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.2.0.2.11 Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) to determine neuraminidase Inhibition (NI)To test if vaccination with N2-MPP and N2-VLP induces serum antibodies with NI activity, an ELLA assay was performed as described before (34). Briefly, highly binding polystyrene 96-well plates (Microwell™ MaxiSorp™ flat bottom plates, Sigma-Aldrich) were coated with 100 µL/well of 25 µg/mL fetuin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4°C ON. Serum samples were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 56°C and then diluted 1:50 in sample diluent which consisted of 5% BSA in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) complemented with calcium and magnesium (Gibco) and 2% Tween. The samples were then serially diluted 1:2 on a separate 96-well plate and 50 µL/well was added to the fetuin-coated plates. The influenza virus A/Kansas/14/2017 was diluted in sample diluent and added to the serum dilutions at 2x the 50% effective concentration (EC50). The serum-virus mixture was incubated for 16–18 h at 37°C. The plates were washed 3x with PBS-T and then incubated with 100 µL/well of 50 µg/mL peanut agglutinin (PNA) conjugated to HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at RT. The plates were washed 4x with PBS-T, and 100 µL/well of SigmaFast OPD developing solution was added. After 10 min of incubation in the dark at RT, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL/well of 3 M HCl. The OD was measured in a Synergy H1 Hybrid multimode microplate Reader (BioTek) at an optical density of 490 nm. The individual inhibitory dose 50 (ID50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism 10.2.0.2.12 Statistical analysisTiters were compared using a one-way analysis of variance corrected for multiple comparisons. Survival was compared using a Mantel-Cox log-rank test and corrected for multiple comparisons. IgG levels were compared by determination of the area under the curve. All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 10.2.0.3 Results3.1 N2-VLPs set up correctly folded structures and active neuraminidasesTo express the N2 neuraminidase on the surface of VLPs, the full sequence coding for the N2 cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane domain, the stalk, and the NA head of A/Kansas/14/2017 were cloned into a pACBac2 vector and then fused with a pIDC-gag vector that contained the HIV-1 gag matrix protein using Cre recombination. Gag-based VLPs displaying the N2 were expressed using the BEVS and the T.ni insect cell line, Tnms42 (35). NA-VLPs were then purified via a platform downstream procedure based on a Capto-Core 700™ flow-through chromatography followed by a Capto-Heparin™ affinity chromatography (26). The flow-through material from the Capto-Core 700 ™ was loaded onto the heparin column to separate the gag-VLPs from baculovirus particles and other extracellular vesicles. An immediate breakthrough of particles during loading followed by two overlapping peaks during elution was observed at the chromatogram of this purification step (Supplementary Figure 1A). To corroborate that particle populations were separated as Zollner et. al., reported, protein composition was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blots (Supplementary Figures 1B–E). HIV-1 p24 Western blot (Supplementary Figure 1B), can be found with higher intensities in peak 1 (P1 or E2); the capsid protein of the baculovirus vp39 (Supplementary Figure 1C) is enriched in the second peak (P2 or E4 and E5). An H3 histone antibody was employed as an indicator for the presence of chromatin (Supplementary Figure 1D), the Western blot showed that it was removed by the Capto-Core 700 ™ step. Finally, the purification of the sample was corroborated by SDS-PAGE analysis, the P1, which corresponds to the VLP enriched fraction showed fewer bands than the loading material, and the supernatant of the Tnm42 cells that was employed to search for host cell protein (Supplementary Figure 1E). The VLP enriched fraction was then concentrated by ultracentrifugation to a NA concentration of 0.05 mg NA/mL. This concentration of NA was equal to ~1 x1011 particles/mL. Contaminants such as baculovirus (BV) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were determined by tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) and PicoGreen™ assay respectively. Raw supernatants contained 1.6 x103 ng/mL dsDNA while after purification the samples only contained 80 ng/mL of dsDNA. This corresponded to 1.6 ng/dose (Figure 1B) which meets the requirements of the regulatory agencies with <10 ng of residual dsDNA per dose (36). Moreover, the amount of BV particles decreased from 2.7 x107 plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL in raw supernatants to 1.4 x106 pfu/mL of BV in the final product fraction, which corresponded to 2.7 x104 pfu BV per dose (Figure 1B). A recombinant version of the head domain of the same N2 fused to an N-terminal signal peptide, hexahistidine tag and measles virus phosphoprotein tetramerization domain (N2-MPP) (29, 37) was expressed in the same system and purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography. This protein served as a comparator for the following experiments.Figure 1 Figure 1 Immunization. (A) Schematic representation of the N2-VLP (B) Composition of a N2-VLP vaccine dose and the respective analytical assays employed for given quantification (C) Vaccination scheme for assessing the protective potential of the N2 as soluble protein or displayed at the surface of a bionanoparticle in vivo without adjuvant. Female 6- to 8- week-old DBA/2J mice were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen and then challenged with 25x the LD50 of A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2, mouse-adapted) and monitored for 14 days. IM: Intramuscular. Mice were bled on day 21 (d21) and day 49 (d49) for serological analysis.To verify the protein identity and structural integrity of the recombinant proteins, the N2 was visualized by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal NA-antibody (Figures 2A, B). Under reducing conditions, the N2-MPP and N2-VLP showed a band at around 60 kDa, corresponding to the size of the N2 monomer (Figure 2A). Since only tetrameric NA and not the monomer is able to induce a protective immune response in mice (19) the proper formation of tetramers was tested by employing a BS3 cross-linker, which connects primary amines. After the cross-link reaction, the Western blot analysis showed the formation of tetramers at around 240 kDa and dimers at 120 kDa (Figure 2B). Correct folding of the NA was also determined by measuring the NA activity, considering that only tetrameric NA and not the monomeric is showing robust enzymatic activity (19). Both the soluble N2 and N2-VLPs exhibited high enzymatic activity (Figure 2C). The gag-VLPs without N2 expressed at the surface were used as negative control and did not show any NA activity.Figure 2 Figure 2 Analysis of N2-MPP and N2-VLP. (A) Western blot under reducing conditions using a polyclonal antibody against the N2. (B) Western blot using a BS3 cross-linker and a polyclonal antibody against the N2. (C) NA activity was determined via NA-Star assay. 1.0 nM NA is equivalent to 0.003 µg of NA/50 µL assay volume, based on a subunit molecular weight to 60 kDa. A gag-VLP (with no protein expressed on the surface) was employed as a negative control. This assay was run once in duplicates, geometric mean, and geometric standard deviation are shown.Transmission electron micrographs (Figure 3) and size distribution determined by NTA (Supplementary Figure 2C) of the purified samples showed the presence of round-shaped particles with an average size of 100–200 nm, consistent with previous reports on gag-based VLPs (38, 39). The morphology of gag-based nanoparticles has been reported as similar to HIV-1 immature particles, in which the distribution of the exposed proteins is grouped in more than one single focus unlike mature particles (40, 41). The exposition of the N2 antigen on the surface of the VLPs was confirmed by immunolocalization of the NA by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sample containing the N2-VLPs showed bionanoparticles surrounded by black dots representing the gold-labeled N2 (Figures 3A–C), no unspecific binding was observed for the gag-only particles (Figure 3D, Supplementary Figures 2A, B).Figure 3 Figure 3 Transmission electron microscopy. Immunolocalisation of NA. Abundant VLPs and high purity level can be observed in N2-VLPs (A–C) and gag-VLPs (D) samples. See the labelling for N2 on the N2-VLPs (A–C, outlined arrowheads), as well as the presence of p24 on the N2-VLPs (C, arrowhead) and the absence of significant labelling on the negative control (D). Bars 50 nm (A–C), 200 nm (D).3.2 Vaccination with N2-VLP provides protection against influenza virus challengeWe aimed to test the N2 incorporated into VLPs (Figure 1A) without adjuvant in terms of potency as vaccine in a mouse study. The VLPs were compared to soluble NA which, when adjuvanted, induces robust protection against challenge (29). Therefore, six-to-eight-week-old DBA/2J mice (n=5 per group) were vaccinated in a prime/boost regimen. Mice were intramuscularly primed with 0.3 or 1.0 µg N2 NA protein without adjuvant, either using the soluble immunogen or NA-VLPs, and were boosted three weeks later using the same dosage. The composition of the novel influenza vaccine candidate is indicated in Figure 1B. A group vaccinated with equivalent particle composition but no N2 exposed at the surface was employed as control (gag-VLP dose: 2 x109 particles, 2.7 x104 particles and 4.1 ng of dsDNA). Four weeks post booster immunization, mice were intranasally challenged with 25x the 50% mouse lethal dose (mLD50) of the mouse-adapted heterologous H3N2 strain A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 and monitored for 14 days (Table 1, Figure 1C).Table 1 Table 1 Vaccination regimen for N2-VLPs and N2-MPP as a standalone vaccine.Mice vaccinated with 1.0 µg of the NA-VLPs were fully protected from mortality but experienced a ~15% weight loss (Figures 4A, B). In contrast, the group that received 1.0 µg of the soluble unadjuvanted NA (N2-MPP) succumbed to the lethal infection between days 7 to 9 (Figures 4A, B). The group that received 0.3 µg of N2 on VLPs showed 20% weight loss, with one mouse succumbing to infection on day 8 post-challenge (Figures 4A, B). N2-VLP vaccinated groups showed moderate weight loss, with some intermediate recover from day 3 to day 5 post-challenge, and they finally fully recovered. We believe that these minor differences are an artifact due to small group sizes. Differences in survival were analyzed using a Mantel-Cox log-rank test corrected for multiple comparisons: BSA vs N2-VLP 1.0 µg (p=0.002); gag-VLP vs N2-VLP 1.0 µg (p=0.0023); N2-VLP 1.0 µg vs N2-MPP 1.0 µg (p=0.0020); were statistically significant. Other differences were not statistically significant (ns; Bonferroni-corrected α value for 10 comparisons p>0.005).Figure 4 Figure 4 Protective potential of N2-VLP as vaccines in vivo. Weight loss curve (A) and survival curve (B) after challenge. n=5. (A) The dotted line indicates 75% of the initial weight, the endpoint for weight loss. Geometric mean and geometric standard deviation are shown.In summary, in a prime/boost regimen, 1.0 µg of the N2 displayed on the surface of a VLP provided 100% protection from mortality post-challenge. A statistical difference in the probability of survival was observed by comparing this group to the group that was vaccinated with 1.0 µg the N2-MPP protein (p<0.005).3.3 Vaccination with N2 VLPs results in robust induction of anti-NA antibodiesTo analyze the characteristics of serum antibodies obtained after vaccination with the different constructs, their capacity to bind to recombinant N2 protein was tested. Serum was obtained three weeks after priming as well as prior to challenge (Figure 1C). Before the boost vaccination (1st bleed), strong antibody response was detected only in the groups vaccinated with the N2-VLPs (Figure 5B). The strongest response was detected in the group vaccinated with 1 µg, the calculated area under the curve (AUC) was 3.852 as compared to 2.073 of the group vaccinated with only 0.3 µg. The same trend was seen in the neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay when an H3N2 virus from A/Kansas/14/2017 was used (Figure 5A), the inhibition was detectable only in the groups vaccinated with the N2-VLP. However, no statistical significance between groups was determined. After the second vaccination and before challenging (2nd bleed), the antibody reactivity of the group that received 1.0 µg of the N2-MPP was markedly higher with an increase of the AUC from 0.44 to 2.76 (Figure 5D). Still, the group that received the N2 integrated into VLPs showed higher AUC than the group that received the same amount as N2-MPP (AUC: BSA=0.55, gag-VLP=0.50, N2-VLP 0.3 µg=4.23, N2-VLP 1.0 µg=5.70, N2-MPP 1.0 µg=2.77). Furthermore, the NI assay exhibited only a moderate gain for the group that was vaccinated with the N2 in soluble form (Figure 5C). The group vaccinated two times with 1.0 µg of N2-VLP produced higher NI titers and in a one-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparison, it was the only group statistically different from all other groups (p<0.005).Figure 5 Figure 5 Serological assessment of serum samples obtained after N2 vaccination.

The AUC value was determined to compare the reactivity of the serum to recombinant N2 protein. ****, p-value <0.005.4 DiscussionConventional influenza virus vaccines lower the risk of disease in the general population by 40% to 60% (42). These vaccines are based on influenza virus HA as a major antigenic component and rely on the induction of HA-specific neutralizing antibodies (1). In contrast to natural infection, seasonal vaccination lacks the ability to induce a robust immune response against the influenza virus NA (21), which is the second most abundant viral glycoprotein. A potential solution to this problem is to supplement current vaccines with correctly folded, stable, tetrameric NA protein or alternatively with bionanoparticles that display tetrameric NA on an outer membrane. It was shown that vaccines incorporating standardized amounts of NA have the potential to provide broader and longer-lasting protection against influenza virus infection (16–21). In this study, we compared the efficacy of NA vaccination in a mouse model administered either as soluble protein or displayed on the surface of VLPs.Subtypes A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) of the influenza virus are currently circulating in the Northern hemisphere (season 2023/24). Vaccination against influenza generally provides reduced protection against influenza A (H3N2) strains as compared to other influenza strains (43). Here, the N2 from A/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2) has been chosen as vaccine antigen. Heightened anti-N2 immunity might offer additional protection against H3N2, especially in years where the HA between vaccine strain and circulating strain is mismatched. In addition, some protection from strains with pandemic potential may be expected if they possess a N2 neuraminidase subtype (such as H2N2, H5N2, H7N2, or H9N2).Recombinant N2 VLPs were generated using the BEVS and a novel T. ni insect cell line (Tnms42) (35). This was compared to expression of a soluble tetrameric version of the same N2. The soluble protein’s volumetric yield after concentration was 0.6 mg/L culture, as expected for a soluble NA produced on an insect cell system (30). The target antigen content on the produced VLPs was 0.067 mg N2/L culture. Since the presence of NA on VLPs has received little attention in the past, we could only compare it to the 3mg HA/L output from previous production processes of HA-VLPs (24). This is consistent with reports showing that NAs express at lower levels than HAs (30). Moreover, NA-VLPs underwent a two-step chromatography purification process, which has previously been successful in producing high-purity VLPs (26). Semi-purified VLP material has been used up to this point, which may have caused an overestimation of the antigen’s quantification because extracellular vesicles (EVs) and BVs share the same cell membrane and exhibit proteins on the surfaces that are similar to those of VLPs, such as NA or HA.A prior study reported the use of a recombinant N2 linked to the measles virus phosphoprotein tetramerization domain (N2-MPP) to provide protection in a mouse model, especially when adjuvanted. However, here we wanted to assess and compare nonadjuvanted antigens. The use of adjuvants in humans, which may be needed for a purified recombinant protein vaccine, may increase reactogenicity. Vaccine candidates that can be used without adjuvant are therefore preferred. One way to increase immunogenicity without using adjuvants is to present antigens repetitively on particles like the N2 VLPs developed here. In this study, we showed that the presence of correctly folded, tetrameric NA on VLPs accurately mimics the morphology of infectious influenza virions (100–200 nm round-shaped structures displaying dispersed NA spikes on their surface determined by TEM and NTA) and confers robust protection. In a prime/boost vaccination, mice that received 1µg of NA displayed on VLPs were completely protected from mortality, performing significantly better than the nonadjuvanted soluble N2. For both NA vaccines used in this study, it is still unclear whether raising the dose might result in enhanced protection. It is worth mentioning that multiple studies have shown more robust immunity to NA of subtype N2 than to N1 in humans (17, 34, 44), suggesting a possible wider range of protection with our vaccine. Heterologous or heterosubtypic cross-protection of this N2-VLP vaccine needs to be explored more extensively in the future. However, we would like to note that the challenge strain was heterologous to the vaccine strain and yet, we did see good protection.VLPs have previously been shown to induce specific humoral and cellular responses (22, 45, 46). In this study, neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibodies were elicited after a single immunization with N2-VLPs. More importantly, after the boost immunization, all the mice vaccinated with two doses of 1.0 µg N2-VLPs reached the highest concentration of NI titers confirming that the NA-VLP vaccine consistently outperformed the recombinant soluble nonadjuvanted NA vaccine. Interestingly, two mice vaccinated with 0.3 µg of N2-VLP were protected without generating detectable NI. Since the limit of detection for NI titers is quite high it might be possible that sub-detectible levels of these NI titers could confer protection in those mice. Alternatively, the vaccine might be associated with other immunological mechanisms that allow protection from challenge. For example, antibodies that recognize antigenic regions of the NA that are not critical for NAI but important for monoclonal antibody binding or neutralization activity (28). More research is required to fully understand the immunological response triggered by this vaccine. On the other hand, NA-specific antibodies were generated against the N2-MPP, and in one mouse vaccinated with two doses of 1 µg of the N2-MPP, NAI antibodies were elicited, but not at a level high enough to protect. Antibodies that bind but do not neutralize the virus and thus, have no protective function in vivo are nearly universally elicited after infection or vaccination. In addition, VLPs may trigger a better T-cell response which may also contribute to protection.The presence of BV contamination in the VLP vaccine derived from insect cells is another reason linked to the robust immunogenicity of the N2 VLPs. Abe et al., reported that inoculation with a dose of 107 pfu of empty BV induces innate immunity that conferred nonspecific antiviral activity to mice (47). Despite the fact that the purification technique we used was successful in separating VLPs from other particles, the highest dose of VLP contained 2.7 x104 BV particles, probably conferring some level of the beneficial effect that Abe et al. (47) reported. BV contamination has been known for a long time, because of the structural resemblance to the VLPs (46). Prior research has indicated that experimental vaccines contain up to 4.5 x106 pfu BVs per vaccine dose, which can account for up to 5% of the total protein content (48–50). When using the baculoviral expression vector system for mammalian cell transduction, a generally 20- to 40-fold less BV is found in the expression supernatant. Yet, also VLP yields are lower compared to BEVS-based expression in insect cells (51, 52). Our methodology achieves a 150-fold BV reduction maintaining VLP yields from BEVS-based expression in insect cells. Safety is the primary consideration for vaccines, the BV is biologically harmless for humans because the BV cannot integrate its DNA into the host genome in the absence of selective pressure (53). The general safety for the application of BVs in vaccine production and human cell therapy has been the focus of attention in diverse studies and documents of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). According to them, the BVs have no negative effects on human health, and there is no evidence of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity (54). Up to now, more than 10 BEVS-derived vaccines have been approved for veterinary and human use and, a growing number of BEVS derivatives have entered preclinical or clinical phases (55). Vaccines for human use include Flublok® (Sanofi Pasteur), Flubok Quadrivalent® (Sanofi Pasteur), Cervarix™ (GSK), NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax), Weikexin (Westvac), Trivalent Weikexin (Westvac), VidPrevtyn Beta (Sanofi/GSK) and SpikoGen® (Vaxine/CinnaGen Co.).Although this work successfully shows protection in a mouse model, it is noteworthy that the generation of antibodies targeted at structural protein fragments from HIV-1-based VLPs remains a concern following the introduction and cancelation of the UQ-CSL v451 COVID-19 vaccination trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04495933). It was not examined whether this vaccine candidate could cause issues with diagnostic interference. A re-engineered HIV-1 gag VLP platform or alternative pseudotyped viral particles such as the previously used severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov2) murine leukemia virus (MLV)-gag based (56, 57) or the recently approved in Canada Covifenz® (Medicago) SARS-Cov-2 VLP (hepatitis B virus (HBV)-based VLP) (58), may be used.In summary, we find that in the mouse model, exposure of the N2 on VLPs surface results in strong anti-NA immunity and protection from lethal influenza virus infection. On top of that, this approach might be readily adjusted to produce VLP-based vaccines to combat emerging infectious diseases; in fact, it has been demonstrated that more than 100 viral proteins from 35 different viral families can assemble into VLPs (59). This platform is a very innovative and promising approach to developing modern vaccines.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThe animal study was approved by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Bird flu poses a massive threat, and the potential for a catastrophic new pandemic is imminent. We still have a chance to stop a possible humanitarian disaster, but only if we get to work urgently, carefully and aggressively. This will require a major collective shift in the way we approach infectious diseases management — one that embraces a “One Health” approach and prioritizes prevention of human infection before widespread infection happens, rather than responding rapidly once human cases become widespread. As Canada Research Chair in Viral Pandemics and director of the M.G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, I have spent my career studying the impact of previous pandemics, and developing new ways to prevent them in the future. The actions taken now will determine whether the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak already affecting birds and mammals around the world takes hold in humans. Global spread of H5N1 We’ve been watching the global spread of this new strain of H5N1 for roughly five years, from the time it first appeared in wild birds and literally flew around the world. We have seen it adapt and move into domestic poultry flocks, causing millions of chickens, turkeys and ducks to be destroyed to keep the virus at bay. Read more: Bird flu in cattle: What are the concerns surrounding the newly emerging bovine H5N1 influenza virus? International concern about the potential of this virus to cause a pandemic increased significantly in 2022, when the HPAI H5N1 was confirmed to have adapted and jumped to mammals like foxes, skunks, ferrets and seals. These animals are more closely related to humans than birds, giving the virus a chance to learn how to infect us more efficiently. Now it’s picking up speed. In March, we learned H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas, and by the time we could take stock of the situation, testing showed it affected 20 per cent of the milk supply. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz By March, H5N1 had infected dairy cattle in Texas. By the time the situation could be assessed, testing showed 20 per cent of the milk supply there had been touched by H5N1 (while remaining safe for consumption thanks to pasteurization), and infected cows could be found in almost every corner of the country. In recent weeks, reports have identified H5N1 infection in three dairy-farm workers in the United States, two with conjunctivitis (“pink eye”) and, most recently, one with respiratory symptoms. Sadly, someone in Mexico also recently died from a closely related H5N2 influenza virus infection. There are almost certainly many more cases than these. Dairy farms are at risk of becoming dangerous incubators for the virus because mechanized milking seems likely to be responsible for spread among cattle, and facility cleaning procedures often generate airborne droplets that pose a serious risk of human infection. We have yet to see human-to-human transmission of this H5N1 virus, but the virus is always adapting to new hosts, and the early animal-to-human infections we have seen are giving the virus opportunities to learn how to thrive in the human body. Dairy farms are at risk of becoming dangerous incubators for the virus because mechanized milking seems likely to be responsible for spread among cattle. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young Previous outbreaks of avian influenza have killed more than 50 per cent of the people they infected. These numbers are more consistent with viruses such as Ebola, rather than with seasonal influenza or even COVID-19. The potential for high human mortality is what makes this influenza such an urgent concern. There are ways to halt the march of H5N1, but whether they will be put to use is still an open question. Many of the viruses that have caused recent unexpected outbreaks, like Zika, would have been very difficult to prevent. Influenza viruses, however, are an all-too familiar pandemic risk, having already caused four pandemics between 1918 and 2009. Given what we just experienced with COVID-19, letting bird flu take hold in humans would represent a spectacular failure to learn our lesson. Preventing spread vs. limiting spread People may wonder why it matters that we prevent a pandemic when we can limit spread and mitigate illness with masks, drugs and vaccines. It will not be that simple. When COVID-19 first emerged, we had no vaccines available for coronaviruses, and so the development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was a steep challenge. With H5N1, we’ll be able to apply the same fundamental technologies we use to produce seasonal influenza vaccines by adapting the formulation to whatever form the virus may take in humans. But that can’t happen instantly, and by the time bird flu has hit humanity, it may already be too late. Vaccines take time to produce, especially on a global scale, which would demand more than eight billion doses. Three colourized rod-shaped influenza A (H5N1/bird flu) virus particles. (CDC and NIAID) During the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak, the pandemic had already passed its peak by the time a vaccine was getting out to the public — despite the considerable global infrastructure already in place to produce influenza vaccines. The people most likely to suffer are people in remote and Indigenous communities, the poor, the frail and elderly, medically vulnerable individuals, the very young and the displaced. Strategies are beginning to develop in many places around the world to prevent the virus from jumping into the human population, including infection-control measures to protect farm animals from exposure and using personal protective equipment for farm workers. Those whose jobs put them at high risk of exposure to H5N1 may need to be offered vaccines and medications that can prevent exposures from blossoming into full-blown infections, in much the same way we selectively provide rabies vaccines to those whose work puts them in close contact with wild animals. Though plans are taking shape, such measures can only be effective if people are willing to use them. We know how much resistance there was to masking and vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic Pushing back on bird flu Pushing back the bird flu will need public buy-in and public resources. Prevention approaches must be sensitive to those most impacted. Farmers, hunters and others who are regularly exposed to potentially infected animals will need good information and education to understand why they must act. Approaches should be evidence-based and offer people options whenever possible. Mandates should be viewed as a last resort. People whose livelihoods may be jeopardized by the cost of biosecurity measures will need resources to support them in taking actions that could potentially save millions of lives. All this demands new government policies, and enhanced co-operation and co-ordination between agencies responsible for farm animal, human and wildlife health. Canada has been taking encouraging steps in this direction, but alone cannot stop a bird flu pandemic. However, this is a unique opportunity to demonstrate international leadership in effective pandemic prevention approaches. In the United States, it’s critical that infections in farm workers are not concealed due to fears related to immigration status or financial strain because of lack of health insurance. Another huge risk in the wake of COVID-19 is the politicization of issues related to infection prevention, where public opposition, anti-science rhetoric and misinformation could be as deadly as a major war. Our approach and messaging needs to be empathetic and sensitive to these realities to avoid further polarization. In national security, terrorist attacks are considered failures of intelligence. After the tragic losses of 9/11, governments made massive investments to improve security in airports and cities. These measures fundamentally changed travel and public events, and yet today we think little of yielding to rigorous measures that keep us safe from terrorism. Preventing pandemics requires a similar mindset, starting with avian flu, where many millions are at risk. We must change our focus from response to prevention. As with national security, the need for an outbreak response must be regarded as a failure to prevent. This is an hour of opportunity. We don’t know how much or how little time we have, but the window to act is very small and the stakes are enormous.

Since the 2.3.4.4b clade bird-origin influenza A/cattle/Texas/56283/2024 (H5N1) virus arrived in the northern parts of America by late 2021, several spillover incidents among mammals of diverse species, including humans, have occurred. Nonetheless, the viral strains did not harm dairy livestock. Cattle are permissive but resistant to infections by influenza A (IAV), influenza B, and influenza C viruses; nevertheless, they are vulnerable to infections by the influenza D virus. Influenza D viruses are assumed to transfer between cows by direct touch or aerosol transmission over brief distances via the respiratory route, and potential influenza D viral spillovers to humans are alarming. However, veterinarians have investigated different pathogens associated with livestock respiratory epizootics. Study: Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus among Dairy Cattle, Texas, USA. Image Credit: McKenzie Kizer / Shutterstock About the study In the present study, researchers studied dairy cattle samples from a Texas farm using various pathogen identification methods from March to April 2024. The researchers performed molecular screening to identify the etiological agent for cattle diseases. In a few cases, they performed cell culture experiments and next-generation sequencing (NGS) on cattle swab biospecimens. They targeted six groups of viruses: coronaviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, enteroviruses, pneumoviruses, and paramyxoviruses. On March 21, the dairy farm care team collected nasal swab biospecimens from 14 cows presenting with disease signs and six without signs and shipped them in suitable containers. Cattle presented with signs such as lethargy, reduced appetite, increased respiratory secretions, elevated temperatures (up to 40.6°C or 105°F), abnormal bowel motion, and reduced milk production. There were no deceased cats, birds, or other dead wildlife. Cattle diseases were on the decline at the time of collecting specimens. The researchers analyzed the swab samples and filled out questionnaires the following day. On March 28, they requested additional dairy specimens to determine whether the etiological agent was enteric. On April 1, they obtained rectal and nasal swabs from 10 other symptomatic cows; the researchers received them two days later. The researchers obtained 40 specimens from 30 cows, of which 24 were sick while six were healthy. The age range of the sampled cattle was 2.3 to 7.10 years. Farm staff observed cattle illnesses from March 6 onward. Between March 10 and 12, more than 4.8% of cows presented with clinical influenza-like symptoms and were hospitalized for treatment.

However, there were no hospitalizations, conjunctivitis, or severe illness among workers. A maternity care worker received local care for influenza-resembling signs; two milkers also developed influenza-like signs and remained at home. The researchers performed phylogenetic analyses to compare related viral infections using the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and GenBank data and eight viral genetic segments. Results Multiple cattle swabs showed molecular findings of H5 IAV infection. None of the initial 20 cattle samples showed coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza D virus, or enterovirus presence. Among the specimens, three (one sick cow and two healthy cows) exhibited molecular findings indicative of a Pneumoviridae or Paramyxoviridae viral infection. Multiple swabs in Vero E6, MDCK, and MDBK also showed molecular findings of H5 IAV infection. Molecular HA cleavage region analysis indicated high viral pathogenicity. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) supported the results; one cell-cultured specimen obtained from the nasal cavity of cattle provided a complete (H5N1) genome, confirmed as HPAI of the 2.3.4.4b clade. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the eight genetic segments of the virus resembled 13 viruses of the epizootic clade in Texas. The H5N1 strain possessed multiple novel mutations compared to related viral pathogens. The PB2-M631L mutation enhances the H5N1 viral ability to proliferate in humans through increased polymerase enzyme activity. NGS findings indicated that the diseased cow with nasal swabs tested positive for Pneumoviridae or Paramyxoviridae, which contained bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a probable illness cause. Conclusions The study identifies the H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade virus as the etiological agent for the Texas cattle epidemic. Pathogenicity investigations in animal models could improve our understanding of such viruses. The researchers detected H5N1 in symptomatic cows without other viral co-infections. The higher HPAI H5N1 prevalence in nasal swabs than in rectal swabs indicated respiratory transmission of H5N1 among cows. The NGS results revealed the presence of BVDV in nasal swabs from one ill cow and two healthy cows. BVDVs frequently cause minor respiratory infections in cattle ranches; hence, their presence may not explain dairy cow sickness. The H5N1 genome discovered in a cow's nasal samples is similar to strains from cattle, a livestock worker, and deceased birds, indicating a multi-species epidemic in Texas. Further research is required to establish transmission pathways, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and a One Health strategy.

Humans ignore it at our own peril By Brenda Goodman, CNN 11 minute read Updated 11:05 AM EDT, Tue June 11, 2024 Link Copied! A pelican suspected to have died from H5N1 avian influenza is seen on a beach in Lima on December 1, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images CNN — Mark Naniot remembers 2022 as the summer from hell. As the co-founder of Wild Instincts animal rescue in Wisconsin’s Northwoods, Naniot and his team spent the season sweating in gloves, gowns, smocks and masks and going through what felt like endless rounds of disinfection as they moved between the cages of the sick and injured animals they cared for. The precautions were necessary for a trio of infectious diseases occurring with some frequency in wild animals that summer: Covid-19 was still making life difficult, and a devastating contagion called chronic wasting disease was showing up in deer in the area. Then, there was H5N1 bird flu to contend with. “It’s highly, highly transmissible,” said Naniot, who has been involved in animal rescue for 35 years. Since it was first discovered in birds in 1996, H5N1 has shown itself to be a Swiss Army Knife of a virus, evolving the necessary tools to break into the cells of a growing list of species. So far, it has infected and killed millions of wild and farmed birds. It’s also been found in at least 26 different kinds of mammals, including, most recently in the United States — cows, cats and house mice. The voraciousness of the virus prompted Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization in April to call it “a global zoonotic animal pandemic.” Along the way, people have been a kind of collateral damage. Humans can be infected, but we aren’t really the intended targets. That could all change quickly, however. “Influenza actually makes mutations, in the sense of making errors copying its genome, at a higher rate than a coronavirus like SARS-CoV2,” said Dr. Jesse Bloom, a computational biologist who focuses on influenza viruses at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. These errors don’t always work in favor of the virus. Most of the time, viruses with errors won’t work or be fit enough to continue to copy and survive. But every once in a while, a random error can result in a change to the virus that give it an advantage in its environment, and that version of the virus will continue to spread and grow. If humans happen to be that environment, and H5N1 changes at the right place at the right time, suddenly the animal pandemic could become a major problem for people, too.

CDC/NIAID Related article Alpacas test positive for H5N1 bird flu for the first time Naniot had seen wild birds come into Wild Instincts rescue with H5N1 — bald eagles, hawks and owls — but nothing had prepared him for the red fox kits. The baby foxes were brought in stumbling and uncoordinated, making him think they might have gotten into some kind of poison. Then the seizures started. “They would have these severe, severe seizures,” Naniot said. “Screaming very loud, whole-body tremors.” The first seizures lasted for 20 to 30 seconds at a time. “And then it would get longer and longer and longer,” he said. Naniot hadn’t known his young patients could get bird flu. Further research clued him in to the fact that foxes had recently joined a growing list of species that could succumb, usually after eating the flesh of infected dead birds. “The severity of the seizures is something I really hadn’t seen before,” Naniot said. “It’s a very sad thing to see, the progression of the disease.” Risks to humans Though H5N1 is known to have infected nearly 900 people in the past 30 years, these infections have been sporadic and usually self-limiting. The virus can still be deadly, however: More than 50% of people who are known to have been infected with H5N1 have died. Still, the virus isn’t particularly good at infecting humans. Even when virus manages to get into a person and cause symptoms, it rarely gets passed to someone else. “We call these dead-end infections,” said Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinarian and expert in zoonotic infections, at the University of Guelph in Canada.

(Photo by: Ed Young /Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Ed Young/Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group/Getty Images Related article Cows have human flu receptors, study shows, raising stakes on bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle The way a dead-end infection happens, Weese explains, is that a person is around a large amount of the virus, or their immune system is too weak to resist, and H5N1 gets in. But it is not a virus that’s well-adapted to humans, so it never really builds up in respiratory secretions — the fluid that coats the nose, throat, and lungs — which would give it a way out through coughs, sneezes or even exhaled breath. There have been at least three of these have apparently dead-end infections in dairy workers in the US, who worked closely with infected milk cows. Two of the workers developed conjunctivitis, or eye infections. In one case, the worker reported getting splashed with raw milk in their eyes. A third developed respiratory symptoms after close contact with cows. All were successfully treated with an antiviral medication. None developed severe symptoms or infected others. Using a strain of H5N1 from the recent cattle outbreak, scientists recently confirmed that this version of the virus is unlikely to transmit through the air. In experiments with ferrets, which are considered the gold standard for studying how viruses transmit in people, researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grew a sample of the same H5N1 virus taken from a farmworker with the flu in Texas to experimentally infect six of the animals. Then, three healthy ferrets were placed in the same enclosures with three of the sick animals. These animals could touch, nose and lick the sick animals, and all of them became ill. Next, the CDC tested airborne transmission by putting three healthy ferrets into an enclosure where they could breathe the same air as sick animals but couldn’t touch them. Only one of those three animals became ill, suggesting that the virus carried by cattle in the current outbreak is not well adapted to respiratory spread, the CDC wrote in a news release on the study. So far, that seems to be what’s happening in the real world, too. Though more than 80 dairy herds have tested positive across at least 12 states, the number of human infections has apparently been low, though there’s been little testing to confirm that. A dairy worker's infection is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows. CDC Related article What a US farmworker’s case of bird flu tells us about tracking the infection These early ferret experiments are good news, the CDC noted, because it means the virus would need to change to become an infection spread person-to-person through the airborne droplets. The agency said it plans to repeat the tests. As Covid has shown, all of this could change in the the rub of an eye or a small cough. The more opportunity the virus has to spread, the more opportunity it has to change in ways that will help it pry its way into human cells. “It’s really important to understand everything we know today is a snapshot of today, and these viruses can change very quickly,” said Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and former director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the Chasing Life podcast. “They can adapt, and they can spread very easily when they do change,” said Bright, who is now CEO of Bright Global Health. Dr. Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that while humans have been exposed to seasonal strains of the flu, and flu vaccines help build immunity H1 and H3 flu strains, H5N1 would look pretty different to our bodies. “Our existing immunity to H3 and H1 is not necessarily going to protect us against exposure to an H5 virus,” she said. The CDC’s ferret study also had some sobering findings. In contrast to seasonal flu, which makes ferrets sick, but doesn’t kill them, H5N1 killed all the ferrets that were infected. “While the three cases of A(H5N1) in the United States have been mild, it is possible that there will be serious illnesses among people,” the CDC wrote in its conclusions on the study. Dead birds are collected in July 2023 along the coast in the Vadso municipality of Finnmark in Norway following a major outbreak of bird flu. Oyvind Zahl Arntzen/NTB/AFP/Getty Images In the more than two dozen human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide since 2022, with the most recent iteration of the virus, there’s been a wide spectrum of severity. Fourteen illnesses were severe or critical, seven were fatal, six were mild and eight didn’t have any symptoms at all, according to the CDC. Dr. Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist and immunologist at Emory University who specializes in the flu, thinks the difference in symptom severity may be due to previous exposure to seasonal viruses. Her experiments in ferrets suggest that our bodies wouldn’t necessarily be totally defenseless. In her lab, ferrets with previous exposures to seasonal flu strains didn’t get as sick when exposed to new flu viruses compared to those with no prior exposure to seasonal strains. She says she hasn’t tested this with any of the strains involved in the cattle outbreak, however. So while we probably don’t have any antibodies — the immune system’s front-line soldiers — at the ready to fight off an H5 infection, there are memory cells in our tissues that might recognize parts of a new flu virus and respond. How much help we might get from past exposures to flu viruses is difficult to predict, however, which is why vaccination would still be important to tune up our immunity. Plans to stop the virus from spreading The US has vaccines against H5 viruses in its Strategic National Stockpile, and last month, government officials said 4.8 million doses are being “filled and finished” so they would be ready for use, though there’s no plan to give them to anyone yet. Digitally-colorized transmission electron microscopic image of Avian Influenza A H5N1 virus particles (seen in gold), grown in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (seen in green). Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC Related article Wastewater monitoring in Texas picked up an early signal of the bird flu outbreak Finland has already ordered 20,000 doses of a different H5 strain — H5N8 — which, will be used as soon as they’re available to protect workers who might be vulnerable to the virus, such as scientists and those in direct contact with infected animals on mink farms, local officials told health and science news outlet, STAT News. For now, the CDC maintains its assessment that the risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, though people who work with infected animals have a higher risk and should wear protective clothing and take additional precautions to avoid getting sick. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, has made that protective equipment available to states for use on farms, and the USDA has made additional funding available to farms to support efforts to safeguard their livestock from disease. But so far, wearing this equipment is voluntary, and there are concerns that it might be difficult for farm workers to wear the full recommended kit, which includes coveralls, an apron, a mask, eye protection, a head covering, gloves and boots during the summer, which is again expected to break heat records. The government has also said it is working on the development of a rapid test for H5N1. Bright thinks severity of symptoms may depend on how much virus a person is exposed to when they are infected. Touching contaminated milk or the body of a dead bird and then rubbing your eyes or nose might deliver a smaller dose of the virus, and ultimately result in milder symptoms. Whereas ingesting large amount of virus — as some animals do when they scavenge for food or as humans in some countries do when consuming dishes made with duck blood — could lead to severe disease.

(AP Photo/JoNel Aleccia) JoNel Aleccia/AP Related article With bird flu infecting dairy cattle, FDA asks some states to curb sales of raw milk “The virus is able to infect a number of internal organs. So it doesn’t just locate, say, in the lungs, as we would think most influenza viruses would,” Bright said. It’s also been found in “the brains and then the spleens, the intestines, and the heart and throughout the body of those animals.” Dr. Richard Webby, who directs the WHO’s Collaborating Centre on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, agrees. “It’s at the top of the list in terms of bad guy viruses,” he said, noting that the virus is nerve-loving, or neurotropic. “So it goes to the brain and causes very, very severe disease.” Infected animals often behave strangely or aggressively. Ducks waddle in circles, twisting their necks, writhing on the ground. “I would hate to see it in humans,” Webby said. So far, the virus hasn’t made the changes that would enable it to become a fully human pathogen, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. It’s unclear whether it ever will. “I’ve been a student of this virus. And I surely have been amazed at how it’s changed over the course of the last 20-some years, but at the same time, you know, I’m looking for evidence that it is likely to become a virus infecting humans and then transmitted by humans to other humans. And we just haven’t seen that yet,” he added. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. Naniot at the Wisconsin animal rescue said they tried to save about seven infected fox kits in the summer of 2022, but all of them died. Other rescue organizations in their network had a few foxes infected with H5N1 that survived, but they ultimately went blind. While all the precautions they took to safely work with the animals were arduous, Naniot said he’s grateful they were effective. They never spread the virus to any of the other animals in the facility — including themselves. “Unfortunately, it’s kind of like when Covid went through, you know, it first started someplace,” he said. Naniot says he hasn’t encountered any infected animals since 2022, but he’s watching the news closely in case any cow herds become infected in Wisconsin, knowing that he could easily see H5N1 again. “It spread kind of like wildfire, and it’s a highly, highly contagious disease.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Vaccine and Medical Countermeasures Safe, effective, and readily available MCMs, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, therapeutics, diagnostics, ventilators, and respiratory protection devices, are critical to HHS's goal in preventing influenza and reducing its effects on health and society during a future pandemic. An effective influenza pandemic response includes developing, manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, and administering MCMs in the shortest time possible and monitoring their impact when used during a public health emergency. For a summary of planning priorities for pandemic influenza MCMs, please see the HHS 2017 pandemic influenza plan update: Domain 3- Medical Countermeasures: Diagnostics, Devices, Vaccines and Therapeutics. Vaccine Vaccination is the most effective medical countermeasure for mitigating the potentially devastating impact of an evolving influenza pandemic. This requires developing a well-matched, safe, and effective vaccine in the shortest time possible; determining the appropriate dose; and administering it promptly. If a severe influenza pandemic emerges, a well-coordinated vaccination campaign would need to be implemented immediately to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Ross1,2,3,4 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 13800 (2024) Cite this article 818 Accesses 1 Citations 1 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Influenza virusVaccines AbstractAdjuvants enhance, prolong, and modulate immune responses by vaccine antigens to maximize protective immunity and enable more effective immunization in the young and elderly. Most adjuvants are formulated with injectable vaccines. However, an intranasal route of vaccination may induce mucosal and systemic immune responses for enhancing protective immunity in individuals and be easier to administer compared to injectable vaccines. In this study, a next generation of broadly-reactive influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were developed using the Computationally Optimized Broadly Reactive Antigen (COBRA) methodology. These HA vaccines were formulated with Mastoparan 7 (M7-NH2) mast cell degranulating peptide adjuvant and administered intranasally to determine vaccine-induced seroconversion of antibodies against a panel of influenza viruses and protection following infection with H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in mice. Mice vaccinated intranasally with M7-NH2-adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines had high HAIs against a panel of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and were protected against both morbidity and mortality, with reduced viral lung titers, following challenge with an H1N1 influenza virus. Additionally, M7-NH2 adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines induced Th2 skewed immune responses with robust IgG and isotype antibodies in the serum and mucosal lung lavages. Overall, this intranasally delivered M7-NH2 -adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccine provides effective protection against drifted H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.

Seasonal influenza virus infections can cause severe respiratory disease resulting in hospitalization and death1. Antigenic drift and shift allow influenza viruses to escape the host immune defenses by changing the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)2. This is important since developing an effective vaccine against ever-changing influenza A viruses (IAVs) becomes difficult since the selected wild-type (WT) strains included in each seasonal influenza vaccine are not always well matched to circulating strains in a given season, thus compromising the effectiveness of the vaccine3. Current commercial vaccines often use live-attenuated virus or split-inactivated virus vaccine platforms that induce high titer immune responses4. A few of the currently licensed vaccines have been formulated with adjuvants, such as the oil-in-water emulsion MF595. The addition of adjuvants may enhance vaccine induced immune responses in higher risk groups, such as infants with undeveloped immune systems or the elderly with impaired immune responses6,7.Adjuvants serve as pharmacological or biological molecules that enhance the elicitation of specific immune responses upon co-administration with vaccine compounds8. To date, most influenza vaccines are administered by parenteral injections9. However, an intranasal route of vaccination may induce mucosal and systemic immune responses in order to enhance protective immunity in individuals with weak immune systems10. Intranasal vaccines are painless and easier to administer compared to the invasive methods used with injectable vaccines, thus likely improving vaccine uptake worldwide10. In this study, Mastoparan 7 (M7-NH2) peptides were used as adjuvant with hemagglutinin proteins and compared to hemagglutinin proteins with no adjuvant. The M7-NH2 is a 14 amino acid long cationic peptide sequence (INLKALAALAKKIL-NH) derived from wasp (Vespula lewisii) venom and has been previously used in mucosal vaccines for enhancing immunity against systemic anaphylaxis caused by peanut allergic responses as well as vaccines that were effective against cocaine challenge, in mice11,12,13. Additionally, M7-NH2 enhances the efficacy of a west Nile virus subunit vaccine, administered intranasally in mice14. M7-NH2 activates mast cells via its Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X2 (MRGPRX2)12,15. Upon activation of mast cells by M7-NH2, there is a release of preformed mediators, such as histamine, proteases, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-4 and IL-5 that are degranulated at mucosal surfaces or tissues and may have different functions depending on their location16. Additionally, mast cells are activated by cross-linking IgE receptors or IgG Fc gamma IIIA receptors, vital for activating mast cells, and important innate components for mediating the maturation and trafficking of dendritic cells (DCs) to draining lymph nodes17. These dendritic cells will activate naïve T cells via TNF-α and other inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, IL-33, and IL-18, and thereby modulate the adaptive immune response16. Overall, the use of mast cell activators as adjuvants has been shown to be safe, independent of allergic responses, when tested in animal models12.To meet the mission for next-generation influenza vaccines, a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) design methodology has been used to develop HA and NA molecules that elicit protective broadly-reactive antibodies against drifted influenza virus strains18,19. In previous studies, bivalent H1 and H3 COBRA recombinant HA vaccines, B COBRA HA vaccines, H5 COBRA virus-like particle vaccines, or N1 COBRA NA vaccines elicited antibodies with HAI and NAI activity against panels of historical and contemporary influenza A and B viruses in mice, ferrets, and non-human primates, following intramuscular injection which translated to the protection of animals against viral challenge with H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, B-Victoria, and B-Yamagata influenza lineages3,19,20,21,22,23. To determine if COBRA designed vaccines were effective following intranasal delivery, mice were administered the COBRA H1 and H3 HA vaccines formulated with M7-NH2. Intranasal delivery of these vaccines, when mixed with M7-NH2, elicited broadly-reactive serum and mucosal antibodies and protected mice against lethal influenza virus challenge.Materials and methodsAntigen construction and synthesisCOBRA hemagglutinin (HA) proteins corresponding to H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses (IAVs) were design based on the next-generation COBRA methodology as previously described18. Briefly, Y2 (H1) COBRA HA was derived from 6232 full length wild-type influenza A(H1N1) HA protein amino acid sequences, residues 1–566 (starting with Methionine as the first amino acid), from human H1N1 virus infections collected from January 1, 2014 to December, 2016 were downloaded from the EpiFlu online database and organized by their date of collection19.For H3 COBRA HA designated, J4 and TJ5, full length wild-type influenza A(H3N2) HA protein amino acid sequences, residues 1–566 (starting with Methionine as the first amino acid), from 54,041 human H3N2 virus infections collected from May, 1 2008 to April 2016 were downloaded from EpiFlu online database and organized by their date of collection. TJ5 was designed using the sequences between May 2008 to September 2012 and J4 was designed using the sequences between May 2013 to April 20163.Soluble HA proteins were purified from cells transiently transfected into HEK293T with plasmids expressing a truncated HA gene that was cloned into the pcDNA3.1. The truncated HA genes were generated by replacing the transmembrane domain with a T4 fold-on domain, an Avitag, and a 6 × His-tag for purification24. The concentration of the soluble HA proteins was determined by conventional bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) according to the manufacture’s instruction (Thermo Fisher, Meridian Rd., Rockford, IL, USA).Vaccination and infectionDBA/2J and BALB/c female mice (n = 66 and n = 30, respectfully; 6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed in microisolator cages with access to food and water. The mice were cared for by USDA guidelines for laboratory animals and all procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (no. A2020 03–007-Y1-A0 and LRI2935) and performed in accordance with institutional and ARRIVE guidelines. Mice were randomly divided into six (DBA/2J) or three (BALB/c) groups, with n = 11 or n = 10 mice, respectfully, in each group. Prior to vaccination (day 0), all of the mice were bled via the submandibular to confirm seronegative status against seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses, including: Texas/36/1991, Solomon Islands/03/2006 (SI/06), Brisbane/59/2007 (Bris/07, California/07/2009 (Cal/09), Michigan/45/2015 (Mich/15), Brisbane/02/2018 (Bris/18), and H3N2 viruses: Texas/50/2012 (TX/12), Switzerland/9715293/2013 (Swit/13), Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK/14), Singapore/IFNIMH/2016 (Sing/16), Kansas/14/2017 (KS/17), Switzerland/8060/2017 (Swit/17), and South Australia/34/2019 (SA/19). Mice were anesthetized with 2–3% isoflurane and prime vaccinated intranasally (IN) with 50 μL of vaccine formulations containing 1, 0.1, or 0.01 μg of each of the COBRA rHA proteins, Y2, J4, and TJ5, in cold 0.9% saline solution plus the addition of 28.4 μg of lyophilized M7-NH2 powder in cold 0.9% saline solution, with mixing by vortex. As controls, some mice were vaccinated with 50uL of COBRA HA vaccines without adjuvant (0.9% saline only) or mock vaccinated with 50 μL of M7-NH2 adjuvant only (0.9% saline plus M7-NH2) vaccines (Fig. 1a,b). Upon recovery, all of the mice were place back into their cages and monitored. On day fourteen, all of the mice were bled and sera were separated from blood cells via centrifugation and then stored at − 20 ± 5 °C (Fig. 1b). On day 28, the mice were boosted as before following the same vaccination regimen. Following the boost, all of the DBA/2J mice were bled on days 42 and 49, as before, and the collected sera was separated by centrifugation in microcentrifuge tubes at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and pooled together equally and then stored at − 20 ± 5 °C. All of the BALB/c mice were boost-vaccinated on day 28, as before, and bled on day 42 and the collected sera was processed and stored as before (Fig. 2a,b). Concurrently, bronchoalveolar lavages were harvested from five BALB/c mice on day 35 post-boost-vaccination. Vaccinated mice were euthanized via carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by secondarily cervical dislocation and lungs flushed via the trachea with 450uL of cold 1× PBS using 23G needles with 22X1 G polyethylene catheters, attached to 1mL syringes. The samples were placed in sterile microcentrifuge tubes, on ice, followed by centrifugation at 3000×g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred into fresh sterile centrifuge tubes and stored at − 20 ± 5 °C. At day 52, some of the DBA/2J mice were anesthetized and infected with 8 × 106 PFU of A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1) or with 7 × 105 PFU of the mouse-adapted A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) influenza A viruses (IAV) via intranasal distillation. Upon recovery, the mice were returned to their cages and monitored daily for 14 days post infection for both morbidity and mortality. At day 55, following euthanasia as before, lungs were harvested from 3 DBA/2J mice in each group, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at – 80 °C for determining viral lung titers.Figure 1(a) DBA/2J (6–8 weeks old) female mice were randomly divided into six groups, with n = 11 mice in each group, and vaccinated intranasally (IN) with 3, 0.3, or 0.03 μg of COBRA HA proteins (Y2, J4, and TJ5) plus the addition of 28.436 μg of the adjuvant, M7-NH2 (mast cell degranulating peptide), at a 1:1 ratio. As controls, some mice were vaccinated with COBRA HAs (3 μg) with 0.9% saline, with adjuvant only (0.9% saline plus M7-NH2) or without adjuvant (0.9% saline only). (b) Schematic of Study Timeline. DBA/2J mice were bled and prime vaccinated on day 0 follow by blood collection on days 14 and boost-vaccinated on day 28. On days 42 and 49, the mice were bled, followed by intranasal challenge on day 52 with A/Bris/02/2018 or with A/Swit/9715293/2013 viruses. Three days post-infections, lungs were harvested from 3 mice from each group and the remainder mice were monitored for 14 days post infection.

Created with BioRender.com.Full size imageHemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI)The HAI assay was performed for the detection of serum antibodies that inhibit binding of influenza viruses from agglutinating red blood cells (RBCs) by preventing binding of viral surface HA to sialic acid residues on RBCs. This protocol was based on the WHO manual for laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza28. This HAI assay was performed against a panel of H1N1 viruses, including: A/Solomon Island/3/2006, A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/California/07/2009, A/Michigan/45/2015, A/Brisbane/02/2018, and H3N2 viruses: A/Texas/50/2012, A/Switzerland//2013, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, A/Singapore-IFNIMH-16-0019/2016, A/Kansas/14/2017, A/Switzerland/8060/2017, and A/South Australia/34/2019. The HAI assays were performed as previously decribed23. Sera from each mouse was initially treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Co., Tokyo Japan) for eliminating non-specific inhibitors. In a deep-well, 96-well block, sera was diluted to 1/10th final solutions by reconsituting 100 μL of serum with 3 volumes of RDE in 1 × PBS, followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. The following day, the RDE-treated sera was heat inactivated in a water bath at 56 °C for 45 min, followed by cooling to room temperature (RT), and the addition of 6 volumes of 1 × PBS. At days 35, lungs from 5 BALB/c mice were harvested and homogenized, in 1mL of cold 1X PBS, using a plunger and 70 μm strainer. In a v-bottom 96-well plate, 25 μL of PBS was added into each well. RDE treated sera or lung homogenate was added in duplicates and serially diluted across the plate. Following serial dilutions, each virus was prepared and tested at a 1:8 solution. The plates were incubated at RT for 20 min for H1N1 influenza viruses or 30 min for H3N2 influenza viruses. Following incubation, 0.8% turkey red blood cells (TRBCs) for H1N1 viruses or guinea pig red blood cell (GPRBCs) for H3N2 influenza viruses were added to all of the corresponding wells, mixed by agiation, and then incubated at RT for 30 min (H1N1) or 1 h (H3N2). After incubation, the titer of each serum and lung sample was reported as the reciprocal dilution of the last well without agglutination. An HAI titer of 1:40 was considered seroprotective as recommeded by the European Medicines Agency Guidelines on Influenza Vaccines29.Enzyme-Linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)To assess total IgG serum antibody reactivity and specificity to COBRA HAs vaccine components or WT IAV HAs, Immulon 4HBX 96-well flat bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 100 μL of Y2, J4, TJ5 COBRA or WT Bris/18, Tas/20, or Sing/16 rHAs, at 1 μg/mL in carbonate coating buffer (pH 9.4) and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C. Following the incubation, the plates were decanted and blocked with 200 μL, per well, of 4% FBS + 0.05% Tween 20 blocking buffer (BB) in 1 × PBS, for 90 min at 37 °C. During the blocking incubation, serum samples were prepared at 1:100 ratio and serially diluted (1:3) from an initial 1:500 dilution for sera, or prepared at 1:10 ratio for lung lavages, and serially diluted (1:2) from the initial 1:10. Following blocking completion, 100 μL of each sera diluted sample or 50uL of each lung lavage diluted sample was added to the Y2, J4, TJ5 (for sera only) or WT Bris/18, Tas/20, Sing/16 (for sera and lung lavages) rHA coated plates and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Plates were washed and 100 μL of prepared secondary goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), diluted 1:4000 in BB, added to each well, followed by incubation for 90 min at 37°C. After incubation with secondary antibody, the plates were washed and received 100 μL of 1 × ABTS (VWR Corporation, Matsonford Rd Radnor, PA, USA) solution and incubated for about 13 min at 37 °C. After complete colorimetric development, 50 μL 1% SDS solution was added to each well to stop the colorimetric reaction. The optical density (O.D.) of the samples were immediately read at 414nm in a spectrophotometer (PowerWave XS, BioTek) using the Gen05 software (version 3.14, https://www.agilent.com/en/support/biotek-software-releases) to measure the antibody end-point titers, and compared to positive and negative controls. To further assess IgA and specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotype binding antibodies, samples were processed as before on Y2 coated plates (for sera only) or WT Bris/18, Tas/20, Sing/16 rHAs (for sera and lung lavages) and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse IgA, IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b antibody solutions and measured as before. Both sera and lung lavages were prepared at an initial 1:10 and serially diluted (1:2) for detection of IgA and all lung lavages were prepared at an initial 1:10 and serially diluted (1:2) for detection of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b.Lung viral titersMDCK cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 10cm2 and incubated for 24h and grown to ~ 95% confluency. Day 55 lungs from each DBA/2J mouse were weighed and homogenized in DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S), 10 times their weights. The lung homogenates where then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min to remove debris and serially diluted, tenfold. Additionally, a tenfold serial dilution of Brisbane/02/2018 or A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 were used as positive controls. The diluted samples were then added to the MDCK monolayers at 100 μL per well, and allowed to infect for one hour, with 15-min shaking intervals, at RT. Moreover, negative control wells received 100 μL of DMEM P/S only. After one hour of infection, the supernatant from each well was aspirated and the wells were washed once with DMEM P/S, with removal of media after the wash. Next, 2mL of a 1:1 solution of 1.6% agarose in 2 × cMEM media containing TPCK-Trypsin at 1 μg/mL was added to each well and allowed to solidify, followed by incubation for 2–5 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Once cytopathic effects were confirmed, the agarose layers were removed from each well and the cells were fixed with 10% formalin solution for 10 min at RT. After the 10 min, the formalin was removed and the cells were stained with 1% Crystal Violet (Fisher Science Education, Waltham, MA, USA) at RT, for 10–15 min. Following completion of staining, the Crystal Violet was removed and the wells were rinsed in water. The plates were allowed to dry and the plaque forming units (PFUs) were counted, followed by calculation of the lung viral titers as PFU/g of tissue.Institutional review board statementUSDA guidelines and regulations for laboratory animals were followed for caring for the mice and all of the procedures performed on the mice were reviewed and approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (no. A2020 03-007-Y1-A0 and LRI2935), and performed in accordance with institutional and ARRIVE guidelines.ResultsAntigen specific serum and lung binding antibodiesFollowing the second vaccination, anti-HA IgG binding antibodies to the rHA proteins used for vaccination, WT Bris/18 H1N1, WT Tas/20 H3N2, and WT Sing/16 H3N2 rHAs, was assessed (Fig. 3a–e). Mice vaccinated with adjuvant only or the vaccine only had no detectable IgG antibodies in their sera that bound to any of the rHA proteins. However, all mice vaccinated intranasally with the highest dose of M7-NH2–adjuvanted HA (3 μg) had high anti-HA total IgG serum titers against Y2, J4, TJ5, and all of the three WT rHAs proteins (Fig. 3a–e). However, ~ 50% of the mice vaccinated with the COBRA HA (0.3 μg) vaccines plus M7-NH2 adjuvant seroconverted and had detectable anti-HA IgG antibodies, whereas no mice seroconverted using the lowest dose of vaccine (0.03 μg) formulated with the M7-NH2 adjuvant. Mice vaccinated intranasally with the highest dose of COBRA (3 μg) plus M7-NH2 had high anti-HA total IgG titers in their lung lavages against WT Bris/18 and Sing/16 rHAs proteins and 80% of the mice had detectable IgG titers in their lung lavages against WT Tas/20 rHA (Fig. 3e). There were no detectable anti-HA IgA antibodies in the sera of vaccinated mice and few mice had detectable IgA antibodies in the lung lavages.Figure 3Quantification of total IgG in DBA/2J mice pooled sera collected on days 42 and 49, and in the lung lavages of BALB/c mice harvested on day 35, post two vaccinations.

However, all these mice had, on average, HAI titers less than 1:40 (Fig. 5a) against H3N2 viruses. The sera HAI titers of these DBA/2J mice is compared to mice vaccinated with 3 μg of COBRA HA (Y2, J4, TJ5) alone. When these same vaccines were used to vaccinate BALB/c mice, all mice had sera with high HAI activity against the H1N1 viruses as well as 6 of 7 H3N2 influenza viruses (Fig. 5b). The sera HAI titers of these BALB/c mice is compared to mice vaccinated with 3 μg of COBRA HA (Y2, J4, TJ5) alone. There was no detectable HAI activity against KS/17 virus in any of the groups (Fig. 5a,b). There was low or undetectable HAI activity in lung homogenates collected at day 35 from mice vaccinated intranasally with 3 μg of COBRA HA vaccines alone or formulated with M7-NH2. In addition, mice vaccinated with lower doses of COBRA HA vaccines (0.3 μg or 0.03 μg) mixed with M7-NH2, M7-NH2 adjuvant only, or COBRA HA vaccines (0.3 μg or 0.03 μg) only without adjuvant had sera with no detectable HAI activity.Figure 5Hemagglutinin-inhibition activity in mice vaccinated with M7-adjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines (Y2, J4, and TJ5).

Mice vaccinated with M7-NH2 adjuvant only or COBRA HA vaccine alone, and challenged with Bris/18 lost an average ~ 24% of their original body weight and succumbed to infection by day 6 post-infection with no mice surviving infection (Fig. 6a,b). Mice vaccinated with COBRA HA (3 μg) formulated with M7-NH2 only lost an average of ~ 8% (day 6) and had 100% survival (Fig. 6a,b). Mice vaccinated with lower doses of the COBRA HA/M7-NH2 vaccine lost greater than 18% of their original body weight and all of mice succumbed to infection by day 6 post-infection, (Fig. 6a,b). Mice vaccinated with M7-NH2 adjuvant only and challenged with Swit/13 lost an average ~ 26% of their original body weight and succumbed to infection by day 5 post-infection with no mice surviving infection (Fig. 6d,e). Mice vaccinated COBRA HA (3 μg) vaccine alone and challenged with Swit/13 lost an average ~ 22% of their original body weight and succumbed to infection by day 6 post-infection with one mouse surviving infection (Fig. 6d,e). Mice vaccinated with COBRA HA (3 μg) formulated with M7-NH2 and challenged with Swit/13 only lost an average of ~ 5% (day 4) and had 100% survival (Fig. 6d,e).Figure 6Weight loss, survival, and viral lung titers of DBA/2J mice vaccinated IN with M7-NH2.

A P value of less than 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).Full size imageAt day 3 following infection with Bris/18 (day 55), mock vaccinated mice, COBRA HA vaccinated only mice, as well as mice vaccinated with the two lowest doses of COBRA HA plus M7-NH2 adjuvant, all had high viral lung titers (~ 1 × 106 pfu/g of tissue) (Fig. 6c). In contrast, two of the three mice vaccinated with the highest dose of COBRA HA (3 μg) plus M7-NH2 had undetectable viral lung titers (Fig. 6c). One mouse (Fig. 6c; blue square) in the group vaccinated with 3 μg of COBRA rHA plus M7-NH2 adjuvant had viral lungs titers (6.55 × 105 pfu/g of tissue). While this mouse had anti-HA IgG endpoint dilution serum titer of ~ 1 × 104 against WT Bris/18 rHA, this mouse had greatly reduced HAI titers (1:20) compared to the other 2 mice in the group (Fig. 6c and Table 1). However, this particular mouse also had little weight loss (98% of original weight at day 3 post-infection; Fig. 6a; Table 1), following viral challenge. The other 2 mice pertaining to this vaccine regimen both had high HAI titers (1:320) and total endpoint IgG titers of 1.4 × 104 against WT Bris/18 rHA (Table 1). There were also no detectable viral lung titers (Fig. 6c and Table 1) or visible plaques at day 3 post-infection (Suppl. Fig. S1b). Moreover, mice vaccinated IN with M7-NH2 alone, COBRA HA (3 μg) alone, or lower doses of vaccine mixed with M7-NH2 had significant weight loss (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6a) with no mice surviving challenge (Fig. 6b), and high viral lung titers (~ 1 × 10e + 6 pfu/g of tissue) at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 6c, Table 1, and Suppl. Fig. S1). Following challenge with Swit/13 (day 55), mice vaccinated with COBRA HA (3 μg) vaccines alone had between 6.4 × 104 and 5 × 105 pfu/g of tissue (Fig. 6f). Mice vaccinated with M7-NH2 alone had between 9.4 × 104 and 3 × 106 pfu/g of tissue (Fig. 6f). On the contrary, mice vaccinated with COBRA HA (3 μg) plus M7-NH2 had undetectable viral lung titers (Fig. 6f). Table 1 Correlation of immunology and pathology pre- and post- Bris/18 IAV infection in DBA/2J mice.Full size tableDiscussionMost seasonal influenza vaccines are not formulated with an adjuvant30. Although adjuvants are tolerable when administered to individuals, they may be associated with increased inflammation and reactogenicity, particularly at the injection site6. However, adjuvanted influenza vaccines have been approved in the U.S. and European Union (E.U.) to increase the effectiveness of vaccines for the elderly30. MF59 is a squalene oil-in-water adjuvant added to the split inactivated influenza vaccine (marketed under the name Fluad by Sequiris, Holly Springs, NC, USA)31. The next-generation of adjuvants for influenza virus vaccines are currently being tested by many groups which include toll-like-receptor (TLR) agonists such as GLA (glucopyranosyl lipid A) (TLR4) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (TLR9), or saponins (Iscomatrix)32. There are many challenges when tailoring an adjuvant to a vaccine of interest in order to stimulate the necessary protective immune responses. Stimulating the innate immune system will modulate the adaptive immune response and is an efficient mechanism for eliciting protective immunity against viral infection33. Eliciting specific immune responses depends on the type of adjuvant used since some adjuvants induce T-bet and STAT-4 signaling pathways that lead to polarized responses that are skewed towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 response and other adjuvants result in induction of STAT-6 and GATA-3 signaling pathways that drive responses towards an anti-inflammatory Th2 response34,35. Additionally, adjuvant physicochemical properties and formulations play important roles for how an adjuvant interacts with vaccine components. To date, most adjuvants are formulated with injectable vaccines and administered intramuscularly36. An intranasal route of vaccination may induce mucosal and systemic immune responses in order to enhance protective immunity in individuals with weak immune systems, and may be easier to administer compared to invasive injectable vaccines since they do not require needles36.In this study, M7-NH2 was administered intranasally with COBRA HA proteins in a dose-dependent approach. Vaccinated mice had high titers of blocking antibodies in their sera after two vaccinations against panels of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Following vaccination, influenza virus-specific IgG antibodies are induced after memory B-cell activation in the spleen that further differentiate into serum IgG isotypes37. In the presences of T helper (Th) type 1 cytokines, such as IFN-γ, isotype class switching results in IgG2a secreted antibodies38. In contrast, in the presence of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 or IL-5, IgG isotype switching results in IgG1 secreted antibodies14,39. Although Th1 pro-inflammatory immune responses are ideal for clearance or prevention of influenza virus infection, a simultaneous Th2 anti-inflammatory response may be beneficial for counteracting and depolarizing detrimental local and systemic outcomes caused by increased levels of inflammation. Mice vaccinated with COBRA HA proteins plus M7-NH2 had high titer IgG1 serum antibodies against three WT H1N1 and H3N2 IAV HAs, with some level of detectable IgG2b antibodies, but little to no IgG2a. These finding are in agreement with previous studies demonstrating comparable enhancement of IgG1 with minimal IgG2a, in mice vaccinated with M7-NH2-adjuvanted subunit vaccines, thus indicating a Th2 polarized response induced by M7-NH214.Notably, mice vaccinated intranasally with COBRA HA antigens plus M7-NH2 had total serum anti-HA IgG titers ~ 104–105 (primarily IgG1) compared to mice vaccinated intranasally with M7-NH2 alone or the COBRA HA vaccine alone. Vaccinating intranasally using M7-NH2 has the potential to induce protective antibodies in both the nasal mucosal cavity (local) and in sera (systemic). In the sera, vaccine elicited anti-HA serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody titers were similar to the levels of anti-HA antibody titers in the lung lavages of mice, with little to no IgA antibodies. These finding are in contrast to the intramuscularly administered AddaVax, an MF59-like adjuvant, which does not induce measurable mucosal responses in young or old mice vaccinated mice40.Serum HAI titers ≥ 1:40 in people following vaccination with commercial seasonal influenza vaccines are seroprotective in at least 50% of the vaccinated population and are used as a standard of an effective influenza vaccine in people29. Sera and lung lavages collected from mice vaccinated with COBRA HA antigens (3 μg) plus M7-NH2 had seroprotective antibody titers against a panel of H1N1 viruses isolated from 2009 to 2018. These same serum samples had a lower average of HAI activity against H3N2 viruses isolated between 2012 and 2019 in DBA/2J mice but still elevated in BALB/c mice. However, there were mice with low HAI titers that still survived viral challenge without significant weight loss. The dominating epitopes on the head region of HA of the wild-type and COBRA H1 subtypes lead to the recognition and binding by antibodies directed toward the HA head. COBRA HA proteins could potentially elicit antibodies directed towards the conserved stem region, and thus could contribute toward protection, independent of HAI activity41. Additionally, some HAI activity against three H3N2 IAVs was observed in lung homogenates of mice vaccinated with COBRA vaccines, suggesting that protective antibodies could also be retained within mucosal tissue. However, IN administration of COBRA HA proteins with M7-NH2 did elicit HAI titers against both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, systemically and in the nasal respiratory tract. Mice vaccinated IN with COBRA HA antigens (3 μg), adjuvanted with M7-NH2, survived Bris/18 (H1N1) virus challenge, with only about ~ 8% weight loss at day 6 post-infection that may correlate with the slightly lower HAI titers against the challenge strain in mouse number 2. HAI titers could potentially be enhanced following an additional vaccine boost. Additionally, mice vaccinated IN with COBRA HA antigens (3 μg), adjuvanted with M7-NH2, survived Swit/13 (H3N2) virus challenge, with only about ~ 4% weight loss at day 4 post-infection.While other adjuvants such as aluminum salts, MF59, adjuvant system 03 (AS03), or an alternative adjuvant system of AS03 (AF03) may be compatible with intramuscularly administered influenza vaccines, many gaps remain in terms of their mechanism of action. To date no intranasal adjuvants have been approved for use with influenza virus vaccines. This in turn poses limitations and challenges in terms of inducing the necessary immune responses in mucosal compartments that are exposed to the external environment, where respiratory pathogens, such as influenza viruses, invade the host.In general, rHA COBRA HA vaccines alone administered intranasally in mucosal compartments without M7-NH2 adjuvant provide little to no immunogenicity. In this study, even with very low doses of vaccines, using the same amount of M7-NH2 adjuvant failed to be immunogenic. To address this challenge, and to tailor this specific adjuvant to the COBRA HA vaccines for comparing to unadjuvanted COBRA HA vaccines, and explore the adjuvant-enhanced effect on vaccine efficacy, this dose–response study allowed for identifying the optimal dose of COBRA HA (3 μg) vaccines required for formulating with M7-NH2 and successfully enhance the immunogenicity of the antigens, when administered intranasally.The findings in this study demonstrated that M7-NH2 mast cell degranulating peptide adjuvant, was able to successfully enhance the immunogenicity following intranasal COBRA (H1/H3) HA vaccination in mice and reduce morbidity and mortality following challenge with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. Herein, M7-NH2 peptides have potential as an intranasal adjuvant that induces mucosal and systemic immune responses to enhance protective immunity in individuals with weak immune systems, such as young kids and older adults, and provide for easier administration compared to injectable vaccines. Moreover, adjuvanting COBRA HA vaccines with M7-NH2 peptides could potentially enhance the immune responses in humans, thus allowing for assessment of seroconversion in sera collected from participants in future human clinical trials.

Leo Malsam / iStock The 4-year-old child, who had a history of upper-airway disease, was first hospitalized in February for complications from respiratory virus infections, which included influenza B and adenovirus. In early March, the child was hospitalized again with severe respiratory symptoms, which were positive for unsubtyped influenza A and rhinovirus.Further testing of the flu virus sample revealed H9N2. The child was discharged from the hospital on oxygen support on May 1. The follow-up investigation found that the patient had been exposed to poultry at home. No similar symptoms were reported in the patient's family, community, or healthcare contacts.The WHO said most H9N2 infections are typically mild, though a few hospitalizations and deaths have been reported. It added that sporadic infections will likely continue, though the overall risk is low, given that H9N2 hasn't shown a capacity to transmit easily among people.China reports another H9N2 caseChina's H9N2 case is in Guangxi province, according to a weekly avian influenza update from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection. The 3-year-old boy's symptoms began on May 2. No other details were available about his condition or how he likely contracted the virus.H9N2 circulates as a low-pathogenic virus in poultry in many parts of the world. China's mainland has reported five infections involving the virus this year. Moderna reports promising findings for flu-COVID combo vaccine News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 Influenza Vaccines Moderna yesterday reported promising phase 3 clinical trial findings for its candidate combination mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1083) against influenza and COVID-19. The vaccine contains components of Moderna's candidate seasonal flu vaccine and its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine. Anthony Quintano / Flickr cc The company tested the vaccine in two adult cohorts, one adults ages 65 and older—some who were coadministered Fluzone high-dose flu vaccine and Moderna's current COVID vaccine and some who got Moderna's combination vaccine. The other group comprised adults ages 50 to 64 years old, some of whom were co-administered Fluarix, a standard-dose flu vaccine, and Moderna's current COVID vaccine and some who got Moderna's combo vaccine.In both groups, the combo vaccine prompted higher immune response against seasonal flu strains and SARS-CoV-2. Safety and tolerability measures were similar to that of licensed vaccines used in the trial.Moderna said it will present the findings at an upcoming conference and will submit them for publication in a medical journal. The company said it would engage with regulators on the next steps.Combo vaccine could help fill vaccination gapsIn a blog post, Francesca Ceddia, MD, Moderna's chief medical affairs officer, said other combinations such as tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TDaP) and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) have been shown to protect against multiple disease and have been tied to improved vaccine coverage and adherence to immunization schedules.She said that, as of May, flu vaccine uptake for the 2023-24 season was more than double that of COVID for US adults. Ceddia added, however, that COVID hospitalizations were higher than for flu, especially in older adults. "The convenience that a combination vaccine could offer patients may help fill this gap while simplifying and routinizing vaccination against both diseases, which could help improve compliance with public health recommendations." RSV hospitalizations for kids doubled in 2022-23 News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Visivasnc / iStock A new study today in JAMA Network Open shows that pediatric hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) doubled during the 2022-2023 season compared to the prior year. The population-based cohort study of children aged 5 years and younger in Ontario, Canada, looked at hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for RSV from July 1, 2017, through March 31, 2023.On average, 700,000 children per study year were included. Though the 2021-2022 season peaked a bit earlier than prepandemic seasons, the number of hospitalizations was similar, at 289.1 per 100,000 children in 2021-2022, compared to 281.4 to 334.6 per 100,000 in 2017 through 2020.In 2022-2023, however, RSV season peaked a month earlier and resulted in more than twice as many hospitalizations (770.0 per 100 000).ICU admissions tripledThe RSV hospitalizations also led to more ICU admissions.”The proportion of children admitted to an ICU in 2022-2023 (13.9%) was slightly higher than prepandemic (9.6%-11.4%); however, the population-based rate was triple the prepandemic levels (106.9 vs 27.6-36.6 per 100 000 children in Ontario)," the authors said. The rate of mechanical ventilation use was also two- to three-fold higher in 2022-2023 compared with prepandemic years, the authors said. During 2020 and 2021, cases of RSV dropped as COVID-19 mitigation measures, including masking and school closures, halted transmission of RSV. In Ontario, only 11 RSV hospitalizations and seven ICU admissions occurred during the 2020-2021 season. But in 2022-2023, a resurgence was seen as RSV, flu, and COVID-19 all co-circulated with most mitigation efforts removed. The unexpected and widespread influences on seasonal respiratory viruses that followed the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for ongoing research."The unexpected and widespread influences on seasonal respiratory viruses that followed the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the need for ongoing research to understand the impact of pandemic mitigation measures and the unique factors of transmission for common pathogens to ensure societies are better prepared to respond to future pandemics," the authors concluded. GARDP, Bugworks to collaborate on broad-spectrum antibiotic News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Ivan-balvan / iStock The Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP) today announced an agreement with Indian pharmaceutical company Bugworks Research Inc. to co-develop a new broad-spectrum antibiotic that targets some of the most difficult-to-treat bacterial pathogensUnder the agreement, GARDP will provide Bugworks up to $20 million in financial and technical support to develop BWC0977, a compound that has demonstrated in vitro activity against World Health Organization critical priority pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In return, GARDP will acquire the manufacturing and commercialization rights for BWC0977 in 146 primarily low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Addressing unmet public health needs"We are excited to work with Bugworks to make key investments at this critical stage in the development of compound BWC0977," GARDP Executive Director Manica Balasegaram, MRCP, MSc, said in a press release. "Many compounds in the antibiotic pipeline lack innovative characteristics and fail to target priority pathogens. In contrast, BWC0977 stands out for its novelty and potential to address unmet public health needs."The agreement makes official an alliance that was first announced in July 2023, when GARDP and Bugworks signed a non-binding term sheet to define the framework of a potential collaboration. GARDP says its support of BWC0977 depends on successful completion of key research and development milestones that align with its public health objectives.Many compounds in the antibiotic pipeline lack innovative characteristics and fail to target priority pathogens. In contrast, BWC0977 stands out for its novelty and potential to address unmet public health needs.Bugworks has received more than $12 million from CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator) for pre-clinical development and a phase 1 study of BWC0977. The collaboration with GARDP aims to take the compound through approval and commercialization."An overarching goal of this partnership is to enable access to this compound simultaneously in Western countries and in LMICs with high AMR [antimicrobial resistance] burden," said Bugworks co-founder and CEO Anand Anandkumar, PhD. "We are grateful to CARB-X for their continued support for BWC0977 from lead optimization to human clinical trials, thus enabling the asset to enter the GARDP collaborative orbit." Emergency department data show shift in antibiotics used for pediatric UTIs News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship An analysis of US emergency department (ED) visits for pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs) provides some new insight into antibiotic prescribing practices, researchers reported today in Pediatrics.Led by researchers from Boston Children's Hospital, the analysis aimed to evaluate changes in antibiotic prescribing at US ED visits for pediatric UTIs from 2011 to 2020 using nationally representative data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). A previous analysis of NHAMCS data found that, from 1998 to 2007, there was a decline in use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for pediatric UTIs amid rising resistance rates and a significant increase in the use of enteral third-generation cephalosporins (e3GC). That finding raised concerns because e3GC are broad-spectrum antibiotics that can select for antibiotic resistance. In 2014, updated cephalosporin susceptibility criteria for Enterobacterales species made enteral first-generation cephalosporins (e1GC), which target fewer bacterial species, a potential empiric option for uncomplicated UTIs.Increased use of first-generation cephaloporinsA total of 1,083 UTI visits by non-pregnant patients ages 18 and younger were included in the analysis. Over the study period, TMP-SMX prescriptions declined from 20.6% to 9.9% of visits, while use of e1GC increased from 15.2% to 32.6% of visits and use of e3CG remained unchanged. The findings persisted despite adjustments for age, sex, region, fever on presentation, payment type, and hospitalization."Although e3GC use had increased previously, their prescription rate did not significantly change, perhaps reflecting appropriate use in areas with higher resistance," the study authors wrote. "Given their association with development of resistance, ongoing monitoring and quality improvement will be important."The authors add that the increased use of e1CG for pediatric UTIs is encouraging, because they're appropriate for empiric treatment but less likely to drive antibiotic resistance than other agents. Having symptoms after getting a COVID vaccine may indicate robust immune response News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 World Bank, Erick Kaglan / Flickr cc Headache, fatigue, malaise, and chills after COVID-19 vaccination are signs the immune system is marshalling a strong response against future infection, suggests a study posted today in the Annals of Internal Medicine.University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) investigators analyzed serum neutralizing antibody (nAB) levels against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain and daily symptom surveys in 363 unvaccinated, never-infected adults given two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 2021.About 40% of the participants also wore a biometric device to measure their skin temperature and heart and breathing rate. Most participants were in their 40s to 60s.Higher antibody levels after second doseOne and 6 months after receipt of the second vaccine dose, fatigue, malaise, chills, and headache were each tied to 1.4- to 1.6-fold higher nAB concentrations. nAB levels in participants who experienced at least seven symptoms were nearly double the levels of those who reported no symptoms. In participants who wore a biometric device, each 1°C (1.8°F) increase in skin temperature after the second dose was associated with 1.8-fold and 3.1-fold higher nAB levels 1 and 6 months later."Generally, we found that the higher the number of side effects, the higher the level of antibodies," first author Ethan Dutcher, MD, PhD, said in a UCSF news release. "But this wasn't a hard rule: some people without side effects had better antibodies than some people with side effects."The team noted that concerns about vaccine side effects often contribute to vaccine hesitancy. "The toll of COVID is still high for some—sickness, lost work, lasting fatigue and the dreaded long COVID," co–senior author Elissa Epel, PhD, said in the release. "While the symptoms from vaccination can be very unpleasant, it's important to remember that they don't come close to the disease's potential complications," she said. While the symptoms from vaccination can be very unpleasant, it's important to remember that they don't come close to the disease's potential complications. Elissa Epel, PhD The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine and those 65 years and older receive an additional dose.

Ferrets are widely considered to represent the ‘gold standard’ small animal model for studying pathogenesis and immunity to human IAV infections, however little is known regarding the antiviral activity of ferret Mx proteins. Herein, we report induction of ferret (f)Mx1/2 in a ferret lung cell line and in airway tissues from IAV-infected ferrets, noting that fMx1 was induced to higher levels that fMx2 both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression confirmed cytoplasmic expression of fMx1 as well as its ability to inhibit infection and replication of IAV, noting that this antiviral effect of fMx1was modest when compared to cells overexpressing either human MxA or mouse Mx1. Together, these studies provide the first insights regarding the role of fMx1 in cell innate antiviral immunity to influenza viruses. Understanding similarities and differences in the antiviral activities of human and ferret ISGs provides critical context for evaluating results when studying human IAV infections in the ferret model.

As first line of defence, highly conserved cell -associated innate immune sensing receptors such as the cytoplasmic helicase RIG-I can detect viruses, specifically viral nucleic acids, triggering a signalling cascade that results in the rapid induction of diverse antiviral effectors. In our previous work we have demonstrated that the activation of those pathways with synthetic RNA ligands of RIG-I provides potent protection from viral infection with influenza A virus (IAV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in mice and ferrets1,2,3,4. Cell-intrinsic innate antiviral defences include a range of intracellular proteins with antiviral activity that are regulated independently of interferons (IFNs), as well as IFN stimulating genes (ISGs). Collectively, intracellular proteins which mediate antiviral activity against one or more viruses are known as host restriction factors (hereafter referred to as restriction factors). A number of restriction factors have been shown to inhibit IAV at different stages of the virus replication cycle, including during virus entry and uncoating (e.g. IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins), viral genomic replication (e.g. myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins) and assembly and budding (e.g. tetherin) (reviewed in5).Mx family proteins are IFN-inducible dynamin-like large GTPases that have been reported to mediate antiviral activity against particular RNA and DNA viruses. Mx genes are highly conserved within vertebrates which can have one to seven Mx gene copies with most mammals express two Mx genes, including humans and mice6. It is well established that particular Mx proteins from a number of species can act as restriction factors for IAV, including human (h)MxA, but not hMxB, and mouse (m)Mx1, but not mMx2 (reviewed in7). hMxA is a cytoplasmic protein that acts to retain IAV nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm, preventing their nuclear import and thereby blocking early steps in the viral replication cycle8. In contrast, mMx1 localises to the nucleus and mediates anti-IAV activity by inhibiting primary transcription, possibly by disrupting interactions between the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and PB2 in the ribonucleoprotein complex9,10. In fact, mutations in mMx1 that result in redistribution to the cytoplasm abolish its antiviral activity against IAV11.Although less well studied, Mx proteins from other species have also been reported to inhibit members of particular virus families, including rat Mx2 (Rhabdoviridae and Bunyaviridae), chicken Mx (Rhabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae), cow Mx1 and Mx2 (Rhabdoviridae) and dog Mx1 and Mx2 (Rhabdoviridae) (reviewed in6). Aside from hMxA and mMx1, additional proteins reported to mediate anti-IAV activity include nuclear Mx proteins such as rat Mx112, as well as cytoplasmic Mx proteins such as pig Mx113. While ferrets are considered to be the gold standard small animal model to study pathogenesis and immunity to human IAV (reviewed in14,15), little is currently known regarding the characteristics and the antiviral activity of host cell restriction factors in ferrets, including the Mx proteins. Herein, we investigated ferret Mx proteins, including their induction in response to type I IFNs, RIG-I agonists and IAV infection in vitro, as well as induction in the airways following IAV-infection of ferrets. Moreover, we determined the major isoform of ferret Mx1 protein induced and used an inducible overexpression system to assess its antiviral activity against IAV.ResultsPredicted ferret Mx proteinsMx genes are highly conserved in vertebrates with most mammals expressing both Mx1-like and Mx2-like lineages. Previous studies performed whole genome sequencing on an individual female ferret, as well as RNA-seq on 24 samples from male and female ferrets, allowing for annotation of 19,910 protein-coding sequences16 deposited in Genebank in 2015. The annotated sequence (NCBI Accession AEYP00000000) included identification of 3 genes predicted to encode Mx-like proteins, namely fMx1 (with two isoforms, fMx1.1 (NCBI XM_013061287.1) and fMx1.2 (NCBI XM_004762192.2) and fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1). The fMx1.1 mRNA predicted transcript (2,604 base pairs (bp)) contained an additional 23 bp at the 5′ end, as well as an additional 36 bp from residue 248, which are missing from the fMx1.2 predicted transcript (2,545 bp), resulting in an extra 59 nucleotides that are expressed only in fMx1.1. From these genes, the predicted coding sequence is 2,013 bp for fMx1.1 and 1,977 bp for fMx1.2, corresponding to 670 and 658 amino acid sequences, respectively. For fMx2, the gene sequence is 3973 bp, with a predicted coding sequence of 2094 bp and a protein of 697 amino acids.Annotation of fMx genes was updated in 2020 using data from another study (Bioproject PRJNA776022), with 5 predicted transcript variants of fMx1 (X1-5) and 14 predicted transcript variants of fMx2 (X1-14) added such that the original fMx1.1 and fMx1.2 have been designated variant X3 and X4, respectively, and the original fMx2 showing 99.9% identity to X6 (both 697 residues but with Ala to Thr substitution at residue 246 in X6). Given that short base pair reads (150 bp pair end) were used to determine predicted transcript variants, it is not known which transcript variants represent ‘true’ Mx isoforms that would be induced in biological settings.Induction of ferret Mx1 and Mx2 in ferret lung cells in response to ferret IFN-α or RIG-I stimulationPrimers were designed for qPCR to detect all variants of fMx1(X1-5) or fMx2(X1-14) (Fig. 1A,B, primers in orange). Additional primers allowed for detection of an alternative ferret ISG (fISG15), or a housekeeping gene (GAPDH). Next, the ferret lung (FRL) cell line was (i) mock-treated or treated with recombinant ferret IFN-α (Fig. 2A), or transfected with a synthetic RNA oligonucleotide to stimulate RIG-I (3pRNA) or with control (ctrl) RNA (Fig. 2B), and total RNA was isolated from cells 6 and 24 h post-treatment for qPCR. Both ferret IFN-α treatment (Fig. 2A) and 3pRNA (Fig. 2B) induced significant upregulation of fMx1 and fMx2, noting that mock or ctrl RNA treatment did not. Of note, fMx1 was induced to much higher levels than fMx2 by both IFN-α and 3pRNA (14,366 ± 687 fold (IFN-α) or 14,491 ± 533 fold (3pRNA) for fMx1 compared to 116 ± 13 fold (IFN-α) or 108 ± twofold (3pRNA) for fMx2 at 24 h post treatment). Both ferret IFN-α and 3pRNA also induced significant upregulation of fISG15 (4807 ± 160 fold (IFN-α) or 2357 ± 97 fold (3pRNA) at 24 h post-treatment).Figure 1Nucleotide Alignment (MUSCLE) of predicted mRNA transcript variants of (A) fMx1 and (B) fMx2.

(A) FRL cells were treated with recombinant ferret IFN-a for 6 or 24 h and then total RNA was extracted and mRNA levels of ferret Mx1, Mx2, ISG15 and GAPDH (housekeeping gene) were determined by qPCR. Data show fold change relative to mock-treated cells. (B) FRL cells were transfected with RIG-I agonist (3pRNA) or control (ctrl) RNA for 6 or 24 h and mRNA levels of ferret ISGs and GAPDH were determined by qPCR. Data show fold change relative to ctrl. Representative data from triplicate samples in one of three independent experiments are shown. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to calculate statistical differences. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.Full size imageAlignment of fMx1(X1-5) and fMx2(X1-14) transcript variants was performed (schematics shown in Fig. 1A,B, full alignment in Supplementary data 2/3). For fMx1, the X5 variant showed truncation at the N terminus (551 residues compared to the longest variant X1). Therefore, we designed primers to specifically amplify either fMx1(X1-4) (Fig. 1A, primer set 1) or fMx1 (X5 only) (Fig. 1A, primer set 2). When PCR was performed on RNA extracted from FRL cells stimulated with ferret IFN-α for 24 h, primer set 1 generated a prominent band of ~ 1400 bps whereas the band generated by primer set 2 (~ 820 bps) was substantially weaker (Fig. 1C). Moreover, translation of predicted transcripts indicated that fMx1(X5) lacked key signalling domains GDXXSGKS and LPRXXGXXTR associated with functional Mx proteins (Fig. 1D, red boxes)6, as well as a leucine residue at position 41 which is conserved in many Mx proteins and critical for antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses (Fig. 1D, marked with *)17. While we cannot conclusively determine if fMx1_X5 is transcribed, it certainly does not appear to be the major fMx1 species produced in FRL cells in response to IFN-α.Next, we aimed to determine the major fMx1 variant (X1-4) induced following stimulation of FRL cells with ferret IFN-α. To do this, PCR products generated using primer set 1 were cloned using the TOPO Blunt cloning kit and individual colonies were sequenced. Of these, 48/48 colonies contained fMx1(X4), and no other variants detected. Thus, fMx1(X4) which corresponds to fMx1.2 in the original annotation (NCBI XM_004762192.2), is the major fMx1 isoform expressed by FRL cells in response to IFN-α treatment. Of note, we were unable to determine the major fMx2 variant induced as we could not a design primer set that allowed for simultaneous amplification of multiple fMx2 species due to high variability in the 5’ sequence of the 14 different Mx2 variants (Fig. 1B), as well as the low levels of fMx2(X1-14) induced in FRL cells in response to ferret IFN-α (Fig. 2).Induction of ferret Mx1 and Mx2 in FRL cells following virus infectionFerrets represent the ‘gold standard’ small animal model to study IAV (reviewed in14,15), but can also be used to study immunity and pathogenesis to human RSV infections18. Therefore, FRL cells were infected with IAV (HKx31 (H3N2)) or RSV (Long) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 5 for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for absorption and then replaced with media. The percentage of virus-infected cells was then determined by flow cytometry at either 8 or 16 hpi, respectively. Given that MOI 5 resulted in ~ 50% virus-infected cells for both IAV and RSV (Fig. 3A), FRL cells were subsequently infected with either IAV or RSV (MOI = 5) and total RNA was isolated at 6 or 24 hpi for qPCR. Compared to mock-infected cells, both IAV and RSV induced fMx1, fMx2 and ISG15 in FRL cells (Fig. 3B), noting that the fold induction was much lower for each fMx compared to 3pRNA or IFN-α treatment (Fig. 2). As for IFN-α and RIG-I agonist treatment, virus infections induced higher levels of fMx1 compared to fMx2 in FRL cells. Supernatants from non-infected Hep-2 cell supernatants, or from RSV-infected Hep2 cells depleted of virions by ultracentrifugation, showed no significant induction of ferret ISGs (ISG15, fMx1, fMx2) relative to mock (data not shown).Figure 3Induction of ferret ISGs following infection of FRL cells with respiratory viruses in vitro. (A) FRL cells were infected with IAV (HKx31) or RSV (Long) at the MOIs indicated (1 or 5) and the percentage of virus-infected cells were determined at 8 or 16 h post infection (hpi), respectively, by staining for viral NP protein and flow cytometry. Data from triplicate samples in one of two independent experiments are shown. (B) FRL cells were infected with either IAV (HKx31) or RSV (Long) at MOI = 5 for 6 or 24 h and then total RNA was extracted and mRNA levels of ferret Mx1, Mx2, ISG15 and GAPDH (housekeeping gene) were determined by qPCR. Upregulation of ferret ISGs was calculated relative to mock-infected cells. Representative data from one of two independent experiments with triplicate samples is shown. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to calculate statistically significant upregulation of ISGs after virus infection compared to mock. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns = Not significant.Full size image Induction of ferret Mx1 and Mx2 in vivo following IAV infection Aside from FRL cells, to our knowledge few studies have utilized additional ferret cell lines for in vitro studies. To broaden the relevance of our in vitro findings in FRL cells we next examined fMx induction in the upper (nasal turbinates) and lower (lungs) airways following IAV infection. Therefore, ferrets were infected via the intranasal (i.n.) route with 107 PFU of IAV, or mock-infected with an equivalent volume of PBS and, at 6 or 24 hpi, animals were euthanised and tissue from nasal turbinates and individual lung lobes were collected for RNA extraction and analysis of fMx1, fMx2 and fISG15 expression by qPCR. First, we assessed constitutive fMx expression (i.e., from mock-infected animals) by calculating the relative expression, defined as the difference in Ct values of each ISG relative to GAPDH (2ΔCt)19 (Fig. 4A,B). In both nasal turbinates (Fig. 4A) and lung lobes (Fig. 4B), fISG15 showed the lowest baseline expression relative to GAPDH, followed by intermediate expression of fMx1 and higher expression of fMx2 (Fig. 4A,B).Figure 4Induction of ferret ISGs in vivo following IAV infection. Ferrets (n = 3–4/group) were mock-infected or infected with with 107 PFU of IAV (A/Perth/265/2009 (H1N1pdm09)) and 6 or 24 h later, lungs and nasal turbinates were removed for analysis of total RNA (by qPCR). (A, B) Baseline mRNA expression of ferret ISGs relative to housekeeping gene (GAPDH) were measured in RNA extracted from (A) nasal turbinates of mock-infected ferrets. Data points from individual animals are shown (n = 4) or (B) lung lobes from mock-infected ferrets (n = 3, designated F1, F2 and F3). Data points from 5 individual lung lobes/animal are shown. (C, D) Expression of ferret (i) Mx1, (ii) Mx2 and (iii) ISG15 (iv) IAV M gene in nasal turbinates. Data for i), ii) and iii) are shown as fold change relative to mock-treated animals (assigned a value of 1) after normalizing to housekeeping gene (GAPDH)). Data for iv) has been log transformed and expressed as fold change. (C) Data from individual animals are shown (n = 4/group). (D) Data from mock-infected animals have been pooled while data from individual IAV-infected ferrets (F1-F4, 5 lobes/animal) are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns = Not significant.Full size imageNext, ISG expression was assessed using the 2ΔΔCt method which determines the fold change in ISG comparing test conditions (IAV infection) relative to control (mock) conditions, which is then normalized to the GAPDH housekeeping gene19. In addition, qPCR was performed to detect expression of IAV M gene in total RNA extracted form nasal tissues and lungs. We did not detect significant upregulation of ferret ISGs in nasal tissues from IAV-infected ferrets at 6 hpi (Fig. 4C (i/ii/iii)), despite a significant enhancement in IAV M gene in nasal tissues from all animals at this time (Fig. 4C (iv)). However, by 24 hpi we observed significant upregulation of fMx1, fMx2 and fISG15, as well as a further increase in expression of IAV M gene (Fig. 4C). Consistent with in vitro data using FRL cells, IAV infection was associated with a greater fold increase in fMx1 (100–150 fold) compared to fMx2 (50–60 fold). Relative to mock-infected animals, modest but significant upregulation of fMx1, fMx2 and fISG15 was detected in the lungs of 3/4, 1/4 and 3/4 IAV-infected animals at 6 hpi with further enhancement in each ferret ISG to significant levels in the lungs of all IAV-infected animals by 24 hpi (Fig. 4D (i/ii/iii)). Moreover, IAV infection resulted in higher levels of fMx1 induction (20–50 fold) compared to fMx2 (5–20 fold) in lungs. Detection of the IAV M gene confirmed the presence of virus in the lungs of most animals at 6 and 24 hpi (Fig. 4D(iv)).Homology between predicted ferret Mx proteins and Mx proteins from other speciesFerret sequences used in subsequent analyses will be referred to based on the original nomenclature, namely fMx1 (NCBI XM_004762192.2, corresponding to X4) and fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1). To examine the relatedness of fMx1 and fMx2 to other Mx proteins, we retrieved and aligned confirmed or predicted amino acid sequences encoded by Mx genes from different species. The GTPase domain of Mx proteins contains a number of conserved domains, including a tripartite GTP-binding motif (GDXXSGKS, DLPG, TKPD) and a dynamin motif (LPRXXGXXTR)6. Analysis of sequences for fMx1 and fMx2 confirmed that GTP-binding and dynamin signature were present in predicted ferret Mx proteins, which are associated with an intact GTPase domain and required for biological function6 (Fig. 5A).Figure 5Multiple alignments of Mx1 and Mx2 proteins from different species. (A) Predicted amino acid sequences for species indicated were aligned by performing a MUSCLE algorithm using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA X) software. Conserved regions in the GTPase domain are marked. (B) Phylogenetic trees based on alignment from (A) were generated by Maximum Likelihood methods which show the relative evolutionary history of Mx proteins amongst different species.

Flanking genes are TMPRSS2 and FAM3B. Arrow direction indicates the orientation of a particular gene. For all these analyses, the following protein sequences were used: fMx1 and fMx2 (Mustela putorius furo Mx1: XP_004762249.1, Mx2: XP_012916740.1), bear (Ursus arctos horribilis Mx1: XP_026356328.1, Ursus arctos Mx2: XP_026356450), cat (Felis catus Mx1: XP_023094481.1), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes Mx1: NP_001266765.1, Mx2 isoform X2: XP_001171751.3), cow (Bos taurus Mx1: NP_776365.1, Mx2: NP_776366.1), dog (Canis lupus familiaris Mx1: NP_001003134.1, Mx2: XP_038299486.1) horse (Equus caballus Mx1: NP_001075961.1, Mx2: XP_005606216.2), human (Homo sapiens Mx1 isoform a: NP_001138397.1, Mx2: NP_002454.1), mouse (Mus musculus Mx1: NP_034976.1, Mx2: Q9WVP9.2), pig (Sus scrofa Mx1: NP_999226.2, Mx2: A7VK00.1) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens Mx1 isoform X1: XP_004406610.1, Mx2: XP_004406645.1).Full size imageNext, phylogenetic comparison of predicted protein sequences was performed based on the Maximal Likelihood method20,21, where Mx proteins separate into two clearly defined Mx1 and Mx2 lineages. When comparing fMx1 with Mx1 proteins from other species, we detected greatest amino acid sequence homology to Mx1 proteins from bear, walrus and dog, all of which belong to the order Carnivora (Fig. 5B). Similarly, fMx2 also clustered closely with Mx2 from bear, walrus and dog rather than with proteins from humans and mice. Note that mouse Mx1 and Mx2 form a small separate cluster which is located between the Mx1 and Mx2 lineages, with closer proximity to the Mx1 lineage as reported by others6. In the Carnivora, ferrets and minks both belong to the Mustelinea subfamily of the Mustelidae family. For European mink, two Mx1 (X1-2) and four Mx2 (X1-4) transcript variants have been described, noting that these are either identical to or differ by only one residue when compared to variants fMx1 or fMx2, respectively (Supplementary data 4).We then aligned Mx protein sequences from different species by multiple pairwise alignment using NCBI protein BLAST (blastp). In these analyses, fMx1 show highest sequence homology to bear, walrus, cat and dog (Fig. 5C), confirming their close proximity as shown in phylogenetic analyses. The amino acid sequence of fMx2 was less closely related to other species using these analyses, but still showed greatest homology to Mx2 proteins from walrus, bear and dog.In previous studies, Verhelst et al. reported the genomic organization of the Mx locus from different species and found that Mx genes are flanked by transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) and FAM3 Metabolism Regulating Signalling Molecule B (FAM3B) genes6. Similar analyses confirmed that the Mx locus of ferrets (and most other species included into our analysis), were also flanked by TMPRSS2 and FAM3, indicating a conserved synteny across different species (Fig. 5D). Of interest, mouse Mx genes show a different gene orientation and arrangement, likely due to duplication of an ancestral Mx1-like gene7. Moreover, the Mx2 locus is not present in cats.Cytoplasmic expression of ferret Mx1 and Mx2Analysis of amino acid sequences using online tools cNLS mapper22 and NLStradamus23 indicated that fMx1 and fMx2 did not contain a predicted nuclear localisation sequence (NLS). NLStradamus detected a putative NLS (RKFLKERLARLGQARRRLAKF) in fMx1 however this sequence is also detected in dog Mx1 and mouse Mx2, which are both expressed in the cytoplasm6. Each of the programs confirmed the presence of a NLS in mouse Mx1 (REKKKFLKRRLLRLDEARQKLAKFS) and cNLS mapper also detected the NLS in human MxB (ILQEKNRYSWLLQEQSETATKRRILK), consistent with studies confirming that both of these proteins localise to the nucleus11,24. cNLS mapper predicts NLS-specific to the importin αβ pathway and NLStradamus can also identify additional known NLS23.Given that the power of such computational methods can be limited, we next used transfection-based approaches to determine whether fMx1 (NCBI XM_004762192.2, also known as fMx1(X4)) and fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1) localised to the cytoplasm or to the nucleus. In these studies, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding different Mx proteins, each with a N-terminal FLAG tag to enable detection. As expected, transfected hMxA localised to the cytoplasm while mMx1 localised to the nucleus (Fig. 6, upper panels), consistent with their reported cellular localisation24,25. Like hMxA, both fMx1 and fMx2 were also expressed exclusively within the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 6, lower panels). Together, these studies confirm that fMx1 and fMx2 localize exclusively to the cytoplasm following expression in HeLa cells.Figure 6Intracellular localisation of human, mouse or ferret Mx proteins following HeLa cell transfection. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vectors expressing huMxA, mMx1, fMx1 or fMx2, each with a N-terminal FLAG tag. At 24 h post-transfection cells were fixed and stained for intracellular (i) DAPI and (ii) FLAG-tagged Mx proteins. Representative images are shown at 63 × magnification and acquired on Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.Full size imageStable overexpression of ferret Mx1 can inhibit IAV infection and growth293 T cells exhibit high transfection efficiency and express exogenous proteins at high levels following transfection. Therefore, 293 T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vectors encoding FLAG-tagged hMxA, mMx1, fMx1 (NCBI XM_004762192.2, also known as fMx1(X4)) or fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1), or with vector encoding an irrelevant intracellular protein lacking a FLAG tag as a control (CTRL). Cell lines were then selected by culture in the presence of hygromycin and flow cytometry to enrich for mCherry+ cells. Flow cytometry was used to confirm high levels of intracellular FLAG staining in cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged human, mouse and ferret Mx proteins (Fig. 7).Figure 7Generation of 293 T cells with stable overexpression of Mx proteins. 293 T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-mCherry vectors expressing huMxA, mMx1, fMx1 or fMx2, each with a N-terminal FLAG tag, or with the same vector expressing chicken ovalbumin with no FLAG tag as a control (CTRL). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of hygromycin and enriched by sorting for mCherry+ cells. Cells were fixed and stained for intracellular expression of FLAG-tagged proteins and examined by flow cytometry. After gating on live mCherry + cells, FLAG expression was determined in different Mx-expressing cell lines (white histograms) relative to CTRL cells (grey histogram).Full size imageNext, we assessed IAV infection and growth in cell lines overexpressing individual Mx proteins when compared to the CTRL cell line. Following infection with the laboratory adapted HKx31 strain (MOI = 2.5), flow cytometry confirmed reduction in the percent of IAV-infected cells in the presence of hMxA or mMx1 (Fig. 8A, upper panel), consistent with their reported antiviral activity against IAV26. The gating strategy used to identify NP+ cells is shown in Supplementary data 5. Moreover, IAV infection was also significantly reduced by overexpression of fMx1, but not fMx2, noting that inhibition by fMx1 was somewhat less potent than that observed for either hMxA or mMx1. When assessing the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of the viral NP in NP+ cells, overexpression of either hMxA, mMx1 or fMx1 also significantly reduced the levels of viral NP expression in the remaining infected cells detected whereas fMx2 did not (Fig. 8A).Figure 8Anti-IAV activity of human, mouse and ferret Mx proteins. (A) CTRL 293 T cells or cells overexpressing different Mx proteins were infected with IAV (HKx31, MOI 2.5) for 8 h, then fixed and stained for intracellular expression of viral NP. Flow cytometry was performed to determine the % of NP+ cells and geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of NP in the NP + gate. (B) Cells were infected with different IAV strains (MOI 0.1) or RSV (MOI 0.1) and titres of infectious virus in clarified supernatants were determined at 48 hpi by ViroSpot (VS) assay. For (A, B), data from two or three independent experiments, each with triplicate samples, are shown. Specific symbols correspond to triplicate samples in one experiment and symbols differ between independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s unpaired t-test with unequal variance to compare Mx + cell lines to the CTRL cell line. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, ns = Not significant.Full size imageTo determine the impact of Mx overexpression on IAV growth, cells were infected with different IAV strains at low MOI (0.1 PFU/cell) in the presence of exogenous trypsin to promote multicycle virus replication (Fig. 8B). In these studies we utilised HKx31, as well as representative human IAV strains of the A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and A/H1N1pdm09 subtypes as human seasonal strains are routinely used to infect ferrets in published studies. Relative to virus titres recovered from CTRL cells at 48 hpi, all IAV strains tested were potently inhibited by overexpression of hMxA or mMx1 (> 90% reduction in virus titre). Overexpression of fMx1 resulted in a more modest, but significant, reduction in virus growth for 3/3 of the human IAV, while overexpression of fMx2 did not result in inhibition of any IAV strain tested. Consistent with previous reports27, growth of RSV was not inhibited by overexpression of any of the different Mx proteins tested.DiscussionSince ferrets were first discovered to be sensitive to influenza infection in the 1930s they have been used to study various aspects of infection with human and avian IAV. In addition to influenza, viral diseases associated with distemper virus, coronaviruses, parvoviruses and rabies virus, amongst others, also occur naturally in ferrets (reviewed in28). For IAV, ferrets have been widely used to study pathogenesis and immunity, including the impact of vaccination and/or antiviral treatments. However, innate responses to IAV and other viruses have not been well characterised in ferrets, largely due to a lack of immunological reagents which limit insights to transcriptional, rather than to functional, innate responses to infection.Mx proteins are important components of innate cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity and Mx proteins from different species have been shown to mediate antiviral activity against a range of viruses. In some cases, Mx proteins act against a similar spectrum of viruses, however other studies suggest considerable inter-species variation in the viruses inhibited by Mx proteins. Currently, very little is known regarding the induction and anti-IAV activity mediated by any ferret ISG proteins. Mx proteins from a number of species, including humans, mice, bats, pigs and chickens, have been reported to restrict IAV infection in vitro (reviewed in6), but no such studies exist regarding ferret Mx proteins. Herein, we report induction of ferret Mx1/2 in vitro and in vivo, as well as their intracellular localisation and antiviral activity against IAV.Initially, we designed qPCR primers to detect all predicted transcript variants of fMx1(X1-5) and fMx2 (X1-14) and used these to confirm induction of fMx1/fMx2 in FRL cells. While both fMx1 and fMx2 were induced in response to ferret IFN-α, RIG-I stimulation or IAV infection, fMx1 was induced to much higher levels and this facilitated the identification of fMx1(X4) as the major variant produced in response to IFN-α. This finding addresses a gap in our current understanding regarding which of predicted fMx1 transcript variants in the NCBI database is truly expressed under biological conditions. Enhanced induction of fMx1 was also observed following IAV infection of FRL cells in vitro and in nasal turbinates and lungs from IAV-infected ferrets. Currently, the major fMx2 species produced by ferret cells in vitro or in vivo is unknown. Reduced potency of induction, combined with high sequence variability in the N-terminal sequence of fMx2(X1-14), hindered our efforts to identify the major fMx2 transcript variant produced.Our studies then focussed on further characterisation of fMx1. For comparison, we did include the original fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1) in subsequent overexpression studies assessing the subcellular localisation and antiviral activity of ferret Mx proteins, however further studies are required to confirm which fMx2 variant represents the major species produced in response to IFN-α and/or different viral infections. Of note, polymorphisms have been reported in Mx from a number of species at both the genetic and the transcript level, including in pigs29, cattle30,31 and chickens32, amongst others. The chicken genome has only one Mx and studies with chicken Mx have been controversial, with 25 nucleotide substitutions detected, 14 of which were predicted to result in amino acid changes32 and inconsistent results from studies investigating whether the single nucleotide polymorphism encoding residue 631 of chicken Mx does32,33 or do not34 determine anti-IAV activity.Previous immunohistochemistry studies using a mAb to hMxA detected a cross reactive protein with cytoplasmic expression in lung sections from H5N1-infected ferrets35. Herein, we used transfection-based approaches to confirm that both fMx1 and fMx2 proteins localised to the cytoplasmic compartment. Moreover, overexpression of fMx1 was associated with inhibition of IAV infection (as measured by synthesis of viral NP in infected cells), as well as growth of multiple human (> 50% reduction in viral titres) (Fig. 8). While significant, inhibition of IAV by fMx1 was relatively modest when compared to hMxA or mMx1, despite similar levels of protein expression (Fig. 7). Moreover, we did not observe significant inhibition of any of the IAV strains tested in stable cell lines overexpressing fMx2. These results are consistent with the involvement of fMx1 in the RIG-I-mediated antiviral effects we have previously reported in IAV-infected ferrets3.To date, relatively little is known regarding the anti-IAV activity of Mx1/2 proteins expressed by species in the suborder Caniformia (‘dog like’ carnivorans). In addition to dogs, bears and raccoons, mustelids form the largest family and include ferrets, weasels, badgers and mink. Consistent with this, predicted protein sequences for fMx1 and fMx2 were more closely related to other species of the suborder Caniformia than to human or mouse Mx proteins (Fig. 5). Within Caniformia, it appears that only the antiviral activity of canine Mx proteins has been investigated in a limited number of studies to date. For example, overexpression of canine Mx2, but not Mx1, significantly reduced the percentage of VSV-infected 3T3 cells36. Recently, Bayrou et al. demonstrated that 293 T cells overexpressing canine Mx1 showed reduced levels of infection by Schmallenberg virus, a bunyavirus of veterinary significance, although inhibition was modest when compared to that mediated by equine, porcine or bovine Mx137. In terms of IAV, current literature suggests that neither canine Mx1, nor Mx2, inhibit IAV polymerase activity38, nor does canine Mx1 inhibit IAV infection39. Thus, while it is clear that viruses of equine (A/H3N8) and avian (A/H3N2) origin can circulate efficiently in dog populations worldwide (reviewed in40), canine Mx proteins do not appear to represent a major component of antiviral innate immunity to IAV.For hMxA, the generalised function of the loop L4 domain (residues 533 to 572) and, in particular, a phenylalanine at residue 561 is critical for its antiviral activity against orthomyxoviruses41. Indeed, the presence of an aromatic residue at residue 561 or 562 has been proposed to correlate with potent anti-IAV activity of Mx1 proteins from species such as horses, pigs and cows39. However, Mx1 proteins from Caniformia species including walrus, bear, dog (which does not inhibit IAV) and ferrets express a methionine at residue 561. Alignment of the L4 loop of fMx1 and canine Mx1 shows differences in 13 residues, including a phenylalanine at position 567 of fMx1 which is absent in canine Mx1. While distant from residue 561, whether this still contributes to the anti-IAV activity of fMx1 remains to be determined. Our findings with fMx1 suggest that there is more complexity beyond the presence or absence of an aromatic residue at position 561 or 562 in determining the ability of different Mx1 proteins to restrict IAV replication. Swapping L4 loops between fMx1, canine Mx1 and hMxA, or mutagenesis to add (561) or delete (567) particular aromatic residues in fMx1, will provide further insight regarding modulating the potency of anti-IAV activity in Mx1 proteins from different species.Studies reported herein provide the first key insights regarding the regulation, localisation and antiviral activity of fMx1, noting that previous studies have performed comprehensive transcriptional analyses of ISGs, including fMx1 and fMx2, in the blood and lungs of IAV-infected ferrets42. Our finding that fMx1 can inhibit IAV infection and replication, despite its similarity to canine Mx1 (which does not inhibit IAV), provides avenues for further research to determine the influence of specific Mx1 regions and residues which modulate the potency of anti-IAV activity. While short read sequencing has been used to determine predicted fMx transcript variants currently reported in NCBI, future studies using long read sequencing to determine full length ferret mRNA transcripts will allow for identification of the predominant variants induced in biological settings. Determining the major transcript variant of fMx2, as well as the spectrum of antiviral activity of fMx1 and fMx2 against additional viruses, including those that naturally infect ferrets, will also provide important insights regarding the relative contributions of each ferret Mx to innate antiviral immunity in ferrets. Given the recent surge of IAV infections in farmed mink (reviewed in43), comparing the anti-IAV activities of the closely related ferret and mink Mx1/2 is also of interest, noting that European mink Mx1(X2) (NCBI XP_059020753.1) is identical to fMx1.2 (also known as X4) which we have shown to be the predominant transcript produced by FRL cells in response to IFNα.Recently, Horman et al. reported induction of ferret IFITM1, 2 and 3 in vitro in response to treatment of cells with ferret IFN-α or infection with IAV44, although these studies did not investigate induction in vivo, cellular localisation or the antiviral activity of the different ferret IFITMs. Further studies characterising similarities and differences between restriction factors expressed by humans and ferrets are of particular importance given the widespread use of ferrets as animal models to study IAV and other human respiratory virus infections, and of new prophylactic and therapeutic approaches that are based on activation of innate immune receptors such as RIG-I1,2,3,4.MethodsCells and virusesHuman embryonic kidney (HEK)293 T cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-3216), cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (CCL-2), HeLa-derived human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) cells (CCL-23), and FeRret Lung (FRL) cells were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco).

Madin-Darby Canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) were maintained and passaged in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.Seasonal IAV strains were used in this study were A/Beijing/353/89 (Beij89, H3N2), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (NewCal99, H1N1), A/Perth/265/2009 (Perth09, H1N1pdm09) and A/HKx31 (HKx31, H3N2), a high-yielding reassortant of A/Aichi/2/68/60 (H3N2) with PR8 bearing the H3N2 surface glycoproteins. All influenza viruses were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (WHO CCRRI), Melbourne, Australia. Viruses were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, Melbourne, Australia and were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day embryonated chicken eggs (with approval from the University of Melbourne Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dental Science, Medicine, Microbiology & Immunology, and Surgery Animal Ethics Committee, project #10448), following standard procedures45 and titres of infectious virus were determined on MDCK cells by standard plaque assay and expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL46. RSV strains used for this study was RSV Long (VR-26, purchased from ATCC). RSV stocks were generated by propagation in HEp-2 cells and quantified on HEp-2 cells by Virospot (VS) assay as described18. Treatment or infection of FRL cells in vitroFRL cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to treatment with 50 ng/ml recombinant ferret IFN-α (a kind gift from Tim Adams, CSIRO Manufacturing, Parkville, Australia), transfection with RIG-I agonist or infection with human respiratory viruses. Synthetic 3pRNA, consisting of a 5’-triphosphorylated, double-stranded hairpin RNA, was chemically synthesized by solid-phase synthesis using product-specific labelling, as described47. Control (ctrl) RNA was also generated47. For stimulation of RIG-I, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect FRL cells with 3pRNA (100 ng/mL) or ctrl RNA (100 ng/mL) in Opti-MEM (Gibco-BRL) according to manufacturer’s instructions. At 6 or 24 h post treatment, total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), and treated with amplification grade DNase I (Sigma Aldrich). Generation of cDNA and qPCR for ferret ISGs were performed as described below.To determine susceptibility of FRL cells to IAV or RSV infection, cells seeded in 24-well plates were cultured overnight and then infected with either IAV (HKx31) or RSV (Long) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed and then cultured for an additional 7 h (for IAV) or 15 h (for RSV). After incubation, cells were detached, washed, stained with the fixable viability dye eFluor780 (eBioscience), and then fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in water, permeabilised with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton-X 100(Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained in PBS containing 0.25% (vol/vol) Triton-X 100, 1% FCS and 1 mM EDTA. For IAV, cells were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for IAV NP (clone D67J, Thermofisher Scientific). For RSV, cells were stained with a mAb specific for RSV NP (clone B023, Invitrogen) followed by a Alexa Flour™ 488 chicken anti-mouse antibody (clone A21-200, Invitrogen). Data acquisitions were performed on BD LSR Fortessa (BD Bioscience). In some experiments, FRL cells were infected with IAV or RSV for 6 or 24 h, before total RNA was extracted and treated with amplification grade DNase I. Generation of cDNA and qPCR for ferret ISGs were performed as described below.Ethics statementFerret experiments were conducted with approval from the University of Melbourne Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dental Science, Medicine, Microbiology & Immunology, and Surgery Animal Ethics Committee (AEC# 20033), in accordance with the NHMRC Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes.IAV infection of ferretsAdult outbred ferrets (600–1500 g) were housed in the Bioresources Facility at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia. Prior to the commencement of experiments, hemagglutination inhibition assays were used to confirm all animals to be seronegative against IAV strain A/Perth/265/2009 ((H1N1)pdm09). For IAV infection, 12 ferrets were anaesthetised (25 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg ilium Xylazilin a 1:1 (vol/vol) mixture) and 8 were inoculated by dropwise intranasal delivery of 500uL of PBS containing 107 PFU of Perth09 and 4 were mock-infected with an equivalent volume of PBS. At either 6 or 24 h post infection, ferrets were euthanized for collection of nasal tissues and 5 lung lobes from each animal. For euthanasia, ferrets were anesthetised using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine following pentobarbitone sodium (Lethabarb Troy Laboratories) injection. Sections of individual lung lobes and nasal tissues were stored in 5 mL RNALater overnight at 4 °C and tissues were then frozen at − 80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from ferret respiratory tissue samples using the RNeasy Mini Plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 ml or 3 ml RLT buffer containing 143 mM β-mercaptoethanol was added directly to lung lobe sections and nasal turbinates, respectively, in gentleMACS M tubes (Miltenyi Biotec). Samples were homogenized using the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and lysates were clarified twice by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. RNA was extracted using the animal tissue protocol and eluted in 50 μl. RNA concentration and purity was assessed by spectrophotometry (A260/A280). Generation of cDNA and qPCR for ferret mRNA were performed as described below.Detection of ferret ISGs by qPCRAfter standardization, RNA was converted to cDNA using the SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bioline). SYBR green-based qPCR was used to determine expression of ferret Mx1, Mx2 and ISG15 relative to housekeeping gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) using the SensiFAST SYBR. Data acquisition was performed using the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primers used were as follows. Generic fMx1: Fwd 5′-ACATCCTCAGGCAGGAGACA-3′, Rev 5′-CAGGTCAGGCTTTGTCAAGA-3′; Generic fMx2: Fwd 5′- AAGTGGCTCAGAACCTCACG-3′, Rev 5′-GTCAGTCTTTCCGCCAGACA-3′; fGAPDH: Fwd 5′-AACATCATCCCTGCTTCCACTGGT-3′, Rev 5′-TGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAGACAACCT-3′; fISG15: Fwd 5′-AGCAGCAGATAGCCCTGAAA-3′, Rev 5′-CAGTTCTTCACCACCAGCAG-3′.To detect particular fMx1 transcripts upregulated in response to ferret IFN-α, FRL cells in 6-well plates were treated with recombinant ferret IFN-α (50 ng/ml) for 24 h and then total RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA. PCR was then performed using primers fMx1 set 1 (X1-4), Fwd 5′-GCATAAAAGCGGAGGGGCTG-3′, Rev 5′-GTCTTCGGGCACATCTGAGC-3′ or fMx1 Set 2 (X5), Fwd 5′-GGAAGTGGGTTCATAGCCGC-3′, Rev 5′-GTCTTCGGGCACATCTGAGC-3′ and the iProofTM High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Biorad) and PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen). PCR products generated using primer set 1 fMx(X1-4) were then cloned into pCR™Blunt II-TOPO™ vector using the Zero Blunt™ TOPO™ PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), and transformed into DH5α™-T1R (Invitrogen, cat K2895-20) chemically competent cells as per manufacturer’s instructions. After transformation, 50 colonies were picked and sequenced using M13 forward and reverse primers provided.Bioinformatic analysis of ferret Mx proteinsSequences of Mx1 and Mx2 proteins from different species were obtained from NCBI databases. MEGA X software was used to perform MUSCLE algorithm and Maximal Likelihood method. NCBI protein BLAST (blastp) was used to determine amino acid sequence proximities.Generation of 293 T cell lines with stable constitutive expression of Mx proteinsGenes encoding mMx1, huMxA, fMx1.2 (NCBI XM_004762192.2, also known as fMx1(X4)) or fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1), each with a N-terminal FLAG tag , or cytoplasmic ovalbumin lacking a FLAG tag as a control (CTRL), were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression plasmids (Invitrogen) modified to express the IRES mCherry element as described48. After cloning, inserts were confirmed by sequencing and 1 μg of each plasmid were transfected into 293 T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, CA, USA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 2 days, before media was supplemented with 100 μg/mL hygromycin B (InvivoGen). After culture for > 10 days, mCherry-positive cells were sorted twice to enrich for mCherry-positive cells before use in subsequent experiments.Flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular expression of FLAG-tagged proteins in 293 T cells. Cells were stained with with fixable viability dye eFluor 450 (eBioscience) and then fixed, permeabilised and stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-FLAG MAb (clone L5; Biolegend) prior to analysis by flow cytometry.Confocal microscopy to detect subcellular localisation of ferret Mx proteinsLocalisation of FLAG-tagged mMx1, huMxA, fMx1 (NCBI XM_004762192.2, also known as fMx1(X4)) and fMx2 (NCBI XM_013061286.1) were visualized in Hela cells by confocal microscopy. Cells were seeded into 12 mm coverslips circles (Deckglaser, Menzel-Glaser), cultured overnight and then transfected with 2ug of pcDNA3.1-mCherry vectors expressing different FLAG-tagged Mx proteins using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) before permeabilization in PBS containing 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin, 5% (vol/vol) FCS, and 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100. FLAG expression was detected by using anti-FLAG mAb conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (L5; BioLegend). Prior to visualization, cells were counterstained with Vectashield antifade mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM780 microscope and were processed using Fiji ImageJ software.Virus infection and growth in cells overexpressing Mx proteinsCells seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates were cultured overnight, washed and then inoculated with IAV at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI, in PFU/cell). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed to remove residual inoculum and incubated in serum-free media. In some experiments, media was supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL TPCK trypsin (Worthington Biochemical) to promote multicycle replication. To evaluate the early stages of virus replication, the percentage of cells expressing newly-synthesised IAV nucleoprotein (NP) was measured by flow cytometry at 8 hpi48. Briefly, virus-infected cells were stained with fixable viability dye eFlour 780 (eBioscience), and then fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-IAV NP conjugated to FITC (Clone 431, Abcam) before analysis by flow cytometry. To evaluate IAV replication, cell supernatants were collected at indicated times, clarified by centrifugation and titres of infectious virus in cell-free supernatants determined by ViroSpot (VS) immunostain assay as described49.Statistical analysisGraphs and statistical analysis (as indicated in the figure legends) were performed using R software version 4.0.3 . Flow cytometry data was analysed using FlowJo version 10 (Becton, Dickinson and Company). Data availability Data is provided within the manuscript or supplementary information files.

The reduction in susceptibility has been seen in viruses collected from five continents—with most cases in Europe—from May 20203 to February 2024. The viruses showed a 13-fold reduced inhibition by oseltamivir while retaining normal susceptibility to other antiviral drugs, the authors said. The detections were made as part of standard genetic sequencing of influenza viruses, and included 2,039 H1N1 viruses from the United States (1,274) and 38 other countries (765).Most detections made in Europe The viruses that lost susceptibility to Tamiflu had acquired a novel combination of neuraminidase mutations, NA-I223V + S247N. Overall detection frequency of these two mutations was low (0.67%). Of 101 viruses with this double mutation, 67 were found in Europe. "The first dual mutant was collected from Canada in May 2023, and the latest were collected from 4 countries (France, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom) during January–February 2024," the authors wrote. The Netherlands had the most detections (30), followed by France (24), Bangladesh (11), Oman (9), and the United Kingdom (9). Hong Kong had 4 detections, followed by Niger (3), Australia (2), Spain (2), and the United States (2). One dual mutant each was detected in Canada, Ethiopia, Maldives, Norway, and Sweden.Our study highlights the need to closely monitor evolution of dual mutants ."Our study highlights the need to closely monitor evolution of dual mutants because additional changes may further affect susceptibility to antiviral drugs or provide a competitive advantage over circulating wild-type viruses," the authors concluded. Gavi launches vaccine programs for Ebola, meningitis, rabies, and hepatitis B News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Ebola Hepatitis Meningitis Rabies Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners today announced that lower-income countries can now apply to four more vaccine programs, which cover Ebola for high-risk groups, rabies vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis, multivalent meningococcus, and hepatitis B. Doune Porter/GAVI Alliance/Flickr cc The four vaccine programs were approved earlier by Gavi's board, but were put on hold because of either the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of suitable products, or appropriate policy recommendations.Access for lower-income nationsIn a statement, Gavi said the latest expansion of its vaccine portfolio fits with the group's goal of ensuring that lower-income countries have access to key vaccines as soon as possible. For the Ebola vaccine, Gavi will begin funding preventive doses in countries most at risk, targeting populations at greatest risk, including frontline health workers and outbreak responders. The meningitis vaccine in Gavi's program targets five serogroups, A, C, W, Y, and X, and has already been used to protect about 5 million people in outbreaks involving serogroups C and W in Niger and Nigeria. Gavi and its partners have been working since 2018 to prepare for the launch of a rabies postexposure prophylaxis vaccine program. The disease is a serious health problem in 150 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia and mostly in children ages 5 to 14 years old. The group has also been working on a hepatitis B birth dose program since 2018. Rapid test for urinary tract infections wins Longitude Prize News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Sexually Transmitted Infections The Longitude Prize on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was awarded to Sysmex Astrego AB yesterday for the development of a rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test for urinary tract infections (UTIs).The PA-100 AST System, developed at Sweden's Uppsala University, uses nanofluidic technology to detect bacteria in a urine sample in 15 minutes and identify the right antibiotic in as little as 45 minutes, and requires no specialized laboratory testing expertise. Sysmex Astrego was among more than 250 teams vying for the £8 million (US $10.2 million) prize, which aims to incentivize the development of transformative point-of-care tests that will improve antibiotic treatment decisions. "Winning the Longitude Prize is the first true and biggest recognition that what we have been doing all these years was for a very important global cause," Ozden Baltekin, PhD, Sysmex Astrego director of program management, said in a press release.Sysmex Astrego launched the PA-100 AST System in Europe in 2023. The company says the prize will enable it to accelerate efforts to expand the global market for the test.CARB-X to fund rapid test for chlamydia, gonorrheaIn other diagnostic news, CARB-X announced today that it will award Fuse Diagnostics up to $1 million to develop a rapid diagnostic test for chlamydia and gonorrhea.The funding will help Fuse demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility of Apex CT/NG, a molecular, instrument-free diagnostic for the detection of Chlamydia trachomiti and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The hope is that the low-cost test would be ideally suited for areas in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to secondary healthcare and centralized laboratory testing.According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 129 million chlamydia and 82 million gonorrhea infections in 2020. If left untreated, they can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women. "We need rapid diagnostics that allow healthcare workers to test and treat gonorrhea out of the gate, as inappropriate treatment has led to the point that only one effective antibiotic remains," Erin Duffy, PhD, chief of research and development at CARB-X (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator), said in a press release. Low-cost, at-home antibody test can flag low immunity against COVID-19, researchers say News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 ktsimage / iStock An at-home antibody test can gauge users' immunity to COVID-19, alerting to the need for a vaccine booster dose, a University of North Carolina–led research team reports in Science Advances.The investigators evaluated the performance of the low-cost lateral-flow antibody test in 168 healthcare workers with weak COVID-19 vaccine responses. They also measured SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses among all participants before and after a third vaccine dose.By the end of 2022, more than 96% of Americans 16 years old or older had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from infection or vaccination, the study authors wrote. "However, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 tends to wane over time and is typically less effective against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants." Positive results don't necessarily show adequate immunityA negative result on the test indicated low immunity, while a positive result didn't necessarily indicate sufficient immunity. Those who tested positive had higher antibody concentrations than those who tested negative. After wild-type SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination, all participants gained systemic antibodies against evolving SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. Our research suggests that an antibody test taken at home will allow at-risk individuals to conveniently identify inadequate immunity to COVID-19 in a world in which population immunity is declining. John Lafleur, MD, PhD "Our research suggests that an antibody test taken at home will allow at-risk individuals to conveniently identify inadequate immunity to COVID-19 in a world in which population immunity is declining," coauthor John Lafleur, MD, PhD, of George Washington University (GWU), said in a GWU news release. "This can be important information for those who are considering booster vaccination, but question whether or not it is needed."Booster uptake in the United States has been low despite its ability to reduce the risk of severe disease. "Even among 65 and older US residents, the bivalent booster uptake has been reported as under 41%, suggesting the need for new strategies to build confidence and promote the use of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine," the authors wrote.They noted difficulties interpreting negative results: "Redesigning the tests to specifically detect negative Ab [antibody] results with clear instructions for interpreting those results will prevent any positive results that could mislead people into believing they are completely protected against COVID-19."

This is the conclusion of The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), as recently reported in a Preliminary rapid risk assessment of foodborne avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Hazards and risks are not the same thing. A hazard is something with the potential to cause harm. In contrast, risk is the likelihood, or chance, and extent that harm may occur. Although very rare, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, like other pathogens transmissible to people from animals, has the potential to make people sick. It can be considered a hazard. The only people who have contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) are those with close contact with live or dead animals with the disease. Thus, it is the contact with infected, sick, or animals— from breathing the virus into the lungs or contact with the eyes—that poses a risk for human infection, albeit this risk is low to moderate. Individuals in contact with infected animals should take precautions, like wearing protective equipment, to reduce their risks of infection. When it comes to food, the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was reported in meat and in eggs from infected poultry over 25 years ago. More recently, fragments of non-infectious virus have been detected in pasteurized milk and in the muscle tissue from one infected dairy cow. Pasteurization and cooking are extremely effective at destroying the virus, reducing the risk that consumers will be exposed to infectious viruses. There have been no confirmed cases of people becoming infected from eating foods contaminated with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Consumption of only milk that has been pasteurized and fully cooking eggs and meat is strongly encouraged, as these food safety practices reduce the risks associated with other microbiological hazards (e.g. Salmonella, Listeria) in foods. Consumers should feel confident that they will not acquire avian influenza A (H5N1) from food. FAO continues to follow the science surrounding this issue and will update their assessment as necessary.

Health officials continue to recommend that people get vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza every year for the foreseeable future, and high hospitalization rates for COVID-19 in the past winter were a reminder that SARS-CoV-2 can still cause serious disease.Soon, that may be possible with one shot instead of two. On June 10, Moderna reported that its combination COVID-19/influenza shot generated even better immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza than those elicited by existing, separate vaccines.Both of the shots used in the study are experimental. The COVID-19 portion relies on a slightly different form of SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein than the existing vaccine. Instead of encoding for the entire spike protein, the combination vaccine includes two key parts of it in a way that streamlines the shot to require a lower dose—which is useful for a combination vaccine, and also potentially extends its shelf life. The influenza component of the vaccine uses the same mRNA technology behind the existing COVID-19 vaccine but targets influenza proteins in the three strains that circulated during the past season: H1N1 and H3N2 from the influenza A group, and an influenza B strain.Read More: An mRNA Melanoma Vaccine Shows PromiseIn a study of more than 8,000 adults ages 50 and older, about half received the combination vaccine. The other half—the control group—received two separate shots: Moderna's latest COVID-19 vaccine, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, and a flu shot (either Fluarix, if people were 50 to 64 years old, or Fluzone HD for those 65 and older).In the younger group, the combo vaccine generated about 20% to 40% higher levels of antibodies to the influenza strains, and 30% higher levels to XBB.1.5, compared to the control group. Among older people, antibodies were 6% to 15% higher against the flu strains and 64% higher against XBB.1.5 compared to older people in the control group. “The real advantage of a single shot is that people only need to get one needle," says Dr. Jacqueline Miller, senior vice president and head of development in infectious diseases at Moderna. There's a public-health advantage, too, she says, since U.S. vaccination rates for both diseases are relatively low. "When we are able to give the two vaccines as one, it could increase vaccine compliance rates, especially for those at highest risk."Read More: How to Navigate the New World of At-Home TestingModerna is continuing to study the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu shot used in the combo as separate shots as well. That data will also help the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when it reviews the company’s request for approval of the combination shot, which could come by the end of the year. The specific strains targeted in the shot will depend on which forms of the viruses are circulating at the time. (The company also filed a request to the FDA on June 7 to update its COVID-19 vaccine to target the JN.1 variant.) The combination vaccine will likely not arrive in time for the flu and COVID-19 season this fall. But in coming years, a two-in-one vaccine could help to increase vaccination rates, which in turn could contribute to lower hospitalization rates for both diseases.More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

REUTERS/Oliver Doyle by Samuel V. Scarpino and Allison Krugman October 31, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link Epidemics occur when data systems fail. Whether in human, animal, or plant populations, responding effectively to an infectious disease outbreak requires good tracking. Novel and emerging pathogens, such as the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, stress existing data systems because funding for public health surveillance is typically tied to specific pathogens or hosts, for example, influenza rather than SARS-CoV-2 or poultry rather than dairy cattle for H5N1. When strained data systems break, lives and livelihoods are lost. Such were the consequences experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.The need to address the unique data challenges present during the first, critical moments of a new outbreak is why Professors Moritz Kraemer (University of Oxford), John Brownstein (Boston Children's Hospital), and I cofounded an international data science consortium called Global.health. For the past two months, our consortium has focused on connecting the dots between the disjointed data systems related to the ongoing H5N1 outbreak in the United States. With this data, readers can better see the timeline of events unfolding, track the effectiveness of interventions, and monitor the evolving risk to human and livestock populations.Think Global Health, in partnership with Global.health, will update the contents of the timeline every Friday. The Gaps Filled by Global.healthInfectious disease data from human and animal populations is almost always collected by a variety of public, private, multilateral, and nonprofit agencies. The U.S. government agencies responsible for collecting this data serve populations ranging from hyperlocal to federal, and their interactions are governed by a complex web of agreements and regulations that often hinder data sharing. The ongoing H5N1 outbreak further complicates the data picture because many in the scientific community failed to anticipate an avian influenza virus spreading effectively through dairy cattle—despite evidence showing that bovine infections were possible. Historically, wild birds, poultry, and pigs were thought to be the key drivers of novel influenza transmission and spillover risk to humans. Existing data relationships are scarce between the U.S. organizations responding to H5N1, which has led to gaps and delays in information sharing. The data thus comes from disparate sources and ranges from information confirmed by multiple agencies to rumors spread via social media. At Global.health, we are working to collect, standardize, vet, and share these data with scientists, government agencies, and the public. What the Timeline Reveals About the Outbreak So FarBeyond seeing the outbreak unfold, our team can also integrate data to begin uncovering the drivers of H5N1 transmission. As the world learned during the early days of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, determining the scale of infection—along with the degree to which human cases have been missed—is essential to controlling viral spread and avoiding lockdowns. This question of missed or silent infections is one that has historically been challenging to answer. Recently, wastewater surveillance, a process where sewage is tested for the presence of pathogen genomic material, has proven invaluable for tracking otherwise hidden infections across a broad range of pathogens and is a cost-effective solution for an "always on" surveillance. This question of missed or silent infections is one that has historically been challenging to answer As of June 12, by combining wastewater surveillance with data on the number and location of infected farms and information coming from outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and hospitals, our team asserts that very few human cases of H5N1 have been missed. This assertion is in agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nevertheless, the data also suggests that many dairy farms, milk processing plants, and other potential locations experiencing H5N1 transmission in animals could have been overlooked.Our team is beginning to track whether new interventions and resources provided by the CDC, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other agencies are working. If these interventions are effective, testing rates for both humans and animals should increase, wastewater surveillance should expand, and the number of newly infected farms should start to decline. If cases continue to rise despite better public health surveillance, then more action will be required to contain the outbreak. Additional actions could include vaccinating dairy cattle, funding for expanded farm worker and environmental testing, and domestic airline traveler screening. What's Next for H5N1 and How Global.health Is RespondingOur team will be closely watching viral genome datasets for mutations that may indicate adaptation to human hosts. We will continue tracking information coming from wastewater surveillance, combined with traditional epidemiological data on influenza infections in humans, to watch for the earliest signs of human-to-human spread or missed spillover cases in humans coming from dairy cattle or other animal sources. Another noteworthy signal will be the growth or reduction in newly infected farms as an indication as to whether interventions by the USDA and other organizations are starting to work. Global.health is also ramping up efforts internationally and tracking other highly pathogenic avian influenza strains more broadly. Our expanded effort includes monitoring the fatal H5N2 case in Mexico, which was recently announced as a part of a broader initiative at our organization to support data-driven global health. To that end, our organization is monitoring for H5N1 outbreak in other countries. Positive signs from Canada show that H5N1 is either absent or rare in dairy cattle, but as birds migrate further north for the summer, spillovers into agriculture populations in that country are possible. Nevertheless, beyond the United States and Canada, H5N1 remains a persistent threat, and the virus's new relationship with dairy cattle will only complicate the picture and data challenges.

A "dual mutant" flu variant has been identified in 15 countries, including two cases in the US, the CDC says. Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg/Getty Images CNN — A rare flu variant that has shown some resistance to the most commonly used antiviral treatment has been detected in at least two people in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dead birds are collected along the coast in the Vadso municipality of Finnmark in Norway following a major outbreak of bird flu on July 20, 2023. Oyvind Zahl Arntzen/NTB/AFP/Getty Images Related article Bird flu is rampant in animals. Humans ignore it at our own peril Influenza viruses are constantly changing, but this variant has two concerning mutations in places that could lower the effectiveness of treatment with oseltamivir phosphate, known by the brand name Tamiflu. “There’s active global surveillance going on looking for these mutations,” said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We want to know when they come up, because that could really have major implications for how we treat influenza.” For now, though, experts say the threat is low. Cases of the “dual mutant” influenza variant were identified in 15 countries across five continents, including two cases in the US, according to a report published Wednesday in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. But they’re very infrequent, representing only about 1% of the samples collected between May 2023 and February 2024. “They appear in a lot of places, but they’re never really the dominant virus in any place they appear,” Pekosz said. “It’s not like the mutation occurred someplace, and suddenly that particular virus began spreading and out-competing everything in one big wave,” he said. Instead, the same mutations seem to be developing in multiple places independently. The doubly mutated variant has shown a reduction in Tamiflu effectiveness of up to 16-fold, according to the CDC report – but that’s based on laboratory studies. Other influenza variants have shown much greater resistance in the lab, and there’s no gauge for what this could mean in real-life clinical practice, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “We don’t know really what the clinical significance of this slight resistance is,” he said. “It may well be that the amount of Tamiflu that we give patients is sufficient to overcome this.” Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. Laboratory testing suggests that other antiviral treatments – including a newer antiviral called baloxavir marboxil, or Xofluza – are still effective against the dual mutants, according to the CDC. And flu vaccines should offer protection against infections caused by viruses with the mutations, too. “There are no immediate implications with regard to clinical care decisions,” the CDC said in an emailed statement. “CDC is continuously monitoring the antiviral susceptibility of circulating seasonal influenza viruses in the U.S. and worldwide, along with global partners. This global virologic surveillance will inform the potential public health threat of these influenza viruses.” CNN’s Maya Davis contributed to this report.

Share Australia locks down farms as avian influenza spreads share Print Sydney — Bird flu continues to spread in the Australian state of Victoria, where more than 500,000 chickens have been euthanized. Strict quarantine zones restricting the movement of birds and equipment have also been put in place. Australian health authorities say bird flu spreads mainly among wild water birds. The highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza has been found on four farms, while another virus, H7N9, has been detected at a fifth property over the past seven weeks in Victoria state. The Australian farms have been put into lockdown. At least 580,000 birds have been destroyed as part of sweeping biosecurity controls. Japan and the United States have temporarily banned imports of poultry from Victoria as a precaution. In Australia, some supermarkets are restricting the number of eggs that consumers can buy because of disruptions to the supply chain. Avian influenza is a viral disease found across the world. It spreads between birds or when contaminated animal feed and equipment is moved between areas. Danyel Cucinotta is the vice president of the Victorian Farmers Federation, an industry group. She told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Tuesday that the virus can spread quickly. “There is very little we can do and no matter how good your biosecurity is you cannot stop wild fowl coming in. This is a particular flight path for migratory birds. There is housing orders at the moment, which means all birds get locked up. This is about protecting our birds and protecting the food supply chain,” she said. The strains of bird flu identified in the states of Victoria and Western Australia can infect people, but experts insist that cases are rare. The virus can also infect cows. The United States’ Department of Agriculture has said that avian flu has infected dairy cows in more than 80 herds across several states since late March. At least three U.S. dairy workers have tested positive for bird flu after exposure to infected cattle. All three patients are recovering. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the infections do not change its assessment that bird flu is a low risk to the general community and that it has not seen evidence of human-to-human transmission. Last month, health authorities in Mexico confirmed a fatal case of human infection with an avian flu virus that had been reported in poultry.

GlobalData Healthcare June 12, 2024 Share Copy Link Share on X Share on Linkedin Share on Facebook Moderna reported that a single dose of mRNA-1083 met immunogenicity non-inferiority criteria versus the licensed comparator vaccines. Credit: pcruciatti / Shutterstock. Moderna has announced positive Phase III data for its Covid-19/influenza combination vaccine, mRNA-1083. The investigational combination messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine generated statistically significant higher immune responses in relation to the licensed comparator vaccines used in the randomised, observer-blind, active control study among 8,000 adults ages 50 years and older. This development comes less than two weeks after Moderna received FDA approval for the first mRNA respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, further demonstrating the potential of mRNA technology in combatting infectious diseases. mRNA-1083 combines the mRNA-1010 seasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the mRNA-1283 next-generation Covid-19 vaccine candidate. At this time, mRNA-1083 is poised to be the first Covid-19/influenza combination vaccine and the first mRNA influenza vaccine on the market.

Furthermore, mRNA-1083 generated statistically significant higher immune responses against the influenza strains H1N1, H3N2, and B/Victoria, as well as SARS-CoV-2. In the study group of adults ages 50–64 years, the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of mRNA-1083 compared to Fluarix were 1.414 (A/H1N1), 1.380 (A/H3N2), and 1.216 (B/Victoria). The GMR of mRNA-1083 compared to Spikevax was 1.308. In the study group of adults ages 65 years and older, the GMRs of mRNA-1083 compared to Fluzone High-Dose were 1.155 (A/H1N1), 1.063 (A/H3N2), and 1.118 (B/Victoria). The GMR of mRNA-1083 compared to Spikevax was 1.641. mRNA-1083 also met non-inferiority criteria against the B/Yamagata strain of influenza, but this strain is no longer recommended for the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines. The investigational combination vaccine displayed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with the most commonly reported adverse reactions being injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. The development of a Covid-19/influenza combination vaccine could be advantageous to patients, as it would decrease the number of injections needed to provide sufficient protection against multiple respiratory illnesses. Likewise, the development of a combination vaccine is strategic for pharmaceutical companies, as successful uptake of the vaccine can translate to significant market shares under multiple indications. Key opinion leaders (KOLs) interviewed by GlobalData have expressed positive opinions on both the development of a Covid-19/influenza combination vaccine and the advancement of vaccines for infectious diseases due to mRNA technology. mRNA vaccines require a shorter production time and have the potential to incorporate large numbers of antigens. Therefore, they may be more efficacious than traditional vaccines. According to GlobalData, there are over 90 mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases in late-stage development (Phases II–III) globally. These include vaccines for Covid-19, RSV, influenza, cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, malaria, mpox, meningitis, norovirus, shingles, and Lyme disease. Among these are combination vaccines for Covid-19/influenza and COVID-19/RSV. How well do you really know your competitors?

The FDA has documented the H5N1 virus in animals in 48 states. Yet only 27 people worldwide have been infected since the outbreak began, and only four have been in the U.S. That suggests the risk to humans remains relatively low—for now. Why? And what early warning signs could point to an increasing risk? To find out, we spoke to Stylianos Bournazos, a research associate professor in the Leonard Wagner Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology at Rockefeller, headed by Jeffrey V. Ravetch. Part of a research consortium supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the SNF Institute for Global Infectious Disease Research at Rockefeller, Bournazos and his fellow researchers have been tasked by both institutions with a crucially important project: the development of a universal influenza vaccine that protects against every flu strain—those currently circulating and any yet to emerge. Let’s start with the big question. How worried should we be about avian flu? The good news is that we’ve had only four human cases in the United States—farm workers in Texas, Colorado, and Michigan. Two of them only had mild cases of conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and the other two developed a cough, sore throat, or fatigue. Thus far, it doesn’t seem transmittable from person to person. And the bad news? The fact that the virus has acquired the ability to cross to different species. We’re primarily seeing cows infected. Again, largely with no or mild symptoms—but still the cows are a bit more worrying because we have a lot of animals in confined spaces near humans, and we don’t know exactly how the virus is being transmitted between the animals. We suspect it’s close contact. Domestic cats on farms have died from drinking raw infected milk. Can humans also get sick from ingesting animal products that contain the virus? The FDA has found fragments of H5N1 in 20% of supermarket dairy products in 17 states. No. For humans, flu is primarily an airborne respiratory infection. It is possible to catch it by touching your eyes or nose after touching a contaminated surface or getting a contaminated liquid—like raw milk—in your eyes, but here that’s unlikely to happen outside of a farm setting. Most milk sold in stores is pasteurized, so if you and your pet drink pasteurized milk from the supermarket, you’ll be fine. Why haven’t more people caught it? A lot of it comes down to biology. Birds have a type of cell receptor in their upper respiratory tract that this virus can attach to, and we don’t have that receptor. Do we know what made the infected dairy workers susceptible to infection? No, we don’t. It’s possible genetic vulnerabilities or compromised immune systems were at play. We also don’t know why those cases were so mild, when others have been so severe. But a question I have is, do we really know there have been only four U.S. cases? There could be more more; if others had mild symptoms, they might not report it. We caught these cases in testing, but we’re not testing widely. We don’t even have a good grasp on how many cows are infected because there is limited testing of them as well. You’d hope after the COVID pandemic that there’d be much more surveillance and screening. Instead, we have significant gaps in information. However, scientists are doing whatever they can. They’ve analyzed the sequence of the virus and calculated when this flu jumped from birds into cows. In the U.S., the spillover event happened around December 2023. But the current bird flu outbreak has actually been ongoing since 2021. Since then, there have been 27 cases of human infection in eight countries, including 14 critical cases and seven deaths. What’s behind that high mortality rate? One explanation is that the people who sickened or died were infected directly by an animal that carried the disease. Their bodies had no immunity to the virus, which explains why for humans, avian flu infections commonly cause more severe disease compared to human influenza strains. And yet despite its high pathogenicity, H5N1 has limited capacity to spread from these infected people to others. Normally influenza strains adapt as they move to different species, evolving functions that promote survival and transmissibility. Without those intermediary steps, H5N1 didn’t evolve, so it wasn’t able to spread between people. And, as with the U.S. dairy workers, we also don’t know if individual susceptibilities contributed to the vulnerability of these infected people. So if we start seeing evolution of the virus through intermediary species, that becomes worrisome. Exactly. If it acquires the ability to pass from other species to humans, and then from human to human, that’s very bad news. The major concern here is pigs. They are one of the few animals that can get infected by human, avian, and swine flus. If you have a pig infected with the human variety who then gets an avian version at the same time, the virus can recombine to create a new virus. A particularly bad combination would be a strain that combines the pathogenicity of avian flu with the transmissibility of human flu. The swift development of COVID vaccines played a defining role in ending that pandemic. Flu vaccines already exist. They do, and we even have avian flu vaccines available, if necessary, as well as other variants we can modify to increase our targeted vaccine stockpile. So we’re not in a situation as bad as we initially were with COVID. You’re trying to develop a universal flu vaccine. What are the challenges? Due to the anatomy of the virus, we’re aiming at a moving target. Like SARS-CoV-2, the surface of an influenza virion is brimming with antigens that can evolve rapidly, giving rise to new variants that we have limited immunity against. Our antibody response to influenza is typically directed at viral proteins in a region of the antigen called the head domain, which is unique to each strain. However, there is also a region called the stalk domain that is highly conserved across diverse influenza strains, which means it’s similar in each one. Unfortunately, our immune responses only rarely aim at the stalk regions, and any responses are short-lived. So the goal is to be able to redirect our antibody responses away from the variable, strain-specific regions of the virus and get them to target these highly conserved regions, which cannot mutate very easily. If we can do that, we can target multiple variants at once, as well as provide protection against any variants that might arise in the future. That’s the approach the Ravetch lab is taking, correct? It’s one of them. Based on what we’ve learned about the importance of a specific set of immune pathways that are required to elicit broadly protective immunity, we are developing and testing new vaccine candidates that use these pathways to refocus the immune response towards conserved regions of the virus. Recently, in collaboration with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we examined one novel vaccine that’s in Phase 1 testing. We found that its vaccine-elicited antibodies rely on interactions with these specific immune receptors to give protection, which is consistent with our previous findings. Knowing this helps us get closer to designing universal flu vaccines with maximal effect. These findings are not limited to influenza, by the way. They’re relevant for other serious viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, and HIV, as we’ve demonstrated in previous research. How close are we to having a universal flu vaccine available? It’s hard to estimate, but we’re definitely getting closer. Over the past several years, there has been remarkable progress. We now know more than ever before how the virus evades host immunity, what the requirements are for eliciting universal immunity against diverse influenza strains, and how our immune system responds to infection or vaccination. When you put this new knowledge together with advancing technologies and vaccine platforms, we’re really accelerating towards a universal flu vaccine. In fact, there are several candidates in clinical development and testing. In the meantime, it’s a good idea for everyone eligible for a regular flu vaccine to get one. Until then, do you think we’re equipped to handle whatever may come our way with avian flu? I’m optimistic, because after COVID, we know a lot more about how to respond to pandemics. Some governments have already been considering offering avian flu vaccines to farm workers and others with high risk of exposure to avian flu. We also have an infrastructure in place that we can rely on for developing therapeutics—and one day, we’ll have better vaccines. Explore: All latest news Jeffrey V. Ravetch Theresa and Eugene M.

Zargar June 12, 2024 / 10:29 AM EDT / CBS News What to know about human cases of bird flu What to know about the human cases of bird flu case detected so far 03:26 New Delhi — As a string of recent bird flu cases in U.S. cattle and poultry in several states draws warnings about the risks of possible widespread transmission to humans, India has had its second-ever human avian influenza infection confirmed by the World Health Organization. The U.N. health agency confirmed that a suspected case, a 4-year-old child in the eastern state of West Bengal, was infected with the H9N2 avian flu virus.India's first human avian flu case was confirmed in 2019. The cases in India involve a different bird flu virus than the one infecting animals and several people in the U.S., where it is the H5N1 strain spreading through herds.The 4-year-old Indian child was first diagnosed with hyperreactive airway disease, but he developed a fever and abdominal pain in the last week of January this year. A few days later, he developed seizures and his respiratory distress continued. The fever got worse along with the abdominal cramps, and the child was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit. The hospital diagnosed him with post-infectious bronchiolitis caused by viral pneumonia, and he later tested positive for influenza B and adenovirus, for which he underwent treatment for about a month before being discharged on February 28, the WHO said.His condition did not improve at home, however, and he was admitted to a different hospital on March 3. Nasal swabs confirmed an influenza infection, which the WHO has now confirmed as influenza-A sub-type H9N2, the avian flu. The patient was discharged from the hospital, with ongoing oxygen support, on May 1.WHO said the child had exposure to poultry at and around his home, and it warned that "further sporadic human cases could occur as this virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions."

SAM PANTHAKY/AFP/Getty The Indian government has formed teams of public health officials to monitor flu symptoms in poultry flocks and increase awareness of the disease's symptoms and prevention methods.India has witnessed several avian flu outbreaks since 2006, when the first case was detected. The WHO says humans can be infected with the virus if they come in direct — and in some cases indirect — contact with infected animals. Symptoms of human infection range from mild, flu-like symptoms and eye irritation to severe, acute respiratory disease and even death, the WHO says. Third human case of bird flu tied to dairy cattle outbreak 02:08 The U.N.'s global health agency has urged people to "minimize contact with animals" where infections are suspected, avoid contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces, and to "strictly avoid contact with sick or dead animals" and practice hand hygiene.Children, older people and pregnant and postpartum women need to be extra cautious, the WHO says.

Not Now Turn OnBird flu in the US: A full timelineSkip to main content HomeU.S.SportsEntertainmentLifeMoneyTechTravelOpinionFor SubscribersWeatherInvestigationsCrosswordsHumankindNewslettersMediaFor YouContributor Content From chickens to foxes, here's how bird flu is spreading across the USDinah Voyles Pulver USA TODAYA bird flu outbreak that has infiltrated six continents and is wreaking havoc in U.S. farms is among a group of avian influenza flu viruses first described in Italy in 1878 as a "fowl plague."This outbreak, from a strain that emerged among poultry flocks and wild birds in Europe in the fall of 2020, has been the most pervasive in the U.S. and Europe. Once the highly contagious strain – H5N1 – was identified, it quickly began spreading across Europe and into Africa, the Middle East and Asia. By October 2022, it had been declared the largest avian flu epidemic ever in Europe.As it spread around the world, it forced the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeys and has killed or sickened thousands of birds, as well as land-based mammals and marine mammals. For now, the risk to people remains low, but the longer it lingers, researchers say, the risk increases that it could evolve into a virus that has greater impact on human health.Here are some of the key events in the transmission and spread of the virus.May – July 2021Wild fox kits at a rehabilitation center in the Netherlands test positive for the virus during an outbreak in wild birds.Virus found in great skuas – a type of seabird – on Fair Isle, Scotland.November – December 2021H5N1 first detected in North America, in poultry and in a great black-backed gull in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.Four ducks harvested by hunters North and South Carolina test positive for the virus, the first bird flu infection among wild birds in the U.S. since 2016.January – February 2022An avian flu infection is reported in an 80-year-old man in England, with no symptoms who raised ducks that became sick in late December.On Feb. 9, 2022, an outbreak was reported among turkeys at a U.S. commercial poultry facility.Poultry outbreaks occurring worldwide.Sea lions dying in Peru test positive for the virusVirus detections begin occurring at other commercial poultry facilities in the U.S.April – September 2022U.S. reports first human case, possibly the result of contamination of the nasal passages rather than actual infection in a worker culling chickens on a Colorado farm.Bald eagle die-off underway in the U.S.Egg prices jump as thousands of chickens euthanized after they are infected with bird flu.Virus found in at least 88 mammals in the U.S. , including harbor seals, red foxes, skunks and a bottlenose dolphin. Similar detections occurring in Europe and Japan.Infected cormorants wash up on Martha's Vineyard beachesZoos begin moving birds indoors.Fall 2022Virus reported in more than two dozen mammals, including a black bear and Kodiak bear in Alaska, and in grizzly bears in Montana and Nebraska, and in a mountain lion.Two poultry workers in Spain diagnosed with the virus.2023Bird flu spillover into mammals continues. Several human cases reported internationally.By February, more than 50 million chickens have been affected in the U.S., in what has become one of the largest bird flu outbreaks in recorded history.Study finds bird flu killing many bald eagles.In April, wildlife officials report California condors die at alarming rate.A dog died after chewing on a wild goose in Canada.In December, the first detections are reported in both polar regions. A dead polar bear in Alaska tests positive for the virus, a first for polar bears and for the Arctic. Virus also found in elephant and fur seals in the Antarctic. March – April 2024Viral infections occur for the first time in juvenile goats on a Minnesota farm where a poultry flock tested positive.Virus found for the first time in dairy cows, at farms in Kansas and Texas. Later research suggests it was circulating since December, likely after introduction by a wild bird to a Texas cattle farm.Testing of food products ramps up.Virus found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk at two Kansas dairy farms and one in Texas.Fragments of the virus found in pasteurized milk, but aren't considered dangerous.A farm worker in Texas tests positive for the virus, with conjunctivitis but not a respiratory infection, after coming into close contact with infected cows. It's the second human case in the U.S. and the first reported cow-to-human spread of H5N1 bird flu.May 2024Michigan dairy farm worker tests positive for the virus, with conjunctivitis symptoms.Infection reported in another farm worker in the U.S., and this time the patient has respiratory symptoms, which healthcare researchers find more concerning. It's the fourth reported human case, the third by exposure to dairy cows.

So far, only farmworkers are at risk. But not protecting them better leaves the rest of us vulnerable, experts say.Karen Weintraub USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Right now people can't easily infect each other with bird fluThe CDC says there's no evidence humans can easily infect each other with bird flu, and the risk to the general public remains low right now.Scripps NewsPeople and public officials should be "alert but not alarmed" about the current bird flu outbreak, federal authorities said in a Thursday call with reporters.In two new reports, released midday Thursday, officials added details about the spread and status of the outbreak of what is formally called the "highly pathogenic avian influenza." Cattle on more than 90 farms in 12 states have been infected since late last year, as well as three people who caught the disease from cattle. These infections have been widely reported."We should take these data we should understand them in context, and we should, as we are, be alert, but not alarmed," Dr. Nirav Shah, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the call.Eleven of the impacted farms requested funding from a federal program established to encourage cooperation with public health measures among farmers, officials said.Farm workers are the only people currently considered at high risk for bird flu, which is not likely to pose a danger to the general public unless it evolves and becomes contagious from person-to-person transmission. Right now the only means of catching the virus is direct exposure to infected animals.As more animals become infected, however, the risk becomes greater that the virus could mutate and become infectious among people.To prevent that, "we should apply lessons learned from decreasing farm-to-farm transmission amongst poultry and apply them to dairy farms," Dr. Raj Panjabi, former White House Senior Director for global health security and biodefense, told USA TODAY. Slowing the outbreak of bird flu among poultry under his leadership, federal agencies instituted an approach described as "defend the flock." Now, Panjabi said, we need to "gird the herd."It is unclear precisely when or how the virus first infected U.S. cattle. The first incidence of the disease was confirmed on a Texas dairy farm on March 25, according to the federal study.Officials believe the virus was possibly carried from farm to farm on the clothing of workers, 20% of whom work on multiple dairy farms and 7% of whom work on poultry farms as well as at dairies. Other likely routes of transmission include the tires of vehicles used to transport people and equipment from farm to farm. Farms with the infection were linked, the report noted, because the cows were transported between farms and by a milk co-op that is shared by more than 90% of the affected dairies.Identifying these links should help the government and farmers minimize the spread of the disease, the report concluded.But the report is far from perfect, said Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist who directs the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. It's more of a survey than an actual study of how the virus is being transmitted ‒ and therefore, it's hard to learn anything from it, she said."There are literally no data. They do not know how this is spreading," Nuzzo said.This lack of data is not the government's fault, she was quick to add. The U.S. Department of Agriculture relies on farms to voluntarily provide information, and, without that data, everyone is in the dark."Getting access to information on farms has been challenging, but it's critical for us to understand why this is spreading... so that we can prevent it from spreading," she said. "I don't think there's any one farm that wants to have this. They want to protect themselves. Crucially, I want to protect the workers on those farms."Panjabi agrees that America won't be safe from bird flu unless farmworkers are protected.Right now, workers lack access to basic protective gear, he said and wrote in a recent opinion piece. The first worker to become infected had been wearing gloves, but not eye protection ‒ and likely got infected from touching infected hands to eyes.Farm workers are only tested for infection if they are suspected of being infected, the CDC's Shah said.Forty-five farmworkers have been tested nationwide for avian flu so far this year, Shah said, including three people who were infected. Of the first 40 tested, 35 were in Michigan, Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical officer, told the Detroit Free Press.But it's not realistic to conclude that the only people infected were those who tested positive, Nuzzo said. A positive test requires a farmworker to have access to medical care or be so ill that they have no other options. Then, a caregiver has to be aware of their patient's likely exposure, recognize the potential signs of bird flu and know to send a patient sample to the CDC, she said.There are "many points of failure," said Nuzzo who would like to see a vaccination begin with farmworkers so they can be protected and officials can prevent further spread. Officials in Finland recently decided to vaccinate farmworkers, veterinarians and scientists who work with avian influenza in that country. "I don't want farmworkers to die before we suddenly decide to vaccinate" people in the U.S., she said.Eduardo Cuevas contributed to this report.

Their lab experiments, published in March, found the two mutations appeared to raise H1N1's resistance to the flu treatment oseltamivir, commonly sold under the brand Tamiflu by drugmaker Roche. It is unclear how much the mutations could cut the real-world effectiveness of oseltamivir. The laboratory tests found the mutated viruses were up to 16 times less sensitive to the antiviral, a smaller dropoff than in some previous worrying mutations."These mutated viruses retained sensitivity to other anti-influenza medications, including a newer one, baloxavir marboxil. There are no immediate implications to change decisions for clinical care," a CDC spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The spokesperson said that flu vaccination can still offer protection against viruses with these mutations. Cases on multiple continentsDespite the "rapid spread of dual mutants to countries on different continents," the CDC's report on the new dual mutant flu strains found the mutations appear to still be rare for now. Since the mutations first showed up in a case sampled from the Canadian province of British Columbia in May 2023, a total of 101 sequences have been submitted to the global virus database GISAID from Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. These make up less than 1% of flu virus sequences during that time."However, those data may not necessarily represent the actual proportion of what was in circulation because of differences in surveillance and sequencing strategies in each country," the authors said.The two U.S. cases were detected by labs at the Connecticut Department of Health and University of Michigan this past fall and winter. "It is unknown how widely these mutated viruses will circulate in the upcoming season. It is important to continue monitoring the spread of these viruses and the evolution of these viruses," the CDC spokesperson said.The most commonly prescribed antiviralThe CDC has long been closely tracking potential mutations to the flu virus that could lead to resistance to oseltamivir. Oseltamivir ranks as the most commonly prescribed treatment for flu, the CDC says. A study published last year found the drug made up 99.8% of flu antivirals prescribed to kids.The CDC urges doctors to give flu antivirals as soon as possible to all flu patients who are hospitalized or are at risk of severe disease. Doctors have also turned to oseltamivir to treat humans infected by the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in dairy farms this year.This is not the first time that health authorities have tracked the emergence of a potential threat to the effectiveness of flu treatments.Before it was wiped off the map by a competing H1N1 strain behind the swine flu pandemic that swept the world in 2009, health authorities from Europe to Japan had reported seeing surges of a H1N1 strain that was resistant to oseltamivir in 2007 and 2008.That strain had a mutation called H275Y, which at the time were up to 1,000 times less sensitive to oseltamivir in laboratory tests.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd The test uses highly sensitive PCR technology, requiring only a single nasal-swab sample to provide rapid, accurate qualitative detection and differentiation among four of the most prevalent respiratory viruses for which differential diagnosis can drive appropriate treatment.Enables healthcare professionals to make confident clinical decisions and promptly determine appropriate treatment, with definitive results reported in just 20 minutes.Expands Roche’s extensive molecular point of care testing portfolio, offering greater flexibility to meet testing needs amid evolving regional prevalence of respiratory infections. Basel, 10 June 2024 – Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for its cobas® liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test, an automated multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on the cobas® liat system. Producing results in just 20 minutes on a compact analyser suitable for most healthcare settings, the test uses either a single nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal-swab sample to confirm or rule out infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “Diagnostics play a critical role in the fight against respiratory illness,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “We are proud to provide this innovative test to address the significant burden placed on healthcare systems. Now, healthcare professionals will be able to detect and differentiate these respiratory viruses within a single patient visit, enabling improved public health outcomes.” Introducing rapid multiplex PCR diagnostic tests into near-patient care environments such as emergency departments, urgent care facilities, and physician office labs has the potential to provide swift and precise results, expediting clinical decision-making processes. This approach can help reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage, facilitate targeted treatment strategies, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes and healthcare system efficiency.1-6 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), respiratory diseases in the United States reached high levels during the most recent autumn and winter seasons, with SARS-CoV-2 causing the most emergency department visits.7 Hospitalisations due to respiratory illness place a strain on hospitals and can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment for patients.8 In the 2023-2024 respiratory season, infants, children, and adults ages 65 and older were observed to have the highest rates of emergency department visits and hospitalisations caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV.9,10 Nationwide, the percentage of recent total deaths due to these respiratory viruses was highest among patients 65 and older.11 The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test authorised for emergency use further expands and complements Roche’s broad portfolio of single and multiplex tests intended to help diagnose and address the needs of patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory illness, including the following assays: cobas® SARS-CoV-2, cobas® Strep A, cobas® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B, and cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV for use on the cobas liat system. In 2025, Roche intends to seek FDA 510(k) clearance and a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) waiver in the United States for the new test, with plans for commercial launch in other markets worldwide following CE-IVDR approval. About the cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test12The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is an automated rapid multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in anterior nasal (nasal) swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection consistent with COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV can be similar. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet requirements to perform high, moderate or waived complexity tests. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is authorised for use at the Point of Care (POC), i.e., in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation. Results are for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA in clinical specimens and are not intended to detect influenza C virus. SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV RNA are generally detectable in nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the test. The agent detected may not be the definitive cause of disease. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and/or epidemiological information. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is intended for use by trained operators specifically instructed in the use of the cobas liat system and the cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization. About the cobas liat systemThe cobas liat system combines the cobas liat analyser – an automated nucleic acid test instrument – with cobas liat assay tubes to fully automate the testing process, simplify workflows, and enable healthcare professionals to perform molecular testing in a variety of near-patient settings with speed, reliability, and minimal training. The system performs reagent preparation, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid amplification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, real-time detection, and result interpretation to automate the detection and quantification of nucleic acid targets in a biological sample in a single closed tube. Definitive results are generated in 20 minutes or less to aid in patient care decisions. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV Assay complements existing tests for SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B, Influenza A/B & RSV, Strep A, and Cdiff. Assays for other infectious diseases are currently in development. More information is available at diagnostics.roche.com. The cobas liat system is commercially available in select markets.

Share this item with your network: By Veronica Salib, Associate Editor Published: 11 Jun 2024 Results from a Phase 3 clinical trial on a combinatory COVID-19 and influenza vaccine reveal that a combined vaccine approach may elicit a better immune response than individual vaccinations in older adults. Moderna conducted the randomized, observer-blind, active control study on the mRNA-1083 vaccine, which is a combined mRNA COVID and influenza vaccine. The researchers compared the combined vaccine's safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity with co-administered Fluzone HD and Spikevax. They also looked at two age cohorts: adults between 50 and 64 and adults over 65. According to the Moderna press release, the mRNA-1083 vaccine offered a better immune response to multiple influenza virus strains, including H1N1, H3N2, and B/Victoria, across both age brackets. For example, the geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of the 65 and older mRNA-1083 group compared to those in the same age bracket who received the Fluzone HD were 1.155 for H1N1, 1.063 for H3N2, and 1.118 for influenza B/Victoria. Furthermore, for the 50 to 64 age bracket, the GMRs were 1.414, 1.380, and 1.216, respectively. Beyond influenza, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron XBB.1.5 in the mRNA-1083 group compared to those who received Spikevax. More specifically, the GMR for the 65 and older group was 1.641, while it was 1.308 for the 50 to 64 age group. "Combination vaccines have the potential to reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses," said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, in the press release. "Moderna is the only company with a positive Phase 3 flu and COVID combination vaccine. Building on the momentum of positive Phase 3 data across our respiratory portfolio, we continue to address significant unmet medical needs and advance public health." This study supports the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. Although the studies need to be confirmed, if this vaccine is approved, it could offer protection against both viruses with positive public health implications.

Washington State University will get $1.5 million to study respiratory diseases in livestock, like bird flu, in the Pacific Northwest and their potential spread to humans. Since 2021, the newest avian influenza strain –- H5N1 – has infected poultry across the world, but its spread to wild birds, other mammals and now dairy cows worries experts about the potential impacts on humans. So far, three farmworkers have been diagnosed with bird flu associated with a U.S. outbreak in cows, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the public remains low. The university’s Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory will focus their research on small- and medium-sized hosts, like cows, goats and sheep, according to a press release. The project is being funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Washington Department of Health. “These are species that have the potential to spread diseases to humans,” said Dr. Thomas Waltzek, a virologist at WADDL in the College of Veterinary Medicine who is leading the new project. “It’s all about detecting these diseases quickly, determining if the viruses have pandemic potential and immediately taking corrective actions to hopefully prevent a pandemic.” Although the lab has been tracking H5N1 in domestic and wild birds, its jump to dairy was “unexpected,” according to the university release. The spread into dairy cattle has affected more than 80 herds across the country after being first identified in Texas in March. Last week, Iowa became the 10th state with a confirmed infection. Cows can usually recover within two weeks, but the disease can negatively affect milk production. WSU’s project will expand work that the lab is already doing as part of the Pathogen Genomics Centers of Excellence, a national network of labs whose focus is to quickly detect viruses that could have pandemic potential. The lab has also recently partnered with veterinarians and biologists who recently documented the bird flu spread from seabirds to harbor seals near Fort Flagler State Park in the northern portion of Puget Sound. The outbreak had killed more than 1,700 wildbirds and infected a small number of harbor seals in the same area. Dr. Kevin Snekvik, Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory executive director, said in a statement that the number of wild birds dying from this disease is “staggering” and expressed concern of its spread to other mammals like raccoons, skunks and seals. “Luckily, it is not highly pathogenic for humans,” he said. “We hope a mutation doesn’t occur that leads to something like that, but we need to be closely monitoring the situation.” XWSU receives grant to study bird flu, other diseases in livestock by Laurel Demkovich, Washington State Standard June 10, 2024 WSU receives grant to study bird flu, other diseases in livestock by Laurel Demkovich, Washington State Standard June 10, 2024 Washington State University will get $1.5 million to study respiratory diseases in livestock, like bird flu, in the Pacific Northwest and their potential spread to humans.

Will other states follow its lead? By Megan Molteni June 12, 2024 Reprints Corey Seeman/Flickr For weeks now, as the H5N1 bird flu has been spreading into dairy cattle herds in more and more places, one state continues to lead the pack. With reports of infections in 25 herds, Michigan currently accounts for about one-third of the country’s confirmed cases in livestock. And of the three people known to have contracted the H5N1 virus from sick cows since the outbreak began, two of them are farmworkers in Michigan, including one who experienced respiratory symptoms. This has led many scientists and public health officials following the situation to wonder among themselves: What exactly is going on in Michigan? But not for the reason you might think. Of the half-dozen experts STAT spoke to for this story, none believed that the virus was acting differently there, or that state policies were throwing open the door to uncontrolled spread. On the contrary, the reason Michigan has become such an apparent hotspot is because its public health response has been uniquely robust.advertisement “We’ve tested more individuals in Michigan than any other state, to my knowledge,” Natasha Bagdasarian, the state’s chief medical executive told STAT in an interview. Bagdasarian, who was an infectious disease doctor who oversaw outbreak response in hospitals before she took up her role as Michigan’s chief medical executive, said that experience informed her current approach to the H5N1 situation. “One of our mantras is if you don’t test for it you don’t find it,” she said. “And that’s exactly what happens in a situation like this. If you don’t test for it you won’t find it.” It’s an approach other states haven’t embraced as vigorously, and one pandemic preparedness experts hope those states learn from. Related: These are the bird flu questions that influenza and animal scientists desperately want answered Besides Michigan, 11 other states also have dairy herds with known infections, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, with Idaho and Texas also reporting double-digit outbreaks. Public health authorities and scientists believe H5N1 is more widespread than those numbers would suggest, but efforts to clearly map the scale of the problem have been stymied by a lack of cooperation from dairy farmers. Outside of moving animals across state lines, testing of herds is voluntary, as is testing of anyone who’s been in close contact with infected or potentially infected animals.advertisement Since H5N1 was first detected in Michigan dairy herds at the end of March, the state has tested 54 people as part of its efforts to monitor the health of farmworkers who’ve been exposed to infected animals. Samples from 17 of those individuals were sent on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for further testing, making up more than one-third of all the tests the agency has run related to dairy herd outbreaks, according to data the CDC posted Friday. In Idaho, which has seen a rise in dairy herd outbreaks in the last week, five people with possible exposure have been tested, and H5N1 was not detected, AJ McWhorter, a public information officer for the state’s Department of Health and Welfare, told STAT Tuesday. In Texas — where the first human case of H5N1 contracted from a dairy cow was confirmed — roughly 20 dairy workers with flu-like symptoms have volunteered to be tested, according to health officials there. No one else has tested positive. “We’ve tried working with dairy industry groups in Texas but dairies are concerned about biosecurity and have not allowed public health on to the farms,” Lara Anton, a press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services told STAT via email. Most of the department’s outreach has gone through cattle veterinarians instead, she said. In fact, it was a veterinarian working with several Texas Panhandle dairies who brought the dairy worker who tested positive to the department’s attention. “Michigan is looking more closely than a lot of other states,” said Lauren Sauer, who directs pandemic preparedness research at the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “They’re doing more surveillance in humans and animals so they’re finding more cases in humans and in animals. That tells me that we’re only finding things where we’re looking, and that’s not where we want to be.” Related: Finland to offer bird flu vaccine to select groups of people, a possible global first Pandemic playbook authors like Sauer have long been preparing for almost exactly this scenario — an H5N1 bird flu strain makes its way into a population of animals that have a lot of contact with humans and then some of those humans get sick. Without broad testing to provide adequate visibility into that human-animal interface, we risk missing the next step in a pathogen’s path to pandemic potential: evolving to more easily transmit between people. What the playbooks didn’t account for though, is that the human-animal interface could be a milking parlor. Up until this year, instances of influenza in adult dairy cows were rare, which is one reason the outbreak went undetected for months before H5N1 was identified as the culprit. Poultry and pork operations, in contrast, have been dealing with the risks of avian influenza for a long time, and have established regulations and surveillance systems in place to quickly curb further viral spread. “The dairy industry has never had to deal with anything like this before,” said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and a former dairy cattle veterinarian. “And I think we’ve learned that voluntary testing isn’t going to work. It’s not working now. Other than a few people here and there, it’s not being taken up.” Sauer’s group is hoping to learn more about how Michigan’s state and local authorities made inroads into the dairy industry, which in many other parts of the country has been slow to accept personal protective equipment and resisted testing of animals and farmworkers. “It’s clear to me that whatever they’re doing is working. If we can get a better sense of what they’re doing to create this openness, that will be good for all the states.” Three years ago, Kim Dodd packed up her office at the U.S. government’s most secure laboratory for research on potentially deadly agricultural illnesses and headed to Michigan, to direct the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. At the federal lab, she had overseen the development of diagnostics and other countermeasures against pathogens common overseas but not often seen in the U.S. “I had a chance to get an understanding of a lot of different state dynamics,” she told STAT in an interview. “And Michigan, in my experience, is truly unique.” Related: In light of H5N1 outbreak, U.S. in talks with mRNA vaccine makers on bird flu Dodd arrived to find a state government with highly collaborative relationships between animal health, human health, and environmental agencies honed over decades of dealing with overlapping threats, including chronic wasting disease, bovine tuberculosis, and cancer-causing chemicals that got into Michigan’s food supply in the 1970s through contaminated animal feed. Leaders from these agencies meet monthly to discuss any emerging pathogens and regularly drill pandemic preparedness exercises. When H5N1 began reappearing in the state’s poultry flocks in March and April, Dodd expanded the number of laboratory staff who were certified to run tests for the bird flu and switched the lab over to testing seven days a week. The idea was to build enough bandwidth to deal with surges, even during times of the year when staff tend to be out sick. She had no idea that capacity would be called upon almost immediately, as the virus began infecting the state’s dairy cows. But it proved to be a critical piece of the state’s emergency response. As Dodd’s veterinary diagnostic lab detected more positive cases, from both dairy farms and poultry operations, it sent those samples to a national USDA lab for genomic sequencing. Analyses of those sequences revealed that at least some of the new infections detected in Michigan’s poultry farms had been seeded by outbreaks at nearby dairies. Since cows don’t often walk off of their farm and into a poultry barn, the virus had to be traveling some other way. Vehicles and people moving between farms seemed a much more likely culprit. That was a big reason why on May 1, Tim Boring, director of the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, declared an “extraordinary animal health emergency,” signing an order requiring Michigan dairy farmers to ramp up biosecurity on farms. The move was and remains an unusually stringent one. “Michigan was a little different because they immediately required enhanced biosecurity measures,” Poulsen said. “But they have always been a little bit more proactive because of their experience with other diseases.” Related: Wastewater testing specifically for bird flu virus will scale up nationally in coming weeks Poulsen and others noted that the state has also stood out in the way it has reported cases to the public. While the USDA has reported dairy herd outbreaks of H5N1 only at the state level, and most other states have followed that lead, Michigan reports the counties in which any new infections have been detected. The state agriculture agency set up an email alert system so people can sign up to receive notifications of any new outbreaks. “It offers a level of specificity of where this virus is being detected around the state that I think is really helpful to heighten the awareness that this is happening in specific communities,” said Boring. “And it walks this line of making sure we’re not divulging individual farm information.” That’s important because the laws that govern animal health in Michigan contain a confidentiality provision that prevents releasing the identity of the owner of a sick animal and any information gathered in connection with investigating the illness. People in the state agriculture department jokingly refer to it as “Animal HIPAA.” “It’s an outlier and a rarity,” said Brook Duer, a staff attorney at Penn State’s Center for Agricultural and Shale Law. More common is for state regulatory agencies that oversee animal health to have broad authority to use information gathered in disease investigations in whatever way best protects public health, Duer said. But that might actually make farmers less willing to cooperate, because they can’t be sure how the information they provide will be used.

Privacy Policy “One of the challenges with this outbreak is that procedures for testing and how to report data are being left up to individual states to figure out,” said Andrew Pekosz, an influenza researcher and director of the Center for Emerging Viruses and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University. “Each state has different regulations for how they can collect and share data, which means it can be difficult to compare one state’s response to another. But Michigan has found a very efficient way to not only engage dairy farmers in the testing process but also been fairly open in terms of sharing those results with the general public.” That transparency extends to efforts the state is making to find infections in people. Local public health officials in affected counties have been following up with farmworkers via phone calls and text messages to actively monitor for flu-like symptoms as well as conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and offer free testing if symptoms start to show up. In other states, dairy workers have been advised to monitor themselves and contact their health care providers and local public health districts if they become ill. “Michigan has really been ahead of this in terms of our communication,” Bagdasarian said. “The goals for this amount of transparency are two-fold. Number one, we believe the public deserves to know. Transparency is the first step to continuing to have public trust and continuing to have people work with us. The second part is we’re hoping that other states will follow our lead. Because without having a good understanding of impact — numbers of cases and transmission dynamics — we won’t be able to fully mitigate this.” About the Author Reprints Megan Molteni Science Writer Megan Molteni reports on discoveries from the frontiers of genomic medicine, neuroscience, and reproductive tech.

In a typical year, a large part of the Swedish population is affected by influenza when the virus arrives in Sweden during the winter months. But Sweden can do more to reach the optimal vaccination coverage rate of 75 per cent in the risk groups. This report is based on data from the Swedish Public Health Agency, and it clearly shows that there are large regional differences in the level of vaccination coverage achieved. Common to all regions except one is that the vaccination coverage rate decreased from the 2021-2022 season to the 2022-2023 season. The report includes good examples from regions that have succeeded well, such as Region VÃ¤rmland and Region VÃ¤stmanland. With this report, we want to highlight that seasonal influenza is a recurring and serious viral disease that is associated with high costs for the healthcare system and for society as a whole - but it can be prevented. For example, by setting regional targets for seasonal flu vaccination and increasing regional responsibility with a strong focus on promotional activities targeting all people in risk groups.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an update on the H5N2 bird flu strain following the death of a man in Mexico. It is the first globally reported human case of infection with an influenza A(H5N2) virus and the first avian H5 virus infection in a person reported in the country."CDC is in communication with Mexico health authorities about the human case of H5N2," a CDC spokesperson told Newsweek. "Notably, the human infection reported by Mexico is a different variant of the avian influenza virus currently circulating in the United States."Read more: What Is a Health Savings Account?This distinction is important as it indicates that the H5N2 strain found in Mexico may have different characteristics and potential risks compared with the H5N1 strain in the U.S., where three human cases have been detected in recent months. These cases are linked to an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in dairy cows, and none have been fatal. A stock photo shows a test tube with a bird flu strain.

SyhinStas/Getty "The risk to members of the general public who do not have exposure to infected animals remains low," the CDC spokesperson said. "Our surveillance system is equipped to detect H5 activity in people in the United States, and we are monitoring the situation."The World Health Organization (WHO) said the deceased individual in Mexico had close contact with poultry, which is the primary source of transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans. The Mexican health authorities are conducting investigations to determine the source of the infection and to monitor potential further spread.Read more: Find the Right Tax-Advantaged Health Savings AccountsThe CDC has emphasized that the genetic sequence of the virus detected in Mexico will be shared or deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, or GISAID, a global science initiative that provides open access to genomic data regarding influenza viruses and the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. This transparency is crucial for global health monitoring and response efforts.In the U.S., public health authorities have indicated that the patients in the three detected cases of H5N1 avian influenza have either recovered or are in the process of recovery. The CDC's surveillance system continues to look for any new cases to ensure timely response and containment.Bird flu, or avian influenza, primarily affects birds but can occasionally infect humans, particularly those who have close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. Human infections with avian influenza viruses can range from mild to severe, and in some cases they can be fatal. The CDC and WHO stress the importance of preventive measures, including avoiding contact with sick or dead birds and maintaining good hygiene practices when handling poultry.The recent fatality in Mexico has raised concerns about the potential for new variants of avian influenza viruses to emerge and spread. However, health officials say the risk to the general public remains low as long as appropriate measures are taken to prevent transmission from birds to humans.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Earlier this week, Moderna announced positive results for its phase 3 clinical trial of a combined vaccine against COVID and influenza. So what exactly did the trial find? And what sort of impact would a two-in-one COVID and flu vaccine have on public health? Let’s take a look. Combination vaccines are already used for other diseases Combination vaccines have been successfully used for several decades in Australia and around the world. For example, the DTP vaccine, a shot that combines protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough), was first administered in 1948. The DTP vaccine has since been further combined to offer protection against other diseases. A hexavalent vaccine, which protects against six diseases – diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (an infection that can cause brain swelling) – is today part of routine childhood immunisation programs in Australia and elsewhere. Another important combination vaccine is the MMR vaccine, given to children to protect against measles, mumps and rubella. So what did the trial find? Moderna’s phase 3 trial included roughly 8,000 participants across two age groups. Half were adults aged 50 to 64. The other half were aged 65 and up. In both age groups, participants were randomised to either receive the combined vaccine (called mRNA-1083) or a control. The control groups received a COVID vaccine and a suitable flu vaccine delivered separately. The control group in the 50-to-64 age category were given the Fluarix flu vaccine, as well as Moderna’s mRNA COVID vaccine, Spikevax. The over-65 control group received Spikevax alongside Fluzone HD, an enhanced flu vaccine designed specifically for older adults. Participants in the control groups received Moderna’s COVID vaccine and a separate flu shot. Numstocker/Shutterstock The study evaluated safety, including any reactions after vaccination, and the protective immune response the vaccines produced. Moderna reported the combined vaccine elicited a higher immune response in both age groups against COVID and three influenza strains, compared to the co-administered shots. From a safety perspective, the combined vaccine was well tolerated. Adverse reactions were similar across the experimental and control groups. The most common side effects included muscle aches, fatigue and pain at the injection site. While the trial results are promising, they are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, which means independent experts haven’t yet verified them. And further research may be required to test how the combined vaccine works in younger age groups. What are the advantages of combined vaccines? We cannot overstate the importance of vaccines. Each year they prevent up to 5 million deaths around the world from a range of life-threatening infections. At the same time, we can always do more to boost vaccination uptake, especially in areas with fewer resources and among vulnerable populations. Combination vaccines have a variety of advantages. For example, the need for fewer injections reduces costs for health systems, decreases storage requirements and reduces the burden on parents. All of these things can be especially valuable in low-income countries. Notably, research shows combination vaccines make it more likely people will take up routine vaccinations. Many combination vaccines are already in use. Jacob Lund/Shutterstock Two important diseases Every year, particularly during the winter months, millions of people contract respiratory infections. Indeed, parts of Australia are reported to be facing rapid increases in flu cases at the moment. According to the World Health Organization, globally, roughly 3 million to 5 million people experience severe influenza annually, and around 650,000 people will die from the disease. COVID has resulted in more than 7 million deaths around the world to date. As the COVID pandemic has continued, we’ve seen pandemic fatigue setting in, as some people appear to have become complacent about their COVID shots. A 2023 study in Australia found 30% of the surveyed population were hesitant about and 9% were resistant to taking COVID boosters. Uptake of the flu vaccine, which many people are in the habit of getting annually, may be higher. That said, in Australia the current flu vaccine rates for 2024 are still fairly low: 53% for adults over 65 years, 26% for those aged 50 to 65, and lower for younger age groups. A two-in-one COVID and flu vaccine could be an important public health tool to increase vaccine coverage against these two important diseases. Beyond protecting individuals’ health, this would have flow-on benefits for the economy and our health system. Moderna said it will present its trial data at an upcoming medical conference and submit it for publication. The company has also said it will soon apply for regulatory approval, with the possibility of supplying the combined vaccine in 2025. At the same time, Pfizer and BioNTech also have late-stage trials in progress for a combined COVID and flu vaccine. We will await further developments with interest.

Moderna on Monday unveiled Phase III data for its investigational combination vaccine mRNA-1083, which demonstrated a superior immune response against COVID-19 and influenza compared to licensed vaccines. In patients aged 65 years and older, mRNA-1083 triggered significantly higher immune responses than two co-administered licensed vaccines, which are routinely recommended—Fluzone HD, an enhanced flu vaccine, and Moderna’s COVID-19 shot Spikevax. The investigational vaccine induced a stronger response against SARS-CoV-2 and the H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria influenza strains. Moderna’s experimental combo shot also elicited significantly better immune responses against these viruses in adults aged 50 through 64. In this younger age group, mRNA-1083 was compared with the co-administration of Spikevax and the standard-dose flu vaccine Fluarix. The late-stage study found mRNA-1083 to be non-inferior to licensed comparators in both age groups against the B/Yamagata influenza strain, which has increasingly disappeared from circulation, according to Moderna. In terms of safety, most of the adverse events associated with mRNA-1083 were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most common side effects included headaches, fatigue and injection site pain. “Combination vaccines have the potential to reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. With Monday’s readout, Moderna has become “the only company with a positive Phase III flu and COVID combination vaccine,” Bancel said. The pharma will present complete Phase III data and analyses at an upcoming medical congress and will work with regulators to determine the next steps for mRNA-1083. MRNA-1083 combines two of Moderna’s investigational mRNA vaccines. The first is the flu vaccine candidate mRNA-1010, which encodes for the hemagglutinin glycoproteins of the H1N1, H3N2, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata influenza strains. In February 2023, Moderna posted interim Phase III data for mRNA-1010, which was able to elicit better seroconversion rates for the H3N2 and H1N1 strains. However, the investigational shot did not meet its non-inferiority bar for seroconversion for the B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-lineage strains. The second component of mRNA-1083 is mRNA-1283, a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In March 2024, Moderna announced that mRNA-1283 met its primary endpoint in a Phase III trial, eliciting a stronger immune response against SARS-CoV-2 compared with the pharma’s licensed COVID-19 vaccine. This advantage was consistent for both the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and wildtype strains and was pronounced in older adults over 65 years of age.Tristan Manalac is an independent science writer based in Metro Manila, Philippines.

Moderna's COVID-19 and flu vaccine reports favorable resultsKen Alltucker USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption US government to fund Moderna’s mRNA bird flu vaccine trialThe United States government is collaborating with Moderna to fund a human vaccine trial for bird flu (H5N1).Straight Arrow NewsModerna said Monday that its combination vaccine against flu and COVID-19 drew a greater immune response in late-stage study results than two comparable vaccines on the market.The company's investigational vaccine, mRNA-1083, combines a vaccine candidate for seasonal influenza and an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Both vaccines have been independently tested and yielded positive results in late-stage clinical trials, according to Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.The randomized study evaluated the safety, reactions and immune response in people who had received the two-in-one combination vaccine, testing it in two groups of about 4,000 adults each.The combination vaccine elicited greater immune response than existing vaccines designed to protect against COVID-19 and three strains of flu: H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria, Moderna said in a news release.Moderna expects to present the Phase 3 study data at an upcoming medical conference and plans to submit the information to a peer-reviewed medical journal.The adverse reactions to the combination vaccine were mostly minor and included complaints such as pain at the injection site, fatigue, muscle discomfort and headaches. The company said it would work with regulators about the next steps for the combination vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration has granted a fast-track designation. Moderna has not said when the combination vaccine might be evaluated by the FDA.Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Novavax are studying combination vaccines to protect against COVID-19 and influenza.Moderna: Combination vaccine elicited 'higher immune responses'After giving the vaccine to a group of adults 65 and older, the Moderna study compared reactions to the combination vaccine to those of the FDA-approved high-dose vaccine Fluzone and Moderna's existing COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax. The second group of adults who received the vaccine were 50 to 64. They received either the combination vaccine or were co-administered the on-the-market flu vaccine, Fluarix and Spikevax.When compared with the existing vaccines in both age groups, Moderna's combination "elicited statistically (significant) higher immune responses" to the three flu strains and COVID-19, Moderna said.Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a statement that combination vaccines can "reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses."Moderna said the combination vaccine also showed a sufficient immune response to the B/Yamagata strain of influenza; that strain, however, is no longer circulating, and the World Health Organization has recommended the trivalent flu vaccines for the 2024-2025 flu season be made without protection against that strain.Last month, the FDA approved Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, the second approved product for the COVID-19 vaccine maker. The RSV shot is the first messenger-RNA-based vaccine not for COVID-19 to be approved in the United States. It will be sold under the brand name mRESVIA for adults 60 or older.Moderna has sought to expand its portfolio of vaccines beyond Spikevax, its only marketed product. Moderna and Merck also are jointly developing a cancer vaccine.

Photo: NBC Montana.TOPICS:Avian influenzaMontanaBirdsVirusRamseyPoultryOutbreaksBiosecurity measuresBOZEMAN, Mont. — H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in wild as well as domesticated birds in most of the country, including in Montana.The virus was first found in wild birds in 2022, with widespread infection detected across the state of Montana, according to Jennifer Ramsey, a wildlife veterinarian with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.“We had a lot of wild bird mortality in the first year,” said Ramsey. “Lots of birds dying, lots of people calling or reporting sick birds or dead birds.”Ramsey said since the initial detection of the virus the number of wild bird deaths has declined. But that doesn’t mean the virus is no longer a threat.“That’s good news for the wild birds. The issue, though, is there is still a risk factor out there for poultry,” said Ramsey. “This virus is highly fatal and infectious to poultry in particular.”Nationwide, over 1,100 outbreaks of avian influenza have been reported in backyard and commercial poultry flocks across the country in every state except Louisiana and Hawaii.In Montana, outbreaks have been reported in 17 of the state’s 56 counties, including Flathead, Missoula, Park and Gallatin.“If our birds got sick, that would be devastating,” said Stephanie Schlichtmann, a Belgrade poultry farmer.Schlichtmann and her family run Pheasant Lane Coop, where they raise multiple breeds of chickens and turkeys.She has been following the avian influenza situation in the state and says right now she isn’t concerned, as they already employ strict biosecurity measures on their farm, while still letting the birds have space to roam free and forage.But Schlichtmann says if they start to see an uptick in outbreaks among nearby family farms, or if guidance from agencies like FWP and the USDA changes, they’re prepared to step things up a notch.“The birds are allowed to access pasture areas, so they can free-range and stuff. It makes for happier, healthier birds,” said Schlichtmann. “If the avian influenza outbreak were to get worse, we would probably take those precautions and keep them in just the covered runs so that they didn't have any outside access to other birds."Ramsey said right now, good biosecurity measures and the prevention of exposure to wild birds are key both for farmers raising poultry as well as for people with backyard flocks.She also said the virus is something that people should be aware of, as cases of avian influenza have recently been detected beyond birds, with outbreaks reported in 83 herds of dairy cows in nine states including Idaho and South Dakota, according to the USDA.And per the CDC, there have been three cases reported in humans following exposure to infected cattle in Michigan and Texas and one case reported in a human following exposure to infected poultry in Colorado since April of this year.“That’s an unusual thing; this is the first time we’ve seen transmission from a mammal to a human,” said Ramsey. “So that’s got people paying attention.”Public health risk for the general population remains low at this time, according to the CDC, but people should avoid exposure to sick or dead animals without proper personal protective equipment, as well as the consumption of uncooked or undercooked animal products, including raw milk and cheese.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsKECI-KCFWKECIKECIKCFWKCFWKTVMKTVMKTVMKDBZKDBZKDBZPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...WHO acknowledges bird flu patient in Mexico died of other medical conditions - ABC News ABC NewsVideoLiveShowsElections538ShopStream onLive resultsUpdated: Nov. 12, 12:07 AM ETNational Election Results: presidential Projection: Trump is President-elect226312226312Harris71,781,346270 to winTrump74,987,170Expected vote reporting: 95%Recent ProjectionsAriz.

It was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of the H5N2 strain reported globally and the first-ever reported case in Mexico.This strain is different than the bird flu strain that is currently circulating in livestock in the United States. Three dairy workers have been infected in the U.S., all of whom have recovered.MORE: CDC preparing for 'possibility of increased risk to human health' from bird fluFollowing the first release, Mexican Health Secretary Jorge Alcocer Varela pushed back on the WHO's statement, saying the man died from a separate condition and not bird flu, although the WHO said the patient only tested positive for bird flu, not that he had died of bird flu.In the latest update, the WHO said health officials in Mexico had concluded the man died because of his co-morbidities.This photo shows a logo of the World Health Organization with the WHO headquarters in the background in Geneva, Switzerland, May 21, 2023.Lian Yi/Xinhua via Getty Images"A national multidisciplinary group of experts was formed to investigate the cause of death. It included infectious disease specialists, pneumonologists, microbiologists and intensive care professionals," the WHO wrote. "Upon review of the patient's clinical history and records, the national multidisciplinary team concluded on 6 June that, although the patient had a laboratory-confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus, he died due to complications of his co-morbidities."Additionally, the WHO said national authorities performed a genetic analysis on the strain and found it had a 99% similarity with the strain seen in birds this year in the Texcoco State of Mexico.The Mexico patient had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, according to the WHO. Mexico has been dealing with an outbreak of the virus in poultry.On April 17, the patient developed fever, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath and general malaise. He was hospitalized on April 24 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City and died the same day.The patient's relatives said he had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons prior to contracting bird flu, the WHO said.MORE: What to know about the bird flu outbreak in the US after virus fragments found in milk samplesMexican authorities reported the human case to the WHO on May 23.No further cases have been documented during health officials' investigation, according to the WHO. All the people the patient was in contact with at his home and in the hospital have tested negative for influenza viruses.In the U.S., an outbreak of the H5N1 strain has been found to sicken millions of birds as well as older dairy cows. So far, three farmworkers have been sickened in the U.S., one in Texas and two in Michigan.All three had mild symptoms and have recovered. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Related TopicsBird FluPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsWisconsin officials order influenza tests on dairy cows before fairs Skip to contentSmall Towns3 Brilliant MinutesWisconsin Adventures2 Your HealthAsk The ExpertAllergyTrackNewsWatch LiveWeather2025 NFL DraftSportsSafety DeskConsumer First AlertFirst Alert TrafficHomepageWBAY HistoryNewsAction 2 News This Morning LIVESTREAMCommunityCrimeHealthHigh SchoolInternationalNationalPoliticsSmall TownsStateVideosLive NewscastsBreaking News VideoWeatherWeather AlertsClosingsFirstAlert Weather 24/7Pinpoint Digital DopplerMap RoomSkyCam NetworkAllergyTrackSevere Weather SafetyGet Our Weather AppGet a Weather Radio2025 NFL DraftSportsScoreboardPackersOperation FootballNationalFirst Alert TrafficContact Us2 Your HealthAsk The ExpertBirthday ClubCircle CountryCommunity CalendarConsumer First AlertFeatured LinksGas TrackerGray DC BureauInvestigateTVWatching Your WalletInvestigationLotteryMeet the TeamPowerNationRecallsSafety DeskSubmit a TipSubmit Photos and VideosSnow & Ski ReportNEXTGEN TVWBAY JobsZeam - News StreamsWBAY MarketingWhat's on TVDigital MarketingWisconsin officials order influenza tests on dairy cows before fairsCow(Pixabay via MGN)By WBAY news staffPublished: Jun. 11, 2024 at 5:02 PM CDT|Updated: Jun. 11, 2024 at 5:16 PM CDTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInMADISON, Wis. (WBAY) - Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection officials are requiring new tests for dairy cows to prevent the spread of bird flu.Starting June 19 all milking dairy cows must be tested for Influenza A, before being moved to fairs or exhibitions. This comes after the H5N1 pathogen has been detected in 12 states, including Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota.In order to move cattle to such events, producers must receive a negative test for Influenza A at an approved National Animal Health Laboratory Network Lab, with samples collected no more than seven days prior to the event.The tests are available at no cost through the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Officials say the order will remain in place until 60 days after the last detection of the pathogen in cattle herds in the U.S.To report herds with unexplained symptoms, veterinarians should contact DATCP at (608) 224-4872 (business hours) or (800) 943-0003 (after hours and weekends).

The first was reported June 5 in O’Brien County, which neighbors Sioux County in northwest Iowa.Dairy cows infected with bird flu, also called H5N1, typically recover with supportive care. Cows usually lose their appetite and experience a decrease in milk production, among other symptoms.The virus, however, is fatal to birds, and state and federal officials require all poultry in infected flocks to be killed to prevent its spread. The disease is believed to be carried by migrating wild birds that often don’t appear sick.Iowa has had two bird flu outbreaks so far this year — one hitting 4.2 million hens in Sioux County in May, the other 103,000 turkeys in Cherokee County this month. Since 2022, Iowa, the nation's leading egg producer, has destroyed 23.3 million chickens, turkeys and other poultry to control the disease.The virus has spread to cattle in 11 states, in addition to Iowa. And three U.S. dairy workers who were in contact with infected cows have been diagnosed with mild cases of bird flu. Mexico last week reported the first human bird flu death in the current wave of infections, according to the World Health Organization.More: Would vaccines stop bird flu, now jumping from poultry to dairy cows? It's complicated.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current public health risk is low, but the agency is "watching the situation carefully and working with states to monitor people with animal exposures."Federal officials also say the U.S. food supply is safe. Only milk from healthy animals is allowed in the food chain and most milk is pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria and viruses.Federal officials warned Friday, though, that Iowans shouldn't drink raw milk since it may be a "route of consumer exposure" to the virus. Iowa is one of about 30 states that allow raw milk sales.Also on Friday, Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said the agency has requested federal aid for affected Iowa poultry and dairy farms and assistance in disease research and response. The measures include compensation for dairy cattle culled because of the disease and for loss of dairy production, and updated indemnity tables for poultry that "better reflect the fair market value of the impacted birds and/or eggs."In addition to other measures, the agriculture department said it would test dairy operations near infected poultry flocks for H5N1.Donnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

Scientists are trying to find out Science Jun 14, 2024 4:50 PM EST NEW YORK (AP) — In the last two years, bird flu has been blamed for the deaths of millions of wild and domestic birds worldwide. It’s killed legions of seals and sea lions, wiped out mink farms, and dispatched cats, dogs, skunks, foxes and even a polar bear. But it seems to have hardly touched people. That’s “a little bit of a head scratcher,” although there are some likely explanations, said Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. It could have to do with how infection occurs or because species have differences in the microscopic docking points that flu viruses need to take root and multiply in cells, experts say. But what keeps scientists awake at night is whether that situation will change. WATCH: Why scientists are concerned about the latest transmission of bird flu to cows “There’s a lot we don’t understand,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director who currently heads Resolve to Save Lives, a not-for-profit that works to prevent epidemics. “I think we have to get over the ‘hope for the best and bury our head in the sand’ approach. Because it could be really bad.” Some researchers theorize that flu viruses that originated in birds were the precursors to terrible scourges in humans, including pandemics in 1918 and 1957. Those viruses became deadly human contagions and spread in animals and people. A number of experts think it’s unlikely this virus will become a deadly global contagion, based on current evidence. But that’s not a sure bet. Just in case, U.S. health officials are readying vaccines and making other preparations. But they are holding off on bolder steps because the virus isn’t causing severe disease in people and they have no strong evidence it’s spreading from person to person. The flu that’s currently spreading — known as H5N1 — was first identified in birds in 1959. It didn’t really begin to worry health officials until a Hong Kong outbreak in 1997 that involved severe human illnesses and deaths. It has caused hundreds of deaths around the world, the vast majority of them involving direct contact between people and infected birds. When there was apparent spread between people, it involved very close and extended contact within households. Like other viruses, however, the H5N1 virus has mutated over time. In the last few years, one particular strain has spread alarmingly quickly and widely. In the United States, animal outbreaks have been reported at dozens of dairy cow farms and more than 1,000 poultry flocks, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Four human infections have been reported among the hundreds of thousands of people who work at U.S. poultry and dairy farms, though that may be an undercount. WATCH: Bird flu outbreak at dairy farms continue to raise concerns about virus spreading Worldwide, doctors have detected 15 human infections caused by the widely circulating bird flu strain. The count includes one death — a 38-year-old woman in southern China in 2022 — but most people had either no symptoms or only mild ones, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There’s no way to know how many animals have been infected, but certain creatures seem to be getting more severe illnesses. Take cats, for example. Flu is commonly thought of as a disease of the lungs, but the virus can attack and multiply in other parts of the body too. In cats, scientists have found the virus attacking the brain, damaging and clotting blood vessels and causing seizures and death. Similarly gruesome deaths have been reported in other animals, including foxes that ate dead, infected birds. The flu strain’s ability to lodge in the brain and nervous system is one possible reason for “higher mortality rate in some species,” said Amy Baker, an Iowa-based U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist who studies bird flu in animals. But scientists “just don’t know what the properties of the virus or the properties of the host are that are leading to these differences,” Baker said. Unlike cats, cows have been largely spared. Illnesses have been reported in less than 10 percent of the cows in affected dairy herds, according to the USDA. Those that did develop symptoms experienced fever, lethargy, decreased appetite and increased respiratory secretions. Cow infections largely have been concentrated in the udders of lactating animals. Researchers investigating cat deaths at dairy farms with infected cows concluded the felines caught the virus from drinking raw milk. Researchers are still sorting out how the virus has been spreading from cow to cow, but studies suggest the main route of exposure is not the kind of airborne droplets associated with coughing and sneezing. Instead it’s thought to be direct contact, perhaps through shared milking equipment or spread by the workers who milk them. Then there’s the issue of susceptibility. Flu virus need to be able to latch onto cells before they can invade them. “If it doesn’t get into a cell, nothing happens. … The virus just swims around,” explained Juergen Richt, a researcher at Kansas State University. But those docking spots — sialic acid receptors — aren’t found uniformly throughout the body, and differ among species. One recent study documented the presence of bird flu-friendly receptors in dairy cattle mammary glands. Eye redness has been a common symptom among people infected by the current bird flu strain. People who milk cows are eye level with the udders, and splashes are common. Some scientists also note that the human eye has receptors that the virus can bind to. A study published this month found ferrets infected in the eyes ended up dying, as the researchers demonstrated that the virus could be as deadly entering through the eyes as through the respiratory tract. Why didn’t the same happen in the U.S. farmworkers? That’s a hard one to answer, experts said. Perhaps people have some level of immunity, due to past exposure to other forms of flu or to vaccinations, Richt suggested. A more menacing question: What happens if the virus mutates in a way that makes it more lethal to people or allows it to spread more easily? READ MORE: How bird flu puts workers on farms and in food processing plants at higher risk Pigs are a concern because they are considered ideal mixing vessels for bird flu to potentially combine with other flu viruses to create something more dangerous. Baker has been studying the current strain in pigs and found it can replicate in the lungs, but the disease is very mild. But that could all change, which is why there’s a push in the scientific community to ramp up animal testing. Frieden, of Resolve to Save Lives, noted public health experts have been worried about a deadly new flu pandemic for a long time. “The only thing predictable about influenza is it’s unpredictable,” he said.

Prev Next Montana Ag Network: When will an Avian Flu vaccination hit the market? By: Ryan Gamboa Posted and last updated GREAT FALLS — Across the nation, poultry farmers are grappling with the effects of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza or HPAI."We are two years into a national outbreak with highly pathogenic avian influenza," explained Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, Montana State Veterinarian.Dr. Szymanski told MTN there have been approximately two dozen HPAI detection's across the state of Montana, which equates to about 175,000 birds impacted.It sounds like a large number, but is small compared to infections in flocks across the nation.At the beginning of April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a public health alert informing that a Texas farm worker tested positive for HPAI. Before that announcement, Cal-Maine Foods, the largest producer of shell eggs in the country announced it would cull 1.6 million laying hens and nearly 350,000 young hens. It amounts to almost 4% of its total flock.Animal and Range Science Extension Specialist at Montana State University Thomas Bass says the concern is lower in Montana."I think that we can be a little less vulnerable compared to the Midwest where there's a pretty concentrated egg and turkey production. Meaning a lot of farms on the landscape essentially near each other.” Bass explained.Montana's vast open spaces create less vulnerability to livestock, but doesn't eliminate the threat. Livestock can become infected when in close proximity to an infected bird or a human.Bass explained some pathogens will live in humans lungs and can be transmitted elsewhere. He did not confirm that is the case for HPAI. If an animal or group of livestock become infected, Dr. Szymanski says that farmers and ranchers would be asked to distance themselves from others, eliminate sharing of equipment and tools, and limit the number of visitors on your property until the illness passes.With "Bird Flu" still on the minds of agriculture producers and a large number of bird culls in the U.S. — When and will a vaccination become available?"On that large scale of domestic poultry, we have not made that decision. I know that now that we have the detection in cattle, that conversation, I think, is very much being revisited. Is is it time for us to to look and go that route,” said Dr. Szymanski.Bass and Szymanski both explained a vaccination would come in the form of dry food for poultry flocks. Bass says it would be difficult to inject individual flocks as some can vary in size. With illness spreading between species and humans, the conversation of a vaccination is becoming more relevant."I believe the vaccine is being very seriously discussed at the highest levels of of policy around that meeting between the USDA and APHIS." Bass added.The egg crisis of 2022 leaves questions on if the price per dozen of eggs will rise with HPAI running rampant in the United States. Marketplace.org reports in 2023, the price per a dozen grad A eggs peaked at more than $4.80 after the bird flu infected tens of millions of hens, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index shows it's more than twice the amount they cost during the same period the previous year.In the same report, the University of Arkansas wrote a paper finding other factors driving up egg prices during the 2022 outbreak, like inflation. The report found avian flu resulted in a 7.2% to 9.2% increase in retail egg prices from February 2022 and June 2023.Associate Professor Lee Schultz in the Economics department at Iowa State University told Marketplace, “Typically, 86-87.5% of the eggs produced within a month are consumed, and 12.5-14% of the eggs are hatched to add birds to the flock.. For a short period of time, the industry could maintain supplies to consumers by retaining fewer eggs.”As the avian flu continues a steady pace across the country, Dr. Szymanski says poultry and dairy products in grocery stores are safe and there should be no fear during consumption.

Purpose On May 9, 2024, a multi-sectoral expert engagement exercise was conducted to review the pandemic risk scenario analysis (PRSA) completed in March 2023, and to gather expert opinion and advice related to pandemic risk. It is important to remember that when discussing scenarios, they describe alternative or possible futures around a specific issue and help anticipate future changes to better inform preparedness and planning activities. In the context of the PRSA, the scenarios were used to make judgements about the relative risk of avian influenza unfolding towards a pandemic scenario over a one-year timeframe. Although the scenarios were not intended for use to monitor our current status, the experts were asked to comment on the current situation pertaining to H5N1 findings in US Cattle. Method Participants included 93 experts from multiple federal departments in human, animal and environmental health sectors, provincial ministries of public health and agriculture, and academiaFootnote a. The four potential scenarios were reviewed. The participants were asked a series of questions via a whiteboard exercise to determine: what our current situation looks like now compared to last year; what criteria are essential for suggesting that we are in a situation of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission; and what the situation may look like a year from now. The input provided was summarized and analyzed by a team within the Centre for Surveillance, Integrated Insights and Risk Assessment (SIIRA), Public Health Agency of Canada. Statement summary Avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b remains primarily an avian virus, and there have been very few human cases or signs of virus adaptation to mammals. Transmission to and within cattle is new and unexpected. It also represents a new clinical portrait for mammals. This results in new interfaces to consider for biosecurity, including new potential routes of transmission to humans. There was agreement between experts that there is cattle-to-cattle transmission occurring, though the mode and extent of transmission is uncertain. The criteria to suggest that we are in a scenario of "sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission" is complex, and not all experts agree on where to place this line. There was disagreement between experts on whether the current situation could be considered one of 'sustained' mammal-to-mammal transmission, which was driven by the high uncertainty and different opinions on the extent that 'sustained' transmission requires changes to the virus. Suggestions for essential criteria included: respiratory transmission, ongoing outbreaks without human interventions and in groups with minor contact, or genetic changes to the virus favouring mammalian infection. Despite disagreement on where to draw the line between scenarios, there was strong agreement between experts that the situation has worsened from last year with continuous transmission in mammals and across species. This may play an important role in the pandemic trajectory as there is an increased opportunity for genetic changes that favour mammalian adaptation. Although no participating experts indicated that human-to-human transmission would be expected to occur in the next year, concern was raised over the virus's ability to reassort, especially in pigs because they have been identified as mixing vessels. Questions Question 1: From your perspective, what has stayed the same and what has changed from last year? How sure are we of this? What has stayed the same? Avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b remains primarily an avian virus. There continues to be infection in wild and domestic birds, and sporadic detections in wild mammals. There continue to be very few human cases, and no human-to-human transmission. There is a fair amount of certainty about these statements. While new genotypes have emerged with certain mutations, there have been no new 'well-recognized' signs of virus adaptation to mammals. Genomic analyses also suggest that antivirals remain effective. Many uncertainties remain regarding transmission pathways between and within species. What has changed from last year? There have been fewer detections in wild and domestic birds. Although infection is continuing in birds, the severity may be decreasing due to increased immunity. There have been findings in new wild mammal species, and in wild mammals in new geographic regions, though this may be due to increased surveillance rather than major changes in the virus. Transmission to cattle was new and unexpected, and it represents a new clinical portrait for mammals (e.g., lack of neurological signs). This results in new interfaces to consider for biosecurity (i.e., between different animal species, and animals and humans, and vice versa), including new potential routes of transmission to humans and other animals (e.g., unpasteurized dairy products). The case in a dairy cattle worker in the US may represent the first mammal-to-human transmission, but this is still uncertain. There was agreement between experts that there is cattle-to-cattle transmission. The mode of transmission is uncertain, with key factors under review including movement of cattle between herds and contaminated milking equipment, but does not appear to be respiratory. There was disagreement between experts on whether the current situation could be considered one of 'sustained' mammal-to-mammal transmission. There was strong agreement that the situation has worsened from last year due to more mammalian infections creating a significant opportunity for viral adaptation to mammals. Cattle might also be a new mixing vessel with opportunities for reassortment with influenza viruses of mammalian origin, though this is uncertain. Question 2: Given our hypothetical pandemic trajectory (i.e., the scenarios leading to a pandemic of respiratory transmission), what criteria are essential to suggest that we are in a scenario of "sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission"? Essential criteria indicated by experts were related to transmission and genetic changes to the virus. There was agreement among many experts that respiratory mammal-to-mammal transmission was an essential criterion of this scenario. It was highlighted that determining this would require excluding other routes, such as livestock trade, infected farm equipment, or fomites. However, other experts pointed out that even if there is no respiratory transmission, continuous transmission in mammals may play an important role in the pandemic trajectory as there is an increased opportunity for genetic changes that favour mammalian adaptation. A few experts indicated that to see sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission we would need to see transmission occurring at sufficient levels to maintain an outbreak without interventions, or ongoing outbreaks in groups that have relatively minor contact with each other. Another important criterion discussed was genetic changes to the virus. If new or combined mutations of mammalian adaptations are seen this could be an indicator of sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission. While not an essential criterion, experts highlighted that concern would arise if mortality was seen in animals that live on, and around, infected farms. Question 3: How do you think the situation will progress over the next year in relation to A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b? The most frequently discussed themes by the experts were the possibilities of the pathogen genetically evolving and its emergence in new non-human mammal species. Concern was raised over the virus's ability to rapidly reassort, increasing the risk of quickly and frequently adapting to new mammalian species. No experts indicated that human-to-human transmission would be expected to occur in the next year. Limited human cases are expected, particularly in occupational settings, as the virus spreads through wild and domestic animal populations. Some experts expect the virus to become more widespread among dairy cattle within the next year due to its mild presentation and potential asymptomatic transmission, while others expect the dairy industry will be able to curb the outbreaks. Small outbreaks and sporadic cases among wild birds, poultry, and cattle are expected to continue over the next year while natural immunity among these populations develops. There is a greater possibility of transmission for domestic and wild animals migrating on and off farm due to the relative openness of cattle operations versus poultry. The animal of most concern as the next major mammalian spillover event was pigs. A strain with higher pandemic potential could emerge through recombination between other influenza A viruses (of which pigs are reservoirs) and avian influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b. However, it was also suggested that fewer cases may occur among pigs due to enhanced on-farm biosecurity measures compared to cattle operations. Experts also provided comments on impacts that could unfold from economic, agricultural, and environmental perspectives. In conclusion (see Figure 1), given recent events, experts are identifying that the situation has worsened from last year with continuous transmission in mammals. This may play an important role in the pandemic trajectory as there is an increased opportunity for genetic changes that favour mammalian adaptation. Given the complexities and evidence gaps on transmission, there was disagreement between experts on whether the current situation could be considered one of 'sustained' mammal-to-mammal transmission. This aligns with the rapid risk assessment (RRA) update recently posted online, which estimates the risk for the immediate situation and describes future risks. Scenarios are created to explore possible future environments. Experts' insights on the possible progression or not were helpful to identify additional turning points for response and planning by public health authorities. These scenarios continue to be a framework which can be used to investigate longer term risks, as well as for planning and preparedness activities. Next steps Continue to follow the recommendations and fill knowledge gaps outlined in the recently completed RRA update. Monitor triggers for re-evaluation of public health risk and update the RRA as appropriate. Figure 1. Illustrating the conclusions Figure 1: Text description Scenarios 1 through 4 are arranged in sequential and escalating order. Scenario 1 is defined as avian transmission and limited transmission in mammals. Scenario 2 is sustained transmission between non-human mammals. Scenario 3 is defined as limited transmission between humans. Lastly, Scenario 4 is sustained transmission between humans (pandemic). An arrow indicates the potential pandemic trajectory may be from Scenario 1 to Scenario 4, acknowledging that scenarios may not unfold in a sequential manner. Sustained transmission is when the virus transmits easily from one person/animal to the next and then further onward. Limited transmission is when the virus infects an individual or a few people/animals in clusters who are in close contact with each other, such as in a family or a marine mammal setting but does not spread further. Clusters may be indicative of common exposures or limited mammal to mammal transmission and may not indicate sustained mammal to mammal transmission. The uncertainty range associated with the current situation extends equally across the high end of Scenario 1 and the low end of Scenario 2 on the trajectory. The uncertainty range associated with the original March 2023 assessment extends over most of Scenario 1 with only a small portion in the low end of Scenario 2. High uncertainty about the exact situation remains. There is an inability to pinpoint the current situation at an exact spot on the trajectory and whether the current situation has crossed a threshold. Consulted experts agreed that the situation has worsened and requires preparedness.

So How Will We Know When To Sound the Pandemic Alarm? By Amy Maxmen and Arthur Allen June 11, 2024 Republish This Story Disponible en Español (Science Photo Library/Getty Images) Stanford University infectious disease doctor Abraar Karan has seen a lot of patients with runny noses, fevers, and irritated eyes lately. Such symptoms could signal allergies, covid, or a cold. This year, there’s another suspect, bird flu — but there’s no way for most doctors to know. This story also ran on NBC News. It can be republished for free. If the government doesn’t prepare to ramp up H5N1 bird flu testing, he and other researchers warn, the United States could be caught off guard again by a pandemic. “We’re making the same mistakes today that we made with covid,” Deborah Birx, who served as former President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, said June 4 on CNN. To become a pandemic, the H5N1 bird flu virus would need to spread from person to person. The best way to keep tabs on that possibility is by testing people. Scientifically speaking, many diagnostic laboratories could detect the virus. However, red tape, billing issues, and minimal investment are barriers to quickly ramping up widespread availability of testing. At the moment, the Food and Drug Administration has authorized only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s bird flu test, which is used only for people who work closely with livestock. State and federal authorities have detected bird flu in dairy cattle in 12 states. Three people who work on separate dairy farms tested positive, and it is presumed they caught the virus from cows. Yet researchers agree that number is an undercount given the CDC has tested only about 40 people for the disease. “It’s important to know if this is contained on farms, but we have no information because we aren’t looking,” said Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle who alerted the country to covid’s spread in 2020 by testing people more broadly. Reports of untested sick farmworkers — as well as a maternity worker who had flu symptoms — in the areas with H5N1 outbreaks among cattle in Texas suggest the numbers are higher. And the mild symptoms of those who tested positive — a cough and eye inflammation, without a fever — are such that infected people might not bother seeking medical care and, therefore, wouldn’t be tested. Farmworkers Face High-Risk Exposures to Bird Flu, but Testing Isn’t Reaching Them Federal officials are offering $75 to dairy workers who agree to be tested for bird flu. Advocates say the payments aren’t enough to protect workers from lost wages and health care costs if they test positive. Read More The CDC has asked farmworkers with flu symptoms to get tested, but researchers are concerned about a lack of outreach and incentives to encourage testing among people with limited job security and access to health care. Further, by testing only on dairy farms, the agency likely would miss evidence of wider spread. “It’s hard to not compare this to covid, where early on we only tested people who had traveled,” said Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the clinical virology laboratory at Stanford University. “That left us open to not immediately recognizing that it was transmitting among the community.” In the early months of covid, the rollout of testing in the United States was catastrophically slow. Although the World Health Organization had validated a test and other groups had developed their own using basic molecular biology techniques, the CDC at first insisted on creating and relying on its own test. Adding to delays, the first version it shipped to state health labs didn’t work. The FDA lagged, too. It didn’t authorize tests from diagnostic laboratories outside of the CDC until late February 2020. Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up On Feb. 27, 2020, Chu’s research lab detected covid in a teenager who didn’t meet the CDC’s narrow testing criteria. This case sounded an alarm that covid had spread below the radar. Scaling up to meet demand took time: Months passed before anyone who needed a covid test could get one. Chu notes this isn’t 2020 — not by a long shot. Hospitals aren’t overflowing with bird flu patients. Also, the country has the tools to do much better this time around, she said, if there’s political will. For starters, tests that detect the broad category of influenzas that H5N1 belongs to, called influenza A, are FDA-approved and ubiquitous. These are routinely run in the “flu season,” from November to February. An unusual number of positives from these garden-variety flu tests this spring and summer could alert researchers that something is awry. Doctors, however, are unlikely to request influenza A tests for patients with respiratory symptoms outside of flu season, in part because health insurers may not cover them except in limited circumstances, said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratory at the University of Washington. That’s a solvable problem, he added. At the peak of the covid pandemic, the government overcame billing issues by mandating that insurance companies cover tests, and set a lucrative price to make it worthwhile for manufacturers. “You ran into a testing booth on every other block in Manhattan because companies got $100 every time they stuck a swab in someone’s nose,” Greninger said. Another obstacle is that the FDA has yet to allow companies to run their influenza A tests using eye swabs, although the CDC and public health labs are permitted to do so. Notably, the bird flu virus was detected only in an eye swab from one farmworker infected this year — and not in samples drawn from the nose or throat. Overcoming such barriers is essential, Chu said, to ramp up influenza A testing in regions with livestock. “The biggest bang for the buck is making sure that these tests are routine at clinics that serve farmworker communities,” she said, and suggested pop-up testing at state fairs, too. In the meantime, novel tests that detect the H5N1 virus, specifically, could be brought up to speed. The CDC’s current test isn’t very sensitive or simple to use, researchers said. Stanford, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic, and other diagnostic laboratories that serve hospital systems have developed alternatives to detecting the virus circulating now. However, their reach is limited, and researchers stress a need to jump-start additional capacity for testing before a crisis is underway. “How can we make sure that if this becomes a public health emergency we aren’t stuck in the early days of covid, where things couldn’t move quickly?” Pinsky said. A recent rule that gives the FDA more oversight of lab-developed tests may bog down authorization. In a statement to KFF Health News, the FDA said that, for now, it may allow tests to proceed without a full approval process. The CDC did not respond to requests for comment. But the American Clinical Laboratory Association has asked the FDA and the CDC for clarity on the new rule. “It’s slowing things down because it’s adding to the confusion about what is allowable,” said Susan Van Meter, president of the diagnostic laboratory trade group. Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics, and other major testing companies are in the best position to manage a surge in testing demand because they can process hundreds per day, rather than dozens. But that would require adapting testing processes for their specialized equipment, a process that consumes time and money, said Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at the Mayo Clinic. “There’s only been a handful of H5N1 cases in humans the last few years,” he said, “so it’s hard for them to invest millions when we don’t know the future.” The government could provide funding to underwrite its research, or commit to buying tests in bulk, much as Operation Warp Speed did to advance covid vaccine development. “If we need to move to scale this, there would need to be an infusion of money,” said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. Like an insurance policy, the upfront expense would be slight compared with the economic blow of another pandemic. Other means of tracking the H5N1 virus are critical, too. Detecting antibodies against the bird flu in farmworkers would help reveal whether more people have been infected and recovered. And analyzing wastewater for the virus could indicate an uptick in infections in people, birds, or cattle. As with all pandemic preparedness efforts, the difficulty lies in stressing the need to act before a crisis strikes, Greninger said. “We should absolutely get prepared,” he said, “but until the government insures some of the risk here, it’s hard to make a move in that direction.” Amy Maxmen: amaxmen@kff.org Arthur Allen: aallen@kff.org, @ArthurAllen202 Related Topics Health Industry Public Health Rural Health CDC Contact Us Submit a Story Tip Share This Story: TwitterFacebookLinkedInEmailPrint Republish This Story We want to hear from you: Contact Us Republish This Story × Copy And Paste To Republish This Story Bird Flu Tests Are Hard To Get. So How Will We Know When To Sound the Pandemic Alarm? By Amy Maxmen and Arthur Allen June 11, 2024 Article HTML Bird Flu Tests Are Hard To Get. So How Will We Know When To Sound the Pandemic Alarm? Amy Maxmen and Arthur Allen Stanford University infectious disease doctor Abraar Karan has seen a lot of patients with runny noses, fevers, and irritated eyes lately. Such symptoms could signal allergies, covid, or a cold. This year, there’s another suspect, bird flu — but there’s no way for most doctors to know. If the government doesn’t prepare to ramp up H5N1 bird flu testing, he and other researchers warn, the United States could be caught off guard again by a pandemic. “We’re making the same mistakes today that we made with covid,” Deborah Birx, who served as former President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response coordinator, said June 4 on CNN. To become a pandemic, the H5N1 bird flu virus would need to spread from person to person. The best way to keep tabs on that possibility is by testing people. Scientifically speaking, many diagnostic laboratories could detect the virus. However, red tape, billing issues, and minimal investment are barriers to quickly ramping up widespread availability of testing. At the moment, the Food and Drug Administration has authorized only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s bird flu test, which is used only for people who work closely with livestock. State and federal authorities have detected bird flu in dairy cattle in 12 states. Three people who work on separate dairy farms tested positive, and it is presumed they caught the virus from cows. Yet researchers agree that number is an undercount given the CDC has tested only about 40 people for the disease. “It’s important to know if this is contained on farms, but we have no information because we aren’t looking,” said Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle who alerted the country to covid’s spread in 2020 by testing people more broadly. Reports of untested sick farmworkers — as well as a maternity worker who had flu symptoms — in the areas with H5N1 outbreaks among cattle in Texas suggest the numbers are higher. And the mild symptoms of those who tested positive — a cough and eye inflammation, without a fever — are such that infected people might not bother seeking medical care and, therefore, wouldn’t be tested. The CDC has asked farmworkers with flu symptoms to get tested, but researchers are concerned about a lack of outreach and incentives to encourage testing among people with limited job security and access to health care. Further, by testing only on dairy farms, the agency likely would miss evidence of wider spread. “It’s hard to not compare this to covid, where early on we only tested people who had traveled,” said Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the clinical virology laboratory at Stanford University. “That left us open to not immediately recognizing that it was transmitting among the community.” In the early months of covid, the rollout of testing in the United States was catastrophically slow. Although the World Health Organization had validated a test and other groups had developed their own using basic molecular biology techniques, the CDC at first insisted on creating and relying on its own test. Adding to delays, the first version it shipped to state health labs didn’t work. The FDA lagged, too. It didn’t authorize tests from diagnostic laboratories outside of the CDC until late February 2020. On Feb. 27, 2020, Chu’s research lab detected covid in a teenager who didn’t meet the CDC’s narrow testing criteria. This case sounded an alarm that covid had spread below the radar. Scaling up to meet demand took time: Months passed before anyone who needed a covid test could get one. Chu notes this isn’t 2020 — not by a long shot. Hospitals aren’t overflowing with bird flu patients. Also, the country has the tools to do much better this time around, she said, if there’s political will. For starters, tests that detect the broad category of influenzas that H5N1 belongs to, called influenza A, are FDA-approved and ubiquitous. These are routinely run in the “flu season,” from November to February. An unusual number of positives from these garden-variety flu tests this spring and summer could alert researchers that something is awry. Doctors, however, are unlikely to request influenza A tests for patients with respiratory symptoms outside of flu season, in part because health insurers may not cover them except in limited circumstances, said Alex Greninger, assistant director of the clinical virology laboratory at the University of Washington. That’s a solvable problem, he added. At the peak of the covid pandemic, the government overcame billing issues by mandating that insurance companies cover tests, and set a lucrative price to make it worthwhile for manufacturers. “You ran into a testing booth on every other block in Manhattan because companies got $100 every time they stuck a swab in someone’s nose,” Greninger said. Another obstacle is that the FDA has yet to allow companies to run their influenza A tests using eye swabs, although the CDC and public health labs are permitted to do so. Notably, the bird flu virus was detected only in an eye swab from one farmworker infected this year — and not in samples drawn from the nose or throat. Overcoming such barriers is essential, Chu said, to ramp up influenza A testing in regions with livestock. “The biggest bang for the buck is making sure that these tests are routine at clinics that serve farmworker communities,” she said, and suggested pop-up testing at state fairs, too. In the meantime, novel tests that detect the H5N1 virus, specifically, could be brought up to speed. The CDC’s current test isn’t very sensitive or simple to use, researchers said. Stanford, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic, and other diagnostic laboratories that serve hospital systems have developed alternatives to detecting the virus circulating now.

Published - June 11, 2024 06:21 pm IST Zubeda HamidAvian influenza, commonly known as bird flu is back in the news again – at least four states in India: Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand have already reported outbreaks among poultry. The Centre has asked all States to be vigilant, and said all necessary measures have to be taken to prevent its spread. Does bird flu have the potential to turn into the next pandemic?It’s not just in India that bird flu is in the news though – the United States has been battling this problem as the infection has now spread to cattle herds in several states in that country.The World Health Organisation recently said that A (H5N1) strain of avian influenza has become “a global zoonotic animal pandemic” with thousands of animals infected across multiple countries. Avian influenza: Centre asks States to be vigilant While so far there is no evidence that H5N1 virus is spreading from human to human, the risk remains for people who come into contact with infected animals.Two cases were in the headlines recently – one of a child who was diagnosed with H5N1 in Australia where she had just returned after a trip to Kolkata, and another case in Mexico, where a man died of a strain of bird flu called H5N2, which had never before been found in humans.What are the ramifications of bird flu in India? Who is vulnerable to the disease and how can its transmission be curtailed? How do we ensure the safety of eggs, chicken and other animal products? And does India need reforms in its poultry and animal food sector to ensure better safety of animal and human health?Guest: Dr Subramanian Swaminathan, Director of Infectious diseases at Gleneagles Hospital.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The ongoing trial includes adults ages 50 and older. (Image credit: mixetto via Getty Images) An experimental two-in-one vaccine triggered strong immune responses against both the flu and SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, in an advanced clinical trial that included adults ages 50 and older. The ongoing clinical trial pits this new combination shot, called mRNA-1083, against several licensed vaccines that protect against either COVID-19 or the flu. Compared with these separate vaccines, the combo shot produced "significantly higher immune responses" to three subtypes of flu and to the coronavirus, the pharmaceutical company Moderna, which developed the vaccine, announced Monday (June 10).These results haven't yet been reviewed by scientists outside of Moderna. The company plans to present the data at an upcoming medical conference and to publish the results in a scientific journal. Moderna representatives told news outlets that the company aspires to have the new shot approved by fall 2025 — so it won't be available by this flu season, but it might be by the next. Pfizer-BioNTech and Novavax are also working on their own COVID-flu vaccines, but Moderna is the first to release late-stage clinical trial data. Related: A branch of the flu family tree has died and won't be included in future US vaccinesPeople currently have to get their annual flu shots and updated COVID-19 vaccines separately. One major benefit of a combination vaccine would be that it would streamline that vaccination process, boosting coverage through convenience, Dr. Francesca Ceddia, Moderna's chief medical affairs officer, wrote in a Moderna blog post. Such a shot could also free up doctors' and pharmacists' time by cutting the number of individual shots they'd have to give, she wrote.Beyond convenience, though, it's possible that the new vaccine could be more protective than the current vaccines that are given individually, Moderna's early data hint.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over."When we think about the combination vaccine, we often only think about the element of convenience, one shot instead of two," Ceddia told CNN. "But what is really, really breakthrough is the fact that you not only offer that advantage, you also offer the proof of clinical benefit."The combination vaccine includes two components, both made of a genetic molecule called mRNA. Once inside the human body, mRNA instructs human cells to build specific proteins — in this case, proteins found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. The new vaccine builds upon the Nobel Prize-winning technology used to develop the first COVID-19 vaccines. Since those shots were released, mRNA has been used to develop experimental treatments and vaccines for many diseases, including deadly brain cancers and ultra-rare genetic disorders.The ongoing trial is testing the new vaccine in two groups of roughly 4,000 adults each: one group of people ages 65 and up, and one group of 50- to 64-year-olds. Participants in the older group received either the new shot alone or Moderna's old COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax, along with a high-dose flu shot that's recommended to older adults. Participants in the younger group got either the new vaccine or Spikevax and a standard-dose flu shot.In both age groups, the combo vaccine elicited a superior immune response against a variant of SARS-CoV-2 called omicron XBB.1.5; two types of influenza A virus called H1N1 and H3N2; and a type of influenza B virus known as the Victoria lineage. The researchers measured this immune protection in terms of the number of protective antibodies that appeared in people's blood.(Notably, newer versions of omicron have now overtaken XBB.1.5, so the new vaccine's effectiveness against those variants isn't yet known.)The most common side effects of the new shot included pain at the injection site, fatigue, muscle aches and headaches. These side effects also show up with existing COVID-19 and flu vaccines. However, Moderna hasn't released the full details of the trial so it's not yet known whether the rate of side effects differs between the old and new vaccines. Between October 2023 and June 2024, up to 810,000 people were hospitalized for influenza in the U.S., and up to 71,000 people died from the infection, the CDC estimates based on preliminary data; firmer figures will be released in coming months. In addition, data recently presented to the Food and Drug Administration suggest that more than 500,000 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 40,000 died from it, during last autumn and winter, CNN reported. RELATED STORIES—Why is the flu shot less effective than other vaccines?—Did pandemic lockdowns stunt kids' immune systems long-term?—Is it too late to get a flu shot?This past season, the rate of flu vaccination far outpaced that for COVID-19 vaccination among adults, so some experts hope that introducing combination vaccines could help pull that rate up. For now, Moderna is working with regulators to approve the new vaccine for adults but the company hasn't noted when the shot might be tested in younger groups.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Michael Wunderli/Flickr cc So far, 74 cases have been confirmed, 54 in Santiago de Cuba province and 20 in Cienfuegos province. The cases were found during enhanced surveillance following a rise in febrile illnesses. Illness onsets ranged from May 2 to May 23, with cases peaking during the week ending May 24. The most common symptoms were fever, low-back pain, headache, loss of appetite, vomiting, weakness, joint pain, and eye pain.Slightly more than half of the patients were male, and the median age was 34 years. All patients showed signs of recovery at day 3 or 4 of their illnesses. So far, no severe or fatal cases have been reported. Oropouche virus is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. Cuban population highly susceptibleThe WHO said since Cuba is experiencing Oropouche virus infections for the first time and the country's population is highly susceptible, contributing to a risk of more cases. The agency also noted a risk of international spread, given that Cuba is a tourist destination and that the midge that carries the virus is widely distributed in the Americas.Earlier this spring, the WHO's Pan American Health Organization warned of Oropouche virus rises in some Americas countries, with cases already reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Ocular inoculation with H5N1 proves fatal in ferrets News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) AnnaIssakova/ iStock H5N1 infection was fatal to six ferrets after ocular inoculation with the virus, according to a study today in Emerging Infectious Diseases.The virus used in the experiment was A 2.3.4.4b, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus isolated from a human patient in Chile in 2023.The ferrets were inoculated with both low and high doses of the virus via the ocular route. All ferrets inoculated with a high dose of virus had detectable infectious virus in nasal wash, the authors said, and the magnitude and frequency of viral titers in these specimens was reduced, but still present, in animals inoculated with a low dose."Our finding that a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus isolated from a human can exhibit a virulent and transmissible phenotype after nontraditional inoculation, even with a low dose of inoculum, underscores the public health threat posed by those IAVs [influenza A viruses]," the authors said. Our finding that a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus isolated from a human can exhibit a virulent and transmissible phenotype after nontraditional inoculation.Low and high doses of virus infected animals Late last week, a study showed the current strain of H5N1 infecting US dairy cattle was fatal to ferrets. The strain used in that study came from a Texas dairy farmworker who was sickened with the virus. So far, three agricultural workers in the United States have been infected with the virus during ongoing farm outbreaks, all with mild illness. The first two workers reported eye infections. "Considering the myriad ways humans may be exposed to IAVs, our study supports the need to consider nontraditional inoculation modalities in risk assessment activities and supports consideration of using eye protection in potentially contaminated environments," the authors concluded. Wisconsin orders avian flu testing for lactating cattle before fairs and exhibits News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) yesterday announced that lactating dairy cows must be tested for influenza A before movement to fairs and exhibits to prevent the spready of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu in cattle. So far, no H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Wisconsin, but the virus has been detected in 12 states, including in neighboring Michigan, Minnesota, and Iowa. Hope for Gorilla/Flickr cc The testing measure takes effect on June 19, and samples must be collected no more than 7 days before movement to exhibitions. The order will remain in effect until 60 days after the last H5N1 detection in dairy herds in the United States.More detections in US cattle, poultry, and wild birdsIn other developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has reported 4 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, 3 from Idaho and 1 from Iowa, raising its confirmed outbreak total to 94.Also, APHIS reported one more outbreak in poultry, which involves a backyard facility that houses 30 birds in Idaho's Jerome County. The group also reported more than 80 more H5N1 detections in wild birds, which included agency-harvested birds such as sparrows and starlings in Michigan and Idaho counties that have experienced outbreaks in dairy herds. Also, both captive birds and those found dead tested positive in Massachusetts. Federal officials report more cucumber-linked Salmonella cases, second outbreak News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Foodborne Disease Salmonella The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today reported 34 more illnesses linked to a multistate Salmonella Africana outbreak with a suspected link to cucumbers, raising the total to 196. Illnesses have also been reported in 3 more states, putting that total at 28 plus the District of Columbia. Dave DeSandro/Flickr cc The latest illness onset was May 23, and from information on 164 cases, 68 people (41%) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Of interviews with 85 patients, 63 (74%) reported eating cucumbers the week before they got sick.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said sampling efforts as part of the investigation turned up Salmonella in cucumbers distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, which announced a recall of its products. Whole-genome sequencing, however, showed that the cucumbers were positive for Salmonella Bareilly and don't match the outbreak strain.Investigators look for links to second similar outbreakThe CDC and the FDA are also investigating a Salmonella Braenderup outbreak that has so far sickened 185 people in 24 states. "The two outbreaks share several similarities, including where and when illnesses occurred and the demographics of ill people. Investigators are working to determine whether the two outbreaks could be linked to the same food vehicle," the FDA said in its update today. Study: Previous COVID-19 infection may protect against common colds News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Prostock-Studio / iStock Infection with COVID-19 may offer protection against other, less severe endemic coronaviruses (eCOVs) that are often behind the common cold, according to a study today in Science Translational Medicine. COVID vaccines, however, don't appear to afford similar protection. Three coronaviruses can cause severe and fatal disease in humans: MERS-CoV, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2. But four eCOVs typically cause symptomatic, mild respiratory illnesses, accounting for 15% to 30% of "common colds."The study was based on polymerase chain reaction test results from a retrospective cohort of 4,935 people who presented for clinical evaluation for respiratory illness from November 2020 to October 2021 at Boston Medical Center. Half the risk of symptomatic colds Participants were grouped into three categories: previous COVID-19 infection (501 participants), previous COVID-19 vaccine but no known infection (1,565), and no SARS-CoV-2 antigen exposures (no prior infection or vaccination; 2,869). "Incidence of symptomatic eCoV infection was significantly lower in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and no vaccination (2 of 275, 0.7%) as compared with the individuals who had been deemed fully vaccinated but had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (44 of 1,463, 3.0%)," the authors wrote. Incidence of symptomatic eCoV infection was significantly lower in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and no vaccinationPrevious COVID-19 infection was associated with an almost 50% reduced risk of a future symptomatic eCoV during the follow-up period of more than 120 days [hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 1.1)."Our observations have important implications for future pan-CoV vaccines and other disease prevention strategies," the authors concluded. Trial shows that COVID vaccine doesn't raise risk of poor outcomes in acute coronary syndrome patients News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 iStock Patients who received one or more COVID-19 vaccine doses after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) had similar rates of all-cause death, heart attack, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, major cardiovascular events, and hospitalization for chest pain, heart failure, and respiratory infections as their unvaccinated peers, according to a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.The research was published in JAMA Network Open.No reduction in MACEAn international team led by researchers from Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, analyzed results from the Vaccination Against Influenza to Prevent Cardiovascular Events After Acute Coronary Syndromes trial. The trial evaluated the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine post-ACS from July 2019 to November 2020, while the secondary analysis compared the rate of cardiopulmonary events in patients who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil with that of unvaccinated participants. Patients were not randomized to the COVID vaccine in the secondary analysis.In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, patients who received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose after ACS had similar rates of the primary composite end point and MACE compared with unvaccinated patients.Of 1,801 patients (median age, 56.7 years; 30.3% women), 16.2% had a history of heart attack, and 35.7% smoked. In total, 1,665 patients did not have cardiopulmonary events in the first 90 days, of whom 50.2% had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Most (63.9%) received at least one Oxford/AstraZeneca dose during follow-up.In the 90-day event-free follow-up analysis of unvaccinated individuals, the rate of all-cause death, heart attack, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, major cardiovascular events, and hospitalization for chest pain, heart failure, and respiratory infections per 100 patient-years was 9.37, versus 4.81 for vaccinated patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.41). Vaccination didn't significantly lower the rate of MACE (aHR, 0.32), all-cause death (aHR, 0.29), or cardiovascular death (aHR, 0.42). "In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, patients who received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose after ACS had similar rates of the primary composite end point and MACE compared with unvaccinated patients," the researchers wrote. "However, retrospective studies have demonstrated a short-term reduction in MACE risk after COVID-19 vaccination."

What can we learn from their strategies? June 14, 202412:28 PM ET By Gabrielle Emanuel A health officer collects ducks to be killed at a farm north of Bangkok during Thailand's bird flu outbreak in the early 2000s. A massive culling of fowl was part of the country's strategy to quash the virus. Stringer/AFP/via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stringer/AFP/via Getty Images 62 million. That’s the number seared in Prasert Auewarakul’s memory. It is the number of birds – mostly chickens – that were dead by the end of Thailand’s avian flu outbreak that started in late 2003. Some died of the disease, others were culled to prevent the virus from spreading. “It was very bad. Most of the farmers lost everything,” says Dr. Auewarakul, a virologist at Mahidol University in Thailand. Now, two decades later, the U.S. is grappling with its own avian flu outbreak. And this time the virus has taken a new twist. In late March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the H5N1 virus, which is periodically found in farmed poultry, had been identified in dairy cows in two states – the first time scientists have detected a spillover to cattle. Sponsor Message Now, 92 herds spread across a dozen states have been infected, according to the World Health Organization. And the virus has spread to humans as well. Three farm workers have contracted the virus this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So far, the virus has not shown the ability to spread easily between humans. This outbreak has led some scientists and public health experts to look at past avian flu outbreaks. “There are so many lessons that we have learned,” says Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director for epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention at the World Health Organization. And the stakes are high. While there have been relatively few human cases of H5N1 – roughly 900 – more than half of them have been fatal. What did Thailand do? In December 2003 in Thailand, flocks of chickens were mysteriously dying. This was particularly problematic because Thailand was one of the world’s main poultry exporters, producing about a billion chickens a year. About 400,000 people were employed in the industry. By January 2004, the authorities had the answer: avian flu. While nobody knows for sure, Auewarakul says, the virus likely jumped from wild waterfowl to domesticated chickens. The effect was devastating. The virus can easily wipe out a flock of chickens in a matter of days. About 20 people in Thailand also fell sick and 13 of them died from 2003 to 2005. Sponsor Message Officials sprang into action to save Thailand’s poultry industry and prevent more spread to humans. Infected flocks – and nearby flocks as well – were culled (the government paid farmers for the loss). And then Thailand reinvented its poultry industry. The movement of live poultry — to market, for example — was severely restricted. Farm hygiene was dramatically improved. A nationwide surveillance system was launched, including a network of village health volunteers who reported sick birds. Perhaps the biggest and most lasting change, Auewarakul says, is that this outbreak abruptly accelerated the transition from backyard chicken farmers to large-scale industrialized poultry farms. He says this was a big cultural transition since chickens had been part of everyday life for many Thai families. “They were raised like pets, like you would raise your dog,” he says. “But small farms disappeared and big companies with biosecurity systems stayed.” More recently, he notes, some backyard farms have returned. But the big farms still “dominate the market.” In these big farms chickens often spend their lives entirely indoors. This lifestyle means there’s almost no intermingling with wild waterfowl and contact between flocks. Plus, the farms have instituted lots of protocols for who gets to go in and how. “People don't go in and out that much,” Auewarakul says. “When people go in, they have to disinfect themselves” before and after visiting the poultry areas. The shift to these industrialized farms has not fully eliminated avian flu in chickens, but the disease has been largely contained. With ongoing monitoring, cases are often identified early and dealt with before the virus can gain a foothold. Other countries grappled with avian flu at the same time and managed to control their outbreaks: Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam in Asia and the Netherlands, for example. Auewarakul says a similar approach to Thailand’s — a combo of culling, surveillance and limits on the movement of animals — has been a success. Sponsor Message “I remember in 2003, literally, countries were saying, ‘We killed a million birds today.’ And you don't hear that happening anymore because of the responses that were put in place,” says Andrew Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Does what works for the hen also work for the cow? The answer is yes and no – and it’s not just because chickens cluck and cows moo. Certain strategies — like widespread culling when an outbreak is detected — are unlikely to apply to cows. “What has to be remembered here – and I think this is very important – is that cattle are worth huge amounts of money,” says Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergencies program at WHO. An individual chicken is valued at less than $10 while a lone lactating cow sells for close to $2,000, says veterinary doctor Pamula Ruegg, a professor at Michigan State University and editor of the Journal of Dairy Science Communications. So the bar for culling cattle is much higher. And a cattle cull would have a more severe economic impact on farmers, since cows don’t produce milk until they are about two years old while chickens lay eggs in a matter of months. What’s more, H5N1 can decimate a flock of chickens – another pro-cull argument back in 2004. That’s not so for cows, whose symptoms are far milder, including a drop in milk production and loss of appetite. “We're not killing cattle. We don't have to. Everything we've seen and all the preliminary data suggests they recover pretty rapidly,” says Ruegg. As for keeping cows indoors, Ruegg says that while there are some indoor facilities for dairy herds, they tend to fare better when there's access to the outdoors. Still both Pekosz and Auewarakul say a lot can be learned from how clean poultry farms have become. Sponsor Message “In countries around the world, a lot of their poultry workers have significant amounts of protective gear. Sometimes it’s a face shield, a pair of gloves that you change frequently, a pair of boots that you can disinfect periodically,” explains Pekosz. Some of the workers shower upon entering the chicken area and leaving it. The goal is simple: Don’t bring any viruses in or out. These strategies “have all been shown to be incredibly effective in limiting human infections but also limiting the spread of a pathogen from one farm to another, from one flock to another, from one herd to another,” he says, noting that farm workers, delivery drivers, veterinarians and others may visit multiple farms. The CDC has recommended protective gear for U.S. dairy farmers in the wake of the current outbreak to but, Pekosz says, there’s not been widespread compliance. He says that could be because of a lack of training, because it’s hard to change habits or because cow farms are run differently than chicken farms. Ruegg says practices have to be specifically adapted to dairy farms. For example, she suggests glasses instead of face shields. “It'd be really easy for those full [face] shields to fog up when you're working [in a milking parlor],” she says. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer for the National Milk Producers Federation, adds that one of his priorities is making sure to sanitize milking machines between cows because the virus has been found in high concentrations in raw milk. The other lesson that can be learned from the poultry industry’s history with avian flu is the importance of farmer buy-in. One way Thailand did it was to ensure reasonable compensation for farmers who lost their flocks to disease or culling – 100% of the animal’s value early on, then later 75%. Sponsor Message Pekosz would like to see the U.S. reassure farmers they don't lose financially if their cows are tested and found to be infected. “That’s really important to making sure we get more access to these farms so we can get a better understanding of the extent and magnitude of this outbreak,” he says. New strategies are needed While Maurice Pitesky isn’t opposed to borrowing from the past’s avian flu playbook, he says, it’s also necessary to write a new chapter. Pitesky — who studies avian flu at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine — says that two decades ago when Thailand was developing its strategy, there was one main threat: Wild waterfowl introducing the virus. “Now, we're dealing with an entire ecosystem issue,” he says. That’s because in the past few years, H5N1 outbreaks have traveled far beyond chickens and cows. The virus has shown up on six continents and in a slew of wild and domestic mammals, from tigers and mink to cats and dogs. All in all, H5N1 has been reported in more than 48 mammal species across 26 different countries, according to a peer-reviewed journal published by the CDC. In South America, it’s caused the death of more than 17,000 elephant seals. Earlier this month, house mice in New Mexico tested positive for the virus. “It's hard to see how this will ever not be an endemic disease at this point,” says Pitesky. He says this will mandate new strategies that go far beyond the farm gates. “We've never had anything like this before,” Pitesky says. avian flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorWisconsin fairs required to check cows for avian flu this summer - WPR Skip to Audio Player Menu Close Toggle Site Mobile Navigation Home News Shows Culture Music ABOUT Who We Are Events Careers / Volunteer LISTEN Stations & Schedules Music Playlists Ways to Listen SUPPORT Ways to Give Membership FAQ Funding Information CONTACT Get in Touch Help / FAQ Newsletters POLICIES Ethical Guidelines Policies and Reports Privacy Policy News Shows Culture Music Wisconsin Public Radio Homepage Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) Logo Donate Icon Donate Search wpr.org Search Icon Agriculture, Dairy, News Wisconsin fairs required to check cows for avian flu this summer New state order requires lactating cows have negative test for avian flu before traveling to county fair or other exhibition By Hope Kirwan June 12, 2024 Updated June 13, 2024 at 3:52 pm Download Connor Larson, a member of Lafayette County 4-H, moves his Jersey cow at the Wisconsin State Fair on Thursday, Aug. 4, 2022, in West Allis, Wis. Angela Major/WPR Wisconsin dairy cows heading to county fairs and other exhibitions will be required to undergo testing for avian flu this summer. Fairs, rodeos and similar exhibitions will be required to verify that lactating cows have tested negative for the H5N1 virus within 7 days of moving to the event. The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced the new testing requirement Tuesday. It goes into effect on June 19, when the first county fair of the summer begins.

Highly-pathogenic avian influenza has affected 90 dairy herds across 12 states since it was first identified in Texas and Kansas this March. Minnesota and Iowa are some of the latest states to find the virus in cows, with both states announcing their first cases last week. “Although we do not have a confirmed case in dairy cattle in Wisconsin at this point, we did feel that with the increasing number of cases, especially in our region, that it made sense to minimize opportunities for this virus to be introduced or spread among animals in Wisconsin,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Darlene Konkle during a call with reporters. Konkle said fairs will check for the test as part of the health information they normally verify for participating livestock. DATCP’s animal health inspectors will also be working with fairs to carry out the new requirement. New requirements will increase surveillance for H5N1 virus Wisconsin is not the first state to make changes to the fair season in response to avian flu. In May, Michigan agriculture officials issued an order prohibiting dairy cattle from being shown at exhibitions until there are no new cases of the virus in cows for 60 days. The last case reported in that state was on May 31. The new testing requirement does not apply to cows moving between dairy herds in the state. Since April, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has required that lactating cows moving between states undergo testing for avian flu. Konkle said the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory, which is the only facility certified to process the avian flu samples, is prepared to take on the additional tests coming from the order. She said most cattle owners should receive their test results the day of or after their samples are processed by the lab. She said laboratory costs to process the tests will be covered by funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and producers can apply for additional assistance to cover shipping and veterinary costs. Health experts have expressed concerns about the limited amount of testing happening on farms and among their workers nationwide. Konkle said while the new order is meant to protect farms bringing cows to and from fairs this summer, it will help provide additional surveillance in the state. “We’re trying to learn all we can (from) our neighbor states that have affected farms and the additional epidemiological information they’re gathering and the testing information from those affected herds,” she said. Federal officials urge restrictions on raw milk sales Last week, the Food and Drug Administration sent a letter to states recommending the sale of raw milk be monitored or restricted in order to prevent the virus from being passed on to consumers. High levels of the H5N1 virus have been found in raw milk from infected cows, and there is evidence that exposure to raw milk can spread the infection between cows. An FDA official said in the letter that it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk. But the official pointed out that exposures on affected dairy farms have been associated with the three cases of the illness in farm workers, and cited concerns about creating opportunities to “adapt to new hosts.” The sale of raw milk is illegal in Wisconsin, except through what’s called incidental sales. DATCP defines this as a direct sale to a consumer on the farm that is not a regular business transaction or if there is any advertising. Adam Brock, administrator for DATCP’s Division of Food ​and Recreational Safety​, told reporters on Tuesday that the state is not currently moving toward additional restrictions on raw milk sales. “We still have our standard practices of emphasizing and educating on pasteurization,” Brock said. “I think we were probably one of the first to say pasteurization works. We continue to work with FDA and USDA.” Recent studies of milk from infected cows have provided evidence that pasteurization of milk inactivates the virus, supporting assurances from federal and state health officials that the commercial milk supply is safe. Brock said DATCP is also working with producers to mitigate the risk of virus spread in other ways, including increased education around on-farm sanitation and safety measures.

By: Dr. Partha Nandi Posted and last updated (WXYZ) — Two cases of “dual mutant” strains of influenza A, or H1N1, have been detected in the United States.Researchers warn that these genetic changes might make flu treatments less effective.Earlier this year, scientists in Hong Kong published findings on two mutations, I223V and S247N. Their research suggested that these mutations could reduce the effectiveness of oseltamivir, the most commonly prescribed treatment for influenza. Most people know it as Tamiflu.As for how much these mutations might reduce oseltamivir's effectiveness in real-life situations, that we don’t know for certain.However, lab tests showed that the mutated viruses were up to 16 times less sensitive to the antiviral medicine. On the positive side, this decrease is not as large or as severe as what's been seen with some previous mutations that caused concern.Now, a new analysis published in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal reported that these two dual mutants strains were collected in the United States.Tests indicated that these strains also demonstrated a reduced susceptibility to other approved influenza antiviral drugs including baloxavir. Baloxavir is a newer antiviral medication.While the researchers said the emergence of antiviral-resistant variants is a concern for public health, the CDC is not overly worried at this point.Since the mutations first appeared in May 2023, cases have been reported from 15 countries across five continents. A total of 101 virus samples were shared with the global virus database GISAID from countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania.The two countries with the highest number of reported cases include the Netherlands, with 30 reported cases, and France, with 24 reported cases. However, these mutations are still considered rare, making up less than 1% of flu virus sequences globally.As for the upcoming flu season, it's unclear how widely these mutated viruses will spread. But with or without these mutations, the flu vaccination remains important as it still offers protection.The CDC also emphasizes the importance of early antiviral treatment for hospitalized flu patients and those at risk of severe illness. They will continue to monitor and track any new spread and genetic changes.THIS WEEK ON ‘THE DR.

Producing results in just 20 minutes on a compact analyzer suitable for most healthcare settings, the test uses either a single nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal-swab sample to confirm or rule out infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnostics play a critical role in the fight against respiratory illness,” said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “We are proud to provide this innovative test to address the significant burden placed on healthcare systems. Now, healthcare professionals will be able to detect and differentiate these respiratory viruses within a single patient visit, enabling improved public health outcomes.Introducing rapid multiplex PCR diagnostic tests into near-patient care environments such as emergency departments, urgent care facilities and physician office labs has the potential to provide swift and precise results, expediting clinical decision-making processes. This approach can help reduce unnecessary antibiotic usage, facilitate targeted treatment strategies, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes and healthcare system efficiency.1-6According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), respiratory diseases in the United States reached high levels during the most recent autumn and winter seasons, with SARS-CoV-2 causing the most emergency department visits.7 Hospitalizations due to respiratory illness place a strain on hospitals and can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment for patients.8 In the 2023-2024 respiratory season, infants, children, and adults ages 65 and older were observed to have the highest rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV.9,10 Nationwide, the percentage of recent total deaths due to these respiratory viruses was highest among patients 65 and older.11The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV -nucleic acid test authorized for emergency use further expands and complements Roche’s broad portfolio of single and multiplex tests intended to help diagnose and address the needs of patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory illness, including the following assays: cobas® SARS-CoV-2, cobas® Strep A, cobas® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B, and cobas® Influenza A/B & RSV for use on the cobas liat system. In 2025, Roche intends to seek FDA 510(k) clearance and a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) waiver in the United States for the new test, with plans for commercial launch in other markets worldwide following CE-IVDR approval.About the cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test12The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is an automated rapid multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza A virus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA in anterior nasal (nasal) swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection consistent with COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV can be similar.Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet requirements to perform high, moderate or waived complexity tests. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is authorized for use at the Point of Care (POC), i.e., in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation.Results are for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV viral RNA in clinical specimens and are not intended to detect influenza C virus. SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV RNA are generally detectable in nasal swab and nasopharyngeal swab specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the test. The agent detected may not be the definitive cause of disease.Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B and/or RSV infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and/or epidemiological information.The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is intended for use by trained operators specifically instructed in the use of the cobas liat system and the cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV nucleic acid test is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.About the cobas liat systemThe cobas liat system combines the cobas liat analyzer – an automated nucleic acid test instrument – with cobas liat assay tubes to fully automate the testing process, simplify workflows and enable healthcare professionals to perform molecular testing in a variety of near-patient settings with speed, reliability and minimal training. The system performs reagent preparation, target enrichment, inhibitor removal, nucleic acid amplification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, real-time detection and result interpretation to automate the detection and quantification of nucleic acid targets in a biological sample in a single, closed tube. Definitive results are generated in 20 minutes or less to aid in patient care decisions. The cobas liat SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B & RSV Assay complements existing tests for SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B, Influenza A/B & RSV, Strep A, and Cdiff. Assays for other infectious diseases are currently in development. More information is available here. The cobas liat system is commercially available in select markets.References1.

And not only do we tell folks that milk is safe, but we prove it,” said Dr. Alex Hamberg, Pennsylvania’s state veterinarian. Hamberg spoke Wednesday in a call with the Center for Dairy Excellence.Participating farms would be certified as free of avian influenza after three consecutive weeks of negative tests. They would continue testing weekly after that.If a farm misses a week, it would need to do a follow-up test and sample up to five cows in its sick pens.A farm that misses two weeks in a row would have to start over on the three-week entry period.If a bulk-tank test comes back positive for avian influenza, the state would consider it a presumptive positive and do more testing on the farm.“We would want to really be sure that it’s the real thing before we go much further than that,” Hamberg said.Hamberg aims to start accepting samples for the program at the state’s three animal diagnostic labs in the coming days, and he wants participation to be as hassle-free as possible.“If there’s a way that we can remove a hurdle that might be preventing participation, we’d like to hear about it and see if there’s something we can do to fix it,” he said.The labs will conduct samples once a week.As long as milk is submitted within the one-week window, it will count for that week even if the testing is completed a little later.“Occasionally when testing milk, things can be a little bit complicated and you’ve got to repeat a couple of steps. So that’s why we can’t guarantee same-day (results) on this,” Hamberg said.Pennsylvania is one of roughly 16 states in talks with USDA to start the bulk-tank testing program as a new avian influenza surveillance tool.“I think they don’t want to just go completely national with it so they can kind of control it little bit to make sure things are going to work well, and that they’re working with states that are really interested,” said Dr. Ernest Hovingh, the director of Penn State’s Animal Diagnostic Lab.Among the most interested states are those with large cattle populations and those with recent detections of avian influenza in cattle, Hamberg and Hovingh said.Dairy is Pennsylvania’s second largest ag sector, and the state is a top 10 milk producer.Bulk-tank testing would seem particularly useful because, as Hovingh said, avian influenza can be detected more reliably in milk than in nasal swabs or manure.Farmers may indicate their interest in participating in the bulk-tank herd certification program by filling out this brief form.

(90.9 FM) IPR News Bird flu in Iowa: Here's what to know Iowa Public Radio | By Rachel Cramer Published June 11, 2024 at 10:55 AM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Michael Leland Dairy cows infected with the virus often have a dramatic drop in feed intake. Some produce much less milk, and it can be thick and yellow. Other symptoms include fever, lethargy and tacky or loose feces. In early June, state and federal officials confirmed bird flu infections in two dairy herds in northwest Iowa. The cases made Iowa the tenth state in an ongoing outbreak. This story was last updated on 7/5/2024 at 1:30 p.m. We will continue to update as more information becomes available.The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship has announced 13 cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at dairies and 3 cases at commercial poultry operations. IDALS said increased testing has led to more detections in recent weeks.While some dairy cows have died in the U.S., most recover 10-14 days after the initial infection. With chickens and turkeys, the virus is far more deadly and can wipe out a flock within days. Poultry are culled to prevent the spread of the disease.“Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza continues to pose a significant threat to our livestock and the livelihoods of the farmers that care for them,” said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig in a press release on June 7.IDALS expanded HPAI testing requirements, which were already in place for poultry, to include dairy farms within a 12-mile radius of infected poultry sites. Naig said the goal is to better understand the possible spread of the virus and boost the agency’s ability to respond to future outbreaks. While there are no restrictions at this time for moving dairy cattle within Iowa, IDALS said the USDA’s federal order from April is still in effect. It requires negative tests for HPAI (H5N1) in lactating cows before they’re moved across state lines. Labs and state veterinarians are mandated to report positive test results to the USDA.On June 25, IDALS announced new testing requirements for dairy cattle to participate in fairs and livestock shows in the state. The order goes into effect July 1. Each lactating dairy cow will need to test negative for the H5N1 virus, no more than a week before arriving at an exhibition. A bulk milk sample representing the whole herd must also be taken, along with individual samples from up to five sick cows on a farm. The order also requires a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection for dairy cattle going to livestock shows and fairs.Producers are encouraged to bring their own milking equipment, and exhibitions will need to develop and implement biosecurity measures. Cattle from herds with H5N1 detections are banned from exhibitions until the order lifts. 2024 timeline of bird flu cases confirmed in IowaMay 28: A commercial egg-layer operation with 4.2 million chickens in Sioux County. This was the first case of bird flu in poultry for 2024. June 2: A commercial turkey operation with over 100,000 birds in Cherokee County.June 5: A dairy with 4,500 cattle in O’Brien County. This was the state’s first case of avian influenza infecting dairy cows.June 7: A dairy with 250 cattle in Sioux County.June 12: A dairy with 1,700 cattle in Sioux County.June 14: A dairy with 1,000 cattle in Sioux County; a dairy with 3,000 cattle in Plymouth County.June 15: A dairy with 520 cattle in Sioux County. June 17: A dairy with 10,000 cattle in Sioux County.June 19: A dairy with 100 cattle in Sioux County.June 20: A commercial turkey flock with over 46,000 birds in Sac County.June 21: A dairy in Sioux County with fewer than 50 cattle; a second dairy in Sioux County with 500.June 22: A dairy in Sioux County with 5,000 cattle.June 27: A dairy in Sioux County with 980 cattle; a second dairy in Sioux County with 2,500.The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said producers who suspect cases of avian influenza should contact their veterinarian immediately and report possible cases to the department at (515) 281-5305. Michael Leland The CDC says feed contaminated with feces from migratory birds is the most likely initial source of infection in dairy cows in the Texas panhandle, which lies in the Central Flyway. The agency suggests cow-to-cow transmission is possible, given that dairy cows in Michigan, Idaho, and Ohio tested positive for HPAI H5N1 after infected cattle from out of state were brought to the farms. Monitoring health and safety for livestock and peopleSince the end of March, more than 100 herds and several people in the U.S. have tested positive for avian influenza A (H5N1). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the risk to humans remains low, but people who interact with animals, raw milk and feces should wear personal protective equipment.Pat Gordon, a professor of veterinary medicine at Iowa State University, said during a June 19 webinar that people working with dairy cows should wear eye protection and gloves at a minimum."If you can do a mask, probably worthwhile, especially if you're in an area where there's a lot of milk splash. Be cognizant of where you're placing your hands before hand washing," said Gordon.The three dairy workers in the U.S. with confirmed H5N1 had eye infections. One also developed respiratory symptoms.Teri Bos, the director of Community Health Partners in Sioux County, said in early June that her office is working hard to monitor the health of farm workers and others who may be exposed to bird flu.“We follow up with those individuals for a period of time, really just monitoring if they have any symptoms,” Bos said. “At the national level, at the state level, but also at the county level, this is something that is an emerging illness and we are taking it very seriously.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is monitoring the national milk supply and dairy products, including baby formula, for the virus. The agency said pasteurization effectively inactivates H5N1 and warns against drinking raw milk.Several cats from a north Texas dairy farm became ill and died after drinking raw milk from infected cows in March.Federal supportThe USDA offers producers financial support for developing and implementing biosecurity plans and reimbursement for veterinary costs associated with sample collection for H5N1 testing. On July 1, the agency expanded its Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm Raised Fish Program – also called ELAP – to help cover lost profits from the H5N1 virus.Matt Russell, executive director of USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency, said it also creates an incentive to get tested.“Because if you are seeing some cows be sick and they happen to have H5N1, then this program kicks in and will provide some support for that loss,” said Russell.To be eligible for recovery assistance, producers need a positive test result from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. Dairy producers can apply at their county’s Farm Service Agency office.IDALS is requesting additional resources from the USDA.For farmers, this includes:Providing compensation for culled dairy cattle at fair market value.Revising poultry indemnity tables to better reflect the fair market value of the impacted birds and/or eggs.Presenting a streamlined and timely process for farmers to be compensated for lost production and to receive indemnity.For state response efforts:Authorizing additional epidemiological strike teams to assist with both poultry and dairy in Iowa.Providing additional USDA Wildlife Services personnel to assist in the surveying of disease in wildlife around Iowa poultry and dairy facilities.Accelerating funding for research to strengthen and enhance producer mitigation strategies.

The latest detection occurred on a third poultry farm near Melbourne. PDF FILE In recent weeks, Australia has faced a concerning outbreak of avian influenza, specifically the H7N3 strain. The latest detection occurred on a third poultry farm near Melbourne. While this news raises alarm, it’s important to understand that this strain is distinct from the one that has caused global concern and potential human transmission. Let’s delve into the details. The highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza has been found on four farms, while another virus, H7N9, has been detected on a fifth property in the last seven weeks in the state of Victoria. Australian farms have been quarantined. At least 580,000 birds have been culled as part of extensive biosecurity controls. Japan and the United States have temporarily banned poultry imports from Victoria as a precautionary measure. In Australia, some supermarkets are restricting the amount of eggs consumers can buy due to disruptions in the supply chain. Avian influenza is a viral disease found throughout the world. It spreads between birds or when contaminated animal feed and equipment are moved between areas. The outbreak Third farm affected: A third poultry farm, located just a few kilometers from the initial infection site, reported the presence of H7 avian influenza. Both the third farm and the first two affected farms share the same H7N3 strain. Notably, the second affected farm had a different strain, H7N9. Containment measures: Authorities have swiftly quarantined all three farms, implementing movement restrictions in the surrounding areas. Graeme Cooke, Victoria’s Chief Veterinarian, emphasized that detecting avian influenza on the additional property was expected due to ongoing surveillance within Restricted and Control Zones. Risk to Consumers: Fortunately, this outbreak poses no risk to consumers of eggs and poultry products. The government assures that the virus does not endanger human health through consumption. Historical Context Australia’s experience: Since 1976, Australia has encountered nine outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Each outbreak was successfully contained and eradicated. The H5N1 strain, a different variant of avian influenza, has caused widespread bird fatalities globally but has not led to significant human infections in Australia. Global impact: H5N1 has affected various bird species and even some mammals. It has infected three individuals in the United States and one person in Australia. Conclusion While vigilance remains crucial, it’s essential to differentiate between the H7N3 strain detected in Australia and the more globally concerning variants. Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely, and consumers can rest assured that their food supply remains safe. Sources: Available upon request. Continue after advertising.

All rights reserved Copyright Bob Edme/Copyright 2021 The AP. All rights reserved By Marta Iraola Iribarren Published on 11/06/2024 - 15:27 GMT+2Share this articleCommentsShare this articleFacebookTwitterFlipboardSendRedditMessengerLinkedinVK With outbreaks of avian influenza being reported in several countries across the world, the European Union has secured a batch of preventive vaccines to prepare for possible spread among humans. ADVERTISEMENTThe European Commission has joint purchased 665,000 pre-pandemic vaccine doses targeting avian influenza and taken an option for 40 million doses over the next four years, the executive announced today (11 June). The contract was signed by the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) on behalf of fifteen member states. “HERA is showing again the European Health Union in action by making sure that we are prepared,” a Commission spokesperson told a press conference in Brussels. While several outbreaks of avian influenza have been detected in farms across the globe, transmission to humans is still rare and limited to those in close contact with infected animals and contaminated spaces. One of the latest reports comes from Mexico, where a 59-year-old man died on 24 April after being infected with avian influenza H5N2, confirming the first human infection with this strain of the virus. Four other cases of human infections have been reported in the United States since 2022, three of them since the beginning of this year, all among dairy farm workers. The US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control assesses the current public health risk as low and is currently monitoring outbreaks in poultry and dairy cows. According to a press release, the European Commission is in contact with third countries' authorities to exchange information on the situation as well as measures for prevention and management. So far, no human-to-human infections have been reported anywhere, and the risk of zoonotic influenza transmission to the general public is considered low, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported. The Commission also said that there have been no reported active cases of avian influenza infection in humans in the EU. The first shipments of vaccines are already being prepared and will be sent to Finland for immediate vaccinations of workers at risk of exposure such as poultry farm workers and veterinarians. The fifteen member states participating in this purchase are doing so through the EU's Joint Procurement Agreement for Medical Countermeasures. This mechanism allows participating countries to jointly procure medical countermeasures on a voluntary and flexible basis. Such countermeasures include vaccines, therapeutics, and medical devices, and these can be used as an alternative or to complement any procurement at the national level.

She is the author of Runaway Medicine: What You Don’t Know May Kill You, and the cofounder of the California-based homeless work program Wheels of Change. At first glance, some of the expert reactions to the recent surge in bird flu virus cases, both in the U.S. and around the world, may appear contradictory. Isn’t a more urgent response required? How much livestock will be sacrificed? Is the risk to humans really so low that only moderate actions are called for? In truth, though, most of the basics are no longer in question among epidemiologists. This H5N1 virus is certainly spreading. Thousands of outbreaks have been documented in wild and farmed bird populations across all continents, spilling over into mammal populations. In the U.S. alone, bird flu has resulted in the death of more than 96 million birds in commercial and backyard flocks since February 2022, according to a USDA database. ‘The virus has proven its versatility’ Since 1997, sporadic H5N1 infections have been reported in humans in 24 countries, though relatively few cases were reported in recent years. After only one case in the U.S. in the previous 25 years, three farmworkers here have become infected over the past two months. So where do we go from here? That depends significantly, the experts say, on whether governments and those involved are willing to conduct enough testing and surveillance to know where things really stand, and whether the results of that testing will be timely and transparent. “I would like to see very widespread serologic testing done in humans—the farm workers, their family members, contacts,” says epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. (Serologic testing looks for antibodies in the blood.) “That way, we can see if we’ve had more transmission in humans that we’ve missed. We don’t have that right now.” “There are just so many things we don’t know, and it’s the unknowns that concern us more than what we know so far,” says Rick Bright, a virologist, pandemic expert, and former head of the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Without question, researchers say, the H5N1 virus, also known as bird flu or avian influenza, is surging among mammals and proving itself very versatile at jumping from species to species. That includes the recent surprising spread to dairy cattle in the U.S. since March, the first such instance on record. The virus has now been confirmed in cows in more than 85 herds with as many as 12 states affected. This geographic spread, along with high levels of exposure by workers at farms, slaughterhouses, milk processing facilities, and milk itself, is part of what has experts concerned that the virus will be found in more people. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has warned against drinking unpasteurized raw milk, which the CDC says may contain the H5N1 virus. “The virus has proven its versatility to infect about any mammal it comes in contact with,” says Bright. A recent H5N1 outbreak at a commercial egg farm in Iowa led to 4.2 million chickens being destroyed in order to prevent further spread. Multiple types of mammals have been infected, including domestic cats and dogs, red foxes, raccoons, bears, bobcats, and alpacas. Meanwhile, the presence of the H5N1 virus in house mice brings the virus literally closer to home, as rodents can be effective carriers. “When you have a bird flu virus infecting mammal species, that raises the question of the virus becoming more adaptive for mammalian transmission,” says Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There are distinct barriers that bird flu viruses face when they’re infecting mammals in terms of which receptors they use. So that has raised the stakes.” Whether that spread ultimately involves humans on a large scale is one of the unknowns. Among the three people who have been diagnosed in the U.S. since April, the most recent, a farm worker in Michigan, was the first from the current outbreak to exhibit mild upper respiratory symptoms. The respiratory piece concerns health experts because someone with H5N1 virus in their airways could be more likely to spread the virus, perhaps via cough. To date, there’s been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus, and the CDC says the current health risk to the general public is low. But as CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah noted at a Council on Foreign Relations event in May, “The risk here of something going from one or two sporadic [human] cases to becoming something of international concern (is) not insignificant.” Though infections in the three individuals with the current strain of H5N1 virus have been mild, the overall death rate in humans from H5N1 infections since it was first identified in the late 1990s is more than 50% among the more than 900 confirmed cases worldwide. And this H5N1 strain has caused some alarming effects in animals. Cats on a Texas farm died after drinking raw milk from bird-flu-infected cows, and test results showed “high amounts of virus” present in two felines’ brains and lungs who were tested. “It’s interesting that we’ve seen a lot of multi-organ involvement, brain involvement, major organ involvement that has been really remarkable causing the death of many of these different animal species. And we don’t understand that yet,” says Osterholm. Reuters recently reported that dairy cows in five states have died or been slaughtered because they did not recover from their infections, though the USDA says the majority of cows do recover. Should infection among cattle become more widespread, the potential cost to American farms is astronomical, as cows cost much more than chickens or turkeys to raise—ironically, one reason farmers may be reluctant to test them. “What we’re seeing right now in dairy cattle is just another situation where the potential for that virus to change is, I think, surely increased,” Osterholm says. The rise in severe illness among many of the species who’ve been infected by H5N1 is concerning, he notes, partly because it isn’t clear exactly why that has happened. “If you look at genetic sequences and look what the virus has done, we can’t explain that any one mutation has caused this to happen.” ‘We’re just sort of letting it go and spreading it in a very naive way’ The CDC recently confirmed the lethality of the H5N1 virus, isolated from a human infection in Texas, in ferrets that were experimentally infected with the same virus. All of those ferrets died, and Bright says scientists “found evidence that the virus had infected multiple internal organs such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys, and was also found in the brain and the blood.” The CDC said the findings underscore the potential for serious illness in people. Osterholm and others are advocating for increased urgency on the testing front. This is a multifaceted ask; it includes more widespread and continuous testing of farm animals, workers, and their close contacts—and in the case of dairy herds, ongoing testing of the milk supply and any meat that is directed to the food supply for human or animal consumption. It’s important to also test the farm environment, including equipment, transport vehicles, milking machines, and water systems that may be contaminated by disposal of infected milk. Raw milk from cows infected with bird flu has been found to contain astounding amounts of viral particles, according to a non-peer-reviewed study. (The FDA says our commercial supply of pasteurized milk remains safe to drink.) Serology testing, which Bright says has been essentially nonexistent, could help researchers better understand the true extent of H5N1’s spread, which in turn would enable more effective containment strategies. But in the U.S., where there is no single controlling agency or government body coordinating the effort, the result has been patchwork and uneven. “We’re not stopping it,” says Bright. “We’re not doing anything to keep that infected milk and infectious milk on the farm. We’re not testing these cows before they’re put back onto the milking line or sent to slaughter…We’re just sort of letting it go and spreading it in a very naive way.” At almost every turn, there are complications. Absent a federal mandate, most of the testing being done is voluntary. A USDA spokesman told me the agency provides voluntary testing and monitoring options, and has a program that reimburses dairy producers for collecting samples. But, Bright says, “we are finding that many farms don’t want to test because they are afraid that they’ll be shut down or suffer a significant economic loss that is not yet being compensated by federal programs.” As for the workers themselves, the CDC recommends that those in contact with infected or potentially infected animals, raw milk, etc. wear personal protective equipment (PPE), but only those exposed with flu-like symptoms should be tested (again, voluntarily). Further, most farmers want to work first with their county and state health agencies, preferring not to have federal health officials on their land. As of June 7, the CDC reported that only 45 people had been tested nationwide since March. A proactive testing and surveillance program would make rapid flu testing available at all farms, Adalja says. (Specific H5N1 tests don’t yet exist.) “We would be randomly testing cows all over, not just ones that appeared sick or ones that are transported from one state to another,” he adds. And experts have suggested pooled testing of milk from more cows on each farm in an effort to detect infected cows that might not show outward signs of infection. Sharing data quickly from cases of infected animals and people is critical, too, experts say. “The USDA is refusing to share the sequence data from the cows and the animals in a timely manner,” says Bright. “They have not shared a sequence that they collected from any infected animal in the last eight weeks.” And while the agency is sporadically submitting virus sequences to an international database, the data shared, Bright says, is largely from animals infected in March and early April. Federal officials say they will have access to millions of doses of vaccine, should they be needed, as part of their strategic national stockpile. A company contracted by the U.S. government, CSL Seqirus, confirmed that it will fill roughly 4.8 million doses of pre-pandemic vaccine “that is well matched to the H5 of the currently circulating H5N1 strain.” The federal, state, and local arms investigating and monitoring this strain of bird flu “have very collegial, collaborative, candid, discussions,” says Paul Friedrichs, the White House director of the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy. “We don’t always agree, which is exactly what you expect from a complex situation, but what we always do is get to a decision and move out on it.” For now, though, the researchers are consistent in their refrain about what’s needed: heightened surveillance and testing, testing, testing. “It is going to adapt,” Rick Bright says of H5N1. “We’ve watched it adapt over the years among bird species, and we know it’s what influenza viruses do.” The time to get ahead of that evolution, experts say, is now.

Advanced Search Moderna shares positive late-stage results for COVID-19/flu combination vaccine The combined vaccine approach could simplify immunisation practices and lead to higher uptake Moderna has shared positive late-stage results for its investigational combination vaccine against influenza and COVID-19. The ongoing phase 3 trial has been evaluating the candidate, mRNA-1083, in two age-group cohorts of approximately 4,000 adults each. One cohort has been comparing mRNA-1083 to Sanofi’s enhanced Fluzone HD flu vaccine co-administered with Moderna’s standalone COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax in adults aged 65 years and older, while the other has been comparing the combination vaccine to GSK’s standard dose Fluarix flu vaccine in adults aged 50 to 64 years, also given alongside Spikevax. The immune responses from a single dose of mRNA-1083 were found to be non-inferior versus the co-administered comparators, Moderna said, adding that mRNA-1083 elicited statistically significantly higher immune responses against three influenza virus strains and against SARS-CoV-2 in both groups. The company also reported that mRNA-1083 showed an acceptable tolerability and safety profile, with the majority of solicited adverse reactions consistent with the vaccines used in the trial. The combined vaccine approach could alleviate the impact of both COVID-19 and flu while offering a combined administration, potentially simplifying immunisation practices for healthcare providers as well as patients. Stéphane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, said: “Combination vaccines have the potential to reduce the burden of respiratory viruses on health systems and pharmacies, as well as offer people more convenient vaccination options that could improve compliance and provide stronger protection from seasonal illnesses.” Bancel added that Moderna is the only company with positive phase 3 data for a flu/COVID-19 combination vaccine. The company said it is planning to present the phase 3 data for mRNA-1083 at an upcoming medical conference and will “engage with regulators on next steps”. The readout comes just over a week after Moderna’s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to protect adults aged 60 years and older against lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The vaccine, mRESVIA, is now the only RSV vaccine available in single-dose pre-filled syringes and the first mRNA vaccine to receive approval for a disease other than COVID-19.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link Online Bureau , ETHealthWorld Updated On Jun 12, 2024 at 03:27 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals New Delhi: US based vaccine developer, Moderna announced the Phase III trial data for its COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine, mRNA-1083. The data suggest that the vaccine has potential to counter infectious diseases, says GlobalData, a data-analysis company. In the study the investigational combination mRNA vaccine generated statistically higher immune responses in comparison to the licensed comparator vaccines used in the randomised, observer-blind, active control study among 8,000 adults aged 50 years and older. Moderna in the trials reported that a single dose of mRNA-1083 met immunogenicity non-inferiority criteria versus the licensed comparator vaccines: Fluzone high-dose and Fluarix for influenza, and Spikevax for COVID-19, and has generated higher immune responses against the influenza strains including H1N1, H3N2, and B/Victoria, as well as SARS-CoV-2. The investigational combination vaccine displayed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with the most commonly reported adverse reactions being injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Advt The development comes less than two weeks after Moderna’s FDA approval of the first mRNA respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, mRESVIA, further demonstrating the potential of mRNA technology in combating infectious diseases.Commenting over it an expert Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst, GlobalData said, “The development of a COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine could be advantageous to patients, as it would decrease the number of injections needed to provide sufficient protection against multiple respiratory illnesses. The development of a combination vaccine is strategic for pharmaceutical companies, as successful uptake of the vaccine can translate to significant market shares under multiple indications.”“If approved, Moderna’s COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine will be an important addition to the vaccines market. The positive Phase III data provides further validation of how mRNA technology is advancing the infectious diseases pipeline,” Kurdach added. Many experts have expressed positive opinions on the development of a COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine, as well as the advancement of vaccines for infectious diseases due to mRNA technology considering that mRNA vaccines require a shorter production time, have the potential to incorporate large numbers of antigens, and may therefore be more efficacious than traditional vaccines.

Posted inPublic Health New CDC head uses COVID-era innovations to tackle bird flu outbreak Mandy Cohen, former N.C. DHHS secretary, leads federal response to the spread of avian influenza among dairy cows, farm workers by Jaymie Baxley June 12, 2024June 12, 2024 FacebookTwitterLinkedInEmail Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks during the Association of Health Care Journalists’ 2024 conference in Manhattan on June 6. Credit: Jaymie Baxley/NC Health News By Jaymie Baxley Mandy Cohen, who led North Carolina’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is facing her first major test as director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — rising concerns about the spread of avian influenza. Cases of H5N1, a strand of what is popularly known as bird flu, have been confirmed in North Carolina and 11 other states, affecting more than 80 herds of dairy cattle since March. The outbreak has led to a handful of human infections; at least three farm workers in Texas and Michigan contracted the virus through exposure to sick cows. Although the exact origin of the outbreak is unknown, the CDC believes it was caused by cows ingesting “feed contaminated with feces from wild birds” that were infected with the virus. Hundreds of thousands of animals in the Southern Hemisphere have died after being exposed to H5N1, which is carried by migratory birds that can carry the virus without getting as sick. There have been no documented cases of avian influenza spreading from person to person, but that could change as the virus evolves. On June 5, the World Health Organization reported that a new strand, H5N2, had been linked to the death of a Mexico City man who had no known exposure to infected livestock. Cohen was appointed last July to run the CDC. Before that, she served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services from 2017 to 2021. She addressed on June 6 the possibility of the H5N1 outbreak becoming an epidemic during her participation in the Association of Health Care Journalists’ annual conference in Manhattan. “What we’re seeing right now is different than what we were experiencing when we first experienced COVID,” she said. “Avian flu is something we’ve been studying and preparing for for decades, as opposed to COVID, which is a completely novel virus: … we did not have tests, we did not have treatment, we did not have vaccines.” Using COVID tools The CDC is better equipped to handle H5N1, according to Cohen. She said the agency has tests that can detect it, antiviral drugs to treat infection and “multiple vaccine candidates waiting in the wings.” “What is also different in this moment are tools that we built for COVID, we’re using for avian things — like our ability to get real time information about what’s happening in every emergency room in the country,” Cohen said. She added that 90 percent of hospitals provide the agency with real-time data that help scientists spot “unusual patterns” in virus cases. Make more sense of the health care system.

Δ North Carolina’s syndromic surveillance system, NC DETECT, tracks people who report to emergency departments complaining of flu-like illnesses, among other symptoms. The system played a major role during the pandemic of feeding information to state and federal officials in tracking the progress of COVID along with flu. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaks during the Association of Health Care Journalists’ 2024 conference in Manhattan on June 6. Credit: Jaymie Baxley/NC Health News Cohen said wastewater monitoring systems created to track the spread of the coronavirus are now being used to map cases of avian influenza. In North Carolina, DHHS’ wastewater tracking system aggregates data from dozens of sewage sites across the state, keeping tabs on the average number of virus particles per person. According to the DHHS website, the system collects wastewater samples twice per week, then performs laboratory analysis to determine the amount of virus present. While wastewater monitoring systems were used to track COVID, they can be tweaked to track other diseases where people shed virus in their feces, such as influenza. Cohen also said CDC staff are using a “beefed-up genomic program” to see “how the virus is changing and how we might need to step up our response.” Focus on farmers Avian influenza currently poses a low risk to the general public, Cohen said, in part because it’s not transmitted from person to person and in part because of the prior preparation. Some critics have said, though, that the CDC is moving too slowly to get ready and needs to be more aggressive about tracking the virus and getting tools to states. Cohen said it’s important to “stay ahead of this virus” by continuously testing cattle and monitoring farm workers who have been exposed to infected animals. “The folks who are at risk for avian are the farm workers who are coming into contact with sick animals, whether that be poultry or dairy cattle,” she said. “We want to make sure we have the right protective equipment for them to protect themselves.” One challenge the CDC faces in curtailing the H5N1 outbreak is getting dairy farmers to test their cattle or workers for avian influenza — something they are not legally required to do. Cohen said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is offering financial incentives and indemnity programs to encourage testing, tactics that have been “very successful in the poultry space” during past periods of increased bird flu activity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a letter to state, local and tribal governments on June 6 underscoring the risks associated with consuming raw, unpasteurized milk from dairy cows. All milk from herds affected by H5N1, the FDA wrote, has the potential to contain the virus, representing a “potential route of consumer exposure.” Cohen said the CDC “will continue to communicate as much as we know, often, as things may change.” KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST In rural Avery County, Helene washed away one of the only dental clinics by Jaymie Baxley November 11, 2024November 11, 2024 Black Americans still suffer worse health.

All milk from herds affected by H5N1, the FDA wrote, has the potential to contain the virus, representing a “potential route of consumer exposure.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Cohen said the CDC “will continue to communicate as much as we know, often, as things may change.”</p> <p>This &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2024/06/12/cdc-director-tackles-bird-flu/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org&quot;&gt;North Carolina Health News&lt;/a&gt; and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-favicon02.jpg?fit=150%2C150&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; style=&quot;width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;republication-tracker-tool-source&quot; src=&quot;https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/?republication-pixel=true&amp;post=54371&quot; style=&quot;width:1px;height:1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt; PARSELY = { autotrack: false, onload: function() { PARSELY.beacon.trackPageView({ url: &quot;https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2024/06/12/cdc-director-tackles-bird-flu/&quot;, urlref: window.location.href }); } } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;script id=&quot;parsely-cfg&quot; src=&quot;//cdn.parsely.com/keysorthcarolinahealthnews.org/p.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p> Copy to Clipboard 1 Tagged: agriculture, avian influenza, bird flu, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19, farm workers and pandemic, H5N1, livestock, Mandy Cohen, NC Department of Health and Human Services, world health organization Jaymie Baxley Jaymie Baxley reports on rural health and Medicaid for NC Health News.

Frustrated NC Mom says: June 15, 2024 at 15:12 These numbers, especially in NC, are way lower than what is really going on out here in the “real” world because healthcare providers are NOT ASKING questions that could identify possible cases of avian flu and they sure AREN’T TESTING for it! My daughter’s last day of school was June 7th. I can’t tell you how many new migrant workers’ children enrolled in her school spring semester, even into the last week of school…and they don’t speak English at all so they were not born in the U.S. and you can tell they literally just got here. Monday morning (6/10) my daughter woke up with her left eye crusted shut. Tuesday morning my 3 yr old woke up the same way so I took them to the Dr. They also have a new cough. Not once was I asked anything that could possibly signal a red flag that it’s anything other than pink eye. The discharge wasn’t tested to see if it’s bacterial, viral or allergic conjunctivitis. They weren’t tested for covid, avian flu, anything. My dad is a farmer. We live in the country…there’s birds and bird poop everywhere and my kids spend a significant amount of time outside. The eye drops that I have to give them every 3 hours around the clock for 7 days don’t really seem to be doing much and the cough isn’t getting any better either. It was the exact same way when covid started except in this circumstance, we already know there’s a problem! I’m not sure if the government is saying don’t test because we don’t want to sound alarm bells or if nobody is testing because they’re failing to use common sense??? I guess we will never know until it reaches pandemic level…when we could be heading it off before it gets that bad! Comments are closed.

By: Simon Shaykhet Posted and last updated (WXYZ) — Experts at Michigan State University are raising awareness about a growing numbers of avian flu cases impacting herds of dairy cows. It affects everyone from the farm to our community grocery stores.For that reason, experts are now paying extra attention to what’s happening.Shoppers at Johnny Pomodoro’s on Middlebelt Road in Farmington Hills say daily deals and a variety of top products are just two reasons to keep coming back. While she was checking out the ice cream section, I asked shopper Janice Gordon how she chooses her milk, and how much she prioritizes value.Gordon says it's "very important" that prices stay low.Her answer resonating with James Averill who oversees farming operations at Michigan State University and keeping cows healthy.“We are good. We have not had a case. We are continuing to watch the situation closely," said Averill. Averill telling me since late March, farmers in Michigan have felt growing concern about ability to keep pumping out milk supply after cases of dairy cows being infected with HPAI, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza.“They have to do some diagnostic testing to get verification that an animal has influenza," said Averill, explaining the process. Officially, according to MSU expert Phil Durst, May 1 marked day one of the onset of the avian flu on a farm in Michigan.A farmer reporting infection within a herd of 500 cows, and since then more cases. Symptoms can possibly include a spike in body temperature, decreased rumination, less water intake and severe dehydration, and requiring medical help. “We don’t know all the ways to prevent transmission or what the future course of the disease is," said Durst. I asked Durst about efforts made to treat the cows and what milk consumers can expect.He says all pasteurized milk products remain safe for consumption, but he adds costs could eventually rise with less milk flowing into cartons. On whether it could mutate and spread faster, Durst says it's unclear. Steps are also being taken to minimize risk of spread to other animals and workers on farms by separating cows. Frequent hand washing, wearing safety eyewear and changing clothing, among measures being encouraged in the event of a case to reduce chance of further spread.And for grocery stores, there’s also the matter of keeping costs down. General manager David Kouza says Johnny’s, which is family owned, works with multiple farms to keep inventory stocked."There are other vendors we can use. So, if that does or doesn’t happen you just have to deal with it," said Kouza. He adds, “there’s always an alternative. You aren’t going to be out of it.”For Gordon, staying informed is important as a shopper and supporter of this family owned business.She say her trust in the products and confidence in our state’s tracking of cases helps make it easy to check milk off the grocery list.Durst says most cows do recover from illness, however providing extra care is extremely important.

A new "dual mutant" strain of H1N1 influenza could pose a threat in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Details about the two strains, I223V and S247N, were published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, which is published by the CDC. At least two cases of the flu mutations have been confirmed in humans in the U.S., the agency announced on Wednesday. COVID-FLU COMBO VACCINE SHOWS ‘POSITIVE’ RESULTS IN PHASE 3 TRIALS, MODERNA SAYS: A 'TWO-FOR' OPTION The researchers identified a total of 101 samples of the "dual mutant" virus. The concern is that these strains of flu have shown to be resistant to the antiviral medications that are typically used to treat the virus — notably Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the common flu medication from Switzerland-based Roche. A new "dual mutant" strain of H1N1 influenza could pose a threat in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (iStock)"In laboratory tests, these viruses were found to be about 13 to 16 times less sensitive to oseltamivir than those without this combination of mutations," a CDC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "For perspective, another mutation called H275Y makes the virus 500 to 1,000 times less sensitive to oseltamivir in the laboratory test."CDC, WEBMD GIVE UPDATE ON CURRENT BIRD FLU OUTBREAK: ‘BE ALERT, NOT ALARMED’ Given that these mutated viruses were still sensitive to other anti-influenza medications, including baloxavir marboxil, the CDC spokesperson said that "there are no immediate implications to change decisions for clinical care." "Our study highlights the need to closely monitor the evolution of dual mutants, because additional changes may further affect susceptibility to antiviral drugs or provide a competitive advantage over circulating wild-type viruses," the researchers wrote in the study findings.The strains have been detected in 15 countries across five continents, but are mostly prevalent in Europe, the study found. "The dual mutants that we tested retained susceptibility to other approved influenza antiviral drugs, including baloxavir," the researchers wrote. (iStock)The researchers determined that the mutations have been circulating globally since May 2023. I223V and S247N were first tested by Hong Kong scientists, who published their findings in The Lancet Microbe in March 2024. Those researchers also found that the mutant strains lessened the effectiveness of Tamiflu.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, said it is "highly unusual" to see an influenza A strain (H1N1, which is a distant cousin of the Spanish flu, he noted) spreading throughout southern U.S. states at this time of year. People who contract the flu can take antiviral medications to ease symptoms, the CDC stated, which is most important for high-risk patients. (iStock) "Flu season is usually over by March," Siegel told Fox News Digital. "Flu doesn't spread as easily in hot, humid weather."He added, "This mutation worries me because the use of Tamiflu — especially in high-risk groups and the elderly — is really helpful at decreasing severity, and it looks like the reaction to it is less." CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERThe doctor said he would still recommend using the drug, however, because it has some impact — "or consider other anti-flu drugs." Siegel also advised a vaccine booster for the elderly or those in high-risk groups. So far this season, the CDC estimates that there have been at least 35 million illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from the flu, as published on the agency’s website. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older receives an annual vaccine during heightened flu spread.

"It is important to continue monitoring the spread … and the evolution of these viruses, as they may acquire other mutations that could further impact the usefulness of oseltamivir or other antiviral medications."

By: Olivia Pageau Posted Olivia Pageau I'm your Jackson neighborhood reporter. As someone who was born and raised in Jackson, I'm so excited to be sharing our story with the rest of mid-Michigan. Video shows Kimmie Garrett, a nine-year-old girl from Jackson who recently lost her legs and parts of her hands, due to medical complications that stemmed from Influenza A.Parents, John and SharRonnie Garrett say that she almost lost her life during a brain procedure, but miraculously recovered.Kimmie still enjoys art and sports and is looking forward to learning and adapting to those hobbies without her hands or legs."The worst news you want to hear is that you have a couple of hours of life left with your child," says John Garrett. This news came to him and his wife ShaRonnie in February when their 9-year-old daughter caught Influenza A.Kimmie's case of Influenza led the family down a tumultuous road of medical complications. From heart attacks to multiple strokes, and a brain hemorrhage that led to a procedure doctors thought may have been her last. "We were given the option to either let her pass away in bed or pass away on the operating table, and I just asked the neurosurgeon to try," says John.In what her parents are calling a miracle, Kimmie survived. However, a loss of oxygen to Kimmie's hands and feet left doctors with no choice. Kimmie shares, "I got very sick. My hands and feet got really black. Then, they were no good anymore, so they had to go." Now, after fighting for her life, this nine-year-old girl is fighting for the life she's always wanted. Kimmie is now adapting to her love of sports and art, just in a new way. "It's been amazing to see," says SharRonnie, "to see Kimmie come out of the ICU and do all these things we were told she probably wouldn't be able to do." John adds, "She didn't lose her personality. She didn't lose her memory. Those things were most important to us. Yes, she's lost a lot, (but) to keep that was just so amazing." A story that is unimaginable for any kid, but nothing Kimmie couldn't handle. "I felt brave," she says. "Cause I trusted the process." Kimmie is most looking forward to learning to play basketball again, and plans on getting prosthetics in SeptemberKimmie's advice: Get your flu shot Want to see more local news?

The patient had exposure to poultry at home and in the surroundings. There were no known persons reporting symptoms of respiratory illness in the family, the neighbourhood, or among healthcare workers at health facilities. This is the second case, the first one was reported in 2019. NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization on Tuesday reported that a case of human infection with Avian Influenza A(H9N2) virus has been detected in a child residing in West Bengal.India's International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) on May 22 informed the WHO about a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus in a 4-year-old child living in the state of West Bengal.She was previously diagnosed with hyperreactive airway disease, initially presented to the paediatrician with fever and abdominal pain on 26 January 2024 then on February 2, the patient tested positive for influenza B and adenovirus at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the local government hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital on February 28, as per WHO.But on March 3, with a recurrence of severe respiratory distress, he was referred to another government hospital and was admitted to the pediatric ICU and intubated. After several tests, the patient on March 5 was tested positive for influenza A (not sub-typed) and rhinovirus. The same sample was sent to the National Influenza Centre at the National Institute of Virology in Pune for subtyping. On April 26, the sample was sub-typed as influenza A(H9N2) through a real-time polymerase chain reaction. On 1 May, the patient was discharged from the hospital with oxygen support. Information on the vaccination status and details of antiviral treatment were not available at the time of reporting.According to the WHO, the patient had exposure to poultry at home and in the surroundings. There were no known persons reporting symptoms of respiratory illness in the family, the neighbourhood, or among healthcare workers at health facilities attended by the case at the time of reporting. The child has recovered and been released from the hospital. This marks the second human case of avian influenza A(H9N2) reported to WHO by India, with the first occurring in 2019.As per the IHR (2005), "a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO." The majority of human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection occur through exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. These infections typically result in mild clinical illness.Given the available information, additional sporadic human cases may occur, as this virus is among the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry across various regions. Based on the current evidence, WHO assesses the present public health risk posed by this virus to the general population as low. However, this risk assessment is subject to revision should new epidemiological or virological information become available.About the AuthorTOI News DeskThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Here's everything you need to know. First H5N2 human case has been reported in India since 2019. Image courtesy: Adobe Stock Published by Arushi Bidhuri Published On: 12 Jun 2024, 04:07 pm IST 232 Channel ChannelAfter a bird flu outbreak affected a person in the United States earlier in 2024, a case of bird flu, caused by the H9N2 virus, has been detected in a four-year-old in India’s West Bengal region. The child was reported to have severe respiratory issues, high fever, and abdominal cramps, and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a local hospital. The patient was discharged three months after diagnosis and treatment, according to the report by the World Health Organization (WHO). This is the second case of human infection of the bird flu in India, after 2019.What is the H5N2 virus?Avian influenza or bird flu refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu). This flu is highly contagious and deadly for domestic and wild birds. Avian influenza A viruses infect birds have evolved into distinct genetic lineages based on the geographic lineages, including H5N. Hemagglutinin, or H, which is essential for the virus to infect cells, and neuraminidase, or N, which aids in the virus’ dissemination, are the two types of surface proteins that are used to categorize the viruses. It is a member of the H5 family of bird flu viruses, which mostly affects wild birds. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that there are nine distinct H5 virus subtypes.First human case of H5N2 virus reported in India. Image courtesy: Adobe stockBird flu continues to riseOther types of avian influenza, including H5N1, have been spreading. Earlier in June 2024, the central government of India issued an advisory on H5N1 or avian influenza (bird flu) warning states and the Union territories (UT) to be on the lookout for any unusual cases among people or deaths in animals or poultry. The affected states are Andhra Pradesh (Nellore district), Maharashtra (Nagpur district), Jharkhand (Ranchi district) and Kerala (Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts).The United States (US) has also reported a bird flu outbreak, which has raised concerns and panic among people. With cases of avian influenza on the rise, health experts have warned people to be vigilant, be careful, and take appropriate action to fight the deadly infection.Can H5N2 infection spread to humans?A type of viral infection, bird flu or avian influenza infects birds but can also affect humans. H5N2 virus generally circulates among animals, but it can also affect humans, states a report by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is believed that the primary cause of infections in humans is through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. These infections may trigger mild to severe symptoms that affect your respiratory tract and can be fatal. Patients may experience symptoms such as conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalopathy (a group of conditions that cause brain dysfunction), and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain tissues).Also Read: Is it safe to consume milk, eggs and other animal products during a bird flu outbreak?Symptoms of H5N2 bird flu in humansHere are some of the signs and symptoms of bird flu you should watch out for: High fever Headache Cough Shivers Muscle ache Shortness of breath Fatigue Runny nose Sore throatSymptoms may get worse in some cases, which may include: Diarrhea Nausea Stomach pain Respiratory distress or failure Pneumonia Nose and gums bleeding Conjunctivitis and ink eye Pain in the chest Changes in behavior and thinking Seizures (in severe cases)How is H5N2 bird flu treated?H5N2 bird flu, like other strains of avian influenza, is primarily managed through some preventive measures that help fight off the infection. Here are some ways that can help:1. Antiviral medicationMedicines such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) may help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. These medicines inhibit the replication of the virus, helping you reduce the severity. Additionally, your healthcare provider may give you cough suppressants and other medicines that may help manage respiratory symptoms.2. Stay hydratedDoctors recommend drinking plenty of fluids to help the body recover from any type of flu, including H5N2. Hydration helps prevent dehydration, which can lead to complications.Drink plenty of water to protect yourself against H5N2 virus. Image courtesy: Freepik3. Practice good hygieneGood hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals or birds is vital to prevent the virus from spreading.4. Take vaccineVaccination is a key preventive measure for avian influenza. While the effectiveness may vary against specific strains like H5N2, it is best to get vaccinated against the infection. Make sure you connect with your healthcare provider to get the right vaccine.5. Take plenty of restYou should take adequate rest to help the body recover from any type of flu, including the H5N2 virus. Taking adequate rest allows the body to focus its energy on fighting the infection.It is imperative to check with your healthcare provider as the treatment protocols may vary from one individual to another. It could be decided, depending on the severity of the illness.Get latest updates on health and wellness along with Health News Related Topics: healthAbout The Author Arushi Bidhuri Arushi Bidhuri is a journalist with 7 years of experience in writing, editing, and conceptualizing story ideas across different genres, including health and wellness, lifestyle, politics, beauty, fashion, and more.

This is the first case of H9N2 or bird flu in India since 2019.The child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of a local hospital due to persistent severe respiratory issues, high fever and abdominal cramps in February, and was discharged three months later after diagnosis and treatment, the WHO said.The child was exposed to poultry at home and in his surroundings, but there was no known person reporting symptoms of respiratory illness among his family and other contacts.The patient tested positive for influenza B and adenovirus at the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the local government hospital in February.On March 3, with a recurrence of severe respiratory distress, he was referred to another government hospital and was admitted to the pediatric ICU and intubated.Two days later, a nasopharyngeal swab was sent to the Kolkata Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory and tested positive for influenza A (not sub-typed) and rhinovirus. The same sample was sent to the National Influenza Centre at the National Institute of Virology in Pune for subtyping.On April 26, the sample was sub-typed as influenza A(H9N2) through a real-time polymerase chain reaction.On May 1, the child was discharged from the hospital with oxygen support.First human case of 'bird flu' reported in Australia in a child who acquired it while in IndiaInformation on the vaccination status and details of antiviral treatment were not available at the time of reporting, the WHO said.Further sporadic human cases could occur as this virus is one of the most prevalent avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry in different regions.According to Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, former president Indian Medical Association (IMA), Cochin, said that it is important to understand that infection by this particular virus is known to be largely mild not only in birds, but also in humans.This is unlike other bird flu viruses like H5N1 which can cause up to 50% mortality in man, he said.“More than the possibility of severe illness, the concern here is if this virus infects human beings along with another human influenza virus at the same time, mixing of genetic material could occur, creating influenza viruses that never existed before. Therefore, it is important to minimise human infection from bird flu by avoiding contact with poultry, especially during times of a bird flu outbreak in the region,” he told this paper.Bird flu outbreaks in domestic poultry are common, mainly because of visiting migratory birds that share a common food and water source with poultry.“These visitors bring different types of bird flu viruses with them, and this cannot be stopped. Culling of infected poultry is the standard practice to reduce spread. Vaccine against H9N2 in poultry has been developed. It is important to avoid panic but at the same time to follow precautions while handling poultry,” he said.“We should keep a close surveillance of the Genome of the virus. This will help us track the movement of the virus across the world and also monitor the changes that occur with time,” he further said.According to the International Health Regulations, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact and must be notified to the WHO.The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention explains the bird flu infection as a type of infection caused by avian influenza Type A viruses. Usually, it is expected to affect wild aquatic birds, domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. However, human cases of bird flu infection are not unusual and have been reported in the past.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestBird fluShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

More than half a million chickens have been euthanised in an effort to stop the spread of the disease.A 24-egg limit applies at Coles stores everywhere except Western Australia.The supermarket said it was temporary but did not reveal how long it was expected to last.“We are working closely with all of our suppliers to ensure eggs remain available for our customers and we are providing support to the industry in responding to the avian flu cases in Victoria,” a Coles spokesperson said.3:51There's more than one bird flu: what recent outbreaks mean for Australia – videoWoolworths does not have any limits on egg purchases and no other national stores have publicised limits.The peak body representing egg producers, Australian Eggs, said the egg supply was not at risk and purchase limits “can send the wrong message to consumers”.“These avian influenza incidents will cause some disruption to egg supply as retailers reorganise their supply, but purchase limits or patchy supermarket shelves do not indicate a nationwide shortage,” said Australian Eggs’ managing director, Rowan McMonnies. “We know many Australians rely on eggs as a staple and it might be concerning to see signs of a shortage, but we want consumers to know that only a small part of the industry has been impacted by [avian influenza] and other egg farms are working hard to ensure over 18 million eggs continue to be available every day.”The H7N3 outbreak was first detected at a large egg farm near Meredith on 22 May, and the H7N9 strain was detected at another egg farm in Terang, 130km south-west, two days later. The properties were linked through contact tracing and Victoria’s chief veterinary officer, Dr Graeme Cooke, said on Friday that the detections were not unexpected and “shows that Agriculture Victoria’s comprehensive and ongoing surveillance activities are working well to date”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Control areas were set up around each property. Chickens at three other properties within the 5km restricted zone or broader 15km control area surrounding the site of the first outbreak were identified as having H7N3 last week. Under Australia’s guidelines for managing high pathogenicity avian influenza, all birds at all affected properties were euthanised and their carcasses safely disposed of.The purchasing restriction by Coles follows the Victorian Farmers Federation warning that the outbreak may have an impact on egg supplies. In a statement, the VFF vice-president and an egg farmer, Danyel Cucinotta, said: “We’re anticipating a flow-on impact to egg supplies in the coming week and are working as hard as possible to maintain availability.“My advice is to shop around at your local grocer, market or small independent store to buy your eggs.”The acting chief executive of the Australian Chicken Growers Council, Dr Joanne Sillince, said any egg supply issues were a “short-term blip that will resolve itself very quickly”.“You have got a whole bunch of new pullets coming into production every week,” she said, referring to young hens. “I think Coles may have moved out of an abundance of caution.”To date the virus has not been detected on farms that only produce chicken meat. The first property at Meredith was a mixed egg and chicken production business.Avian influenza is primarily spread through the wild bird population, making free-range birds more at risk. Most of the infections to date have been at free-range egg producers.“Most of our meat chickens are grown indoors,” Sillince said.Agriculture Victoria has issued a housing requirement for all birds within the restricted and controlled areas around Meredith and Terang, which requires all poultry farmers, back yard chicken owners and those with pet birds to keep them enclosed in cages or sheds.Avian flu said to hit over 40 cattle at Minnesota farm: ‘Only a matter of time’Read moreThe control area stretches almost all the way to Ballarat and Geelong. Those who breach the order, including back yard chicken owners, face potential fines.Cooke said all bird owners in the state were “reminded to follow best biosecurity practice such as keeping poultry sheds, yards, aviaries and equipment clean”.Avian vets have been urging Australia’s back yard bird owners for months to adopt biosecurity measures to protect their flocks.Sillince said the outbreak management so far had been “really fantastic”, with authorities and farmers identifying and destroying new infected flocks before the virus had time to develop.Australian authorities were on high alert for signs of bird flu due to the global outbreak of H5N1, a different strain of high pathogenicity avian influenza, which has yet to be detected in birds in Australia.Agriculture Victoria has repeatedly assured consumers that eggs and poultry products are safe to consume.

Those who breach the order, including back yard chicken owners, face potential fines.Cooke said all bird owners in the state were “reminded to follow best biosecurity practice such as keeping poultry sheds, yards, aviaries and equipment clean”.Avian vets have been urging Australia’s back yard bird owners for months to adopt biosecurity measures to protect their flocks.Sillince said the outbreak management so far had been “really fantastic”, with authorities and farmers identifying and destroying new infected flocks before the virus had time to develop.Australian authorities were on high alert for signs of bird flu due to the global outbreak of H5N1, a different strain of high pathogenicity avian influenza, which has yet to be detected in birds in Australia.Agriculture Victoria has repeatedly assured consumers that eggs and poultry products are safe to consume.

The affected child from Kaliachak, treated at Malda and NRS Medical College, tested negative for H9N2 strain. KOLKATA: There was no avian influenza threat in Bengal and the case detected in Malda is the lone one in the state so far. The assurance came from state health officials and animal resource development officials, who clearly said there was no reason to panic and that there was no advisory, restricting the consumption of poultry products, such as chicken, egg and duck meat.âWe sent the samples of the child from Malda twice to National Institute of Virology Pune for genomic sequencing. The test in March confirmed the presence of H9N2 strain of avian influenza, which has a very low capability of human-to-human transmission. The follow-up test in April showed the child was no more positive to the virus,â said state principal health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam on Thursday, clearing the air about bird flu incidence in Bengal. The affected child, a resident of Kaliachak, was treated both at Malda Medical College and NRS Medical College for respiratory illness. Samples of the childâs family members as well as close contacts were also tested and none was found positive to the virus. A health team visited the Malda locality on Thursday for another round of surveillance.Officials said tests on samples of birds, like chicken and duck, were also being conducted and so far, no trace of avian influenza was found. âWe have analysed 390 bird samples from Malda and avian influenza was found in none. Bengal has a strong surveillance system under which, we collect 30,000 serum samples every year from across the state and test them at the lab at Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Belgachhia. Between April and June, 1,728 samples were tested and none was positive to avian influenza,â said Vivek Kumar, additional chief secretary, ARD department. Of those samples, 30% were also sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Disease Bhopal for re-evaluation and the results again showed no presence of avian influenza. âThere is no scope for confusion or fear. There is no need for advisory on restricting the consumption of chicken, egg or duck meat,â added Kumar.Another child, a resident of Melbourne, had tested positive to avian influenza in May, after returning there with H5N1 strain. âWe held active surveillance by a multidisciplinary team in that locality, which the child visited in Kolkata in Feb. None of his contacts tested positive to the virus. There is no trace of human-to-human transmission. There is no reason to panic,â added Nigam.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make vrat-friendly Coconut Peanut Chutney at homeFoodHow to make your 'Curry patta' plant grow fasterLifestyle10 plants that can be grown without soil (you only need water!)Lifestyle10 countries known for their wildlifetravelâ10 things you should never say to an older personâLifestyleâ10 stunningly beautiful parrots in the worldâLifestyle10 most iconic animals from the world of fiction and literatureLifestyle10 animals that live in waterLifestyle10 types of vegetable-based cheela for healthy breakfastFood8 signs a child is smarter than averageLifestyle Next123 Photostories Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showâBigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8â5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Top 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

(Supplied)abc.net.auews/egg-shortage-victorian-chicken-farmer-supermarket-limit/103962690Link copiedShareShare articleIn short: Egg farmers near the avian influenza outbreak area in south-west Victoria have been permitted to deliver some stockpiled eggs. Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt said around 1 million hens had been euthanased or otherwise affected, representing around 4 per cent of the national flock. What's next? The Farmers Federation says it wouldn't be surprised to see more infected farms near the outbreak zone.As supermarkets across the nation began rationing eggs, the storage room at Wes Humpage's western Victorian farm was reaching capacity.Mr Humpage runs a free-range egg farm in the tiny town of Maude, around half an hour north-west of Geelong.A further 15 minutes up the road is Meredith, where four egg farms are confirmed to have the high pathogenicity H7N3 strain of avian influenza.The avian outbreak in Victoria put the clamps on Mr Humpage's family-owned operation last week, although there had been no trace of the virus among the pasture-raised birds on his property."The order that we received last Tuesday night really threw everyone into a bit of a scramble, you know," Mr Humpage told ABC Victorian Mornings. That order was to hold all eggs on his farm for at least 28 days from the first recorded case of avian influenza (AI) in May. At the same time, Coles supermarkets across Australia, with the exception of WA, had put a limit on the number of eggs that shoppers could take home."It was a real shock when we know that we don't have AI on our farm," Mr Humpage said. The hens at the Humpages' farm in Maude have not tested positive for avian influenza (Supplied: Wes' Eggs)That order was reversed on Tuesday morning. Mr Humpage and his wife Amanda hopped straight in their sanitised delivery van to deliver their eggs. "We were approved to deliver all eggs that were produced before the eighth of June, so that's going to clear out a big chunk of the backlog," he said. "But yeah, we've really had a week of uncertainty." Can't rule out the spreadThat sense of uncertainty continues to pervade the egg industry nationally. What do we know about Australia's bird flu case?Photo shows A person in a white protective suit stands next to a lake holding a dead crane. Two different strains of avian influenza — also known as "bird flu" — have been detected in Victoria. Here's what to know about bird flu, its risk of transmission to humans and what precautions to take against its spread.Victoria is the third-largest egg-producing state in Australia, and the Victorian Farmers Federation said about one in 16 egg-laying chickens had been destroyed, reducing the state's supply by about 450,000 eggs a day.There are five confirmed outbreaks across the south-west of Victoria, impacting around 800,000 birds.Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Watt said while the state and federal governments were doing everything possible to contain the outbreak, the industry wasn't out of the woods just yet. "I can't rule out that it'd be spreading further, but obviously, every effort is being put in by the Victorian government, backed by ourselves," Senator Watt said. "The quicker and earlier we can get on top of this the better."Senator Murray Watt says consumers should be confident the eggs they're eating are safe. (ABC News: Marco Catalano)Senator Watts said the outbreak could have affected more farms, but for the quick response from officials. Horrific weeksThe Victorian Farmers Federation (VFF) remains concerned about not only the financial but also the emotional impact on egg producers.Danyel Cuccinotta (right) and her father Brian Ahmed have farmed caged eggs in Werribee for more than 50 years. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)VFF vice-president, Danyel Cucinotta, told ABC RN that farmers were doing it tough. "Nothing shocks us at the moment because, unfortunately, it's just completely out of farmers' control," Ms Cucinotta said. Ms Cucinotta said farmers were enduring a "horrific couple of weeks" and that the outbreak was going to cost the industry millions.Loading..."Unfortunately this is going to be an ongoing threat for not only eggs but the chicken meat industry in Australia," she said. She said she wouldn't be surprised to see supermarket chains Woolworths and Aldi follow suit and implement egg restrictions. "This is what happens if the farms that are affected end up as a supplier of a major supermarket," she said. Coles has introduced a cap of two cartons per customer right across the country, except in Western Australia. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)"My advice, or my suggestion, would always be eggs are available. It's just probably not in the places that you know and love."Ms Cucinotta's NSW counterpart, Xavier Martin, was less concerned. Mr Martin, president of the NSW branch of the Farmers Federation, said less than 2 per cent of Australia's hens have been impacted and that there's no need for panic. "There's no need for any concerns, avian influenza is not new — it's been in New South Wales about a decade ago," he said. Bird flu detected in childPhoto shows Melbourne AirportA Victorian child has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza after returning to the country from overseas earlier this year. The Department of Health says transmission to humans is rare.He said the buying restrictions had more to do with the supermarkets than farmers. "It says more about their procurement policy," he told ABC Radio. Victoria earlier this year recorded a human case of bird flu, when a child returning to Australia from overseas became unwell and tested positive for the H5N1 strain. The case was not related to the outbreak on the poultry farms, and the Victorian Department of Health has reassured the community that the chance of avian influenza spreading among humans in Australia is low.Authorities say chicken meat and eggs are safe to consume, and there is no risk to the public.Posted Tue 11 Jun 2024 at 2:10amTuesday 11 Jun 2024 at 2:10amTue 11 Jun 2024 at 2:10am, updated Tue 11 Jun 2024 at 3:47amTuesday 11 Jun 2024 at 3:47amTue 11 Jun 2024 at 3:47amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

The stepped-up surveillance system due to be operational later this year will document human cases associated with outbreaks in poultry, wild birds or other animals, the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases has confirmed. “This surveillance system will be set up in collaboration with veterinary and animal health colleagues,” Sibongile Walaza, head of epidemiology in the institute’s Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, told Research Professional News. Pandemic potential Concerns are growing globally around avian influenza, with three dairy workers in the US having caught the virus from dairy cattle since April this year. Bird flu comes in various subtypes, including H5N1, responsible for the infections from cows to humans. Humans infected with H5N1 have died in around half the cases that have been reported globally. Infection between people is so far very rare, but this could change if the virus mutates as it spreads, which makes tracking the disease a priority for health bodies including the World Health Organization. No time for complacency Last year, an outbreak of H5N1 in South African poultry farms decimated the country’s poultry stocks and disrupted egg production in the country. No human infections were reported. But that should not breed complacency, Walaza said. “Although no human cases were detected during the recent outbreaks in chickens, testing and surveillance are important for any future potential exposures.” Walaza said her laboratory is able to detect and sequence flu viruses, including those of avian origin, and store them in case they are needed for vaccine production. “Should a pandemic virus emerge with the potential to spread from person to person, South Africa has a pandemic preparedness plan in place,” she said.

SNS | Kolkata | June 14, 2024 7:52 am (Representational Image; Source: iStock) No fresh case of human infections of avian influenza among people who had come in close contact with the two bird flu-infected children in West Bengal was reported so far in the state, claimed the health department on Thursday. While speaking to reporters today at Swasthya Bhaban, Narayan Swarup Nigam, principal secretary in charge of health department, said, “We have not yet received any fresh case of avian influenza in any person who had come close in contact with any one of the two bird flu-infected children in the state. There is also no report of surge in the state-wide survey on cases like influenza like illness (ILI).” Advertisement “No bird flu case among poultry birds has been reported so far even after strong surveillance. Therefore, there is no reason to panic. The health department has not yet imposed any restrictions on consumptions of chickens and eggs,” Mr Nigam said. Vivek Kumar, additional chief secretary in charge of state animal resource and development (ARD) department, said that samples of 1,728 poultry birds have been tested in ARD laboratory during April-May but no case of bird flu was reported so far. Bird flu scare came back again in the state after two cases of human infections of the avian influenza caused by two variants H5N1 and H9N2 respectively were reported in the state. The WHO on Wednesday pressed an alarm button and confirmed about one case of human infection of bird flu in a child in the state.
