- A clinical trial for an experimental universal influenza vaccine has begun.
- The vaccine, known as H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP, was developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center.
- The trial will test the safety and immune response of the vaccine.
- Up to 50 healthy volunteers aged 18-49 will be enrolled in the trial.
- Participants will receive different dosages of the vaccine, and data will be evaluated to determine the optimum dosage.
- The trial will also include a group of participants who will receive a current quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine for comparison.
- The vaccine aims to provide immunity against a wide variety of flu strains and potentially eliminate the need for annual flu vaccines.
- An effective universal flu vaccine could also serve as a defense against future flu pandemics.
