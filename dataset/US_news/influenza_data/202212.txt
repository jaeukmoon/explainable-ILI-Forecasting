Here we analyze with a novel Bayesian model a large cohort of 2353 individuals followed for up to 5 years in Hong Kong to characterize influenza antibody dynamics and develop an algorithm to improve the identification of influenza virus infections. After infection, we estimate that hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) titers were boosted by 16-fold on average and subsequently decrease by 14% per year. In six epidemics, the infection risks for adults were 3%–19% while the infection risks for children were 1.6–4.4 times higher than that of younger adults. Every two-fold increase in pre-epidemic HAI titer was associated with 19%–58% protection against infection. Our inferential framework clarifies the contributions of age and pre-epidemic HAI titers to characterize individual infection risk.

In addition, avian influenza viruses can occasionally adapt to humans and cause influenza pandemics. A thorough characterization of the risk factors for influenza virus infection is critical to optimize mitigation strategies, and an important component of this is correct identification of infected persons. However, it can be challenging to determine whether a person has experienced an influenza virus infection, since most infections are associated with mild disease or are asymptomatic2,3,4. Serological studies can allow identification of infections regardless of illness severity, and can be used to estimate the incidence of influenza virus infections in different regions and in persons of different ages2,5,6,7,8.For more than 70 years, scientists have relied on an ad-hoc rule whereby a 4-fold or greater rise in hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) titers in paired sera, which are collected from the same persons before and after an epidemic in longitudinal studies, is considered as evidence of influenza virus infection9,10. Although this can capture some asymptomatic and subclinical infections, there are a number of known limitations to this heuristic, such as misclassification due to measurement error11, and ‘non-bracketing’ issue in which the first serum is collected after the start of an epidemic so that the paired sera may not neatly bracket the epidemic period12. Consequently it can be difficult to estimate infection rates in communities11,12, and characterize disease severity13, disease burden1,14 and risk factors for infection15 since all of these require accurate classification of infected vs uninfected persons. Otherwise, other information would be required, such as the sensitivity and specificity of the 4-fold criterion.Here, we develop an analytical framework to address this challenge. We develop a novel Bayesian model to characterize the dynamics of influenza HAI titers from the analysis of a large cohort of 2353 individuals followed for up to 5 years in Hong Kong. Using this detailed understanding of HAI dynamics, we build an algorithm that can identify influenza infections without having to rely on fixed and arbitrary cut-offs. We use our approach to build a comprehensive picture of the circulation of influenza in Hong Kong and its footprint on HAI titers in the population. We then use the model to perform joint estimation of infection risks in different age groups during six influenza epidemics in Hong Kong from 2009 through to 2013, the risk factors for infection, the degree of boosting and waning in HAI titer after infection, and the measurement errors in HAI titer.ResultsStudy participants and influenza epidemicsA total of 3160 individuals participated in the studies in 2008/09 or 2009/10 including 301 who participated in both studies16,17. Participants were then followed up for three additional years18 (Supplementary Fig 1). Based on the surveillance data, there were three epidemics of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and three seasonal influenza A(H3N2) epidemics (hereafter abbreviated as H1N1 and H3N2 respectively) in the study period (Fig. 1A). For the 6 epidemics, 1321–1851 individuals provided at least one mid-/post-epidemic HAI titer value and were included in the analysis (Supplementary Fig 2, Supplementary Table 1). Figure 1B illustrates titer trajectories for three individuals that are considered uninfected based on the traditional 4-fold rise approach.Fig. 1: Estimation of individual HAI titer trajectories.A Timelines of our study, rounds of blood sample collection, and local influenza activity by surveillance data. Influenza activity for a strain is computed by weekly proportion of outpatients with influenza-like illness multiplied by the weekly proportion of laboratory specimens testing positive for that strain.

B Illustration of HAI titer trajectories, infection status, infection time and pre-epidemic HAI titer if missing in three example individuals. The black dot represents the observed HAI titer, the curve indicates the augmented HAI titer trajectories since the start of an epidemic, red and blue indicate infection and non-infection respectively. Child 1 with 2-fold rise is imputed to be infected in some augmented data to reflect the uncertainty. Adult 1 and 2 with missing pre-epidemic HAI titer, the mid- and post-epidemic HAI titer 3 in log2 scale, are from epidemic 1 and 5, respectively. Adult 1 and 2 is estimated to be infected with probability 0.80 and 0.08, respectively. It is because (1) the pre-epidemic titer distribution suggested that adult 3 has a higher pre-epidemic titer than adult 2 (probability of <10 was 0.98 and 0.59 in epidemic 1 and 5, respectively), (2) the infection probability for adults for epidemic 1 (18%) was higher than epidemic 5 (2%). C Estimated boosting distribution in HAI titer after infection by subtype. Funnel plots are used to show the distribution. Solid horizontal and vertical lines are used to show the mean and corresponding 95% credible intervals of the estimates based on our estimation approach fitted to data with 2353 individuals. D The waning after boosting in HAI titer from infection by subtype. The solid lines are used to show the mean waning of HAI titer trajectories over time and the shadowed areas are used to show the corresponding 95% credible intervals.Full size imageHAI titer dynamicsWe estimate that, after infection, geometric mean HAI titers are boosted 3.98 (95% CrI: 3.89, 4.07) log2 titers on average, with standard deviation 1.82 (95% CrI: 1.77, 1.88), and 14% (95% CrI: 12%, 16%) of infections are associated with less than 4-fold rises (Fig. 1C). For H1N1, a strain change is associated with a mean boost in adults that was 1.26 log2 titers (95% CrI: 0.78, 1.73) higher in epidemic 1 (with strain change; Supplementary Table 3) than in epidemics 3 and 5 (without strain change; Supplementary Table 3). The effect is similar in children (1.58 log2 titers; 95% CrI: 1.10, 2.07). For H3N2, the mean boost in epidemic 4 (with strain change; Supplementary Table 3) is also higher than in epidemics 2/6 (without strain change; Supplementary Table 3): 1.54 log2 titers (95% CrI: 0.73, 2.39) higher for children and 1.45 log2 titers (95% CrI: 0.94, 1.96) higher for adults. For H1N1, the mean boosting in children is 0.64 log2 titers (95% CrI: 0.21, 1.04) and 0.95 log2 titers (95% CrI: 0.41, 1.50) higher than in adults, in epidemic 1 and epidemic 3/5, respectively. There is no difference in boosting in children and adults for H3N2.After the boost following infection, the HAI titer starts to wane, with a mean waning rate of 14% (95% CrI: 12%, 15%) a year after infection, and a standard deviation of 22% (95% CrI: 21%, 23%). We also observe substantial differences in the waning rate depending on the epidemic (Fig. 1D). For H1N1, we estimate that the waning in epidemic 1 (with strain change) is 27% (95% CrI: 11%, 40%) and 53% (95% CrI: 27%, 84%) more than in epidemic 3/5 (without strain change) for children and adults respectively. For H3N2, we estimate that the waning in epidemic 4 (with strain change) is 21% (95% CrI: 8%, 40%) larger than in epidemic 2/4 (without strain change) for children, but no difference for adults. Overall, we find that when the circulating strain is substantially different than the previous ones, HAI titers exhibit larger boost and waning than those seen in other years.We estimate that the 1-sided probability of a 2-fold error is 2.8% (95% CrI: 2.3%, 3.6%) and 5.5% (95% CrI: 4.9%, 6.1%) for H1N1 and H3N2, respectively. The probability that the measurement is erroneous and that observed HAI titer level is a random value from <10 to 5120 is 3.3% (95% CrI: 2.9%, 3.7%).Our framework allows us to reconstruct the antibody titer dynamics to identify infections probabilistically, integrating information on observed titers, the boosting and waning distribution, measurement error, and influenza activity. For example, our model suggests that the Child 1 in Fig. 1B that has a 2-fold rise in epidemic 1 was likely infected with probability 0.81. Due to irregular seasonality in Hong Kong and unpredictable timing of influenza circulation12,19,20,21, the pre-epidemic titer may be missing and infection may have occurred before the collection of the first sample (Supplementary Fig 2). For example, Adult 1 in Fig. 1B has HAI titer equal to 3 in log2 scale in the first and second sample but we infer that this individual has an 80% chance to have been infected. This is because almost all individuals have an HAI titer <10 before the pandemic while there was also high prevalence of infection in the community during the pandemic (estimates shown in the next section). In contrast, Adult 2 in Fig. 1B has the same observed titer pattern in a seasonal epidemic but since the probability of infection in the community is low during this epidemic, it is unlikely this individual was infected (probability of 0.08). These simple examples illustrate the additional insight one can gain from an analysis that goes beyond the 4-fold criterion and can integrate additional contextual information.Using the same technique for each individual, among 9463 person-epidemic investigated over six epidemics, we probabilistically identify 1731 infections (95% credible interval (CrI): 1657, 1791). Among these, 45% of those infections (779; 95% CrI: 736, 807) have no pre-epidemic titers and could therefore not be identified by the traditional 4-fold criterion. Among 662 individuals with 2-fold rise in paired sera, we estimate that 24% of those (160; 95% CrI: 139, 192) were infected.Infection risk in epidemicsWe estimate the infection probability for children (age < 18), adults (age 18–50) and older adults (age > 50) during six epidemics (Fig. 2A). For the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, these probabilities were 52% (95% CrI: 48%, 56%), 19% (95% CrI: 16%, 21%) and 13% (95% CrI: 8%, 19%), respectively. During seasonal epidemics 2–6, they were in the range 4%–22% for children, 3%–15% for adults, and 2%–17% for older adults. However, these overall infection probabilities reflect the combination of the effects of age, the distribution of pre-epidemic HAI titers across age groups and the level of protection associated with different HAI titers. First, the infection probability for individuals with a given pre-epidemic titer could vary by epidemic. The infection probabilities during epidemics 5–6 were smaller than for epidemics 1–4 for individuals with pre-epidemic HAI titer <10, and children were at higher risk than adults even when they both had HAI titers <10 (Fig. 2A). Second, the average pre-epidemic titers for children (log2 titer: 3.1) are higher than adults (log2 titer: 1.4) among the five seasonal epidemics (Fig. 2B). Third, the protection associated with a two-fold increase in pre-epidemic titer (Fig. 2C) ranges from 38% to 58%, except in epidemic 4, where the protection is only 19% (95% CrI: 13%, 28%). Therefore, after adjusting for the higher average pre-epidemic titers of children, their infection probabilities are still estimated to be 1.6 to 4.4 times higher than that of younger adults in the six epidemics (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2: Infection probability and its determinant among six epidemics.A Estimates of infection probabilities for children, younger adults and older adults in the six epidemics in our study period. The overall infection probability and infection probability for individuals with pre-epidemic titer of <10 are plotted to show the protective effect of pre-epidemic titers.

D Model estimate of the age-relative susceptibility for six epidemics. Points and vertical lines are used to show the mean and corresponding 95% credible intervals of the estimates based on our estimation approach fitted to data with 2353 individuals.Full size imageAssociation between infection status in different epidemicsWe explore the association between infection status in different epidemics, considering individuals that participated in more than one epidemic in our study (n = 1853; Supplementary Table 2). For adults, there is no evidence for heterosubtypic protection from previous infections (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig 3). For children, infection during H1N1 epidemic 1 provides 93% (95% CrI: 83%, 98%) and 76% (95% CrI: 25%, 96%) protection in H1N1 epidemic 3 and 5, respectively. Such homosubtypic protection is not observed for H3N2. However, the association is no longer significant after adjusting for pre-epidemic HAI titers in the logistic regression, suggesting such protection is captured by information on pre-epidemic HAI titers boosted by previous infections.Fig. 3: The association between infection status in different epidemics.The association between the infection status in each pair of epidemics in the study period. Upper and lower diagonal shows the odds ratio without adjustment and adjusting pre-epidemic HAI titer respectively. A, B Indicate the association for children and adults respectively.Full size imageSensitivity and specificity of identifying infectionsWe conduct a simulation study to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying infections by using our approach or using a 4-fold criterion. We use our model with the model parameters randomly drawn from their posterior distribution to simulate 50 epidemics. When pre-epidemic titers are available, the sensitivity and specificity of our approach are 87% (95% posterior predictive intervals (PPI): 85%, 89%) and 98% (95% PPI: 97%, 98%), which is better than the ones obtained using a 4-fold cutoff point, with 82% (95% PPI: 80%, 84%) sensitivity and 96% (95% PPI: 96%, 97%) specificity. Moreover, our framework performs substantially better when the pre-epidemic titers are unavailable, with 78% (95% PPI: 73%, 81%) sensitivity and 96% (95% PPI: 95%, 97%) specificity compared to the 4-fold rise case definition. Using a 4-fold criterion would have only 22% (95% PPI: 20%, 24%) sensitivity and 98% (95% PPI: 98%, 99%) specificity, due to the ‘non-bracketing’ problem that individuals infected before the collection of the first serum samples are misclassified as uninfected 12.Model validation and adequacyBased on 50 simulated epidemics, we found that the 4-fold criterion leads to an underestimation by 44–70% of infection probabilities for the first three epidemics in which there are non-bracketing issue so that the pre-epidemic titer for some individuals are unavailable (Fig. 4A). In addition, the infection probabilities for children are underestimated by 23–59% for the other three epidemics with no non-bracketing issue. Furthermore, the age relative susceptibility may be biased if using a 4-fold criterion to identify infections, particularly for children (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4: Comparison of using 4-fold criterion and using model estimates to estimate infection probabilities and relative susceptibility among age groups by simulation.A, B Show the infection probabilities and relative susceptibility among age groups estimated by a 4-fold criterion and by our proposed approach respectively. Points and vertical lines are used to show the mean, 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the estimates from 50 simulated epidemics based on our data with 2353 individuals. C The proportion of infected individuals in the groups with different infection probability zone (red rectangles) estimated by our inference from simulation study. Points and vertical lines are used to show the mean, 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the estimates from 50 simulated epidemics based on our data with 2353 individuals.Full size imageIn a simulation study with 50 epidemics, we validate that our approach can accurately identify infections by computing the proportion of infections in individuals with model-predicted infection probabilities that fell in the infection probability window (10 intervals from 0 to 1). The proportion of infections are equal to the middle value of each probability window, suggesting that our inference can correctly identify infections (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the distributions of titer change predicted by the model for children and adults in each epidemic are consistent with the observed ones (among 1000 simulated epidemics) (Supplementary Fig 4). In 50 simulated epidemics, we find our approach could adequately estimate model parameters with no systematic bias (Supplementary Table 4).DiscussionIn this study, we developed a Bayesian modeling approach to jointly estimate individual antibody dynamics, identify influenza virus infections, and determine the risk factors for infection. We found that our approach outperformed the use of the 4-fold criterion which may cause under-detection of infections and hence underestimation of infection risks11,12. Compared with previous approaches that used the antibody titer response after PCR-confirmed infections to identify infections without using the traditional 4-fold rise approach22,23, our approach jointly characterized antibody titer dynamics to identify infections based on serology data alone and, did not require any PCR-related data. Instead, we used surveillance data to inform estimation of infection time, which would be much easier to obtain and would be much more suitable for serologic studies 6.We estimated the degree of boosting of HAI titers after H1N1 and H3N2 infections, and their waning after the boost. We estimated that higher boosting occurred in children, and after strain changes in epidemics, which is consistent with the results from previous studies24,25. Both associations are likely caused by the infection histories, as previous exposure to similar strains would reduce the HAI titer response26,27,28 and children are less likely to have been previously exposed than adults. We found that the waning in HAI titer was higher in epidemics with strain change for both H1N1 and H3N2. Such higher waning was also observed in other studies7,12,23,29,30,31. Further studies are required as the waning rate could depend on other factors, such as the definition of cases, previous exposure or age 12,22,26.Our findings indicate that there is a complex interaction between age and individual immunity. In our framework that accounted for variability in HAI assays32, we find that the protection associated with HAI titer could vary by epidemic, similar to other studies15,19,30,33,34,35. Also, we find that the infection probabilities for children and adults could differ after adjusting for HAI titers, which could be because HAI titers only capture part of the immunity for adults22,26,34, or that children have greater exposure to infection for various reasons33,36. Despite these age differences in infection probabilities, we still find that HAI titers predict infection probabilities at the individual level, and the protection from prior infection could be explained by HAI titer that was boosted by previous infections. This suggests that the distribution of HAI titers in a population could be a useful measure of the proportion of individuals with protection, as a measure of population immunity 7.Our approach consistently outperforms the traditional 4-fold criterion for both sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, our approach could give a more accurate estimate of the incidence of infections and hence more accurate determination of risk factors and disease burden. In particular, our approach could account for the different boosting and waning patterns and therefore would be generalizable to populations with persons with different boosting and waning distribution for different influenza virus strains or even other pathogens with similar patterns after infections37. Furthermore, our approach could still perform well when there is a “non-bracketing” issue that collected sera may not neatly bracket the epidemics of interest. Such performance would be critical as “non-bracketing” is unavoidable in tropical and subtropical regions, or in unpredictable influenza pandemics 20,38,39.Our study has some limitations. We used a proxy measure of influenza activity in the community (Fig. 1A) and the reliability of estimates would depend on the accuracy of the proxy to reflect the relative infection risk over time. Although the proxy is not age-specific, our previous study suggested that the incidence rate of H1N1 infection in 2009 pandemic were similar among different age groups40. Since the rise in HAI titer from vaccination is indistinguishable from natural infections, we excluded all recently vaccinated individuals in this analysis, and our results may not be generalizable if vaccination has an effect on infection risk over more than one epidemic.In conclusion, here we introduced a new approach to jointly characterize antibody dynamics and identify influenza virus infections from serological data that addresses key limitations of the tradition 4-fold criterion. Within our inferential framework, we were able to clarify the contributions of age and pre-epidemic titers to characterize individual infection risks.MethodsStudy designData were collected from two community-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for evaluating direct and indirect benefits of influenza vaccination (Supplementary Note 1)16,17. In the RCTs conducted in 2008/09 and 2009/10, 119 and 796 households were recruited. Serum specimens were collected at the start of the study, and after 6 and 12 months from all participants. In the subsequent observational follow-up of the same cohort participants from late 2010 to late 2013 without intervention18, serum specimens were collected from all participants in each autumn (October to December), and also each spring (April to May). Receipt of influenza vaccine outside of the trial was recorded annually.EthicsAll participants aged 18 years and older gave written informed consent. Proxy written consent from parents or legal guardians was obtained for participants, with additional written assent from those aged 8–17 years. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and by the Hong Kong Department of Health Ethics Committee (Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00792051).Laboratory methodsAll serum specimens were tested in parallel for antibody responses by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays in serial doubling dilutions from an initial dilution of 1:10 using standard methods41. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that prevents complete hemagglutination wells was regarded as the antibody titer. In the pilot (2008/09), serum specimens were tested against A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2). In the main trial and second year of follow-up, i.e., 2009/10 and 2010/11, serum specimens were tested against A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009-like (H3N2). In 2011/12 and 2012/13 serum specimens were tested against A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Victoria/361/2011-like (H3N2). Sera from consecutive years were tested in parallel due to the recommended practice of examining paired sera for evidence of influenza virus infections.Surveillance dataInfluenza activity in the general community is monitored through a sentinel surveillance network in outpatient clinics, which report the proportion of patients with influenza-like illness defined as a fever >37.8 °C plus a cough or sore throat. The public health laboratory also collects data on the weekly proportion of specimens from sentinel outpatient clinics and local hospitals that tested positive for influenza virus. An incidence proxy is constructed to measure the weekly incidence rate of influenza virus infections in the community, derived as the weekly proportion of outpatients with influenza-like illness multiplied by the weekly proportion of laboratory specimens testing positive for H1N1pdm09 or H3N2 virus42. This particular proxy is showed to be a good indication of incidence of H1N1pdm09 virus infection in the community based on hospital admissions 40.Statistical modelsThere were at most 13 serum specimens per participant. However, there was no H1N1 and H3N2 activity between November-December 2008 and April 2009. Therefore, serum collection in April 2009 is considered as the first round in our analysis. Post-vaccination sera are excluded in the analysis since they were only available for a subset of children in the 2009/2010 study.We first identify influenza A epidemics during our study period based on incidence proxy, constructed based on local influenza surveillance data. Then, we identify relevant consecutive titers to estimate the infection risk. For each epidemic, the most recent round of serum collection prior to that epidemic is used to obtain the pre-epidemic titers, to address the non-bracketing issue12. Then, any titer that is collected in the next two consecutive rounds (mid-epidemic and post-epidemic titers) are used to infer infection status. Further titers are ignored due to the low sensitivity to detect infections with waning in titers over time12. For each epidemic, only unvaccinated participants with mid- or post-epidemic titers are included in the analysis of that epidemic, since interpretation of serology in vaccinated persons can be challenging 43.Titers of 10, 20, 40 … 2560 are translated on a log2 scale to 1, 2, …, 9. Undetectable titers <10) are set to 0 on the same scale. While infection has traditionally been defined by 4-fold or greater rise in titers in consecutive pairs of sera, this definition is shown to be suboptimal for estimating infection risk, since some 2-fold rises may also indicate infections with smaller rises11. To improve this, we developed a 5-level hierarchical model to reconstruct the infection status, infection time and the unobserved HAI titer trajectory for each individual by describing the infection risk, boosting in antibody after infection and waning in antibody by integrating serology data and surveillance data (Supplementary Note 2). Parameters and latent variables in the model were summarized in Supplementary Table 5. Hence, we could identify infections without using a cutoff of the rise of titers to define infections in our analyses.The first level of our model was the ‘measurement model’ (Supplementary Note 2). We modeled the underlying titer on a continuous scale, so that a ‘true’ titer between any two dilutions was measured as the lower of the two dilutions when there was no measurement error. For example, a “true” titer of 1.3 is measured as 1. We consider a ‘true’ titer was the underlying but unmeasured titer on a continuous scale, and a ‘measured titer’ is the value that is actually measured by the assay. We use the approach in Cauchemez et al. to model the probability of 2-fold error on the left or right side 11.The second level of the model was the HAI titer dynamics model (Supplementary Note 2). The magnitude of the boosting and the waning was Gamma distributed, and their characterizing parameters are estimated in the inference. We allow these distributions to be different for children and adults, for epidemics with or without strain change compared with previous epidemic of same subtype (H1N1 or H3N2), and by subtype.The third level of the model was the infection model (Supplementary Note 2), that describes the daily infection risk during epidemics. In agreement with our previous analysis12, we assume that the scaling parameter changed on November 21, 2009 to account for the fact that the sentinel surveillance system is affected by the 2009 pandemic H1N1 outbreak44. The pre-epidemic titer and age groups were considered as covariates of infection risk in the model. The fourth level of the model for the distribution of pre-epidemic titer (Supplementary Note 2). The fifth level of the model specifies our priors on model parameters.Model InferenceTo infer the unobserved HAI titer trajectories, we use a Bayesian data augmentation framework45. We developed a reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to explore the joint distribution of model parameters and latent variables (Supplementary Note 3). We updated model parameters with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Infection times, individual boosting and waning parameters, and true titers for each individual were jointly updated with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm conditional on their augmented infection status. Finally, we used a reversible-jump MCMC approach to add or remove infections, informed by the pattern of HAI titers, and also the infection risk of a particular epidemic. Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Association between infection status in different epidemicsWe utilize the longitudinal feature of our study to explore association between infection status in different epidemics (Supplementary Note 4). To estimate the association, we randomly select 100 augmented infection status in the inference to reconstructed datasets. For each reconstructed dataset, we conduct logistic regression for infection status for each pair of epidemics in our study. Hence, we could estimate the homosubtypic or heterosubtypic protection from previous infections, defined as one minus odds ratio, based on the subtypes of the pair of epidemics (Supplementary Table 4). We further include the pre-epidemic HAI titer in the logistic regression, to determine if any identified protection could be explained by pre-epidemic HAI titer. We use a bootstrap approach to account for sampling uncertainty for the above analyses 37.Model validation and adequacyA simulation study is conducted to confirm that our algorithm could provide unbiased estimates of model parameters. In each simulation, a dataset is simulated with parameters equal to their posterior mean, and with a structure identical to the observed dataset, including the availability of titer measurement, infection status and age (Supplementary Note 5). We also track the sensitivity and specificity for using our proposed model and 4-fold criterion to identify infections, and track the infection probabilities by age groups, and relative susceptibility among age groups computed by using a 4-fold criterion. In our model, we defined infection in an individual as the estimated probability of infection for that individual being >0.5, in computing sensitivity and specificity. When applying the 4-fold criterion, we assumed that the baseline HAI titer for individuals without a baseline sample were missing, so that they were assumed to be not infected before the collection of the first serum, which could be either a mid-season or post-season sample. We check the model adequacy by comparing the distribution of titer changes for each age group and each epidemic in observed data and the 1000 simulated epidemics.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Effective COVID-19 preventive measures, including wearing a mask, hand washing, avoiding the “Three Cs”, and city lockdowns, could decrease other infectious diseases. The case numbers of the major infectious diseases in Thailand were investigated (pneumonia, influenza, and dengue fever) during the COVID-19 pandemic using Thailand government national data sources from 2018 to August 2021. Pneumonia, influenza, and dengue fever cases decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to respiratory tract infections, COVID-19 preventive measures could decrease dengue fever cases. Dear Editor,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat, and various social preventive measures have been taken in each country. Effective COVID-19 preventive measures, which are wearing a mask, washing hands, or alcohol hand hygiene, avoiding the “Three Cs” (closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded spaces with many people nearby, and close-contact settings such as close-range conversations), and during a crisis, city lockdowns, could decrease the other infectious diseases [1, 2]. This study aimed to evaluate case numbers of the major infectious diseases in Thailand (pneumonia, influenza, and dengue fever) during the COVID-19 pandemic.This retrospective cohort study used Thailand government national data sources from 2018 to August 2021. The annual case numbers of COVID-19, pneumonia, influenza, and dengue fever were examined using the database of the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand [3,4,5].The number of COVID-19 cases from January 12, 2020, to December 3, 2021 was reported by the Ministry of Public Health; 2,130,641, and 20,880 people were infected and died, respectively. The COVID-19 cases did not increase from January 2020 to November 2020; the number of cases/day was less than 2,000. However, the cases increased rapidly in December 2020. The outbreak peaked in August 2021, with 589,415 cases, as shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Restrictions on movement of people within the country were introduced from 26 March 2020 to 30 April 2020.Fig. 1Influenza cases from 2018 to 2021 in ThailandFull size imageFig. 2Pneumonia cases from 2018 to 2021 in ThailandFull size imageFig. 3Dengue cases from 2018 to 2021 in ThailandFull size imageInfluenza is endemic in Thailand year round, high in the rainy season from June to October and the winter season from January to March. In 2019, the maximum and minimum numbers of cases of influenza were in September (53,339) and May (15,275), respectively. However, after COVID-19 started in 2020, the incidence of influenza dropped rapidly from February to April. The incidence of influenza then remained lower, at less than 3,000 cases/month as shown in Fig. 1. [4]. The seasonal trend of pneumonia in the pre-COVID-19 era resembles that of influenza: high in the rainy season from June to October and in the winter season from January to March, as shown in Fig. 2. However, few pneumonia cases were reported from January to March in 2021, while COVID-19 was an epidemic. Dengue is highly prevalent in the summer and rainy season from May to October and decreases in winter from December to March, as shown in Fig. 3. In 2020, the number of dengue cases was lower than in 2019, and in 2021, fewer dengue cases were reported; less than 2000 cases were reported from May.The decreased incidence of major respiratory infectious diseases worldwide has been reported elsewhere [6]. COVID-19 preventive measures, such as the changes in lifestyle, social lockdowns, and wearing facial masks, and immigration restrictions, are effective for other respiratory infections, such as pneumonia and influenza. The United States reported a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by the percentage of submitted specimens testing positive. In Japan, we previously reported a 44–53% reduction in community-acquired pneumonia admissions from April through September of 2020 [6]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to preventive measures against respiratory infections, all suspected COVID-19 and regular pneumonia cases were quickly sent to the hospital, diagnosed, and treated; the risk of infection with pneumonia was minimized.Dengue cases decreased in Thailand in 2020 and 2021. Particularly in 2021, few dengue cases were reported. Regarding mosquito-borne diseases, malaria cases have reportedly increased, especially in African countries. However, dengue cases may decrease or increase during a COVID-19 pandemic. Dengue cases decreased significantly in Sri Lanka and China. COVID-19 lockdowns decreased dengue transmission in Sri Lanka [7]. In Singapore and India, however, the social distancing policy increased dengue cases. In Singapore, the increased time spent at home might increase exposure to Aedes mosquitos [8]. In India, the density of the immature Aedes mosquito increased drastically during the COVID-19 lockdown due to insufficient vector control programs [9]. In Thailand, the public health staff and the military were heavily involved with COVID-19 mitigation activities with less emphasis on dengue source reduction. However, the community engagement to actively remove breeding habitats in and around homes may have improved during extended periods spent at home during the lockdown. People had more time to pay attention to the vector breeding in their premises. Other possible factors are restrictions on the movement of people within the country, especially closed schools, universities, and offices to control COVID-19 transmission. Dengue infections were clustered among schools in Thailand [10]. Restrictions on the movement of people can result in reduced access to the mosquitoes.The findings in this report are subject to limitations, including the lack of age-specific weekly data, which cannot distinguish between community and hospital patients, and other factors, such as the sharp reductions in global travelers and increased vaccine use, which might have played a role in decreasing disease spread.In conclusion, pneumonia, influenza, and dengue fever cases decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue fever could decrease, in addition to respiratory tract infections, due to preventive measures enacted during global pandemics.

Previous work determined mucin-associated sialic acid acts as a decoy receptor for IAV hemagglutinin (HA) binding and the sialic-acid cleaving enzyme, neuraminidase (NA), facilitates virus passage through mucus. However, it has yet to be fully addressed how the physical structure of the mucus gel influences its barrier function and its ability to trap viruses via glycan mediated interactions to prevent infection. To address this, IAV and nanoparticle diffusion in human airway mucus and mucin-based hydrogels is quantified using fluorescence video microscopy. We find the mobility of IAV in mucus is significantly influenced by the mesh structure of the gel and in contrast to prior reports, these effects likely influence virus passage through mucus gels to a greater extent than HA and NA activity. In addition, an analytical approach is developed to estimate the binding affinity of IAV to the mucus meshwork, yielding dissociation constants in the mM range, indicative of weak IAV-mucus binding. Our results provide important insights on how the adhesive and physical barrier properties of mucus influence the dissemination of IAV within the lung microenvironment.

Individuals with chronic lung disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have an increased risk of potentially life-threating medical complications due to influenza virus infection3,4. To protect the respiratory tract from infection by the influenza virus and other pathogens, a thin layer of mucus is constantly produced and coats the surface of the airway epithelium5. Mucus is a hydrogel composed of approximately 98% water and 2% solids, containing secreted mucins, globular proteins, lipid surfactants and cellular debris6,7. The primary building blocks of mucus gels are high molecular weight (≥1 MDa) mucin biopolymers that are heavily glycosylated with terminal groups such as fucose, sulfate, and sialic acid7,8,9. Mucin biopolymers interweave to form a gel network with a pore size ranging from 100 to 500 nm, depending on total mucin concentration8. Ciliated cells on the airway epithelium beat in a coordinated fashion to clear mucus and trapped particulates from the airway10. In order to prevent infection, mucus in the lung must effectively trap inhaled pathogens and the mechanisms by which this is achieved are important to our understanding of innate host defenses.The IAV lipid envelope contains receptor-engaging hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins and receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) enzymes11. HA binds to α-2,3 and/or α-2,6 linked sialic acid on the surface of the cell to allow for internalization of the virus12,13. The various strains of influenza virus have different sialic acid-binding preference, with human viruses typically preferring α-2,6 linked sialic acid while avian and equine viruses prefer α-2,3 linked sialic acid14. Newly formed virions are released from the cell when NA catalyzes the cleavage of terminal sialic acid15. Previous work has shown the same HA/NA machinery also plays a role in the penetration of IAV through the mucus barrier13,16,17. Specifically, prior work has shown HA on IAV binds to sialic acid within mucus, which is predominantly α-2,3 linked sialic acid on mucins18. It has been proposed that constant NA activity is required for viral penetration through mucus to facilitate removal of sialic acid decoy receptors17. However, whether this can be generalized to human influenza virus infections remains unclear as the evidence to support this mechanism is largely based on data generated using nonhuman IAV, non-human mucus, and synthetic glycan-coated substrates. In addition, prior work on nanoparticle and virus diffusion has noted substantial variation between the barrier properties of human mucus between individual donors19,20,21, which would likely contribute to differences in their susceptibility to infection. It has yet to be established if host-specific mucus barrier properties, such as mucus gel pore size and/or mucin glycan profile, influence the trapping and elimination of IAV from the respiratory tract.In this work, we use fluorescence microscopy to measure the diffusion of IAV through human mucus. Our investigations were conducted using the well-characterized H1N1 influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain, of human origin but with an ‘avian-like’ HA binding preference for α-2,3 linked sialic acid22. PR8 IAV was chosen for these studies given its widespread use and reported binding preference for α-2,3 sialic acid which we anticipate are present in abundant quantity in human mucus18. We used mucus collected from endotracheal tubes of 10 donors for our studies to assess variation in their barrier properties. An important component of our work was also measuring diffusion of nanoparticles designed to be minimally adhesive to mucus19,23 with a comparable size to IAV (~120 nm) in each sample tested. This enabled us to develop an analytical model to decouple physical and adhesive barrier functions of mucus towards IAV. This technique provides a method to assess effective dissociation constants for IAV and potentially other respiratory viruses in 3D human mucus gels. The results of this work give insight into how the structural and adhesive properties of mucus influence its protective function against IAV infection.ResultsIAV diffusivity in human mucusTo visualize IAV in human mucus, we used the lipophilic dye, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), to label individual virions. To confirm the identity of fluorescently tagged particles, DiI-labeled IAV were stained with an antibody specific to IAV HA and imaged using fluorescence microscopy, revealing co-localization of the dye and viral antigen (Fig. 1a). Nanoparticles were included in the imaging to establish plane of view. We next used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to compare the size of unlabeled and DiI-labeled IAV. Our results indicate both labeled and unlabeled IAV were ~120 nm in diameter, suggesting that DiI intercalation did not disrupt virions or cause particle aggregation (Fig. 1b). Further, we confirmed DiI labeling did not impact IAV infectivity (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Characterization of fluorescent IAV.a Fluorescence micrograph of purified IAV and 100 nm PS-NP (blue) stained with DiI (orange) and anti-HA antibody (green). DiI and anti-HA co-staining is denoted with white arrows. PS-NP indicated by white circles. Scale bar = 10 µm. b Measured hydrodynamic diameter for muco-inert PS-NP (dotted blue), unlabeled IAV(dashed orange), and DiI-labeled IAV (solid red).Full size imageAfter confirming successful IAV labeling, we introduced DiI-labeled IAV and muco-inert polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP) to human airway mucus and measured their diffusion using fluorescence video microscopy and multiple particle tracking (MPT) analysis. By simultaneously measuring PS-NP and IAV diffusion, we were able to analyze mucus microrheology and determine the diffusion rate of IAV particles within the same regions of interest. The diffusivity, as measured by logarithm based 10 of mean squared displacement (MSD) at a time lag of 1 s (log10[MSD1s]), showed significant differences between PS-NP and IAV diffusion for individual samples (Fig. 2a, b). Measured MSD for IAV varied over several orders of magnitude between individual patient samples. However, when comparing across all samples collected as shown in the combined data set (Fig. 2b; column ‘C’), we found IAV and PS-NP diffusion are comparable. To put these results into context, we calculated the average effective diffusivity (D) for each sample which was then used to estimate the time necessary for the particles to diffuse (considering motion in z-direction only) through an airway mucus layer with a physiological thickness of 7 µm (Fig. 2c). We would expect IAV capable of penetrating the mucus gel in under 30 min, where D > 0.01 µm/s, would reach the airway epithelial surface and avoid removal via mucociliary clearance10. Based on these estimates, we find that IAV would penetrate the mucus barrier in ≤30 min for 3 out of the 10 samples tested and as a result, would be more likely to cause infection.Fig. 2: Diffusion of IAV and nanoparticles with similar diameter in human mucus.a Representative trajectories of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated 100 nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NP) and IAV diffusion in mucus.

The step-by-step procedure, representative potentials, and resulting binding affinities for IAV are shown in Fig. 3. IAV and PS-NP trajectories (Fig. 3a) are transformed to radial positions with respect to the trajectory center (Fig. 3b, c). For IAV, we define an equilibrium energy of confinement (U3D,IAV) as the sum of interactions resulting from gel network viscoelasticity and receptor-mediated glycan binding. Given the comparable size of IAV and PS-NP (~120 nm), we used PS-NP as micromechanical ‘gauges’ of network viscoelasticity as experienced by IAV. Importantly, PS-NP have been designed to exhibit negligible interactions with mucins24. In order to decouple the influence of physical confinement (Us) and mucin glycan binding on IAV diffusion (UB,IAV), we subtract the average measured U for PS-NP 〈U3D,NP〉 from measured U for IAV (U3D,IAV) to effectively remove the influence of local gel mechanics, as shown in Fig. 3d. With this accounted for, we fit UB,IAV energy profiles with a harmonic well potential representation and a general expression was used to estimate a dissociation constant for individual IAV25. Using this approach, the IAV trajectories were analyzed to determine the spring constant (ks) and effective dissociation constant (K3D) for binding of IAV to human mucus (Fig. 3e, f). Based on our analysis, we find the mode and median for ks of 38 and 43 pN nm−1, and K3D of 163 and 300 mM, respectively.Fig. 3: Quantifying IAV binding to human mucus.a Representative PS-NP (blue) and IAV (red) trajectories centered around the average x and y value.

Line drawn at mean value. For f, IAV with a calculated K3D ≥ 1000 mM are compiled with these high K3D indicative of negligible IAV-mucus interactions. Patient numbers correspond with those in Fig. 2.Full size imageEffect of IAV neuraminidase (NA) inhibition on IAV diffusionGiven these measurable effects of glycan binding on IAV diffusion, we next examined the impact of NA activity on IAV diffusion. Prior work has shown IAV is immobilized when NA activity is inhibited given it will not be able to cleave bonds between IAV HA and mucin-associated sialic acid13,18. To test this, we measured IAV diffusion in human mucus in the presence of the NA inhibitor (NAI), zanamivir (Fig. 4). Control experiments confirmed NA activity is completely abolished by NAI at a final concentration of 10 µM (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the addition of NAI to IAV did not result in viral aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, samples containing IAV and PS-NP were treated with 10 µM NAI, imaged, and subsequently analyzed with MPT. When comparing samples from 2 donors that exhibited no significant change in pore size after NAI treatment, we observed the diffusivity of the IAV was unchanged in 1 sample (patient 5) and significantly increased in the other sample (patient 9) in the context of NA inhibition (Fig. 4a-c). We also found a significant change in the average trajectory diameter (σ) for IAV in both samples while the K3D values showed no significant change (Fig. 4d, e). Unexpectedly, two additional samples treated with NAI showed a significant change in gel pore size which presents a challenge in interpreting the effects of NA inactivation. The data for these samples are provided in the supplemental information (Supplementary Fig. 4).Fig. 4: The effect of neuraminidase (NA) inhibition on IAV diffusion through and adhesion to human mucus.a Representative trajectories of PS-NP and IAV untreated and treated with NAI in human mucus.

Whiskers are drawn down to the 5th percentile, up to the 95th percentile, and outliers are plotted as points. Data sets (n = 2 patient samples) statistically analyzed with two-tailed Mann-Whitney test: ns = not significant; p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. Patient numbers correspond with those in Figs. 2 and 3.Full size imageDisruption of mucus gel cross-linking and its impact on IAV diffusionWe next investigated the effect of cross-linking on IAV diffusion by treating samples with the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT). We reasoned that reducing disulfide cross-linking in human mucus would result in larger network pores and allow for IAV to more readily diffuse through human mucus. Importantly, control experiments confirmed that treatment with 5 mM DTT does not impact viral infectivity (Supplementary Fig. 5). To examine IAV diffusion after disulfide bond disruption, samples containing IAV and PS-NP were treated with DTT and analyzed using MPT. Once treated, both PS-NP and IAV traveled significantly greater distances (Fig. 5a) leading to the significant increase in measured pore size (Fig. 5b), and diffusion rate of the IAV particles (Fig. 5c). Additionally, we analyzed the trajectories of the IAV to determine σ and K3D for the DTT treated samples compared to the untreated samples. In doing so, we observed a significant increase in σ (Fig. 5d) and decrease in K3D (Fig. 5e) after DTT treatment and disulfide bond reduction.Fig. 5: Impact of reducing disulfide bonds within mucus gels on IAV diffusion and adhesion.a Representative trajectories of PS-NP and IAV diffusion in mucus with and without DTT treatment.

For e, IAV with a calculated K3D ≥ 1000 mM are compiled with these high K3D indicative of negligible IAV-mucus interactions. Whiskers are drawn down to the 5th percentile, up to the 95th percentile, and outliers are plotted as points. Data sets (n = 2 patient samples) statistically analyzed with two-tailed Mann-Whitney test: ns = not significant; p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Patient numbers correspond with those in Figs. 2–4.Full size imageDiffusion of IAV in synthetic mucus with altered microstructural propertiesWe then investigated the relationship between mucus crosslinking and IAV diffusion using a synthetic mucus model26. We hypothesized that a systematic increase in synthetic mucus gel crosslinking and resulting tightening of gel pore structure would lead to a reduction in IAV diffusion rates. To test this, MPT experiments were performed on IAV and PS-NP in synthetic mucus of varying crosslinking densities. The total mucin concentration and associated sialic acid content were kept constant in all cases. As the crosslinker concentration increased, the network pore size within the synthetic mucus decreased (Fig. 6a), which was mirrored in the decreased diffusivity of the IAV (Fig. 6b). Comparison of measured pore size based on microrheology using PS-NP and the log10MSD values for the IAV revealed that increased pore size correlated with increased diffusivity (Fig. 6c). Additionally, while there are significant differences in the calculated dissociation constant (K3D) for the IAV, we observed a consistent range of mean K3D values across all crosslinking percentages (Fig. 6d).Fig. 6: Modulation of crosslinking density effects IAV diffusion through synthetic mucus.a Calculated mucus gel pore size (ξ) based on PS-NP diffusion in synthetic mucus. b Measured log10MSD1s for IAV in synthetic mucus. c Median gel pore size (ξ) calculated from the PS-NP compared to the median log10 MSD value for the IAV particles in synthetic mucus of varying crosslinking densities, R2 = 0.9435. d Calculated dissociation constant (K3D) for individual IAV particles, the line at mean value for each data set.

Data sets (n = 3 synthetic hydrogels per group) statistically analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Color and symbol indicative of comparison group: 0%, light blue circles; 1%, orange squares; 2%, green triangles; 3%, red diamonds; 4%, dark blue hexagons.Full size imageDiscussionIn this work, we examined the additive and synergistic roles of gel network structure and IAV-glycan binding in the trapping of viral particles in human mucus. Consistent with prior studies13,27, IAV displayed lower mobility than muco-inert PS-NP with the comparable diameter (~120 nm) in 5 out of the 10 samples, presumably as a result of IAV binding to the mucus gel network. However in the other 5 samples tested, we observed IAV more rapidly diffused through mucus than PS-NP. Previous work has demonstrated rigidity-dependent diffusion of lipid and protein-based nanoparticles through biological gels where particle deformability can be tuned to enhance mobility28,29. As this seemed to occur in more densely cross-linked mucus gels with pore sizes below 200 nm (Supplementary Fig. 6), this may be a result of the semi-deformable nature of IAV particles30 compared to rigid PS-NP, but additional work is required to explore this. However overall, diffusion of IAV and PS-NP was comparable when considering all samples tested. To further characterize IAV-mucus interactions, we developed a statistical mechanics-based analysis to decouple the impact of network structure and glycan binding on IAV diffusion behavior in human mucus. The effective dissociation constant (K3D) determined for individual IAV virions in all human mucus samples tested were within a mM range, consistent for protein-sugar mediated binding31,32. These relatively weak IAV-mucus interactions alone are unlikely to provide sufficient means to immobilize IAV, but likely contribute to the slowing of IAV diffusion as compared to the non-mucoadhesive PS-NP as seen in half of the donor samples in Fig. 2b. We also found disrupting mucus crosslinking with the reducing agent DTT enhanced IAV diffusion through mucus due to the increased network pore size. Interestingly, disruption of the mucus gel via DTT treatment also resulted in a broader range and effective reduction in K3D values, indicative of greater IAV-mucus association. Further, we have demonstrated that a smaller network size, as detected by PS-NP, substantially decreases IAV mobility in a synthetic mucus model with systematically varied crosslinking density.We have also developed an analysis capable of extracting effective binding constants for IAV within the mucus gel network. Unlike standard approaches using glycan binding arrays with purified viral and glycan components33,34, we are able to directly determine effective disassociation constants (K3D) for intact IAV within the 3D microenvironment of native and synthetic mucus gels. Importantly, our analysis allows us to account for the physical pore structure of mucus gels with analysis of PS-NP confinement energies. The calculated ks for IAV-mucus binding, with the median value of 43 pNm, is on the order of forces required to disrupt HA-sialic acid bonds (10-25 pN35,36). Calculated K3D values in human mucus varied widely between patients over a mM range, but are generally consistent with short-lived, reversible HA-sialic acid bonds. In previous work, the dissociation constants for recombinant X-31 HA protein from A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) were quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In the presence of α2,3-linked sialyllactose (3′) sialyllactose and α2,6-linked (6′) sialyllactose, the KD values for the HA protein were 3.2 mM and 2.1 mM, respectively37. We attribute the large range in measured K3D to differences in the properties of mucus collected rather than functional differences in individual IAV. There is likely wide variation in the glycans present in human mucus from different donors.These estimates of K3D would suggest IAV HA only weakly associates with the mucus network. A potential explanation for this finding is the nature of sialic acid linkages in mucus gels as compared to the surface of the airway epithelium. More specifically, mucin-associated sialic acid are generally O-linked whereas they are present predominantly in an N-linked form on the epithelial surface which may influence IAV recognition and binding38. In addition, free sialic acid and other sialylated soluble factors (e.g., H-ficolin39) present within mucus could competitively inhibit IAV binding to sialic acid groups anchored to the mucus gel. To further examine the impact of IAV binding to sialic acid on mucus penetration, we performed studies on the diffusion of IAV in mucus after pre-treatment with 3’ and 6’ sialyllactose to competitively inhibit these interactions with the mucus mesh (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, based on our analyses, sialyllactose treatment of IAV did not have a substantial impact on IAV diffusion and association with the mucus network.Interestingly, while we found that treatment with NAI resulted in a significant increase in the average trajectory diameter (σ) for 1 of the samples, there was no significant change in K3D values. This would indicate that NA has a small influence on the binding affinity of IAV and HA binding alone is unlikely to lead to irreversible bond formation. While our results indicate the low binding affinity of HA, we should also note HA/NA cooperativity may play a role in the association of IAV to the mucus gel40. We also considered the possibility that IAV NA could degrade mucus and disrupt its structure to promote penetration, similar to the mechanism used by bacterial pathogens41. However, we observed an increase in PS-NP diffusion when incubated with IAV in only 1 of 3 patient samples tested (Supplementary Fig. 8). We also found that while we observed a significant increase in σ, the range of K3D values decreased following disruption of disulfide bonds which we attribute to the increased availability of binding sites on mucin polymers to engage the following disruption of the gel network. This may be explained, at least in part, by sterically limited HA-sialic acid binding within dense and/or highly crosslinked mucus given the estimates of K3D ≥ 1000 mM, indicative of negligible HA-mediated glycan binding. This is further substantiated by the slight reduction in K3D values observed in the synthetic mucus gels with lower percentages of crosslinker (<2% w/v PEG-4SH). Relevant to the above-mentioned observations, a recent study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of high mucin density on IAV binding to supported lipid bilayers engineered with surface-tethered synthetic mucin mimetics42. In this previous work, IAV attachment to sialylated mucin mimics was apparent but a reduction in viral attachment was observed above a critical concentration suggesting steric limitation of IAV binding. Using a 3D synthetic mucus gel network, we also observed a slight increase in K3D values (i.e., less IAV-mucus binding) as the percentage of crosslinker increased.Several reports on IAV diffusion through mucus suggest interactions with mucin-associated glycans contribute to its transport behavior13,18,43. For example, it has been shown H1N1 and H3N2 IAV adhere to human lung tissue sections and salivary mucus in a sialic acid-dependent manner16. In addition, previous work has shown NA activity of a swine IAV facilitates its transit through porcine lung mucus13. Conversely, we have found in our studies NA inactivation does not reduce IAV diffusion through mucus. The unexpected increase in network size and IAV mobility observed after NAI treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4) may be explained by either direct effects of NAI on mucus structure or differences between aliquots from individual donors. Based on our results, it is likely IAV HA binding of mucin glycans is weak and reversible in the presence or absence of NA activity. In a previous study, Wang et al. also found that IAV penetration through mucus was not dependent on NA activity, but rather IAV was immobilized in mucus by influenza-specific IgG antibodies27. We note this work was performed similarly to our work with the use of the PR8 strain of IAV in human mucus collected from endotracheal tubes using multiple particle tracking to quantify IAV diffusion rate. However, we did not find evidence of uniform IgG-mediated trapping in our work presumably as the mucus samples collected from individuals during our study from 2018 to 2020 are unlikely to contain antibodies strongly reactive to the lab-adapted PR8 strain initially isolated in 1934. More recent work by Vahey & Fletcher showed that NA-enhanced influenza A transport was limited to nonspherical, filamentous viral particles as opposed to their spherical counterparts44. Given PR8 forms predominantly spherical virions, our results on the limited impact of NA align with these previous studies.The literature to date has generally focused on glycan-mediated entrapment of IAV within human mucus9,13,18. From a more physiological perspective, our data support the rationale that the crosslinking and pore structure of mucus gels can help to protect the airway epithelium from IAV and potentially other respiratory viruses. The inflammatory response to IAV infection is known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytokine expression resulting in acute lung injury45. In response to ROS and oxidative stress, the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) pathway, responsible for mucin hypersecretion, becomes activated leading to increased mucus concentration in the airway lumen46,47. In addition, prior studies have found ROS and oxidative stress can increase the elasticity of airway mucus, attributed to the oxidation of mucin cysteine domains leading to the formation of mucin-mucin disulfide crosslinks48. Increased mucin concentration and mucin-mucin crosslinking due to oxidative stress might be a beneficial part of the inflammatory response towards IAV infection to hinder virus penetration through the mucus barrier. These potential benefits, however, may be undermined by compromised airway clearance in mucus gels with abnormal viscous and elastic properties10.While we think our studies using patient-derived lung mucus provides a physiologically relevant system to investigate IAV dynamics in the airway microenvironment, we acknowledge the modest sample size limited by their availability and note that all experiments were performed with only the PR8 strain. To determine the broader relevance of these findings, we plan to include alternative strains in future work with different sialic acid preference and more contemporary IAV strains where neutralizing antibody-mediated entrapment may influence IAV-mucus interactions as has been observed in prior work27. We also note PR8 and other lab adapted IAV strains produce primarily spherical virions49. In natural infections, influenza virions can vary in morphology, producing a mixture of spherical and filamentous virions49. Recent work has also shown the impact of IAV particle morphology on transport in mucus which will be important to consider in subsequent studies44. Based on this prior work, IAV with a filamentous or anisotropic shape with the potential for HA/NA polarization within the IAV envelope are more likely to engage in multivalent HA-sialic acid interactions than spherical IAV like the PR8 strain used in this work.In summary, we have determined that IAV mobility can be limited by both the structural and biochemical features of the mucus gel network. The influence of gel network structure observed in our work bears similarity to past studies that demonstrate the size dependence of particle diffusion through mucus and other biological matrices28,50,51,52,53. Unlike previous reports, we found HA on the IAV envelope exhibited negligible binding to sialic acid, indicating that PR8 IAV penetration through dense mucus is not dependent solely on NA function. As might be expected, mucus gels with pore sizes approaching the diameter of IAV are capable of physically entrapping viral particles. Our measurements suggest IAV binding to mucus is weak and reversible due to low-affinity interactions between HA and sialic acid, which likely improves its ability to navigate to the underlying airway epithelium. Steric hindrance within the mucus gel network may also influence the accessibility of sialic acid receptors to HA binding. Our results also provide a framework for direct measurement of viral particle association to mucus gels which may prove useful for future studies on respiratory viruses by our group and others in the field.MethodsIAV and nanoparticle preparationThe plasmid-based reverse genetics system for influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1) was a gift from Adolfo Garcia-Sastre. Infectious virus was generated from cloned cDNAs in 293 T and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell co-cultures and purified by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion as previously described54,55. The infectivity of resulting virus stocks was quantified by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells56, yielding 3.9 × 109 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL for PR8. IAV was subsequently labeled with a lipophilic dye, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Invitrogen). The labeled virions were then purified and concentrated via haemadsorption to chicken red blood cells57. Final DiI-labeled IAV stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Each aliquot underwent a maximum of two freeze thaws. This strain exhibits a primarily spherical morphology and diameter of roughly 120 nm. DiI-labeled virus stocks were counter-stained with polyclonal anti-influenza virus H1 (H0) HA PR8 antibody (NR-3148; antiserum, goat; BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH). Carboxylate modified fluorescent PS nanoparticles (PS-NP; Life Technologies) with a diameter of 100 nm were coated with a high surface density of polyethylene glycol (PEG) via a carboxyl-amine linkage using 5-kDa methoxy PEG-amine (Creative PEGWorks) as previously reported19. The NanoBrook Omni (Brookhaven Instruments) was used to conduct dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments to determine particle size distribution and surface charge. We confirmed the formation of a dense PEG coating on PS-NP based on its measured zeta potential of 0.04 ± 0.71 mV.Neuraminidase assayThe neuraminidase activity was tested using the NA-FluorTM Neuraminidase Assay Kit from Life Technologies and following manufacturer instructions. Fluorescence intensity was measured using a Spark Multimode Plate Reader (Tecan). A standard curve for 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU(SS); Sigma-Aldrich) was then generated and the fluorescence signal of 18,000 relative fluorescent units (RFU) corresponding to 20 µM 4-MU(SS) was chosen to normalize NA activity. The neuraminidase assay kit was also used to perform a neuraminidase inhibition assay using the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir (Cayman Chemical). IAV neuraminidase inhibition was tested using a 1:16 dilution of IAV and varying the concentration of zanamivir from 0.01 nM to 10 µM. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, IAV was incubated with zanamivir for 30 min before the NA-FluorTM substrate was added. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before fluorescence intensity was measured.Human mucus collectionHuman mucus was collected under an IRB-approved protocol at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC; Protocol #: HP-00080047). Samples were collected by the endotracheal tube (ET) method, as previously described19. ET were collected from 10 donors after intubation as a part of general anesthesia at UMMC. The data presented here are from 6 male and 3 female subjects with mean age of 66 ± 12 years (note: demographic data not available for 1 patient). All adults undergoing non-cardiothoracic surgery and under general anesthesia were eligible for the study. Given we were collecting a surgical waste product (endotracheal tubes), recruitment of participants was not required as the study was exempt from informed consent. In order to collect mucus from ET, the last approximately 10 cm of the tubes were cut, including the balloon cuff, and placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. The ET tube was suspended in the tube with a syringe needle and was then spun at 220 g for 30 s, yielding 100–300 μL of mucus. Mucus with visible blood contamination was not included in the analysis. Samples were stored at −80 °C immediately after collection and thawed (up to 3x) prior to use for experiments. Notably, control experiments showed the microrheology of an ET mucus sample was minimally impacted by freeze-thaw as compared to an unfrozen sample kept at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig. 9).Synthetic mucus hydrogel preparationUsing a previously established method26, synthetic mucus hydrogels were prepared using 2% bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM; Sigma-Aldrich) and varying percentages of a 10 kDa thiolated 4-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG-4SH; Laysan Bio Inc.) used as a thiosulfate crosslinker. The mucin and PEG-4SH crosslinker were combined in a physiological buffer (154 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl2, and 15 mM NaH2PO4 at pH 7.4) and mixed for 2 hours. The cross-linking solution was prepared separately in buffer directly before mixing with mucin solution. To initiate gelation, equal volume aliquots of each solution were mixed and equilibrated for 21 hours at room temperature. After synthetic mucus gels were fully formed, DiI-labeled IAV and/or nanoparticles were added prior to fluorescence video microscopy experiments. There were n = 3 gels tested for each cross-linking percentage, with a total of n ≥ 100 particles per condition.Fluorescence video microscopySamples were prepared for imaging by placing a vacuum grease coated O-ring on microscope cover glass. The sample was then applied to the center of the well and sealed with a coverslip. Samples were allowed to stabilize for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to imaging. Slides were imaged using Zeiss LSM 800 inverted microscope with a 63x water-immersion objective. For each sample, 10 s videos were recorded at 33.3 frames per second. For all experiments, 1 µL of DiI-labeled IAV (3 × 109 PFU/mL) and 1 µL of PEG-coated nanoparticles were added to 20 µL thawed human mucus in the center of the slide well and stirred with a pipette tip prior to imaging. After equilibration and initial imaging, samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C and then imaged. For IAV with neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) in human mucus, 1 µL of IAV labeled with DiI was mixed with 1 µL of NAI zanamivir (Cayman Chemical) and allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes. The IAV and NAI mixture was then combined with 100 nm PS-NP and added to 20 µL of human mucus. The final concentration of NAI in the mucus sample with the IAV was 10 µM. For freeze-thaw testing, IAV was added to 20 µL of different aliquots of the same human mucus sample after 0, 1, 2, and 3 freeze-thaw cycles. For mucus treated with dithiothreitol (DTT; VWR), 1 µL of 115 mM DTT was added directly to the mucus sample, yielding a final concentration of 5 mM. On average, 137 IAV particles and 246 PS-NP were tracked per sample tested. In rare cases, a minimum of 10 IAV particles were tracked.Multiple particle tracking (MPT) analysisAcquired fluorescence microscopy videos were processed using a previously developed MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) based analysis code to isolate and track imaged particles58,59,60. For each video, the mean squared displacement (MSD) was calculated as \(\left\langle {{\mbox{MSD}}}\left(\tau \right)\right\rangle =\left\langle \left({x}^{2}+{y}^{2}\right)\right\rangle\), for each particle. The MSD values of the particles were then used to determine the average α value for each sample, calculated as \(\alpha ={{\mbox{(}}}\triangle {\log }{{\mbox{MSD}}}\left(\tau \right){{\mbox{)}}}/{{\mbox{(}}}\triangle {\log }\left(\tau \right){{\mbox{)}}}\). All experimental data were verified to have an average α value with 0 < α ≤ 1, indicative of sub-diffusive particle motion. Due to the nature of MPT, PS-NP and IAV were tracked for a maximum of 10 s due to their motion out of the focal plane. To minimize the dynamic and static error in our measurements58,59,60, a lag time of 1 s was used as a representative value for comparison between conditions. The MSD values for PS-NP were then used to calculate the microrheological properties of the samples tested using the generalized Stokes-Einstein relation61, defined as G(s) = 2kBT/(πas〈Δr2(s)〉) gives the viscoelastic spectrum where kBT is the thermal energy, a is the radius, and s is the complex Laplace frequency19. The complex modulus is calculated by \({G}{\ast }\left(\omega \right)={G}^{\prime}\left(\omega \right)+{G}^{\prime\prime}{{\mbox{(}}}i\omega {{\mbox{)}}}\) where iω is used in place of s, i is a complex number, and ω is the frequency19. From this equation, the pore size (ξ) can be estimated as \(\xi ={\left({k}_{B}T/G^{\prime}\right)}^{1{{{/}}}3}\) and the complex microviscosity (η*) can be calculated as η* = (G*(ω))/(ω)19. The effective diffusivity (D) was calculated for each individual particle using the MSD values as MSD = 4Dτ6. The average effective diffusivity for each sample was then used to calculate the estimated diffusion time (t), using the equation \(t\,={L}^{2}{{\mbox{/(}}}2D{{\mbox{)}}}\), where L is the thickness of the mucus layer62. For the estimated diffusion time, a physiological thickness of 7 µm was used for the calculations.Dissociation constant (K3D) for IAV binding to mucusIn order to quantify an effective binding constant for IAV within a mucus gel network, we have developed an analytical procedure that accounts for the confinement of IAV particles due to physical constraints (i.e., pore size limited, sub-diffusive motion) and adhesive interactions (i.e., HA-sialic acid binding). First, the trajectories from MPT analysis are recentered, based on the average x- and y-position, and the radial distance from the center of the trajectory (r) is calculated (in µm) for each frame. The r values for each frame are used to measure the confinement that a given particle experiences using the expression,$$\sigma =\frac{2}{n}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left|{r}_{i}\right|$$ (1) where n is the number of frames the trajectory is tracked over, and σ is the average diameter of the trajectory. A histogram is then constructed based on measured r for individual IAV and PS-NP particles. To determine an effective energy of confinement based on sampled r, histograms are used to calculate an energy of confinement (U3D) using a Boltzmann distribution as,$${U}_{3{{{{{\rm{D}}}}}}}/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T=-\,{{{{\mathrm{ln}}}}}[n(r)/{n}_{{{\max }}}]$$ (2) where n(r) is the number of counts for a given r value, and nmax is the largest count value representing the most probable r position at the local energy minimum63. We consider the overall energy of confinement for IAV within mucus gels (U3D,IAV = Us + UB,IAV) to be a result of the combined effects of steric obstruction (Us) and adhesive interactions due to binding (UB,IAV). Given the limited adhesive interactions expected for PS-NP, the overall confinement energies for PS-NP (U3D,NP) are averaged to account for confinement due to steric interactions to determine Us as Us = 〈U3D,NP〉. Importantly, 〈U3D,NP〉 for PS-NP within the same regions of interest as IAV are used to account for these effects as they will be depend on the local microenvironment within highly heterogenous mucus gels. The potential energy of IAV-mucus binding is then determined for individual IAV particles as UB,IAV = U3D,IAV − 〈U3D,NP〉.Measured energy profiles for IAV-mucus binding (UB,IAV) for individual virions are then analyzed to estimate an effective dissociation constant using a generalized analytical expression for harmonic well potentials25,64. The spring constant (ks) is calculated by fitting measured UB,IAV using the expression,$${U}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}},{{{{{\rm{IAV}}}}}}}/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T=0.5({k}_{{{{{{\rm{s}}}}}}}/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T){r}^{2},$$ (3) where kBT is thermal energy in pN•nm and ks is in units of pNm63. An effective dissociation constant for IAV binding to the mucus gel network, K3D, is then calculated as,$${K}_{{{{{{\rm{3D}}}}}}}={(2{{{{{\rm{\pi }}}}}}{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{s}}}}}}})}^{-3/2}\exp (-{U}_{{{{{{\rm{M}}}}}}}/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T),$$ (4) where UM is the depth of energy well for measured UB,IAV (in pN•µm)25. Given these estimates are determined for viral particles with multiple receptors diffusing in a 3D biological gel decorated with ligands, these effective dissociation constants will likely differ from those determined using traditional single molecule-based assays. Thus, we believe it is important to distinguish the estimated dissociation constant here from traditional measurements and we have denoted the dissociation constant with the symbol “K3D” to reflect the nature of our measurements. In our previous work, this analytical expression was computationally validated and produces accurate dissociation constants for harmonic well potentials of varying depth and range25. These calculations were not performed on UB,IAV energy profiles with UM values less than 1 kT and negligible binding.Statistics and reproducibilityThe number of patient samples used in our study were based on the number available for collection during the study. Studies in synthetic hydrogels were performed in triplicate. For each sample and treatment, PS-NP and IAV particles from at least n = 3 microscopy videos were tracked and pooled for analysis. Differences in measured parameters were calculated using either non-parametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney test or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. The resulting p-values were considered significant if p < 0.05. Data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The findings, from a study carried out by the University of Edinburgh, University of Liverpool, Leiden University and Imperial College London, show patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) and influenza at the same time were over four times more likely to require ventilation support and 2.4 times more likely to die than if they only had COVID-19. Researchers say the findings show the need for greater flu testing of COVID-19 patients in hospital and highlight the importance of full vaccination against both COVID-19 and the flu. The research, published in The Lancet, included more than 305,000 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. It was delivered as part of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium’s (ISARIC) Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium – the largest ever study of people with COVID-19 and other endemic respiratory viruses. ISARIC’s study was set up in 2013 in readiness for a pandemic such as this. Being infected with more than one virus is not very common but it’s important to be aware that co-infections do happen. The vaccines that protect against COVID-19 and flu are different, and people need both. Professor Peter Openshaw NHLI The team looked at the data on adults who had been hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK between 6 February 2020 and 8 December 2021. Test results for respiratory viral co-infections were recorded for 6,965 patients with COVID-19. Some 227 of these also had the influenza virus, and they experienced significantly more severe outcomes. Dr Maaike Swets, PhD student at the University of Edinburgh and Leiden University, said: “In the last two years we have frequently witnessed patients with COVID-19 become severely ill, at times leading to an ICU admission and the employment of an artificial ventilator to help with breathing. That an influenza infection could give rise to a similar situation was already known, but less was understood about the outcomes of a double infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.” Professor Kenneth Baillie, Professor of Experimental Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, said: “We found that the combination of COVID-19 and flu viruses is particularly dangerous. This will be important as many countries decrease the use of social distancing and containment measures. We expect that COVID-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections. That is why we should change our testing strategy for COVID-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely.” Double infection Professor Calum Semple, Professor of Outbreak Medicine and Child Health at the University of Liverpool, said: “We are seeing a rise in the usual seasonal respiratory viruses as people return to normal mixing. So, we can expect flu to be circulating alongside COVID-19 this winter. We were surprised that the risk of death more than doubled when people were infected by both flu and COVID-19 viruses. It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late.” Dr Geert Groeneveld, doctor at Leiden University Medical Center’s infectious diseases department, said: “Understanding the consequences of double infections of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is crucial as they have implications for patients, hospitals and ICU capacity during seasons that SARS-CoV-2 and influenza circulate together.” Professor Peter Openshaw, Professor of Experimental Medicine at Imperial College London, said: “Being infected with more than one virus is not very common but it’s important to be aware that co-infections do happen. The vaccines that protect against COVID-19 and flu are different, and people need both. The way that these two infections are treated is also different so it’s important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection. This latest discovery by the ISARIC consortium again adds significantly to improving the way we manage patients.” The research was funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and by the Department of Health and Social Care through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) as part of the UK Government’s COVID-19 rapid research response. - ‘SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, or adenoviruses’ by ISARIC4C Investigators is published in The Lancet.

There are no signs the strain of avian influenza poses a danger to people yet, but experts are on the lookout for potential mutations of the virus that could make it more of a threat.Although the risk to humans remains low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it will monitor people who've been exposed to domestic and wild species infected with H5N1 — a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that spreads easily among birds.Since February, the H5N1 virus has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in at least 17 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, making it the worst bird flu outbreak since 2015, when nearly 50 million birds were slaughtered or died. The spread of the disease has largely been blamed on the migration of wild birds flying over domestic flocks and transmitting the virus through their droppings. At this time, no human cases of H5N1 have been detected in the United States, CDC spokesperson Kate Grusich said in a statement to NBC News. “Based on past experience with earlier H5N1 bird flu viruses — and what is known about this group of viruses from existing epidemiologic and genetic sequence data — CDC believes the health risk to the general public is low,” she said.The worry, experts say, is that a continued spread among birds could give the virus more chances to pick up new mutations and become more of a risk to people.“New strains of influenza that are introduced to the human population and can cause global pandemics often originate from these animal sources, in particular birds,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “There is a risk that some of these bird flu strains may pick up the genetic capacity to infect humans.”Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMore than a dozen types of bird flu have been identified, according to the CDC. Since 2015, there have been sporadic cases in humans from bird flu viruses, though most often occur in people who had prolonged exposure to infected poultry. Schaffner said the virus often has trouble infecting humans — once the virus is inhaled, it must latch on to the cells located in the back of the throat, the nose and the upper parts of the bronchial tubes, which are in the lungs. He noted that the disease can't be transmitted to humans through properly cooked food.But when the bird flu does infect people, it can be quite severe, with a mortality rate estimated to be at approximately 60 percent, according to the CDC. The CDC said data so far shows the current H5N1 virus lacks mutations seen in the past that have been associated with bird flu viruses spreading easily among poultry, infecting people more easily and causing severe illness. The agency said it is working closely with the Agriculture Department and states to track the spread and conduct additional laboratory work to be ready in case human infections occur.‘Explosion’ of cases expectedMeanwhile, farms across the U.S. are taking steps to increase biosecurity measures. Dr. Mendel Miller, the assistant state veterinarian for South Dakota, told NBC News that the state has euthanized just short of 200,000 infected birds.As soon as state health authorities detect a potential case of bird flu, they immediately quarantine the facilities and prevent the movement of poultry products, he said. "Everybody's trying to do what they can biosecuritywise, trying to prevent the introduction of the virus," Miller said. "Whether it's a backyard flock or more of a large, commercial type flock, everybody needs to do their part to prevent the spread of the disease." The measures may do little to stop the spread of the virus, according to Henry Niman, a virologist and biochemist in Pittsburgh who has been tracking the bird flu’s spread. He is expecting an "explosion" of bird flu cases in birds in the coming weeks. "This outbreak I think is likely going to be bigger than 2015," he said, noting that the disease is already widespread in other regions of the world, such as Europe and Canada. The virus likely began circulating in Europe before it came down to the East Coast of North America, Niman said. "There's a lot of birds that have been positive and there have been some outbreaks in the Delmarva Peninsula, which is in Delaware and Maryland. That peninsula has a lot of poultry," he said. "It is starting to take off in the Midwest." Niman anticipates a "limited" number of human cases in the U.S., likely people who have close contact with birds who may then transmit the virus to close family members.Mike Stepien, a spokesperson for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency within the Agriculture Department, said in an emailed statement that the virus does not present an immediate public health concern at this time.Bird owners can take some simple steps to protect their birds from the virus, he said, including:Practice good biosecurity, such as cleaning up feed spills to avoid attracting wild birds.Prevent contact between domestic birds and wild birds.Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through the Agriculture Department’s toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

New research shows rapid flu tests conducted at home are just as accurate as those performed in clinical settings. By Julia Ries Julia Ries Julia Ries is a writer focusing on all things health and wellness. She has over 10 years of experience in health journalism, and though she has written about pretty much every health topic imaginable, her very favorite thing to write about is mental health and the many ways in which it influences how we think, feel, act, and, ultimately, live. health's editorial guidelines Published on March 23, 2022 Close AdobeStock At-home tests for influenza are just as accurate as those used in doctors' offices, new research finds. Experts believe that the distribution of such tests—particularly following home testing done during the COVID-19 pandemic—could not only lead to earlier diagnoses, but potentially reduce infections on a national or global scale. The news comes as part of the Seattle Flu Study, and was recently published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance. Researchers ultimately determined that both the sensitivity and specificity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) performed at home were on par with RDTs done in a clinical setting. Though public health experts had long suspected that at-home tests may not be as accurate as those performed or tested by health care professional, the new study shows that most people are quite good at testing themselves—and that the tests used are reliable. "The main takeaway is that people at home, unsupervised, could do a simple self-test for flu with similar accuracy to if they'd been to the doctor," the study's senior author Matthew Thompson, DPhil, MPH, a professor of family medicine and global health at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told Health.com. At-home flu tests approved by the FDA aren't currently available, likely because the demand for at-home testing didn't become fully apparent until COVID-19 hit. But the new research may be a step in the direction of changing that. Here's what you need to know about the accuracy of at-home flu tests, and when you may be able to expect them on store shelves. What to Know About Flu Tests—Including How to Know if You Need One, and What to Do if You Test Positive Accuracy of At-Home Flu Tests To figure out just how accurate rapid flu tests used at home are, researchers from University of Washington Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Seattle Children's Hospital recruited 605 participants in Seattle. The participants were mailed rapid influenza testing kits (made by Ellume), along with collection materials for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that would be sent to a local laboratory. The participants were instructed to swab their noses if they had a cough or other respiratory infection symptoms like sore throat, body aches, chills or fever. After completing the tests, they recorded their rapid tests results on an app and mailed the PCR samples back to a lab. Between February to May 2020, 14% of the participants tested positive for influenza via PCR tests, a rate that was in line with the prevalence of influenza in the area during the time period. When compared to the PCR test results, which have been considered the gold standard of diagnostic testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the at-home tests only caught about 60% of infections, which researchers labeled as "moderate sensitivity." When a rapid test identified an infection, they were often very good at identifying the strain of influenza (influenza A or influenza B). But those results were expected, since RDTs in general are less sensitive than PCRs. When compared to previous data on RDTs performed in health care settings, the at-home tests were just as accurate at providing diagnoses. They each detected about 60% of infections, according to current data and pooled estimates from past studies. "Although it compares similarly to other antigen tests, it doesn't compare great to a PCR test," Daniel Rhoads, MD, FCAP, the vice chair of the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Committee, told Health.com. The at-home tests were also found to be more accurate when performed in the first 72 hours following symptom onset. The chances of false-negative readings increased when the test was performed after that first 72-hour window, researchers said. Flu vs. COVID-19: How the 2 Illnesses Compare, According to Experts At-Home Flu Test Availability A typical flu season sees up to 41 million infections, 710,000 hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. Home-based tests could dramatically improve the burden of influenza: People could be diagnosed faster through home tests, and the sooner infected people are diagnosed, the quicker they can begin isolating or taking treatments that shorten the duration and severity of their illness. But there aren't currently any authorized at-home flu tests on store shelves—in fact, the only home-based, FDA-approved diagnostic test available in pharmacies, other than at-home COVID-19 tests, are is one used to identify HIV, approved by the FDA in 2012. "It is curious that none of the manufacturers had really been pushing self tests for other infections—flu or strep throat or other sexually transmitted infections," Thompson said. Many manufacturers probably didn't think there was a strong enough demand for home testing prior to the pandemic. That doesn't necessarily mean scientists weren't working on any. Thompson said there were a handful of at-home flu tests in development before COVID-19 hit; some of which may have been already released if it weren't for the pandemic pushing back developments for other illnesses. Another hitch in scientists' plans: The lower-than-usual influenza numbers, due to COVID-19 mitigation strategies. "It's been very hard for test makers to actually finish their testing," Thompson said. COVID-19 did, however, lay the groundwork for at-home tests, and show that people are interested in (and capable of) testing themselves at home. "Moving forward, with so much attention over the last two years put toward respiratory viruses, there's probably increased interested, or market demand, for at-home respiratory virus testing," said Dr. Rhoads. Multiple at-home flu tests are now back in development: Lucira Health, a company focused on at-home diagnostics, has reportedly developed a dual COVID-19 and influenza test anticipated for the 2022–2023 flu season. Meanwhile, health care technology company Cue Health is also actively testing their own at-home influenza test, and Ellume—the makers of the test used in the Seattle study—already has an at-home flu test that they plan to share updates on soon. We could start to see rapid flu tests on the shelves at pharmacies next winter, said Thompson. And hopefully, just like with COVID-19, these at-home flu tests could help expand access to testing, lower medical care costs, and kickstart treatments or encourage people to lay low to stop further spread.

Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian Dr. Shauna Voss says high-path avian flu is being seen in wild birds, commercial poultry, and backyard poultry in many different states. “So now is the time as birds are migrating north that all of our producers need to be on alert.” She tells Brownfield the virus is very similar to the strain that wiped out millions of chickens and turkeys in 2015, but one significant difference is how avian flu is being introduced. “We had some spotty introductions on the West Coast kind of centered into the Upper Midwest, but this time it’s come all the way up the East Coast (into) a lot of the Midwestern parts of the U.S. And we’re even seeing incidences in wild birds out on the West Coast, so it’s in all four flyways.” As ominous as that sounds, she says growers are far more prepared.

It's Iowa's sixth report of the deadly diseaseDonnelle Eller | Des Moines RegisterShow Caption Hide Caption Where does Iowa agriculture production rank nationallyHow Iowa ranks in agriculture production nationallyWochitBird flu has hit another commercial turkey operation in northwest Iowa, the third outbreak in Buena Vista County and the sixth in the state since the beginning of March, the Iowa Department of Agriculture said Thursday.The state said the facility has nearly 54,000 turkeys that are being destroyed to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. The virus can wipe out a flock within 48 hours.Buena Vista County has been under a state disaster proclamation since March 6, when the first outbreak in was reported in a commercial flock of nearly 50,000 turkeys. And a week ago,the state said the deadly disease hit an egg-laying operation with 5.3 million hens.The disaster proclamation enables the state agriculture department and other agencies to help track, monitor and contain the disease. Officials are testing seven flocks in a six-mile area around the infected site, and monitoring 14 others, said Chloe Carson, the department's spokeswoman.Iowa has struggled with avian influenza outbreaks in backyard flocks in Pottawattamie and Warren counties, and at a Taylor County operation with about 916,000 pullets, or young laying hens.On Wednesday, the agriculture department canceled all live bird competitions and exhibits at county fairs and the Iowa State Fair. The agency said it was prohibiting live bird sales at auctions, markets, swap meets and exotic sales.State officials believe wild birds are infecting domestic poultry with highly pathogenic avian influenza. Iowa is part of the Mississippi flyway, a migration route for millions of birds each year.More: Iowa agriculture department shuts down bird contests at fairs to prevent bird flu spreadState and federal agencies said none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach U.S. food supplies. No human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in the United States.“This is a difficult time for poultry producers as HPAI (highly pathogen avian influenza) continues to impact farms across Iowa and the United States,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said in a statement.Bird flu toll mounting nationallyNationally, 17 states have reported outbreaks of bird flu among commercial or backyard flocks, with about 14 million birds destroyed to prevent the virus' spread, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Thursday.Iowa leads the nation in egg production, with 55 million laying hens producing 16 billion eggs annually, and it ranks seventh nationally for turkey production, raising 12 million birds a year. More: Fifth Iowa outbreak of bird flu confirmed in a backyard Warren County flockA 2015 outbreak led to the destruction of 32.7 million laying hens, turkeys and other birds in Iowa. That was about two-thirds of the 50.5 million that were destroyed nationally.Officials urge flock owners to prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and to immediately report sick birds or unusual deaths.Donnelle Eller covers agriculture, the environment and energy for the Register.

But this year, preliminary data suggests this season's vaccines aren't as effective.If preliminary data is suggesting the flu vaccine isn't as effective, why are we still pushing for Oregonians to get it?"We're still seeing a lot of pressure on our hospitals, not all from Covid now, but maybe from pent-up demand from patients who weren't getting their surgeries previously," Dr. Cieslak says. "And the last thing we want to see now is more people ending up in the hospital. So even if the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting influenza at all, it's still very likely to keep you out of the hospital."And the best way to distinguish whether you have the flu, Covid, or just seasonal allergies?"A sign you have an infection; a change from your typical allergy symptoms would suggest that you have an infectious cause, so get tested," replies Dr. McGovern.OHA says anyone ages 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine, particularly young children, older adults and those who have chronic conditions.If you're interested in getting yours, find a flu vaccine clinic, visit www.Flu.Oregon.Gov and use OHA's flu vaccine locator tool.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Us© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Midwest Avian Flu Outbreak Offers Lessons for Today | Farming and Agricultural News | lancasterfarming.com Skip to main content You are the owner of this article.

U.S. Geological Survey map Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link As avian influenza infections rise across the eastern United States, it’s chilling to recall the last time cases got this bad.The 2015 outbreak centered in the Midwest led to the destruction of 50 million birds on 211 farms. With $1.6 billion in direct losses, it was the most expensive animal health disaster in the nation’s history.That outbreak drove the U.S. to improve its animal disease preparedness and offers some insights for avoiding a repeat of that grim spring. “I think the risk that we face in 2022 is substantially different than 2015 simply because of all the lessons learned,” said Kevin Brightbill, Pennsylvania’s state veterinarian.The two outbreaks have been caused by substantially similar pathogens — H5 types of avian influenza.Named for the configuration of a protein on the surface of the virus, H5 is one of the flu categories most likely to mutate and become highly pathogenic.In addition to causing the recent outbreaks, H5 strains were behind the 1983-1984 avian influenza outbreak in Pennsylvania, said Sherrill Davison, an associate professor of avian medicine and pathology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.Still, the current strain is arguably a greater concern than the one from seven years ago.The earlier virus needed some time to become a problem once it got into poultry, but the latest strain is even killing wild birds, which don’t typically show symptoms of influenza.“It doesn’t really have to warm up or adapt at all in the chicken to become deadly or highly pathogenic,” Brightbill said. “It already is.”Comparing TimelinesThe 2022 outbreak has so far progressed in broadly similar fashion to its forerunner.In December 2014, the U.S. reported its first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 10 years. The disease spread slowly across multiple states, infecting just a few premises per week, through late March 2015.Then, at the end of March — seven years ago this week — cases began to surge, mainly in Iowa and Minnesota. And cases stayed high for two grueling months, with USDA reporting as many as 38 farms testing positive in a week.Cases have been popping up at a slow and steady rate this year, but it’s not clear whether the U.S. is destined for another regionwide blowup.Avian influenza is spread by waterfowl, which are still in the midst of their spring migration. Different groups of birds migrate at different times, and their pace of travel depends on the weather and the resources at their stopover points.“Usually they’re following their food supply,” said Gregory Martin, a Penn State Extension poultry educator.The U.S. has robust disease surveillance and better technology than in 2015, so Davison said it’s possible that the disease could spread less readily than it did seven years ago.But viruses are inherently unpredictable.“Each outbreak is very different as to how it’s going to spread, where it’s going to spread, how fast it will spread,” Davison said.One of the clear differences between 2015 and 2022 is where the disease has been most troublesome.The Midwest has borne the brunt of both outbreaks, but the Eastern seaboard — spared last time — is a hot spot for avian influenza this year.Wild birds traveling the coastal Atlantic Flyway have been found with the disease in nearly every state from Florida to maritime Canada, and backyard birds have tested positive from Virginia to Maine.Seven poultry farms totaling 3.2 million birds have tested positive on the Delmarva Peninsula, home to a $3.4 billion poultry industry.And for as bad as the 2015 outbreak was, avian influenza has actually been advancing a bit faster this year.Twenty premises were infected through March 24, 2015, compared to 51 by that date this year, according to USDA.Then as now, about half of the infections were in backyard birds, which are kept in much smaller flocks than commercial farms and, depending on how informed the owner is, might have weaker biosecurity.Still, the share of infected premises can change in a hurry. By the end of the 2015 outbreak, about 90% of the infected premises were commercial farms, not backyard operations.Preventing a RepeatFortunately, USDA and state animal health officials learned from 2015 in ways that are paying off now.The initial testing and response procedure has been streamlined, which facilitates rapid diagnosis and depopulation. The disease management process has also gone paperless as much as possible, which speeds up communication, Martin said.Delay in depopulation allows for exponential increases in the amount of virus the sick birds shed into the environment, according to USDA.To speed up depopulation, many birds have been killed this year with ventilation shutdown plus heat. That method is easier to implement than the carbon dioxide gassing that is still used but was more common in 2015, Brightbill said.Pennsylvania’s key avian influenza experts also hold a monthly call to review the status of disease outbreaks around the world and adjust the state’s plan as needed, Brightbill said.Pennsylvania is even using lessons learned from its encounter with avian flu in the ’80s.Since that outbreak, Penn Vet has tested for the disease as part of its standard bird necropsy, done for wild birds and backyard fowl as well as commercial poultry.The wild bird testing — which covers everything from migratory waterfowl to shore birds and raptors — is part of a disease surveillance collaboration with the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Davison said.Defending the FarmAnother lesson from 2015 is that farms must be prepared for the many ways that avian influenza can enter a poultry house.In some cases, wild birds may have been able to enter poultry buildings, but USDA said the disease may also have spread to neighboring farms through equipment sharing, farm workers tracking contaminated feces into houses, and poor carcass disposal.Over short distances, virus particles might even have traveled on wind-blown dust, Martin said.Genetic analysis of the virus indicates that, unlike 2015, farm-to-farm spread has not been a problem this year.“There’s not a connection between facilities, indicating that biosecurity is relatively strong between farms, but there are some breakdowns on the farm,” Brightbill said.In response to the 2015 outbreak, Pennsylvania implemented rules for cleaning and disinfecting conveyances holding poultry products or litter. That rule remains an important safeguard against farm-to-farm transmission.“I firmly believe it’s only the staunch biosecurity that’s been implemented in Pennsylvania to date that’s protecting our state,” Brightbill said.Poultry farmers should continue to guard against all possible avenues of transmission. Farm visitors should be limited, and trucks that need to come onto the farm should have their wheels washed.To reduce the risk of the virus going airborne, vegetative buffers can be planted around exhaust fans, Martin said.It’s also particularly important that farmers change their clothes and footwear when crossing the line of separation in the entrance of the poultry house.“Biosecurity should be done every day. It’s just that when we have migrations of birds that we know are carrying a disease, we have to be extra cautious,” Martin said.Farmers should also make sure their biosecurity plans are up to date and have been reviewed by the state Department of Agriculture.A biosecurity plan is essential for obtaining movement permits during an outbreak and for getting an indemnity for birds that are depopulated, Davison said.When Will It End?It’s impossible to know when the current high risk period for avian influenza will subside, but again 2015 offers some possibilities.That outbreak ended in June, partly because the wild bird migration was over and partly because Midwestern farms got very strict about protecting their flocks.Farms found holes in their biosecurity they hadn’t previously considered, such as watering their flocks from ponds that wild birds had visited, Martin said.Some experts are predicting that the current outbreak could persist in wild birds for up to 18 months. Cases might decrease in the summer heat only to increase again in the winter.“This is going to be an extended marathon. We’re just in the first leg,” Brightbill said.Since the last big avian influenza outbreak in poultry, Americans have experienced a human disease pandemic, with successive waves of infection driven by new variants.Martin sees COVID-19 as a reminder that, even if a disease recedes as a threat, it can eventually flare up again.“We always need to be prepared because birds migrate two times a year,” he said. “There’s a spring migration and a fall migration, and so we need to be on our toes.”To learn about the symptoms of avian influenza in poultry, go to bit.ly/SymptomsHPAI.To report a suspected outbreak of avian influenza, call the appropriate phone number at bit.ly/ReportHPAI.

The new fear is driven by the discovery announced Feb. 9, 2022, of the virus infecting a commercial turkey flock in Indiana and now Wisconsin. Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo After state agriculture officials confirmed the presence of bird flu in Wisconsin, one poultry management expert shared safety tips for poultry farmers and what risk exists to humans.Ron Kean, a faculty associate and extension specialist in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Animal and Dairy Sciences, also explained what costs farmers can and cannot get covered if the flu hits their farm.The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced March 14 that for the first time since 2015, officials confirmed the presence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza at a commercial egg-laying facility in Jefferson County.

Agriculture officials said last week that nearly 3 million laying hens needed to be culled.Kean joined WPR’s “The Morning Show” on Friday to answer several questions about transmission, prevention measures and possible effects on egg prices.The following has been edited for clarity and brevity. Kate Archer Kent: Is there a risk of virus transmission from live birds to people? Ron Kean: At this point, no. There have been a few rare situations, especially in some Asian countries, where a few people have gotten influenza from it. But they’re usually in very close contact with the birds. So, for a person buying chicken or eggs, there’s, I would say, no risk. Ron Kean. Photo courtesy UW-Madison KAK: There are different strains of avian flu. The one circulating now is H5N1. How significant are the differences in bird flu strains? RK: Quite significant. We mentioned this was high pathogenic. There are low pathogenic strains that really cause almost no symptoms in many cases. This H5 typically is one of the worst ones. And so, this is one reason we try to get rid of it as quickly as we can.KAK: What is the status of incidents in Wisconsin? RK: As far as we know, that’s the only one. Let’s hope it stays that way. The state agriculture department and the U.S. Department of Agriculture will both be working, checking other farms and poultry flocks in that area. So, hopefully we can nip it in the bud.KAK: What can you tell us about the spread as you watch it nationwide this year? And how does it compare to the last big outbreak in 2015?RK: It’s quite widespread this year … I think one difference from 2015 (is) we’re seeing quite a few more backyard flocks and small flocks testing positive this year. There were some in 2015, but by and large it was mostly commercial flocks.I think there’s also been a lot more positive tests in wild birds this time. So, I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but there seems to be a lot more wild birds carrying it.KAK: What are the dangers to wild birds, especially at this time of migration? RK: Some of the wild birds, especially some of the ducks and geese, seem to be able to carry this virus without too many symptoms themselves, which is kind of bad for us because that continues to spread it around. But (with) some of the other birds, there have been some deaths. I believe I’ve seen some pelicans have died. I think I saw a vulture was one of them that had died. So, it does cause death in wild birds, as well.KAK: How could a small backyard flock get this virus? RK: We think that the most common spread is from the wild birds. They can spread this virus in their nasal secretions, saliva and feces, which is a little different for a respiratory virus. But it does also spread in their feces. If you’ve got co-mingling with wild ducks and geese, especially, that’s certainly a risk that the birds would pick it up there.KAK: How can a hobby or commercial farmer know if their flock has the avian flu? RK: This one does seem to be pretty lethal. So, probably you’ll see sudden deaths in the flock. Some other things: There can be some swelling around the head, respiratory problems or sneezing. You might see some purple coloration because of hemorrhaging. One thing I’ve heard from some is just a real lethargy and (they) stop eating and drinking. So, if you see that in multiple birds, I would get a little concerned.KAK: What steps can poultry farmers or others take to prevent their flock from contracting avian flu?RK: The key thing, as far as we know, is that this is spreading from wild birds. And so, anything you can do to prevent contact between those wild birds and your domestic birds is key. Ideally, we would keep birds inside, and that would help a lot. However, that isn’t the only solution because some of these large facilities that have tested positive, I’m sure, were inside. But limiting that contact is a key thing. So, even if your birds are outside, doing things to keep them away from wild birds (and) keeping feed and water inside so it doesn’t attract wild birds would be something to consider.KAK: How does the government pay poultry farmers who lost their entire enterprise to bird flu?RK: It is a massive expense. The USDA has an indemnity program. Once you test positive, they will pay for birds that have to be euthanized. The goal is to euthanize those birds that are potentially carrying (the flu) as quickly as possible. They will pay for those birds. They don’t pay for future production and things like that. So, there is quite a loss there, even though the cost of the birds is covered.KAK: What do you think this could do to egg prices and the cost for poultry products?RK: That depends a lot on how widespread it becomes. In 2015, we did see quite an increase in egg prices. The chicken meat wasn’t severely affected at that time. We did see quite a loss in turkeys, so turkey prices went up. So, we’ll see. If a lot of farms contract this, then we could see some real increases in price.

At the time, no one knew that influenza was caused by a virus, and "flu" was a catchall term for a suite of infectious respiratory symptoms. But one German researcher thought he had cracked the case when he pegged the disease to a new bacterium in 1893, and his mistake turned out to be momentous.Photograph by Hulton-Deutsch Collection, Corbis via GettyByJen PinkowskiMarch 21, 2022•15 min readIn 1892 a prominent German bacteriologist named Richard Pfeiffer made a mistake—one that would have an enormous impact on the pandemic of 1918 and the next century of medicine.In the late 19th century scientists had begun to draw connections between microorganisms and human illnesses. But no one had convincingly linked a specific pathogen to influenza, which back then was essentially a catchall term for a suite of infectious respiratory symptoms that had swept through populations for millennia.To solve the mystery, Pfeiffer was examining sputum from 31 patients who had died in the flu pandemic of 1889-90, which killed about a million people worldwide. That’s when he discovered a new type of bacterium. “The influenza bacilli appear as tiny little rodlets,” he reported in the British Medical Journal in January 1892, and he found them exclusively in pandemic victims. “In view of these results, I consider myself justified in pronouncing the bacilli just described to be the exciting causes of influenza.”He named the bacterium Bacillus influenzae, but it quickly became known known as Pfeiffer’s bacillus. After all, Pfeiffer was chief of the Scientific Section of the Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases and a protégé of Robert Koch, a microbiology pioneer. His stature was such that people readily believed him. This was still the case 26 years later, in 1918, when people began dying at alarming rates from an infectious respiratory disease.A scanning electron microscope image shows Haemophilus influenzae, the microbe formerly known as Pfeiffer's bacillus. German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer discovered the bacteria and found them only in flu victims. “In view of these results, I consider myself justified in pronouncing the bacilli just described to be the exciting causes of influenza,” he wrote in 1892.Photograph by David M. Phillips, Science SourcePfeiffer (seen here standing) was a protégé of Robert Koch (seen seated in his study), the founder of bacteriology and discoverer of the bacteria that cause cholera and tuberculosis.Photograph by Bettmann Collection via Getty ImagesWe now know that a flu virus, not a bacterium, caused the infamous pandemic. But in 1918 no one knew the flu virus existed. Instead, scientists of the era initially blamed the deadly scourge on Pfeiffer’s bacillus.Today Pfeiffer’s story is a potent reminder of the challenges scientists face when a novel microscopic threat emerges. Efforts to pin down the connection between the bacterium and the rapidly spreading disease led to many frustrations and setbacks, including multiple failed attempts to develop an effective vaccine. By summer 1919 tens of millions were dead across the globe, and scientists still did not agree on what, exactly, had killed them.Still, the mistake and its consequences had a lasting effect on science and medicine, ultimately generating new standards for research and drug development, some of which are still in place today. The scientists working during the 1918 pandemic “were very thoughtful, smart, hard-working people, doing their very best, using their knowledge base and their technology,” says Jeffrey Taubenberger, head of viral pathogenesis and evolution at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The work led to new treatments for other diseases, hastened the formation of national and global public health institutions, and left us better prepared to deal with modern pandemics, including COVID-19.‘Not quite sure what we know’Though the disease is erroneously called the Spanish flu, it first appeared at a U.S. Army base in Kansas, where more than 56,000 soldiers were destined for the trenches of World War I. The pathogen quickly spread to other Army camps, and hundreds of thousands of infected soldiers were subsequently shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. By that summer terrible outbreaks were happening around the world.In September 1918 then-U.S. Surgeon General Rupert Blue issued guidelines for physicians dealing with the pandemic titled: “Infectious agent—the bacillus of Pfeiffer.” That prompted another misstep: Teams across the nation begin concocting vaccines based on the bacterium.Nurses and an orderly attend to patients in the influenza ward at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C. By summer 1919 tens of millions were dead across the globe due to the flu pandemic, and scientists still did not agree on what, exactly, had killed them.Photograph by GHI, Universal History Archive, Universal Images Group via GettyYet in October 1918 alone, more than 200,000 people in the U.S. died from the mysterious new flu, including scores of vaccine recipients.To figure out why vaccines were failing to prevent deaths, physicians and pathologists collected samples from the lungs of the living and the dead and analyzed them in their labs. They found teeming colonies of Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria—but much less of Pfeiffer’s bacillus. Confoundingly, they also found Pfeiffer’s bacillus in many healthy people.The Public Health Service and the U.S. Navy conducted more audacious experiments on enlisted volunteers in late 1918. The researchers first sprayed a pure culture of Pfeiffer’s bacillus into volunteers’ noses. When none of them got sick, “we became bolder,” prominent public health official Milton Rosenau recounted in an August 1919 publication.The team had volunteers and influenza patients come together “muzzle to muzzle,” and the ill patients exhaled into the open mouths of the volunteers. Then they coughed in the volunteers’ faces five times. “I may say that the volunteers were perfectly splendid about carrying out the technic of these experiments,” Rosenau noted. “They were inspired with the thought that they might help others.” The researchers also sprayed a filtered solution made from 13 strains of Pfeiffer’s bacillus into the volunteers’ throats and eyes, and later injected the volunteers with blood from flu patients.No one got sick.Rosenau didn’t draw any conclusions, though, and only underscored the mystery they faced: “We entered the outbreak with a notion that we knew the cause of the disease. Perhaps, if we have learned anything, it is that we are not quite sure what we know.”Finding the real flu virusSome teams insisted that Pfeiffer’s bacillus vaccines were effective—physicians in New Orleans, for example, claimed theirs prevented 90 percent of flu infections. For others, the bacterium had fallen further out of favor. By the time a third wave of the pandemic hit in early 1919, vaccines containing a mixture of dead bacteria were more common than ones purely focused on Pfeiffer’s bacillus. These treatments didn’t help with the flu, but they seem to have reduced overall fatalities by preventing bacterial pneumonia, a common secondary infection during the pandemic.For a worried public, confusion reigned about what really caused the flu.Multiple groups developed and administered vaccines during the 1918 flu, many of them based on the assumption that Pfeiffer’s bacillus caused the disease. Other vaccines contained a mixture of dead Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, and while they didn't help against the flu, they do seem to have reduced deaths from secondary infections.Photograph by Hulton Archive, Getty ImagesIn March 1919 the Kansas City Kansan spoke to Noble P. Sherwood, head of the University of Kansas’s bacteriology department, about reports that his team had identified the actual flu germ. He denied it. “The ‘flu’,” the newspaper snarked, “has the scientific world up in a tree, out on a limb, in deep water, gagged, bound hand and foot, yet waving both hands and waving wildly for help.” (Find out what lessons we can learn from the history of 1918 flu fatigue.)Flu deaths finally returned to pre-pandemic levels in 1921, and for the next nine years scientists tried—and failed—to definitively rule out Pfeiffer’s bacillus as the causative agent, in part because seasonal flu continued to ravage communities who had no effective treatments. Even a 500-page global review of all pandemic-related scientific papers could only conclude that “it cannot be legitimately deduced that the Pfeiffer bacillus … either is the cause or not the cause of influenza,” as bacteriologist Edwin Jordan wrote in 1927.Things finally turned around in 1930, when virologist Richard Shope isolated the first known flu virus in sick pigs in Iowa. Inspired by Shope, scientists in the U.K. swabbed the throats of flu-stricken people and injected a filtered fluid into ferrets. The animals promptly fell ill. The team also swabbed Pfeiffer’s bacillus into the animals’ noses, and it had no effect.You May Also LikeSCIENCECOVID-19 has tested us. Will we be ready for the next pandemic?HISTORY MAGAZINEInside the swift, deadly history of the Spanish Flu pandemicMAGAZINEHow devastating pandemics change us“We consider that the evidence given above strongly suggests that there is a virus element in epidemic influenza,” the English researchers wrote in 1933.They were right. It had taken roughly 40 years, thousands of studies, and tens of millions of deaths, but scientists had finally found the real cause of pandemic influenza. A full 72 years later, in 2005, Taubenberger and his colleagues were able to pinpoint the deadly strain that caused the 1918 pandemic using tissues from a woman preserved in Alaskan permafrost. It was H1N1, and it had leapt from birds to humans.H1N1 is the ancestor of some seasonal flu viruses that have infected us since, says Taubenberger, and it gets the blame for many flu-related fevers, shivers, coughs, and lost days of work.“So in a sense, we’re still in the 1918 flu era more than a hundred years later. That’s a really profound thing for me,” he says. “At least 50 million people died in the pandemic in 1918, but tens of millions of people have died in the past century because of seasonal flu and subsequent pandemics—all because of this single introduction of a virus a hundred years ago.”It took roughly 40 years, but scientists eventually discovered the viral strain that caused the 1918 pandemic, seen here in an image taken via transmission electron microscopy.Photograph by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Science SourceCasting a long shadowDespite the chaos it caused in 1918—or arguably because of it—Pfeiffer’s bacillus had a lasting effect on medicine and microbiology.Then as now, researchers trying to control the pandemic were publishing their findings about causes and treatments at a frantic pace. But in 1918 it was much harder to compare results, let alone understand the big picture. The public health community at the time had no standardized methods of research or testing, virtually no peer review, and no common protocols for clinical trials. Some of the vaccine trials for the 1918 flu were conducted on vulnerable populations, including mentally ill patients, orphans, and prisoners.In response, the American Public Health Association issued the nation’s first guidelines for conducting vaccine trials in January 1919. The guide included some of the most foundational practices used today, such as having a control group—a set of participants who don’t get the experimental treatment and so serve as a baseline—and matching participants in the control and experimental groups by gender, age, and prior exposure.In 1928 “a very bad year of seasonal influenza got Congress worried,” so they created the National Institutes of Health, says historian John Barry, author of The Great Influenza. “Had 1918 not sensitized them, it wouldn’t have happened.”Similarly spurred by the missteps of the 1918 pandemic, the World Health Organization established a network of 26 laboratories around the world called the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System in 1952. Taubenberger says scientists were thus better prepared when the H2N2 pandemic hit in 1957. They were ready with antibiotics to treat the secondary infections that had been so devastating in 1918, and they could quickly create effective vaccines for the specific strain.Also, one upside of chasing down Pfeiffer’s bacillus—also known as Haemophilus influenzae, or H. flu—was that researchers learned more about it. In 1929 a young bacteriologist named Margaret Pittman studied more than 500 mucus samples from Rockefeller Hospital patients. She was trying to definitively establish or completely sever the link between the bacterium and the flu, and she didn’t do either. But she did discover six encapsulated strains of H. flu. Humans are H. flu’s only host, and some strains live harmlessly in our noses and throats. But one strain, now known as Hib, is especially pathogenic.Pittman’s work revealed Hib as the cause of a variety of serious conditions, including influenzal meningitis, which can lead to death or lifelong disabilities. Soon after her discovery, Pittman developed a serum from horse blood that saved tens of thousands of children and made her internationally famous. Her insights were instrumental in the creation of the Hib vaccine 50 years later, which has since virtually eradicated Hib diseases wherever it’s been introduced.An historic coronavirus, too?Recently scientists have found hints that Pfeiffer’s mistake may not have been the only error associated with the 1889 pandemic. If they’re right, the discovery could have implications for the COVID-19 pandemic.In a 2005 paper Belgian researcher Leen Vijgen traced the most common ancestor of a bovine coronavirus and the human coronavirus CO43 to around 1890, when it seems to have leapt from cows to people. Other scientists have since argued that the disease seen in 1889 shares similar symptoms to those of COVID-19, including the loss of taste and smell, seizures, and long recovery periods.Perhaps, they say, the 1889 pandemic was not caused by a flu virus at all, but by the CO43 coronavirus. Teasing out the truth may offer a window into the future of SARS-CoV-2; for one, the strain of CO43 circulating today causes only mild symptoms.Taubenberger and his NIAID colleague David Morens have also set their sights on the 1889 pandemic. They’re seeking tissue samples from the period, which have so far proven elusive.“It’s very, very hard to find autopsy samples from before 1918,” Taubenberger says. “We have been working very hard with other collaborators around the world to find such cases, and we’ve been analyzing autopsy cases going back to about 1907 or so. No one is aware of any tissues from the 1890s. But that's not to say they don’t exist somewhere.”Taubenberger adds that it’s a modern mistake to think the researchers working during past pandemics were missing the obvious: Despite having vastly better technology and improved understanding of how viruses cause disease, we’re still in the dark about some aspects of COVID-19, including its origins, its long-term impacts on the body, and its ultimate evolutionary trajectory. Today’s scientists have also had to navigate conflicting data about how COVID-19 spreads and how best to control it.“If you don’t know what the unknowns are, you can’t look for them,” Taubenberger says. “We don’t know what our unknowns are. A hundred years from now, there are definitely going to be insights that should have been quote-unquote ‘obvious’ to us now. And that’s perfectly fine. That’s the way of science.”Related TopicsINFLUENZAEPIDEMICSMICROBIOLOGYPUBLIC HEALTHMODERN HISTORYYou May Also LikeSCIENCEShould you be concerned about bird flu in your milk?SCIENCEIs the 5-second rule true?

The highly virulent avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 can better escape host innate immune responses than the less virulent seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, we report a mechanism by which transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated suppression of innate immunity occurs post AIV infection. By using cell lines, mouse lungs, and patient PBMCs, we showed that genes on the complementary strand (“trans” genes) influenced by TRT were involved in the disruption of host antiviral responses during AIV infection. The trans-TRT enhanced viral lethality, and TRT abolishment increased cell viability and STAT1/2 expression. The viral NS1 protein directly bound to SSU72, and degradation of SSU72 induced TRT. SSU72 overexpression reduced TRT and alleviated mouse lung injury. Our results suggest that AIVs infection induce TRT by reducing SSU72 expression, thereby impairing host immune responses, a molecular mechanism acting through the NS1-SSU72-trans-TRT-STAT1/2 axis. Thus, restoration of SSU72 expression might be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics.

The mortality rate in patients infected with AIVs such as H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 is higher than that in those infected with seasonal influenza viruses [5, 6]. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which influenza viruses infect their hosts and how the host immune system responds to these viruses is important for developing adequate preventive strategies for pandemics.Although innate immune responses play critical antiviral roles, viruses can escape these responses, leading to high mortality rates [7]. Influenza viruses suppress antiviral innate immune responses, particularly the interferon (IFN)-β–Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, via translation of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), a multifunctional immunosuppressive factor [8]. NS1 targets JAK/STAT by reducing IFN signaling [9], binds to cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30), and inhibits mRNA cleavage at the poly(A) binding site [10]. NS1 interacts with cellular mRNA and the spliceosome component U6 snRNA, which inhibits the export of cellular RNAs from the nucleus [11]; inhibits the cellular antiviral 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase–RNase L pathway, RNA-dependent protein kinase pathway, and retinoic acid-induced gene I expression [9, 12, 13]; and upregulates the JAK/STAT inhibitors SOCS1 and SOCS3 [14, 15]. NS1 could be the factor underlying viral virulence, as it can potentially inhibit the polyadenylation of cellular pre-mRNAs [16].Herein, we report a novel mechanism by which lethal AIVs might suppress innate immunity, namely, transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated repression of innate immunity. In TRT, transcription does not faithfully stop at the transcription termination site (TTS) but continues, resulting in the synthesis of RNA transcripts of up to dozens of kilobases [17]. Many studies have suggested that the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphatase SSU72 is involved in transcription termination [18,19,20]; SSU72 was first discovered in a screen for suppressors of transcription factor IIB in yeast [21] and was shown to be essential for transcription termination of small nucleolar RNAs and specific mRNAs in yeast [22]. More recently, ChIP-seq and GRO-seq analyses revealed that SSU72 has a minor peak in the terminator region in human embryonic stem cells and thus has a modest effect on transcription termination [23]. In eukaryotic cells, transcription is precisely regulated through cleavage and poly(A) signals [24]. Abnormal TRT has been reported in HIV-1 [25], HSV-1 [26], and Leishmania infections [27] as well as in renal carcinoma [28] and under osmotic stress [29, 30]; however, the underlying mechanism is not yet known.Recent studies have revealed that the influenza A virus NS1 protein induces global transcriptional defects at the 3′ ends of genes and causes global TRT, which can dysregulate host transcription [31]. Moreover, NS1-induced TRT may alter the three-dimensional organization of downstream chromatin [32]. Disruption of transcription termination was shown to be widespread and continuous and to extend from the gene coding sequence. The presence of RNA polymerase II in the TRT region was shown to influence spatial chromatin interactions, and TRT was shown to be involved in cohesion-mediated interactions of chromatin with gene bodies [32]. Here, we explored the functions of TRT in innate immune responses and immune escape upon AIV infection.Material and methodsEthics statementAll procedures in studies involving human participants were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees, and verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients or family members of patients.All animal studies were conducted following the National Guidelines for the Care of Laboratory Animals and performed in accordance with institutional regulations and with the approval of experimental protocols by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences.Cell lines and cell cultureThe human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and H1650, human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, and human embryonic kidney cell lines HEK293 and HEK293T were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD, USA). Adult human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF-a) cells were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells, and Jurkat human T lymphocyte cells were purchased from the Peking Union Medical College Cell Culture Center (Beijing, China).A549 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., South Logan, UT, USA); MDCK, H1650, HeLa, HEK293, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA); peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), THP-1, and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone Laboratories; cat. no. SH30027.01); and HPF-a cells were cultured in fibroblast medium (ScienCell Research Laboratories; cat. no. 2301). Ham’s F-12 medium, DMEM, and RPMI-1640 medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). Fibroblast medium was supplemented with 10 mL of FBS, 5 mL of fibroblast growth supplement, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). All cell types were cultured in a 37 °C incubator in 5% CO2. Poly-l-lysine-coated culture vessels (2 μg/cm2) were used to culture HPF-a cells.VirusesThe A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) influenza virus and A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) influenza virus were obtained from the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The A/Beijing/CAS0001/2009(H1N1), A/Beijing/CAS0001/2007(H3N2), A/Anhui/1/2005 (H5N1), A/Shenzhen/Th002/2016(H5N6), and A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) viruses were obtained from CAS Center for Influenza Research and Early-warning (CASCIRE). All live virus experiments were performed at biosafety level 3 facilities following governmental and institutional guidelines. Viruses were propagated by inoculation into 10- to 11-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic route. Allantoic fluid (AF) was collected from the eggs after 2-3 days of incubation at 37 °C; the viral titer was determined in MDCK cells by using the Reed–Muench method and is expressed as TCID50 per milliliter as previously described [33]. The titrated viruses were stored at −80 °C.Separation of PBMCsBlood samples were collected from patients with pneumonia and healthy controls at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Blood samples from H1N1-infected patients were collected at the General Hospital of the PLA. In addition, blood was also obtained from patients admitted to Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital with avian influenza (H5N6/H7N9) infection (detailed patient information is shown in Supplementary Table 2). Four samples from H7N9-infected patients and eleven samples from H7N9-infected patients were collected during the first and second weeks of disease onset, respectively. Eleven samples from H7N9-infected patients were collected more than two weeks after disease onset. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.Blood samples were collected into EDTA anticoagulant tubes, and PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Kent, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (STEMCELL Technologies; cat. no. 07851).RNA-seq and data analysisTotal RNA was extracted from cells or tissues by using Invitrogen TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (PE125). All RNA-seq analyses were performed by strand-specific transcriptome sequencing with the deoxy-UTP (dUTP) strand marking protocol.We used FastQC (version 0.11.2) to control the read quality of the RNA-seq data. Bowtie2 (version 2.1.0) and TopHat2 (version 2.0.11) were used to align strand-specific paired-end RNA-seq reads from human cell lines, PBMCs, and tissue samples from patients infected with seasonal H1N1 or avian-origin H7N9/H5N6 influenza A virus to the human genome (version hg19, http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html). Strand-specific paired-end RNA-seq reads from mouse tissue samples were mapped to the mouse genome (version mmc10, http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html). Influenza A virus genomic coding sequences (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/INFLUENZA/) encoding neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) were used to confirm viral infection in cell lines and in mouse and human tissue samples. Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) was used to assemble transcription units and calculate gene expression levels in fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped (FPKM). We used Cuffmerge (version 2.2.1) and Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1) to compare the FPKM levels between samples.TRT definitionTRT genes are defined as genes with abnormal transcription in which the abnormal transcription signal has passed the TTS. We defined TRT-influenced genes as the nearest downstream genes influenced by TRT genes.TRT can affect the expression of the nearest downstream genes via two mechanisms: affecting the TRT-influenced gene encoded on the same DNA strand (cis-TRT) or that encoded on the complementary DNA strand (trans-TRT).Calculation of TRT gene expressionWe filtered 11,784 cis-gene pairs and 5052 trans-gene pairs from the human genome.The standard for cis-TRT genes was calculated as follows: (1) The cis-TRT gene expression FPKM value was greater than 2. (2) The fold change (FC) in the expression level of the cis-TRT region was greater than 5 (upregulated) relative to the control group. FC in the expression of a cis-TRT region = Vc(Xji)/Vc(X0i), i = 1, 2, 3,…, nc (number of cis-genes) j = 1, 2, 3,…, m (number of genes in the test group) where Vc(Xji) represents the expression level of the cis-TRT region of a particular gene X in one of the test groups and Vc(X0i) represents the expression level of the cis-TRT region of a particular gene X in the control group. The standards for trans-TRT genes calculated from trans-gene pairs were similar to those for cis-TRT genes, as follows: (1) The trans-TRT gene expression FPKM value was greater than 2. (2) The FC in the expression level of the trans-TRT region was greater than 5 (upregulated) relative to that in the control group. FC in the expression of a trans-TRT region = Vt(Yjk)/Vt(Y0k), k = 1, 2, 3,…, nt (number of trans-genes) j = 1, 2, 3,…, m (number of genes in the test group) where Vt(Yjk) represents the expression level of the trans-TRT region of a particular gene Y in one of the test groups, and Vt(Y0k) represents the expression level of the trans-TRT region of a particular gene Y in the control group. Calculation of TRT region expressionCis-TRT region expression levels were calculated using the following formula:Vc(Xi) = Rc(Xi)/(Tc × Lc(Xi)), i = 1, 2, 3,…, nc (number of cis-genes) where Vc(Xi) represents the expression level of the cis-TRT region of a particular gene X; Rc(Xi) represents the RNA-seq read count mapped to the cis-TRT region; Tc represents the total RNA-seq read count (in millions) mapped to all 11,784 cis-gene pairs and cis-TRT regions; and Lc(Xi) denotes the length (in kb) of the cis-TRT region, which extends from the TTS of the cis-TRT gene to the TTS of the nearest cis-TRT-influenced gene on the same DNA strand.The following formula was used to calculate trans-TRT region expression levels:Vt(Yi) = Rt (Yk)/(Tt × Lt(Yk)), k = 1, 2, 3,…, nt (number of trans-genes) where Vt(Yk) represents the expression level of the trans-TRT region of a particular gene Y; Rt(Yk) represents the RNA-seq read count mapped to the particular trans-TRT region; Tt represents the total RNA-seq read count (in millions) mapped to all 5052 trans-gene pairs and trans-TRT regions; and Lt(Yk) denotes the length (in kb) of the trans-TRT region, which starts at the TTS of the trans-TRT gene and extends to the TTS of the nearest trans-TRT-influenced gene on the complementary DNA strand.Calculation TRT-influenced gene expressionWe selected cis-TRT-influenced genes from the cis-gene pairs based on the following criteria: (1) The expression level of the cis-TRT-influenced gene in the control group was greater than 2. (2) The expression of the cis-TRT-influenced gene was downregulated with a FC of >1.5 relative to that in the control group. FC in the expression of a cis-TRT-influenced gene = Fc(P0i)/Fc(P ji), i = 1, 2, 3,…, nc (number of cis-genes) j = 1, 2, 3,…, m (number of genes in the test group) where Fc(P ji) represents the expression level of a cis-TRT-influenced gene of a particular gene P in one of the test groups, and Fc(P0i) represents the expression level of the cis-TRT-influenced gene of a particular gene P in the control group. (3) The expression of the cis-TRT region was upregulated with a FC of >5 relative to that in the control group. The same criteria used for cis-TRT genes were used. We used the following criteria to select trans-TRT-influenced genes from the trans-gene pairs: (1) The expression level of the trans-TRT-influenced gene in the control group was greater than 2. (2) The expression level of the trans-TRT-influenced gene was downregulated with a FC of >1.5 relative to that in the control group. FC in the expression of a trans-TRT-influenced gene = Ft(Q0k)/Ft(Q jk), k = 1, 2, 3,…, nt (number of trans-genes) j = 1, 2, 3,…, m (number of genes in the test group) where Ft(Qjk) represents the expression level of a trans-TRT-influenced gene of a particular gene Q in one of the test groups, and Ft(Q0k) represents the expression level of a trans-TRT-influenced gene of a particular gene Q in the control group. (3) The expression of the trans-TRT region was upregulated with a FC of >5 relative to that in the control group. The same criteria used for trans-TRT genes were used. Analysis of gene profiles and RNA-seq coverageWe used BEDtools (version 2.23.0) to analyze gene profiles. We screened for genes without genes on the complementary DNA strand to identify downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FC > 2) between the virus-infected and control groups. We divided the gene body (the region between the transcription start site (TSS) and TTS) of each DEG into 60 equally sized bins and then added the flanking antisense strand regions 4 kb upstream of the TSS and 4 kb downstream of the TTS in 100-bp windows. The normalized expression levels in each bin or window were calculated using Python (version 2.7.3, https://www.python.org/) and its default package NumPy. For the trans-gene pairs GLS–STAT1 and IL23A–STAT2, RNA expression levels in the gene bodies, intergenic regions, and gene flanking regions upstream of the TSSs were combined into 50-bp windows.Gene functional enrichment analysisWe used MetaCore (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA, USA) software for functional and pathway enrichment analyses of TRT-influenced genes. Two-tailed P values and Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted P values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.PTM analysisA549 cells were treated with the A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004 (H5N1) virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 4 or with an equal volume of vehicle for 18 h and were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Disulfide bonds in equal amounts of protein lysate (10 mg/sample) were reduced by adding dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 4.5 mM. Each sample was then mixed in the well and was placed in a 55 °C incubator for 30 min. The solution was briefly cooled on ice to room temperature, and iodoacetamide solution (100 mM, one-tenth volume) was then added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The sample was sufficiently mixed, incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, and diluted 4-fold with 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) to a final urea concentration of approximately 2 M. Subsequently, a one-hundredth volume of a 1 mg/mL trypsin-TPCK (Worthington, LS003744) stock solution in 1 mM HCl was added, and the mixture was digested overnight at RT with mixing. After digestion, a one-twentieth volume of 20% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to the digested sample to a final concentration of 1%. The pH was checked by spotting a small amount of the peptide sample onto a pH strip to ensure that the pH was less than 3. After acidification, a precipitate was allowed to form by maintaining the sample on ice for 15 min. The acidified peptide solution was then centrifuged at 1780 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The peptides in the digested sample were cleaned by passing the acidified sample through a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (WAT051910; Waters) and eluting with 10 mL of 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The eluted peptide solution was frozen overnight at –80 °C and subjected to lyophilization for 2 days.An affinity matrix was prepared by incubating a ubiquitin branch motif antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; cat. no. 3925) with 30 µL of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Inc, Little Falls, NJ, USA). The samples were washed four times with 1× PBS after antibody binding. The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 1.4 mL of 1× IAP buffer [50 mM MOPS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 50 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.2)]. The peptide solution was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The antibody beads were mixed with the peptide solution, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 1 mL of 1× IAP buffer and three times with 1 mL of HPLC-grade water. The enriched peptides were eluted from the antibody beads by incubation in 50 µL of 0.15% TFA for 10 min at room temperature with gentle mixing; the elution step was then repeated, and the eluents were combined.The enriched peptides were cleaned in a StageTip made in-house by placing two layers of C18 EmporeTM material into a 10 µL pipette tip. The StageTip was equilibrated by passing 50 µL of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA, followed by two passages of 50 µL of 0.1% TFA, through the tip by centrifuging the tip at 1500 × g for 1 min. The eluted peptide solution was passed through the StageTip by two rounds of centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min each, and the StageTip was then washed twice in 50 µL of 0.1% TFA by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 1 min each. The peptides were eluted from the StageTip by passing 10 µL of 40% ACN in 0.1% TFA through the tip by two rounds of centrifugation at 750 × g for 1 min each. The eluent was then dried under vacuum.Each sample was dissolved in 12 µL of 0.125% formic acid and separated on a reverse-phase C18 column (75 µm inner diameter × 10 cm) packed into a PicoTip emitter (approximately 8 µm inner diameter) with Magic C18 AQ (100 Å × 5 µm; New Objective). Each sample was split, and analytical replicate injections were run to increase the number of identifications and provide metrics for analytical reproducibility of the method. A standard peptide mix (MassPREPTM Protein Digestion Standard Mix 1; Waters) was spiked into each sample (total amount, 100 fmol; 33 fmol per injection) before LC–MS/MS analysis on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy-nLC 1000 system. The peptides in each sample were separated with a linear gradient from 2% to 32% ACN over 90 min, and both MS and MS/MS data were acquired in centroid mode. For precursor analysis, the Orbitrap resolution was set to 70,000 with an AGC target of 1e [6] and a scan range of 300 to 1500 m/z. The top 20 precursors were selected for MS/MS analysis during each duty cycle with a normalized collision energy of 35.Generation and identification of recombinant virusesRecombinant viruses were generated by reverse genetics, as previouse study [34]. In brief, eight gene segments from an A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8) or PR8 backbone with the NS sequence from the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus or A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) virus were individually inserted into dual-promoter plasmids. MDCK and HEK293T cells were then cocultured at a ratio of 1:5 and transfected with 0.5 µg of each of the plasmids along with 10 µL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 11668019) in 1 mL of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the transfection mixture was removed, and 1 mL of Opti-MEM containing 2 µg/mL tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, USA) was added. After 48 h, the cell supernatant was inoculated into 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos to produce stock viruses. The rescued viruses were named as PR8 witld type (wt), PR8+H1N1-NS1, and PR8+H5N1-NS1, respectively. Each viral segment was amplified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT–qPCR) and sequenced to confirm the identity of the virus.Viral infectionIn all experiments, cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 4. Controls were treated with an equal volume of AF. A549 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well. The cells were infected with the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1), A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1), A/Beijing/CAS0001/2009(H1N1), A/Beijing/CAS0001/2007(H3N2), A/Anhui/1/2005(H5N1), A/Shenzhen/Th002/2016(H5N6), and A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9) viruses and the following three recombinant viruses: the PR8 wt, the PR8+H1N1-NS1, and the PR8+H5N1-NS1.H1650, HEK293, HEK293T, HPF-a, and HeLa cells were collected 24 h after infection with A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) or A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1), whereas THP-1 and Jurkat cells and PBMCs were collected 24 h after infection with A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) or A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1).PlasmidsTen protein-coding fragments of the H5N1 virus (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NA, M1, M2, NS1, NS2, and NP) were optimized for cDNA synthesis by using high-frequency human codons as previously described [35]. Each of these fragments was then fused to a Flag tag at the C-terminus and inserted into the Peak13 vector (provided by B. Seed, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). The protein-coding fragments of the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus were constructed using the same method.Full-length cDNAs encoding human SSU72 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_014188.2) were amplified by PCR from a cDNA library generated from A549 cells. The SSU72-Myc plasmid contained the full-length coding sequence of SSU72 without a stop codon and the Myc-tag sequence inserted into the Peak13 vector. The NS1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid contained the protein-coding fragments of H5N1 NS1 fused to GFP, which was also inserted into the Peak13 vector. All gene products were verified by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen, Beijing, China).The psPAX2 (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA; cat. no. 12260), pMD2.G (Addgene; cat. no. 12259), lentiGuide-Puro (Addgene; cat. no. 52963), pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (Addgene; cat. no. 46911), and lenti-dCAS-VP64_Blast (SAM) (Addgene; cat. no. 6142) plasmids were purchased from Addgene. SSU72 overexpression and knockdownFor SSU72 overexpression, A549 cells were transfected with a control plasmid or a plasmid encoding human SSU72 by using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche; cat. no. 6366236001) for 60 h according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were then infected with the A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) virus at an MOI of 4 for 48 h or treated with an equal volume of vehicle.For SSU72 knockdown, A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA (RiboBio) or an SSU72-specific siRNA (5ʹ-GACTCACGTGAAGCTTCCA-3ʹ) by using RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 13778075) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were then treated for 48 h with the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus, the A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) virus, or an equal volume of AF.Expression of viral protein fragmentsHEK293T cells were transfected for 48 h with plasmids containing 10 protein-coding fragments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, HA, NA, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2) from the H5N1 virus or A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus.CRISPRi cell linesMonoclonal cell lines expressing dCas9 and control gRNA or a gRNA targeting GLS-TRT or IL23A-TRT were seeded into 12-well plates (for RNA extraction and protein expression analysis) or 96-well plates (for cell viability assays) at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. After 24 h, the cells were challenged with the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus or A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) virus at an MOI of 4 or treated with an equal volume of vehicle. RNA and proteins were extracted from the 12-well plates 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after infection.Cell viability assayCell viability was determined at 24 h or 48 h after infection using an [(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)] (MTS) assay (Promega Biosciences Inc., San Luis Obispo, CA, USA; cat. no. G3582).Fluorescence in situ hybridizationIn situ hybridization of the GLS-TRT region (440 bp) and IL23A-TRT region (925 bp) was performed using a GLS-TRT probe (5′-AAGCGAATGCTATTCCCACG-3′) and an IL23A-TRT probe (5′-GCTGATTGTTGGCAAAGCC-3′), respectively. Each probe was labeled with Cy3 at the 5′ end.A549 cells grown on coverslips were treated with the A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) virus, the A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004(H5N1) virus, or an equal volume of vehicle for 24 h; washed twice with PBS; and fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with proteinase K in PK buffer [0.5 M EDTA, 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4–7.5), and 20 mg/mL proteinase K] for 10 min and treated with 0.1 M triethanolamine for 10 min. After rinsing in PBS buffer, the cells were prehybridized in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 250 µg/mL yeast RNA, and 500 µg/mL salmon sperm DNA) at RT for 1 h in a hybridization box. The prehybridization buffer was replaced with hybridization solution (containing 1 nM RNA probe), and the cells were incubated at 55 °C overnight. The cells were then washed three times with 0.2× SSC for 20 min at 40 °C, once with 0.2× SSC for 5 min at RT, and twice with Buffer B1 [0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4–7.5) and 150 mM NaCl] for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed twice with PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. P10144) and DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. D3571). Image acquisition and analysis were performed using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope system (Thornwood, NY, USA). Fluorescence was semiquantitatively assessed on the basis of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each cell.Immunofluorescence studiesHEK293T cells were grown on glass chamber slides; transfected with the SSU72-Myc, SSU72-Myc, and GFP, or SSU72-Myc and NS1-GFP expression plasmids (0.2 μg/well in 48-well plates); and fixed after 48 h with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After fixation, the cells were washed with PBS buffer and were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After the cells were washed with PBS buffer, they were blocked with blocking buffer (containing 5% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 1 h. SSU72-Myc was detected by staining the cells with an anti-Myc mAb (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 2276) and an Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (IgG) secondary antibody (1:1000; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab175473). Nuclei in all cells were labeled with Hoechst 33258 (1 ng/mL). Image acquisition and analysis were performed using a Zeiss LSM780 microscope.Lentivirus productionHEK293T cells were cultured in 15-cm plates to 70–80% confluence (approximately 1.5 × 107 cells). Then, they were cotransfected with 15 μg of the lentiviral plasmid, 15 μg of the psPAX2 plasmid (Addgene; cat. no. 12260), and 10 μg of pMD2.G plasmid (Addgene; cat. no. 12259) in the presence of a DNA transfection reagent (NEOFECT, Beijing, China). After 18 h, the medium was replaced with 25 mL of fresh complete medium. The supernatant was harvested at 48 h and 72 h, centrifuged at 1000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min to remove cells, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove debris. Finally, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 120,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, the supernatant from this step was removed, and the precipitate was dissolved in PBS and stored at −80 °C.Generation of SSU72 transgenic miceSSU72-overexpressing mice were generated by Cyagen Biosciences (Guangzhou, China) and were then bred at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College. All mice were housed in an SPF facility, and animal experiments were conducted at the Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, in accordance with governmental and institutional guidelines.In brief, C57BL/6J mouse embryos were injected with the pRP:ExSi-EF-1α-SSU72 vector containing a fragment of the mouse SSU72 gene. Pups were screened by PCR by using primers targeting SSU72 (forward: 5ʹ-GCTTTTGGAGTACGTCGTCTTTAGGT-3ʹ; reverse: 5ʹ-CCATGCTCCGATTCTGGTTACTCG-3ʹ) and Western blotting with an antibody to confirm the insertion of the SSU72 fragment and SSU72 overexpression in the lungs.Viral infection in SSU72 transgenic miceLung injury was induced via intratracheal instillation of the A/chicken/Jilin/9/2004 (H5N1)virus (106 TCID50) as previously described [36]. Control mice were treated with an equal volume of AF. Mice were killed 3 days after infection, and RNA was extracted from lung tissue for RNA-seq and RT-qPCR to detect viral replication. The lung viral titer was determined as previously described [33]. In addition, lung injury was assessed by pathological examination. Survival data were obtained and plotted on Kaplan–Meier survival curves.Assessment of lung injuryThe wet lung weight was determined to assess pulmonary edema, and the lungs were then dried in an oven at 65 °C for 24 h to determine the dry weight.For assessment of inflammatory injury, the lungs were removed from the thoracic cavity and fixed in a glass vial with 50 mL of formalin for at least 72 h. The fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin, coronally sectioned, and mounted on glass slides by using standard techniques. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by three independent pathologists who were blinded to the treatments and genotypes. Inflammatory cells were counted in 100 microscopic fields per slide, and lung injury was scored [37] based on the alveolar wall thickness, presence of hyaline membranes, and filling of the airspaces with proteinaceous debris. The score ranged from 0 to 1, where X indicated severe injury and Y indicated normal tissue.Western blot analysisCells or tissues were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 20 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, and protease inhibitors], and proteins were loaded onto a gel for electrophoretic separation and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies (described below) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (MultiSciences Lianke Biotech Co., Hangzhou, China). Antibody binding was visualized using a Kodak detection system and analyzed using Quantity One software. Primary antibodies specific for the following proteins/peptides were used: SSU72 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 12816) and STAT1 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 9172), STAT2 (1:500; Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, Texas, USA; cat. no. A303-512A-M), Flag tag (rabbit, 1:5000; MultiSciences; cat. no. LK-ab002-100), DDDDK tag (mouse, 1:5000; MBL Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada; cat. no. M185-3 L), β-actin (1:10000; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA; cat. no. A5441), and CRISPR/Cas9 (polyclonal; Diagenode Inc., Denville, NJ, USA; cat. no. C15310258).Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysiscDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of total RNA by using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 4368814), and RT–qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Kit (Roche; cat. no. 04707516001) on a LightCycler 480 PCR system. RT–qPCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Expression levels in mice were normalized to β-actin, and expression levels in human samples were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primers used for RT-qPCR are listed in Table S1.CRISPRiThe target sequence was cloned into the lentiGuide-Puro backbone (Addgene; cat. no. 52963), and two oligonucleotides were generated by BsmBI digestion. Targets were defined using http://crispr.mit.edu to design the gRNA sequence. The KRAB domain from pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (Addgene; cat. no. 46911) was cloned into the BamHI and BsrGI sites in the lenti-dCAS-VP64_Blast (SAM; Addgene; cat. no. 6142) backbone, which features VP64 domain deletion. The following primers were used: GLS-TRT gRNA forward, 5ʹ-CACCGAGGACGTAGAACAACAGCGC-3ʹ and reverse, 5ʹ-AAACTCCTGCATCTTGTTGTCGCGC-3ʹ; and IL23A-TRT gRNA forward, 5ʹ-CACCGCCCCTGGTGTATAGAATAAC-3ʹ and reverse, 5ʹ-AAACGTTATTCTATACACCAGGGGC-3ʹ. The lentiGuide-sgRNA-Puro and lenti-dCAS-KRAB vectors were packaged into lentiviruses. A549 cells were infected with the lenti-dCAS-KRAB lentiviruses, and monoclonal cell lines were screened for transductants showing stable dCAS9 protein expression. Stably transduced dCas9-expressing cells were infected with lentivirus expressing control gRNA, GLS-TRT gRNA, or IL23A-TRT gRNA for 48 h and were then incubated with puromycin (2 μg/mL) to screen for monoclonal cell lines.Chromatin immunoprecipitationChromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Plus Sonicator with 10 high-power pulse cycles (15 s on and 15 s off) according to the protocols for the EZ-Magna ChIP A Kit (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA; cat. no. 17-408). Fragmented chromatin was diluted with ChIP dilution buffer [0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, and 16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)] and incubated with 2 μL of a Cas9-ChIP-grade antibody (Diagenode; cat. no. C15310258) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Next, 20 μL of protein A/G magnetic beads (Millipore; cat. no. 16-663) was added, and the samples were incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with each of the following buffers: low-salt immune complex wash buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 150 mM NaCl], LiCl wash buffer [0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)], and TE (10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Chromatin was eluted by incubation with elution buffer (0.2% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3 supplemented with fresh 5 mM DTT) at 65 °C for 120 min. After reversal of crosslinking, the samples were digested with proteinase K and RNase, and DNA was extracted by ethanol precipitation.Nuclear protein extraction and immunoprecipitationHEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Flag-tagged NS1 from the H5N1 virus or with control plasmid and cultured in 10-cm dishes. After 48 h, nuclear proteins were extracted using a Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China; cat. no. P0028).Nuclear proteins were incubated with an anti-Flag or isotype control antibody (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. Next, 20 μL of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz, CA, USA; cat. no. sc2001) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with TBS buffer [50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl] and boiled for 5 min in 60 μL of 2× loading buffer. Protein samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel for electrophoretic separation, and proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% (m/v) nonfat milk in TBS-Tris buffer and sequentially incubated with primary antibodies (see the antibodies used for Western blot analysis described above) overnight and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Secondary antibody binding was detected using a film exposure detection system (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). Detection of a second primary antibody was performed by stripping the nitrocellulose membrane with stripping buffer (1% SDS and 25 mM glycine, pH 2.0) and then incubating it with another primary antibody.Statistical analysisSPSS 16.0 for Windows (IBM, Chicago, USA) was used for statistical analyses. We used the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to test for normality. ANOVA was used to determine intergroup differences in normally distributed data, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine intergroup differences in skewed data, and the chi-squared test was used to determine differences in categorical data. Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank linear correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between cell viability and TRT, and a least squares second-order polynomial was used to fit nonlinear relationships between the gene count and cell viability or viral replication. The Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to correct for multiple testing in R software. A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsTRT induced by AIV infection is associated with cell lethalityTo explore the transcriptional changes induced by influenza A virus infection, we performed RNA-seq on human A549 lung carcinoma cells infected with H1N1, H5N1, or H7N9 virus. TRT was higher in cells infected with AIVs (H5N1 and H7N9) than in control cells, but no significant difference was detected between H1N1-infected cells and control cells (Figs. 1A and S1A–C). The number of genes with TRT was higher in H5N1- and H7N9-infected cells than in H1N1-infected cells (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1TRT enhanced by avian influenza A virus infection represses genes on the complementary DNA strand. A Gene profile of the averaged normalized expression levels of 5,052 genes in A549 cells at 24 h after H1N1/H5N1/H7N9 influenza virus infection or AF treatment. The gene bodies between the TSSs and TTSs were equally sized and scaled to 60 bins, and the gene flanking regions 4 kb upstream of the TSSs and 4 kb downstream of the TTSs were divided into 100-bp windows.

D Numbers of trans-TRT-influenced genes (FC in the expression level of the trans-TRT gene (H5N1/AF) > 5 and FC in the expression level of the trans-TRT-influenced gene (H1N1/H5N1) > 1.5) at different times after H5N1/H7N9 infection in A549 cells. E Functional pathway enrichment analysis of trans-TRT-influenced genes in H5N1-infected A549 cells (two-tailed P < 0.05, Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P < 0.05). Detection of F GLS-TRT or G IL23A-TRT in A549 cells by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A549 cells were treated with AF/H1N1/H5N1 for 24 h [DAPI nuclear staining (blue) and FISH signals obtained using a Cy3-conjugated DNA probe (red)]. The fluorescence intensity was semiquantitatively assessed using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each cell. The data are shown as the means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. RNA-seq coverage levels of H the GLS gene, trans-TRT region of GLS, and STAT1 gene, and I the IL23A gene, trans-TRT region of IL23A, and STAT2 gene 12 h after AF/H1N1/H5N1/H7N9 treatment of A549 cells. The gene bodies and intergenic regions, as well as the gene flanking regions 2 kb upstream of the TSSs, were divided into 50-bp windows. Only exon regions are shown in this graph. RNA-seq datasets were established in duplicateFull size imageTRT was negatively correlated with cell viability and positively correlated with H5N1 and H7N9 virus replication (Fig. S1D–G). In experiments involving PBMCs, human cancer cell lines (A549, H1650, and HeLa), kidney cell lines (HEK293 and HEK293T), a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1), a human T lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat), and a primary fibroblast line (HPF-a), infection with H5N1 was associated with a higher TRT level than infection with H1N1, except in HeLa cells, in which AIV infection was minimally detected (Fig. S1H, I). These findings suggest that TRT may be negatively correlated with the viability of influenza A virus-infected cells (Fig. S1J).TRT represses host antiviral gene expressionTo determine the potential roles of TRT in AIV infection, we performed correlation analysis between TRT levels and downregulated DEGs in infected A549 cells. Because TRT spans the promoter and coding regions of cis- and trans-genes, it might affect the expression of downstream genes on the same DNA strand (cis-TRT; Fig. S2A) or on the complementary DNA strand (trans-TRT; Fig. S2B). To determine which genes were the most strongly influenced by AIV infection, we calculated the correlations between TRT levels and cis- and trans-gene expression levels (Figs. 1C and S2C). Trans-gene expression was more strongly correlated with cell infection than cis-gene expression, indicating that TRT might specifically regulate the expression of genes on the complementary strand in infected cells.The number of trans-TRT-influenced genes in H5N1- and H7N9-infected cells was substantially increased at 12 h after infection (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the number of trans-TRT-influenced genes was positively correlated with viral replication and negatively correlated with cell viability in H5N1-infected cells (Fig. S2D, E), suggesting that TRT is correlated with viral lethality.Functional analysis of genes influenced by trans-TRT showed that among the viral strains, H5N1 infection resulted in the greatest dysregulation of genes involved in innate immunity (Fig. 1E) and that H7N9 infection also affected immune gene expression (Fig. S2F). These results suggested that trans-TRT-related genes might be responsible for the high lethality associated with H5N1 virus infection and contribute to the disruption of host innate immunity.Trans-TRT during H5N1 infection resulted in the greatest decreases in the expression of STAT1 and STAT2, which are associated with the IFN-α/β signaling pathway. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization by using probes targeting the TRT regions downstream of the TTSs in GLS and IL23A (their sequences are shown in Table S1), which correspond to the trans-TRT positions in STAT1 and STAT2, and then performed RT–qPCR with primers targeting the TRT regions to confirm that TRT caused transcription to continue past the TTS in GLS and IL23A (Figs. 1F, G and S3A–C). Investigation of the expression levels of STAT1 and STAT2 in H1N1- and H5N1-infected cells showed that their expression was repressed by H5N1 infection but elevated by H1N1 infection (Figs. 1H-I and S4A–D). These data suggested that TRT influenced the expression of innate immune genes, especially STAT1 and STAT2, on the complementary strand through trans-TRT.Inhibition of TRT promotes STAT1/STAT2 expressionTo confirm the function of TRT in repressing STAT1 and STAT2 expression, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) [38,39,40] to abolish TRT in GLS and IL23A in H5N1-infected A549 cells and then investigated STAT1 and STAT2 expression. CRISPRi was used to express a catalytically inactive CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 (dCas9), which was targeted by guide RNAs to sequences between the TTSs and TRT termination sites of the GLS and IL23A genes (Fig. S5A, B). We confirmed the correct targeting of inhibitory complexes by using ChIP-PCR with an anti-Cas9 antibody and PCR primers targeting the TRT regions of GLS and IL23A (Fig. S5C, D; the sequences are listed in Table S1).A549 cells with CRISPRi targeting the GLS and IL23A TRT regions exhibited less TRT than control cells with untargeted CRISPRi (Fig. 2A, B). In addition, the STAT1 and STAT2 mRNA (Fig. 2C, D) and protein (Fig. 2E, F) levels were higher in CRISPRi cells than in control cells. After H5N1 infection, CRISPRi cells showed higher viability and less viral replication than control cells; however, after H1N1 infection, the CRISPRi and control cells showed similar viability and viral replication ability (Figs. 2G–J and S5E–L). These data showed that TRT of GLS and IL23A repressed the transcription of the antiviral genes STAT1 and STAT2 on the complementary DNA strand.Fig. 2TRT inhibition by CRISPR interference enhances STAT1/STAT2 expression and cell viability.

The data are shown as the means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01Full size imageNS1 binds to SSU72 to enhance TRTWhile investigating the mechanism underlying TRT, we found that SSU72 protein expression was markedly decreased after H5N1 infection but not after H1N1 infection (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, TRT occurred before SSU72 protein degradation. Our posttranslational modification analysis results indicated that SSU72 was associated with a ubiquitin complex during H5N1 infection (Fig. 3B). After H5N1 infection, SSU72-overexpressing A549 cells showed less TRT (Fig. 3C), higher viability (Fig. 3D), and less viral replication (Fig. S6A, B) than control A549 cells. In addition, SSU72-overexpressing A549 cells had lower GLS and IL23A TRT levels and higher STAT1, STAT2, and IFN-β expression levels than control A549 cells (Fig. S6C–G).Fig. 3NS1 binds to SSU72 and enhances TRT.

K Western blot analysis of SSU72 at 48 h after recombinant virus infection. β-Actin was used as the reference control. The data are shown as the means ± SEMs. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. Each experiment except for RNA-seq analysis of recombinant virus-infected cells was repeated at least three timesFull size imageNext, we used small interfering RNAs to knock down SSU72 expression in A549 cells (Fig. S6H). TRT occurred in more genes in cells with SSU72 knockdown than in control cells (Fig. 3E). After H1N1 or H5N1 infection, A549 cells with SSU72 knockdown showed lower viability (Fig. S6I, J), higher GLS and IL23A TRT levels (Fig. S6K–N), lower STAT1/2 mRNA levels (Fig. S6O–R), and less viral replication (Fig. S6S, T) than cells with normal SSU72 expression. These results suggested that SSU72 is a crucial regulator of TRT during AIV infection.To determine the precise mechanisms by which SSU72 regulates TRT, we overexpressed 10 H5N1 genes in HEK293T cells and performed RNA-seq to analyze TRT levels. Although exogenous expression of each viral protein resulted in different TRT levels, cells overexpressing the H5N1 NS1 protein had higher TRT levels and lower SSU72 expression levels than control cells (Fig. 3F, G). In contrast, overexpression of H1N1 proteins did not increase TRT levels (Fig. S7A, B).Coimmunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy imaging showed that the H5N1 NS1 protein bound directly to the human SSU72 protein (Figs. 3H and S7C). To test whether this binding was unique to the H5N1 NS1 protein, the PR8+H5N1-NS1 and PR8+H1N1-NS1 were used for comparative test. The TRT levels were increased in A549 cells infected with the PR8+H5N1-NS1, suggesting that H5N1 NS1 plays a key role in inducing TRT during infection (Fig. 3I). In addition, cell viability and SSU72 expression were decreased in A549 cells infected with the PR8+H5N1-NS1 compared with those infected with the PR8 wt virus and PR8+H1N1-NS1 (Fig. 3J, K). These results suggested that NS1 binds to SSU72, leading to a reduction in its expression, which eventually induces TRT and represses STAT1/2 mRNA expression (Fig. S7D, E).Dampened innate immune gene expression upon AIV infection is restored in SSU72-overexpressing transgenic miceIn the in vivo studies, SSU72 expression levels in lung tissues were lower in mice infected with H5N1 than in those infected with H1N1 (Fig. 4A). To further elucidate the role of SSU72 in influenza A virus infection, we generated transgenic SSU72 mice with SSU72 overexpression in the lungs and infected them with H5N1 (Fig. S8A). RNA-seq analysis of mouse lung tissues showed that the TRT gene count was lower in SSU72 transgenic mice than in control mice (Fig. 4B). In addition, SSU72 transgenic mice showed higher lung expression levels of STAT1 and STAT2 (Fig. 4C, D), less severe lung injury and edema, lower viral titers, and higher survival rates than control C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 4E–H).Fig. 4TRT is reduced and lung injury is ameliorated in SSU72 transgenic mice infected with the lethal H5N1 virus.

Each experiment except for RNA-seq analysis of lungs from mice with or without H5N1 infection was repeated at least three timesFull size imageThese results suggested that overexpression of SSU72 can inhibit TRT in mouse lung tissue during viral infection; this might be a potential strategy for preventing future AIV pandemics.TRT is increased in blood samples from AIV-infected patientsTo determine whether TRT is associated with influenza virus lethality, we infected A549 cells with highly virulent or less virulent viruses and then analyzed TRT levels. TRT levels increased strongly after infection with the lethal avian viruses H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 and moderately after infection with the less virulent viruses H1N1 and H3N2 (Fig. 5A). TRT was also negatively correlated with cell viability and positively correlated with viral replication (Figs. 5B and S8B). These results suggested that TRT is associated with high viral lethality.Fig. 5TRT is enhanced in PBMCs from patients infected with influenza virus. A Numbers of TRT genes (those with TRT region expression upregulated by more than 5-fold after AIV infection compared with AF treatment) in A549 cells at 24 h and 48 h after H1N1/H3N2/H5N1/H5N6/H7N9 infection. B Correlation analysis between the number of TRT genes (those with TRT region expression upregulated by more than fivefold after AIV infection compared with AF treatment) and cell viability in A549 cells at 48 h after H1N1/H3N2/H5N1/H5N6/H7N9 infection. A549 cell viability was determined using an MTS assay. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and P values are provided in the graph. C Numbers of TRT genes (those with TRT region expression upregulated by more than fivefold in the patient group compared with the healthy control group) and D numbers of trans-TRT-influenced genes (those with TRT region expression upregulated with a FC greater than 5 in the patient group compared with the healthy control group or downregulated by more than 1.5-fold in the patient group compared with the healthy control group) in human PBMCs. The horizontal lines indicate the mean values in each group. ANOVA was used for comparisons among multiple groups. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. All experiments except for those involving human blood samples were performed at least in triplicateFull size imageTo confirm our laboratory results in the clinic, we obtained 29 blood samples from 12 H7N9-infected patients, 3 blood samples from 3 H5N6-infected patients, 15 blood samples from 15 H1N1-infected patients, 8 blood samples from 8 patients with pneumonia (without influenza virus infection), and 10 blood samples from healthy individuals (see Table S2 for the patient characteristics). RNA-seq of the isolated PBMCs revealed that the TRT gene count was higher in PBMCs from patients infected with H7N9 and H5N6 than in the other PBMC samples analyzed (Fig. 5C). In addition, the trans-TRT genes were more repressed in PBMCs from the H7N9- and H5N6-infected patients than in those from the other patients (Fig. 5D). Notably, the TRT levels and the number of suppressed trans-TRT genes were higher in H7N9-infected patients who died than in those who survived. Our results suggested that TRT might be a potential biomarker for the outcomes of patients with AIV infection.DiscussionIn this study, we showed that TRT was enhanced by AIV infection in cultured human cells, mouse lung tissues, and patient-derived PBMCs. TRT inhibited the expression of innate immune genes on the complementary DNA strand, a phenomenon that we called trans-TRT. TRT also inhibited the expression of immune response-related genes such as STAT1 and STAT2 in cell lines and mouse lung tissues. This finding does not contradict a previous discovery that NS1 can repress STAT1/2 through IFNα/β [14, 41,42,43,44,45]. Both mechanisms could coexist or exist independently in different viral strains. Further studies are required to elucidate why TRT acts mainly in trans and not in cis. Future studies should also explore other genes that are associated with the innate immune response and are influenced by trans-TRT.We found that SSU72, a gene loop regulator at TTSs, plays a crucial role in TRT regulation and influences the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response both in vitro and in vivo. SSU72 binds to promoter and terminator regions to maintain gene loop formation and transcriptional directionality [23, 46]. We found that the H5N1 NS1 protein can directly bind to SSU72 and reduce its expression. This appears to be a novel mechanism by which AIVs can suppress innate immunity. Moreover, overexpression of SSU72 ameliorated lung injury and protected against suppression of antiviral gene expression in mice infected with H5N1. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the specificity of SSU72-restricted transcripts. Based on our findings, we propose that SSU72 may be a useful therapeutic target in AIV. The PBMCs of patients infected with H7N9 and H5N6 showed enhanced TRT, suggesting that TRT levels are associated with patient outcomes.In conclusion, we showed that NS1 bound directly to SSU72 and suppressed STAT1/2 expression through trans-TRT, which enabled the virus to evade host antiviral immune responses, eventually leading to viral lethality. In addition to the pathways through which NS1 targets IFN by inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling, this novel mechanism constitutes an alternative pathway of viral escape from antiviral responses. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism by which TRT suppresses the innate immune system during AIV infection. ReferencesPeiris JS, de Jong MD, Guan Y.

"We had this virus in Toronto in December of '68 and January of '69, and then it departed these shores," Middleton told the CBC's Adrienne Clarkson on the CBC-TV program Take 30.According to the Globe and Mail, which called it Hong Kong A2, the virus was named for the place where scientists had first isolated it in July of 1968.Take 30 co-host Adrienne Clarkson wanted to know why a virus that had swept the globe had been so hard to control. (Take 30/CBC Archives)But, Middleton continued, A2 had then travelled "to the southern hemisphere" for winter in that part of the world, and was now back in North America."Why can't it be controlled?" asked Clarkson.It all came down to immunity."New people are born all the time into this world of ours," said the doctor. "And they're not immune."Besides, any immunity people gained was only good for "two or three years." 'Pan-epidemics''They're known as "pan-epidemics"'55 years agoDuration 2:03Virologist Dr. Peter Middleton explains the different types of flu viruses on CBC-TV's Take 30.Earlier in the interview, Middleton had explained the nature of viruses in general."Are there really different kinds of flu viruses?" asked Clarkson as she and her guest sat beneath an illustration of cartoonish alien-type creatures labelled A1, A2 and A3."This is a very fine piece of artistry," said Middleton, gesturing at the drawings Clarkson had described as "malevolent". "There are three basic types of influenza viruses," Middleton said.He went on to describe the three types, which doctors tagged A, B or C. "Now, C is a very mild sort of fellow," he said. "He produces a sort of a common cold."Things got more serious with the B strains."Influenza B causes an epidemic, not usually a worldwide one," said Middleton.But the A2 strain then going around was something more serious yet."Now, the A's … are associated with substantial epidemics," he said. "These affect, usually, the whole world and they're known as 'pan-epidemics.'"According to the Globe and Mail in a report from 11 days before this interview, the Hong Kong A2 virus had killed about 2,000 people in Papua New Guinea and 400 in Britain in the previous two months.By Jan. 17, 1970, the number of deaths in the previous four weeks in Britain had reached 7,000, according to another, later report in the Globe and Mail.Related Stories From 2004: Talking about what a potential pandemic could look like Preparing for 'the next great epidemic' in 2005 When the WHO said SARS had stopped spreading in Toronto As seen on CBC-TV: Snapshots of cross-border life before COVID-19Add some “good” to your morning and evening.Sign up for this biweekly blast from the past, straight from the CBC Archives.Email address:SubscribeCurrent TimeIgnore this field.

In conditions where the virus has become widespread by affecting some of the main facilities supplying eggs across the country, all effort has already been limited to isolating H5N8. So far, there are three outbreaks of bird flu, specifically in Durrës, Dibra and Korça.In a press release, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Ermira Gjeci, drew the attention of traders of live poultry in open spaces, prompted by television chronicles that showed the opposite in some cities of Albania."It is important for traders and the public to know that the order to take restrictive measures to prevent avian influenza in open spaces and live animal markets is in force. This order will be implemented in the three regions where the outbreak of the disease has been confirmed: Durrës, Dibër, Korçë. "The order prohibits the sale and trade of live birds in open spaces and live animal markets in these counties, as well as the movement of live birds from farm to farm and from farm to live animal markets", underlined Gjeci, while adding that it has the cooperation of the Police, mayors and mayors to stop attempts to violate the law, thus sharing responsibility with them.In the meantime, Durrës Prosecution has registered the criminal investigation for companies and public officials. Investigations are underway following allegations of breach of bird quarantine rules at the infected outbreak and abuse of office by officials who appear to have allowed chickens and eggs to be marketed with H5N8.Cross-examinations that are said to have started on Monday, March 21 in some poultry houses of the coastal city have requested information on the time when the first case was ascertained and whether or not the relevant bodies have been informed.The Prosecution has asked the Police to seize documents on the practice that has been followed after the cases found for the death of birds. The Ministry of Agriculture ascertained the first case on March 19, announcing it a day later in the media.

Signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change from Monday, and free-range labelling will only return when hens are permitted to go outside again.Human case of bird flu detected in the UKBirds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian fluAimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser at the National Farmers' Union, said the government's advice was that there was "still a high level of risk" to birds of catching flu."This is an incredibly difficult time for all bird owners and vigilance remains vital," she added. Ms Mahony said farmers were following "stringent biosecurity measures" and adapting hen houses to make birds more comfortable.What are barn eggs?Image source, Anthony Lee/Getty ImagesImage caption, Avian flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird, whether it is dead or aliveBoth "barn" and "free range" eggs meet the RSPCA's welfare standards, because the hens that lay them have freedom and space to move around, along with perches for roosting and nest boxes.The difference is that for barn hens, this all happens inside, whereas free-range hens can access to the outside through "popholes" - although bird flu restrictions have put a stop to this.The RSPCA says consumers buy more boxes of free range and barn eggs than those from caged hens.However, the charity says a large proportion of eggs used as ingredients in products like mayonnaise, cakes and sandwiches are still from hens kept in cages.It says such cages provide less than the size of an A4 piece of paper of space per bird and have limited facilities for perching, nesting and scratching and do not meet its welfare standards. The charity says about 35% of egg-laying hens are still kept in cages.Case numbers of the H5N1 strain of bird flu began rising in November last year. The virus - which is highly contagious and can destroy poultry flocks - was first discovered in North Yorkshire.It poses an extremely low risk to humans, according to the NHS, although several people have been infected around the world and a number have died.The outbreaks have resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone which made it a legal requirement for all bird keepers across the UK - whether they have pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard flock - to keep them indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures.Under such restrictions egg farmers have a 16-week "grace period" to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on Monday.Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would "continue to support British farmers".In a statement the government said it would work with farmers and retailers to implement the branding changings.A spokesman added: "We are experiencing our largest ever outbreak of avian flu and housing measures remain in force to protect poultry and other birds from this highly infectious and unpleasant disease."More on this storyCounty has fifth bird flu outbreak within a monthPublished21 March 2022Human case of bird flu detected in the UKPublished6 January 2022Birds culled amid multiple outbreaks of avian fluPublished13 December 2021Bird flu at phenomenal level in UK - chief vetPublished9 December 2021Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1082Top storiesStarmer to join Macron for Armistice Day events in ParisPublished36 minutes agoHouse vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsarPublished23 minutes agoEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south dividePublished1 hour agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south divideâCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Energy smart meter issues creating north-south divide2Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron3Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'4Mattel 'deeply regrets' porn site misprint on Wicked dolls5Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards6âCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâ7âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director8Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacks9Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale10'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'BBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

The nature of the pandemic diseases, ways of prevention and treatments are not fully known for a long time. People saw the disease as a wrath of God until they learned the nature of the epidemic, and often placed a blessing on it. Many diseases with an endemic, epidemic and pandemic character have been experienced since ancient times and millions of people have died in these outbreaks. Plague, malaria, cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, influenza, tuberculosis, typhoid, typhus and syphilis are important epidemic diseases that cause mass death. However, all of these could not produce outbreaks while would affect several continents of the world. We can only say that plague, cholera and influenza diseases are pandemic epidemics and that affect people globally known. The world has experienced from antiquity to the present, more than ten influenza pandemics with three plagues, seven cholera, and the outbreak we are experiencing today. Epidemic outbreaks of smallpox, malaria and yellow fever which caused the death of many people, were at least as effective as these three diseases. The reason for the high destruction of all pandemics is that the disease is not fully recognized. Therefore, the mortality rates were high, and the spreading areas were wide. Epidemics/pandemics deeply affected social life economically, socially, psychologically, culturally, politically, religiously, geographically and many more.

That is why we should change our testing strategy for Covid-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely.”The team looked at the data of adults who had been hospitalised with Covid-19 in the UK between February 6 2020 and December 8 2021.Test results for respiratory viral co-infections were recorded for 6965 patients with Covid-19.Some 227 of these also had the influenza virus, and they experienced significantly more severe outcomes, researchers found.Professor Calum Semple, Professor of Child Health and Outbreak Medicine at the University of Liverpool, said: “We are seeing a rise in the usual seasonal respiratory viruses as people return to normal mixing.“So, we can expect flu to be circulating alongside Covid-19 this winter. We were surprised that the risk of death more than doubled when people were infected by both flu and Covid-19 viruses.“It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late.”The research, delivered as part of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium’s (Isaric) Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, is said to be the largest ever study of people with Covid-19 and other endemic respiratory viruses.Isaric’s study was set up in 2013 in readiness for a pandemic such as this.Professor Peter Openshaw, Professor of Experimental Medicine at Imperial College London, said: “Being infected with more than one virus is not very common but it’s important to be aware that co-infections do happen.“The vaccines that protect against Covid-19 and flu are different, and people need both. The way that these two infections are treated is also different so it’s important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection.“This latest discovery by the Isaric consortium again adds significantly to improving the way we manage patients.”The findings have been published in a research letter in The Lancet.Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say – November 11UK News|3 hours agoGovernment says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitismUK News|4 hours agoStarmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorationsUK News|7 hours agoSFA chief tells of emergency eyecare surgery before key Euros matchUK News|7 hours agoDrivers handed £4.1m Dartford Crossing fines by mistakeUK News|7 hours agoMost popular1Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|19 hours ago2GST heading your way for 2027News|Nov 83‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|1 hour ago4Queens Road Medical Practice opens at new site on MondayNews|Nov 95St James grateful but future is still uncertainNews|Nov 9Follow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.
