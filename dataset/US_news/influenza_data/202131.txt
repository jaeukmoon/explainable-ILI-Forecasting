Here we investigated whether intradermal (i.d.) vaccination induces protective immunity. Our results showed that DelNS1-LAIV intradermal vaccination conferred effective and long-lasting protection against lethal virus challenge in mice. A single intradermal injection of DelNS1-LAIV conferred 100% survival with no weight loss in mice after A(H1N1)09 influenza virus (H1N1/415742Md) challenge. DelNS1-LAIV injection resulted in a significant reduction of lung viral load and reduced airway epithelial cell death and lung inflammatory cytokine responses at day 2 and 4 post challenge. Full protections of mice lasted for 6 months after immunization. In vitro infection of DelNS1-LAIV in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) demonstrated activation of antigen-presenting cells at 33 °C, together with the results of abortive replication of DelNS1-LAIV in skin tissue and strong upregulation of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines expression, our results suggested the strong immunogenicity of this vaccine. Further, we demonstrate that the underlying protection mechanism induced by intradermal DelNS1-LAIV is mainly attributed to antibody responses. Together, this study opens up an alternative route for the administration of LAIV, which may benefit individuals not suitable for intranasal LAIV immunization.

Despite the availability of several classes of antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors, vaccination is still the most effective option for controlling influenza epidemic and pandemic. Currently, inactivated influenza vaccines and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are administrated mainly through intramuscular injection and intranasal spray, respectively2. Both approaches are shown to be immunogenic. LAIV has been licensed for clinical use since 2003. Besides avoiding an unpleasant injection, intranasal LAIV immunization mimics the process of a natural infection. Attenuated vaccine virus infects and replicates in the upper respiratory epithelial cells to elicit systemic and local antiviral immune responses3,4. In some individuals, transient local side effects were observed up to 2–3 days after intranasal (i.n.) vaccination3,5 but were generally well tolerated. However, LAIV is not recommended for children under 2 years old, people above 49 years old, pregnant women, and people with asthma or chronic obstructive lung diseases or immunocompromised conditions because these temperature-sensitive vaccine viruses with intact viral NS1 gene may replicate to higher titer in the respiratory tract to cause severe side effects2. Another potential risk is that vaccine virus may reassort with wild-type influenza viruses if simultaneous natural infection and immunization occur, although the progeny virus is unlikely to be transmissible6.Besides the nasal respiratory mucosa, the skin is another immune organ which harbors lots of innate immune cells including Langerhans cells, dermal dendritic cells, and residential B cells7. Vaccines other than influenza vaccine delivered to skin have been proven to induce potent protective immunity8. Inactivated influenza vaccine through intradermal route is only regaining more interests in recent years owing to the development of new technologies and new devices for easier, more reliable intradermal delivery9,10. Our previous clinical trials for intradermal inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine with topical imiquimod cream demonstrated rapid, strong, and longer-lasting antibody responses11,12. Intradermal vaccination is antigen dose-sparing. Compared with other administration routes, i.d. injection could potentially reduce the cost per injection to about 60%13,14. This is of particular significance in vaccine resource-poor settings, especially during the start of a pandemic when global vaccine production capacity limits the supply15.Live attenuated influenza vaccine DelNS1-LAIV is highly attenuated in human cell culture and non-pathogenic in mice because the virulence factor NS1 protein was deleted from the vaccine virus16. We reported previously that i.n. vaccination with DelNS1-LAIV provided full protection against homologous virus A(H1N1)pdm09 and heterologous H7N9 and H5N1 influenza challenges in mice16. DelNS1-LAIV is cold-adapted with limited replication at 33 °C which is similar to the temperature of human and mouse skin17,18. In this study, we evaluate whether i.d. DelNS1-LAIV vaccine can induce durable protective immune responses with homologous and heterologous protection. The findings may broaden the application of LAIV.ResultsIntradermal DelNS1-LAIV vaccination fully protected mice against homologous H1N1/415742Md challengeTo test whether LAIV is effective via intradermal route, 106 plaque forming units (PFU) of DelNS1-LAIV was i.d. injected to multiple groups of mice. One of the groups was boosted with second injection at 14 days after the prime vaccination. Unvaccinated control mice were injected with the same volume of PBS. The mice were intranasally challenged with 10x LD50 of H1N1/415742Md at 28 days after primary vaccination. Both single dose and two doses of i.d. vaccination induced good protection with no weight loss and 100% survival after virus challenge (Fig. 1a). Comparing i.d. vaccinated mice with i.n. vaccinated mice, there was no difference in body weight loss or survival rate (Fig. 1a), which suggested LAIV i.d. vaccination offered the same protective efficacy as i.n. vaccination. Remarkably, a single dose of i.d. vaccination fully protected mice against virus challenge with 100% survival and no weight loss (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Intradermal vaccination of DelNS1-LAIV protected mice against homologues and heterologous virus challenge.a Schema for vaccination, body weight change, and survival rate for mice challenged by homologous virus A/Hong Kong/415742Md (pH1N1) 28 days after vaccination. b Vaccination schema, body weight change, and survival rate for mice challenged by A/Hong Kong/415742Md at 14 days after one dose vaccination. c A/Anhui/1/2013m (H7N9) challenged at 28 days after one dose vaccination. d A/VNM/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus challenged at 28 days after one dose vaccination. n = 4–5 mice per group.

Error bars indicate standard deviation. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001 when compared with the survival of PBS group by log-rank test.Full size imageTo test the broadness of i.d. vaccination-induced immunity, H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013m) or H5N1 (A/VNM/1194/2004) challenges were performed at 28 days after a single dose of i.d. vaccination. H7N9 challenge caused sharp weight loss and 60% death in PBS control mice, while the vaccinated mice were 3 days quicker in body weight recovery and had 100% survival (Fig. 1c). However, i.d. DelNS1-LAIV only rescued the survival rate to 20% among the H5N1-challenged mice, versus 100% mortality in the PBS group (Fig. 1d).We then studied the longevity of i.d. DelNS1-LAIV-induced immunity by challenging the vaccinated mice at 3 or 6 months after vaccination. Firstly, homologues virus H1N1/415742Md challenge did not cause body weight loss, nor lethality 3 or 6 months after vaccination (Fig. 1e), suggesting the protective immunity lasted at least for 6 months; Secondly, all vaccinated mice survived against an antigenically different H1N1 strain (PR8) challenge and regaining body weight starting day 7 post challenge (7dpi) (Fig. 1f). All vaccinated mice survived after H7N9 challenge though with a similar degree of weight loss comparing to the PBS control mice (Fig. 1g). The immunized mice challenged by H5N1 at 3 or 6 months had 30% and 20% survival, respectively, with a similar degree of weight loss comparing to the PBS controls (Fig. 1h).DelNS1-LAIV intradermal vaccination controls virus replication and reduces histopathological damages in the virus-challenged lungThe vaccinated mice had significantly reduced infectious virus titer in the lung tissue at 2 and 4 dpi comparing to the control mice (Fig. 2a). Vaccinated mouse lung sections also showed much less viral nucleoprotein (NP)-expressing cells. The NP-positive cells were mainly confined to the larger bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium, rarely affecting alveolar epithelium (Fig. 2b). In contrast, in the unvaccinated mouse lung sections, NP-positive cells were more extensively distributed in the airway epithelium and more frequently detected in alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 2b), indicating that the dissemination of virus to distal structure of lungs was controlled in the vaccinated mice. Further, vaccinated mouse lung sections showed no severe pathological damages, significantly less bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell death, and less destruction of airway structure comparing to the PBS control (Fig. 2c), resulting in a significantly improved epithelium necrosis score (Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the expression levels of lung inflammatory cytokine/chemokine were significantly lower in the vaccinated mice than that in the unvaccinated mice (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2: Viral load and lung histology of vaccinated mouse challenged with A/Hong Kong/415742Md (pH1N1).The mice were challenged with 10x LD50 of A/Hong Kong/415742Md 14 days after one dose i.d. vaccination.

However, the responses of immune cells to DelNS1-LAIV virus are unknown. To evaluate this, we inoculated human MoDCs19 with DelNS1-LAIV (MOI = 2), our results showed that DelNS1-LAIV replicated to a higher level than wild-type virus A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 at 33 °C (Fig. 3a). However, viral M gene mRNA copies increased only by less than half-log from 6 to 24 hours post infection (hpi) (Fig. 3a), indicating DelNS1-LAIV directly infected MoDCs but replicated to a limited degree. MoDCs were activated by DelNS1-LAIV infection and expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ (Fig. 3b). Similarly, inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α, and chemokines including MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES were significantly upregulated at 6 hpi and further increased at 24 hpi in MoDCs (Fig. 3c). In addition, the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 on MoDCs increased at 24 hpi (Fig. 3d), which also indicated that DelNS1-LAIV could rapidly and effectively activate dendritic cells at 33 °C.Fig. 3: DelNS1-LAIV virus strain infection and activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) in vitro.Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were infected with 2 MOI of DelNS1-LAIV or wild-type A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 (pH1N1) at 33 °C.

The expression of cytokines/chemokines including IFN-α/β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MIP-1α/β in skin tissue (Fig. 4a, lower) significantly increased at 6 h after injection, and continued to increase at 24 h. MCP-1 expression was higher at 6 h than 24 h after injection, while RANTES, IP-10, and CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13 were upregulated at similar levels at 6 or 24 h after injection. The upregulated expression of these cytokines and chemokines are consistent with reported molecular events induced by i.d. vaccination20, and suggested that a broad spectrum of innate immune responses at the injection site were elicited by i.d. vaccination. However, no visible or histological skin tissue damages were observed despite the upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 4: DelNS1-LAIV induced local innate immune responses in skin and skin-draining lymph nodes.Mouse skin tissue of the i.d. injection sites and skin-draining lymph nodes were harvested 6 and 24 h after DelNS1-LAIV or PBS injection. a Real-time RT-PCR determined the expression of viral vRNA, viral mRNA, and cytokines/chemokines in skin tissues. b The expression of viral vRNA, viral mRNA, and cytokines/chemokines in draining lymph nodes (pooled samples of inguinal lymph nodes, axillary lymph nodes, and superficial cervical lymph nodes). Dashed lines in the viral load chart indicated the detection limit of 100 copies of viral gene. The relative expression levels of cytokines/chemokines were relative to the PBS control mice, which were indicated by the dotted line in the charts. n = 6 mice per group. c Different sets of the inguinal (iLN), axillary (aLN), and superficial cervical (cLN) lymph nodes were harvested for dendritic cell analysis at 6 h after vaccine injection. The percentage of CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC) and mean florescence intensity of the expression levels for DC activation markers CCR7, CD86, and MHC-II were analyzed by flow cytometry. n = 4 per group. Error bars indicate standard error of mean.Full size imageSkin-draining lymph nodes including inguinal, axillary, and superficial cervical lymph nodes were analyzed. The level of viral M gene mRNA and vRNA in lymph nodes were just above our qRT-PCR detection limit, with no increase from 6 to 24 h after i.d. DelNS1-LAIV injection (Fig. 4b, upper), indicating a limited amount of live vaccine virus, if any, could reach the lymph nodes. Inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression profiling showed mild upregulation of IL-6, MIP1α/β, MCP-1, and IP-10 at 24 h after i.d. vaccination. The expression levels of IFN-α/β, TNF-α, RANTES, CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL13 were just above the baseline levels (Fig. 4b, lower). The number of CD11c+ dendritic cells were slightly increased in axillary and superficial cervical lymph nodes at 6 h after i.d. vaccination, which had a higher expression levels of the cell migration marker CCR7. At the same time, the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 and MHC-II molecule also increased in the CD11c+ dendritic cells (Fig. 4c). However, all of these changes did not reach statistical significance.Intradermal vaccination of DelNS1-LAIV induced adaptive antibody responsesInfluenza virus-specific IgG antibody was detected in the serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 14 days after vaccination, which were mainly IgG2a, followed by IgG2b and IgG1 isotypes. IgG2a and IgG1 further increased at 28 days after vaccination (Fig. 5a). The second dose of vaccination significantly boosted the concentration of total IgG, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG1 (Fig. 5a). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer against homologous virus was detected at 28 days after one dose of vaccination, and significantly increased after the second vaccination (Fig. 5b). Virus neutralizing titer was similarly detected at 28 days after vaccination, which was significantly increased after the second vaccination (Fig. 5b). At 3 and 6 months after the one dose vaccination, similar titers of serum HI and MN antibody were detected indicating the presence of long-lasting antibody secreting cells (Fig. 5b). Serum IgG against H7N9 (Fig. 5c, left) or H5N1 (Fig. 5c, right) were detected by ELISA at 28 days after vaccination, and further increased at 3 months and maintained at 6 months post vaccination.Fig. 5: DelNS1-LAIV induced antibody response in mouse.Mouse serum samples were collected at 14 days, 28 days, 3 months, and 6 months after the first vaccination. a Geometric mean titer (GMT) of pandemic A/Hong Kong/415742 /2009 (pH1N1) virus-specific IgG and IgG subtypes in mouse serum detected by ELISA using inactivated pH1N1-coated plate. b GMT of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralizing (MN) antibody titer against pH1N1 virus.

Error bars indicate standard deviation. ***p < 0.001 when compared with survival of UV-DelNS1 group by log-rank test.Full size imageTogether, our findings suggested that live attenuated influenza virus given via intradermal route effectively induced protective humoral immunity. To confirm its relation with the higher immunogenicity of live vaccine, a same dose of UV-inactivated21 DelNS1 virus was i.d. injected to BALB/c mice and challenged with H1N1/415742Md 14 days after vaccination. Hemagglutination test showed no loss of HA titer after UV-inactivation (Fig. 5e). However, body weight change and survival data from the challenged mice showed that one dose (equivalent to 106 PFU) of inactivated vaccine did not confer protection against lethal virus challenge (Fig. 5f).Intradermal vaccination of DelNS1-LAIV induced viral-specific T cell responses in challenged miceNext, we studied the role of T cell responses in the protection of vaccinated mice after H1N1/415742Md challenge. We detected significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 2 and 4 dpi in vaccinated mouse lungs by flow cytometry (Fig. 6a, middle), among which there were particularly higher proportion of memory CD4+ and memory CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6a, right). Immunohistochemistry staining showed intensive infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells around the infected airway structures in vaccinated mouse lung comparing to the unvaccinated controls at 2 dpi (Fig. 6b). Significantly higher expression levels of IL-2 and IL-4 in the lung at 2 dpi (Fig. 6c) also indicated the activation of T cell responses in the vaccinated mouse lung tissues. Further, using CD4 or CD8 T cell epitope from influenza virus nucleoprotein (CD4 T epitope peptide: RLIQNSITIERMVLS; CD8 epitope peptide: TYQRTRALV) stimulation16,22, we detected significantly higher number of interferon-γ producing virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells from vaccinated mouse bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL, Fig. 6d). Similarly, virus-specific T cells were significantly increased in the spleen of vaccinated mice (Fig. 6e).Fig. 6: T cell responses in vaccinated mouse lungs.Mice were challenged with 10x LD50 of mouse-adapted A/Hong Kong/415742Md virus at 14 days after i.d. vaccination. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), lung, spleen, and serum samples were collected at 2 and 4 dpi. a T cell composition in mouse lung single-cell suspension by flow cytometry assays.

In vitro T cell epitope stimulation with CD4 epitope and CD8 T epitope from influenza NP (CD4 T epitope peptide: RLIQNSITIERMVLS; CD8 epitope peptide: TYQRTRALV) were performed for 48 h.

Scale bars = 100 µm. i Serum antibody titer, HI (left), MN (right) tested at 4 dpi in T cell-depleted or not depleted mice, and control mice. n = 3–5 per group.Full size imageTo further understand the protective role of T cells, we performed T cells depletion in vaccinated mice by intraperitoneal administration of monoclonal antibodies against CD4 and/or CD8 before virus challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). We found that antibody-mediated T cell depletion did not compromise i.d. DelNS1-LAIV-induced protective effects (Fig. 6f). Mouse lung histology showed inflammatory infiltration and viral antigen expression (Fig. 6g), which were similar to those in vaccinated mice without T cell depletion (in Fig. 2c). However, the density of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells presented at the infected site was dramatically reduced after T cell depletion (Fig. 6h). These data suggested that there existed other protective mechanisms besides T cell-mediated responses, as we did detect HI and neutralizing antibody from mouse serum after T cell depletion (Fig. 6i).Intradermal vaccination of DelNS1-LAIV induced viral-specific B cell responses in challenged miceFlow cytometry analysis of lung single-cell preparations showed significantly more B cells in the vaccinated mouse lungs at 2 and 4 days after H1N1/415742Md challenge (Fig. 7a), which suggested fast B cell recruitment to the infected lungs. ELISPOT assay further demonstrated a significantly higher number of virus-specific IgG producing B cells in the BAL, lung, and spleen single-cell samples (Fig. 7b–d). In support of viral-specific B cell responses, at 4 dpi after H1N1/415742Md challenge, vaccinated mice had higher titers of serum HI and neutralizing antibody comparing to the control mice (Fig. 7e); while the mucosal IgA antibody response seemed less effective, since ELISA assay detected similar level of IgA in BAL of vaccinated and non-vaccinated control mice at day 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 7e, right).Fig. 7: B cell responses in vaccinated mice and passive transfer of immunized serum and T cells for protection.Mice were challenged with 10x LD50 of mouse-adapted A/Hong Kong/415742Md virus at 14 days after i.d. vaccination.

Serum or spleen T cells obtained from vaccinated mice 28 days after vaccination were pooled; 400 μl of serum (pooled from 9 vaccinated mice, HI titer = 1:80) or 1 × 107 purified pan T cells were transferred to groups of naive mice via intraperitoneal injection before challenged with 3x LD50 of A/Hong Kong/415742Md virus. Body weight changes and survival were monitored for 14 days. Data presented are from two experiments. n = 6 per group. Error bars indicate standard deviation.Full size imageOverall, our data indicated that both humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses were elicited by i.d. DelNS1-LAIV vaccination. To further analyze the protective roles for the both arms of immunity in mice, we performed passive transfer of T cells or serum collected from vaccinated mice to naive mice before virus challenge. Our data showed total spleen T cells isolated 28 days after two doses vaccination could not protect the naive mice from lethal virus challenge (Fig. 7f) while transfer of pooled serum samples protected the naive mice against virus challenge (Fig. 7f).DiscussionThe aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of i.d. vaccination of LAIV. We demonstrated that i.d. injection of DelNS1-LAIV induced potent protective responses in mice and conferred full protection not only against homologue virus challenge but also against heterologous viruses with protection lasting for at least 6 months. Our results showed that both B and T cell immunity were activated and the protection effects are mainly attributed to serum antibody responses. Our results broaden the potential application of LAIV to subjects who are not suitable for i.n. vaccination.LAIV is mostly administered via intranasal spray to deliver vaccine virus to the upper respiratory tract which mimics the natural infection process and induces effective host immune responses4. Intradermal administration of live attenuated vaccines has only been used for BCG and some types of inactivated vaccines. For example, WHO recently recommends the intradermal route for post-exposure prophylaxis inactivated rabies, based on studies that i.d. administration offers an equally safe and efficacious alternative to intramuscular vaccination23,24. In addition, i.d. vaccination offers a dose-sparing benefit which reduces the volume of vaccine by 60–80% comparing with intramuscular vaccination25. The immunological basis for i.d. vaccination comes from the recognition of skin being an important part of the immune system26,27. Skin tissue contains various types of immune cells in the dermal layer, for example, dermal dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, resident T cells and B cells26,28, all of which play vital roles against natural infection, in capturing and presenting antigens to lymphoid organs during vaccination. Our DelNS1-LAIV lacked the NS1 gene and replicated well in MDCK cells at 33 °C16, which is the temperature of skin tissues in human and mouse17,18. We showed here that DelNS1-LAIV had limited replication in the skin tissue within 24 h after i.d. injection. DelNS1-LAIV showed no virus replication in skin-draining lymph nodes, which is certainly a safety benefit to avoid undesired side effects. The strong immune response in both skin tissues and skin-draining lymph nodes can be attributed to skin antigen-presenting cells, which mediated antigen transportation to the lymphoid tissues. In vitro infection of MoDCs by DelNS1-LAIV demonstrated an abortive feature of DelNS1-LAIV replication in dendritic cells at 33 °C while promoted strong MoDCs activation as shown by the high-level expressions of cytokine/chemokine after infection. Further, the limited replication of DelNS1-LAIV in skin tissue is crucial for the induction of subsequent adaptive immunity as the protective effects were lost when the vaccine virus was UV-inactivated.As indicated by the body weight and survival rate after lethal-dose virus challenge, i.d. DelNS1-LAIV vaccination induced a similar level of protection as those vaccinated via the intranasal route. However, we found that i.d. vaccination-induced immunity is not sterilising in mice because virus titer was detected in mouse lungs after challenges. A possible explanation for this is that i.d. injection of live vaccine may induce lower mucosal antibody (IgA) comparing to i.n. vaccination of LAIV which were reported to have stronger mucosal immunity3,4. This could also partially be due to the earlier virus challenge experiment performed at 14 days after i.d. vaccination, while in our previously reported i.n. vaccination, virus challenge experiments were performed at 21 days after vaccination16. Nevertheless, i.d. vaccinated mice showed significantly reduced lung viral load and viral antigen NP was restricted to the bronchial epithelial layers. These findings indicated that the infection was well controlled after i.d. vaccination. Furthermore, lethal-dose virus challenge only caused mild degree of epithelial cell death and lung inflammatory cytokine responses. These findings indicated that the i.d. vaccination approach provided protection against severe disease upon infections.Serum HI and neutralizing antibody titers are often used as standard criteria to evaluate influenza vaccine immunogenicity, especially when vaccination was given via injections. Intradermal vaccination of DelNS1-LAIV induced serum HI and MNT antibodies in mice. A single dose of i.d. vaccination induced low HI and neutralizing titers at 14 days after vaccination while the titers elevated significantly after the second dose. The HI or MN antibody titers were not particularly high in our model at 14 days after the second vaccination. However, passive transfer of immunized mouse serum to naive mice fully protected the naive mice against lethal virus challenge. Further analyses of the serum antibody showed virus-specific IgG, IgG2a, and IgG1, which indicated that both Th1 and Th2 antibody responses were elicited in the i.d. vaccinated mice. It is well known that comparison of results for serum HI and MNT antibody titers against influenza vaccination or infection between different studies are problematic due to the nature of these assays and different laboratory settings. Together with the high protective effects, evaluation of serum HI or MN titers alone may underestimate the effects of i.d. LAIV; similar inconsistency of HI titers with protection were also observed from LAIV human clinical studies29. Virus-specific IgA in nasal secretions has been shown to be important for intranasal live vaccine-induced antibody responses30. However, we only detected a modest increase of IgA in the BAL of challenged mice at 2 and 4 dpi, which is not significantly different from that of the unvaccinated mice. This may suggest that the i.d. vaccination is more effective in inducing circulating antibodies than mucosal antibodies. In line with this observation, we found a better-preserved distal lung structure in challenged mice because circulating antibodies are more protective to the lower respiratory cells. Similarly, human studies with intramuscular vaccination of inactivated influenza vaccines usually elicited circulating antibodies, but not mucosal immune responses31,32, which may share similar underlying mechanisms with i.d. vaccination.LAIVs have been shown to induce strong T cell responses via intranasal administration4,33. We demonstrated here that i.d. vaccination with LAIV induced virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in lungs. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that they were mainly CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, which produced interferon-γ upon influenza T cell epitope stimulation in vitro. However, depletion of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells through antibody injection in vaccinated mice did not affect the protection effect against lethal virus challenge. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells staining showed they were largely depleted from the lung at day 4 after virus challenge, hinting that T cells are not essential for early protection against virus challenge. This may also explain the observation that transfer of immunized T cells to naive mice could not protect them from virus challenge. Of note, we still observed some CD4 and CD8 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node (Supplementary Fig. 2c) and spleen tissue (Supplementary Fig. 2d) after T cell depletion, this suggested that our depletion procedure did not completely deplete T cells in the lymphoid tissue34. Therefore, there may be some T cell recruitment from 4 dpi onward as the last depleting antibodies were administrated at 3 dpi.In conclusion, our study demonstrated that i.d. administration of LAIV induces B cell and T cell responses and offers an equally safe and efficacious alternative to i.n. vaccination. Along with the constant efforts to improve influenza vaccine using different strategies, our study opened up a new option for LAIV. Further studies for its safety and efficacy in human are warranted.MethodsLAIV, animal, and virusesLAIV (DelNS1-LAIV) was generated from A/California/04/2009(H1N1) by deleting the NS1 coding region as we previously reported16. Six to eight weeks old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Centre for Comparative Medicine Research, the University of Hong Kong. A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 H1N1 mouse-adapted strain (H1N1/415742Md)35, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8), mouse-adapted A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013m)36, and A/VNM/1194/2004 H5N137 were used for virus challenge experiments after vaccination. Six to eight weeks old female BALB/c mice obtained from Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong were housed in specific pathogen-free animal facility with 12 h light–dark cycle and free access to standard pellet food and water. Vaccination and virus challenging experiments were performed in biosafety level 2, or level 3 animal laboratories at the Department of Microbiology. The experimental procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research, the University of Hong Kong (CULATR # 5095-19).Vaccination and virus challenge of miceMice were randomly divided into groups, the fur on the lower back were shaved to expose the skin. Next, 106 PFU of DelNS1-LAIV diluted in 100 µl of PBS were injected i.d. with insulin syringe, 30–40 µl per injection site. The mice were observed twice daily to identify skin tissue damages. The second dose of vaccination was given via i.d. at 14 days after the first dose. Blood, skin, and lymph node samples were taken at 14 and 28 days after first dose vaccine, and 14 days after second does as well, for the analysis of vaccine-induced immune responses. Virus challenging experiments were performed under ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthesia and intranasal inoculation of 10x LD50 of H1N1/415742Md, PR8, A/Anhui/1/2013m (H7N9), or A/VNM/1194/2004 (H5N1) at 14 or 28 days, 3 or 6 months after vaccination. The body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days after virus challenge. The lung viral load, histological changes, and immune responses were studied at 2 and 4 dpi.Determination of lung viral load by plaque assayThe lungs were taken at 2 and 4 dpi, the left-side lobes were homogenized in 1 ml of cold minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Homogenates were clarified by centrifuge at 9000g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatant were made aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. For plaque assay, 10-fold serial diluted homogenates were inoculated into MDCK cell monolayer in 12-well plates followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The inoculum was removed by PBS washing and the cells were then overlaid with MEM containing 2% low-melting-point agarose and 2 µg/ml of L-1-p-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. The cells were fixed in 10% formalin solution and stained with 1% crystal violet after 72 h incubation. The number of plaques were counted and calculated as PFU/ml.Real-time RT-PCR for cytokine gene expressionTotal RNA was extracted from 350 µl of clarified lung homogenates using MiniBEST Universal RNA extraction kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of RNA with oligo-dT primer and PrimeScriptTM RT kit (Takara). Cytokine gene expression levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR performed on a LightCycler 96 system (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, USA) using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 1) and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara). The expression of house-keeping gene β-actin or GAPDH was quantified in parallel for RNA normalization. The relative expression of the target genes was calculated by the ΔΔ Ct method.Histological examination of mouse lung tissueFor histological analysis, the right-side of mouse lungs were fixed in 10% formalin/PBS, processed, and embedded in paraffin blocks. Then, 4 µm thick tissue sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and were examined by a blinded pathologist without the knowledge of the samples. The severity of bronchiolar epithelial cell death was assessed by the number of bronchiole sections with dead cell debris in the lumens and bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, and rated by a semi-quantitative scoring method as described in Supplementary Table 238. Representative images were captured with Olympus BX53 semi-motorized fluorescence microscope equipped with CellSens software.Immunohistochemistry staining of lung sectionsRehydrated paraffin-embedded lung sections were treated with Antigen Unmasking Solution according the manufacturer’s instruction (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA) to unmask the antigen. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated with mouse anti-influenza NP, rabbit anti-mouse CD4, or rabbit anti-mouse CD8 primary antibody (all from Abcam) at 4 °C overnight39, followed by biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) for 30 min at room temperature. Streptavidin peroxidase complex reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min followed by color development with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories). The slides were mounted and examined under microscope. Representative images were captured with Olympus BX53 semi-motorized fluorescence microscope.Passive transfer of immunized serum or spleen T cells to naive mice before virus challengeSerum and splenocytes were collected 28 day after first dose i.d. vaccination and pooled for passive transfer; 400 μl of pooled serum (HA = 1:80) were intraperitoneally injected to naive mice at 18 h prior to and immediately before virus challenge. Next, 1 × 107 of T cells purified using pan-T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) were intraperitoneally injected to different groups of naive mice at 18 h prior to virus challenge. The mice were challenged by 3x LD50 of H1N1/415742Md virus.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and microneutralization (MN) assayMouse serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Japan) overnight at 37 °C and inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. For HI assay, 2-fold serially diluted serum was incubated with 4 HA unit of influenza virus at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with 50 µl of 0.5% turkey red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories, PA, USA). The plates were read after 30 min of incubation. For MN assay, diluted serum was incubated with 100 TCID50 of the virus at room temperature for 1 h and added to MDCK cells. After absorption for 1 h, virus inoculum was removed and cells were incubated with MEM with 2 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C. Cytopathic effects were evaluated at 72 h after incubation40.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)For detection of virus-specific antibodies in mouse serum, 96-well immunoplates (Nunc-Immuno Modules; Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with inactivated virus particles (2 µg/ml) in 0.05 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h, 2-fold serially diluted serum was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technology, CA, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h. After color development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with H2SO4. The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm. The cut-off OD was set at the mean OD of uninfected serum at all dilutions plus 3 standard deviations. The highest sample dilution which produces an OD above this cut-off OD was taken as the antibody titer41,42.Flow cytometry assayTo determine the composition and activation of immune cells in the lymph nodes from vaccinated mice and lungs from infected mice, single-cell suspension were prepared and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies before fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde for flow cytometry assay. Single cells from lymph nodes were stained with CD45-PerCP/Cy5.5, B220-Brilliant Violet 421, CD11c-PE/Cy7, CCR7-APC, CD86-PE, and MHC-II (I-A/I-E)-Pacific blue antibodies (all from Biolegend) for the identification the activation of dendritic and B cells. Single cells from lung tissues were stained with CD45-APC/Cy7, B220-PerCP/Cy5.5, CD3-PerCP/Cy5.5, CD4-PE/Cy7, CD8-PE, CD44-APC/Cy7, and CD62L-Brilliant Violet 421 antibodies. Effector memory T cells were identified as CD3+, CD4+/CD8+, CD44+, and CD62L− cells, whereas central memory T cells were identified as CD3+, CD4+/CD8+, CD44+, and CD62L+ cells. Stained cells were analyzed on LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Bioscience), data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Inc.).Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assayTo detect virus-specific IgG producing B cells, BAL, lung, and spleen were taken from vaccinated or non-vaccinated mice at day 4 post virus challenge. Single-cell suspensions from each sample were seeded into ELISPOT plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well, and incubated for 48 h with 100 μg of purified inactivated H1N1/415742Md virus (5 μg/ml) as antigen. IgG producing cells were then detected by alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. To determine virus-specific T cells, 2.5 × 105 cells of single cells were seeded and stimulated with 3 μg/ml of H1N1 nucleoprotein CD4 epitope peptide (RLIQNSITIERMVLS) or CD8 epitope peptide (TYQRTRALV) for 48 h16,22, interferon-γ producing T cells were detected using mouse IFN-γ ELISpot BASIC kit (Mabtech, Inc., Stockholm, Sweden) following the manufacturer’s instructions.DelNS1-LAIV infection and activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs)MoDCs were generated from freshly isolated human CD14+ monocytes and cultured in RPMI1640 complete medium supplemented with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 6 days19. The cells were infected with DelNS1-LAIV and wild-type A/Hong Kong/415742/2009 virus at MOI of 2. Cell lysates were collected at 6 or 24 hpi for viral load and cytokine/chemokine gene expression analysis. Protocol for using buffy coats blood from healthy blood donors was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong (ref. no. IRB UW16-106).Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were computed using Prism 8.0. Analysis between groups was performed by Student’s t-test or two-way ANOVA. Mouse survival rates were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. p Values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Faculty Alumni Giving Home / News / Research and Innovation / Research and Innovation Miller School Research Reveals that Flu Shot Protects Against Severe Effects of COVID-19 By: Kai Hill | August 03, 2021 | 5 min. read | Share In a newly published study, physician-scientists at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have shown that the flu vaccine may provide vital protection against COVID-19. From left, senior study author and Chief of Plastic Surgery Devinder Singh, M.D., with lead authors: medical student Susan M. Taghioff and plastic surgery resident Benjamin R. Slavin, M.D. The study, titled “Examining the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort analysis of 74,754 patients,” was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLoS One on August 3. This was the largest study of its kind and analyzed deidentified patient records from around the world, which strongly suggested that the annual flu shot reduces the risks of stroke, sepsis, and DVT in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 who had been vaccinated against the flu were also significantly less likely to visit the emergency department and be admitted to the intensive care unit. “Only a small fraction of the world has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to date, and with all the devastation that has occurred due to the pandemic, the global community still needs to find solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality,” said senior study author Devinder Singh, M.D., chief of plastic surgery, and professor of clinical surgery at the Miller School. “Having access to the real-time data of millions of patients is an incredibly powerful research tool,” added Dr. Singh, who conducted the study with medical student Susan Taghioff and plastic surgery resident Benjamin Slavin, M.D., both of whom were lead authors. “Together with asking important questions, my team has been able to observe an association between the flu vaccine and reduced morbidity in COVID-19 patients.” Sharing Findings with Scientists and General Public The researchers previously presented their preliminary data findings at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), receiving international attention. Now that the full study has been published, the authors are extremely excited to share their detailed findings for the first time with both the general public and scientific community. The study was conducted using patient records from a number of countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Italy, Israel and Singapore. The team screened de-identified electronic health records on the TriNetX research database for more than 70 million patients to identify two groups of 37,377 patients. The two patient groups were then matched for factors that could influence their risk of susceptibility to severe COVID-19, including but not limited to age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, and health problems such as diabetes, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Members of the first study group had received the flu vaccine two weeks and six months prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Those in the second group also had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis but were not vaccinated against the flu. The incidence of 15 adverse outcomes (sepsis; strokes; deep vein thrombosis or DVT; pulmonary embolism; acute respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome; arthralgia or joint pain; renal failure; anorexia; heart attack; pneumonia; emergency department visits; hospital admission; ICU admission; and death) within 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of testing positive for COVID-19 were then compared between the two groups. The analysis revealed that those who had not had the flu shot were significantly more likely (up to 20% more likely) to have been admitted to the ICU. They were also significantly more likely to visit the emergency department (up to 58% more likely), to develop sepsis (up to 45% more likely), to have a stroke (up to 58% more likely) and a DVT (up to 40% more likely). The risk of death was not reduced. Avoiding Adverse Outcomes The investigators were also able to calculate how many COVID-19-positive patients would need to receive an influenza vaccine to avoid one adverse outcome. Notably, they found that only 176 patients needed to have received a flu vaccine to prevent one ED visit within 120 days of testing positive for COVID-19. Additionally, only 286 patients needed to have received their flu vaccine to prevent one case of sepsis, which is known to be the most expensive condition to treat in the U.S. health care system. Last, for every 440 patients who were up to date on their flu shot, one ICU admission was prevented. Although it isn’t exactly known yet how the flu vaccine provides protection against COVID-19, most theories speculate that the flu shot may boost the innate immune system — general defenses we are born with that do not protect against any one specific illness. The results, said study authors, strongly suggest that the flu vaccine may protect against several severe effects of COVID-19. However, they strongly recommend that people receive COVID-19 vaccines as well their annual influenza vaccine. They add that more research, in the form of prospective randomized control trials, is needed to prove and better understand the possible link but, in the future, the flu shot could be used to help provide increased protection in countries where the COVID-19 vaccine is in short supply or even aid in the ongoing struggle against breakthrough cases in those individuals already vaccinated against COVID-19. “Continued promotion of the influenza vaccine also has the potential help the global population avoid a possible ‘twindemic’ — a simultaneous outbreak of both influenza and coronavirus,” Taghioff said. “Regardless of the degree of protection afforded by the influenza vaccine against adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19, simply being able to conserve global health care resources by keeping the number of influenza cases under control is reason enough to champion continued efforts to promote influenza vaccination worldwide.” Tags: COVID-19, Dr. Devinder Singh, flu shot, PLOS One Related Orthopaedics Department’s Regenerative Research Highlighted at ORS Annual Meeting February 19, 2024 | 5 min. read UHealth Co-Sponsors Collaborative HSS Orthopaedic Symposium February 02, 2024 | 4 min. read Five Advances Transforming Breast Cancer Care and Prevention October 02, 2024 | 8 min. read Categories Clinical Care Community Outreach Grants and Awards Medical Education Research and Innovation Topics Alumni Cancer Cardiovascular Medicine Digestive Health and Liver Diseases Diversity Infectious Diseases Neurosciences Ophthalmology Orthopaedics Otolaryngology Philanthropy Urology FacebookYouTubeTwitterLinkedInInstagramResearch Gate Resources News Research MyUM UM Network Alumni Association Giving Wellness Center Careers University of Miami Visit Campus Highlights Transportation & Parking UHealth Bascom Palmer Eye Institute Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Emergency Information | Privacy Statement & Legal Notices © 2024 University of Miami.

Care Health Plan and Blue Shield of California. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Study: Flu vaccine may reduce severe COVID-19 side effects By Rachel Tillman Nationwide PUBLISHED 2:12 PM ET Aug. 05, 2021 PUBLISHED 2:12 PM EDT Aug. 05, 2021 SHARE Individuals who received an influenza vaccine and subsequently developed COVID-19 have the potential for less severe side effects from the disease, according to a new study published in the Plos One medical journal on Wednesday. What You Need To Know A new study published Wednesday found individuals who received an influenza vaccine and subsequently developed COVID-19 tended to develop less severe side effects from the disease The study specifically found patients who received the influenza vaccine had a mitigated risk of sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, and both emergency department and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions after contracting COVID-19 The study, however, found âno association between influenza vaccination and risk of deathâ in COVID-19 patients Researchers do not yet have a concrete answer as to why the influenza vaccine might offer protection against severe cases of COVID-19 Researchers examined the records of over 73 million patients from around the world, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Israel and Singapore. Those records were pared down to two groups of 37,377 COVID-19 patients: Members of one group had received an influenza vaccine anywhere from six months to two weeks prior to contracting COVID-19, and the other group did not get a flu vaccine. Researchers say two weeks is the minimum amount of time for a person to develop sufficient antibodies after receiving a flu vaccine, while six months is when protection against a virus can start to fade. The study specifically found patients who received the influenza vaccine had a mitigated risk of sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, and both emergency department and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions after contracting COVID-19. COVID-19 patients who had not gotten a flu vaccine were 20% more likely to be admitted to the ICU, around 58% more likely to make an emergency room visit, 58% more likely to have a stroke and up to 45% more likely to develop sepsis. The findings âsuggest a potential protective effect that could benefit populations without readily available access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,â the studyâs authors wrote in part, adding: âThus, further investigation with future prospective studies is warranted.â The study, however, found âno association between influenza vaccination and risk of deathâ in COVID-19 patients. The Plos One study is not the first to proffer a link between the flu vaccine and less severe side effects from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One study, published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine in January, examined 2,005 patients at the University of Florida who tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who had not received an influenza vaccination before contracting COVID-19 had both greater odds of hospitalization and greater odds of ICU admission compared to COVID-19 patients who had gotten their influenza vaccine. âOur analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective from moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection,â the study concluded in part. âThis protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity.â While researchers do not yet have a concrete answer as to why the influenza vaccine might offer protection against severe cases of COVID-19, they do have a number of theories. One possible answer is that the influenza vaccine triggers additional killer cells in the human body, which can in turn help to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Another theory, originally proposed in the International Immunopharmacology Sept. 2020 issue, suggests a certain oil-in-water squalene emulsion present in influenza vaccines also helps to create an immune response against SARS-CoV variants. The authors of the study published Wednesday say not only is the discovery important in âguarding against a possible âtwindemicâ of simultaneous outbreaks of influenza and SARS-CoV-2,â but it can also be used to slow the tide of severe COVID-19 cases in area with little access to COVID-19 vaccines. "Influenza vaccination may even benefit individuals hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to the newness of the technology,â wrote Susan Taghioff, co-author of the study and a research assistant at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, wrote in a statement announcing the results. "Despite this, the influenza vaccine is by no means a replacement for the COVID-19 vaccine and we advocate for everyone to receive their COVID-19 vaccine if able to.â LATEST NEWS Spectrum News CONTACT ABOUT RSS FAQ SITEMAP CAREERS ADVERTISE WITH US CERTIFICATIONS TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising Â© 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.Critical role of oxidized LDL receptor-1 in intravascular thrombosis in a severe influenza mouse model | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

This study evaluated influenza-associated abnormal blood coagulation utilizing a severe influenza mouse model. After infecting C57BL/6 male mice with intranasal applications of 500 plaque-forming units of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8), an elevated serum level of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, an indicator for activated thrombin generation, was observed. Also, an increased gene expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (Olr1), a key molecule in endothelial dysfunction in the progression of atherosclerosis, was detected in the aorta of infected mice. Body weight decrease, serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, viral load, and inflammation in the lungs of infected animals were similar between wild-type and Olr1 knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, the elevation of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 levels in the sera and intravascular thrombosis in the lungs by PR8 virus infection were not induced in KO mice. Collectively, the results indicated that OLR1 is a critical host factor in intravascular thrombosis as a pathogeny of severe influenza. Thus, OLR1 is a promising novel therapeutic target for thrombosis during severe influenza.

Influenza virus, a causative pathogen of influenza, infects and proliferates in the epithelial cells of respiratory tissues. In response to virus proliferation, host innate immunity is induced and triggers proinflammatory responses2. Although the detailed mechanisms of influenza pathogenesis are poorly understood, severe influenza is characterized by tissue edema and single- or multiple-organ dysfunction, one of the lethal pathological conditions3,4. Given the previous findings on sepsis-induced organ dysfunction5, microvascular thrombosis is considered to contribute to tissue injury and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome in severe influenza. In fact, an imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis during severe influenza has been confirmed in mouse and ferret models6,7. Furthermore, the increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolism after acute infectious diseases, including influenza, and the prolonged prothrombin time (PT) in human clinical cases further suggest that abnormal blood coagulation caused by viral infection also occurs in humans4,8,9,10. Therefore, the elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of abnormal blood coagulation during severe influenza would provide novel and important insights into the further understanding of influenza pathogenesis.Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (OLR1) is originally identified as a receptor for oxidized LDL in vascular endothelial cells11. Previous studies have demonstrated that OLR1 mediates vascular endothelial cell damage and atherosclerosis and the enhancement of vascular permeability caused by oxidized LDL12,13. Furthermore, a wide range of physiological functions of OLR1 far beyond cardiovascular diseases has been elucidated, for example, in the regulation of inflammatory responses to endotoxin14,15. In a lung injury mouse model, intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin rapidly increases OLR1 protein expression in the lungs, and induced OLR1 activates inflammatory nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, leukocyte accumulation, and hyperpermeability in the lungs15. Also, OLR1 expressed in vascular endothelial cells promotes the attachment of activated platelets to the cells and endothelial dysfunction16,17, which could change the vascular wall into prothrombotic. These previous findings led to the hypothesis that OLR1 is a bridge between inflammation and abnormal blood coagulation and plays an important role in influenza pathogenesis.This study evaluated influenza-associated abnormal blood coagulation utilizing a severe influenza mouse model that was previously established18. Furthermore, blood coagulation profiles were compared between wild-type (WT) and Olr1 global knockout (KO) mice to investigate the roles of OLR1 as a host factor in cytokine production, coagulation abnormality, and lung intravascular thrombosis during influenza.ResultsActivated thrombin generation in a severe influenza mouse modelThe effect of influenza virus infection on the blood coagulation system of the host was investigated in a severe influenza mouse model, in which weight loss of 25% or more, a criterion for a humane endpoint, is induced within 7 days of infection18. PR8 virus was intranasally infected to male mice at a dose of 500 plaque-forming units (PFUs)/mouse, and samples were collected at 1, 3, and 6 days post-infection (dpi). Body weight changes at each sampling point were 99.9% ± 0.4% in control mice and 99.8% ± 0.5% in infected mice at 1 dpi, 101.1% ± 0.7% in control mice and 86.1% ± 0.4% in infected mice at 3 dpi, and 101.5% ± 0.9% in control mice and 74.0% ± 0.7% in infected mice at 6 dpi. Significant body weight loss was observed in infected mice, compared to control mice, at 3 and 6 dpi [p < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. In addition to body weight loss, infected mice showed ruffled fur, lower motor activity, and dehydration at 6 dpi. Measurements of blood coagulation parameters were performed with whole-blood, and sera were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi for samples at a very early stage, the onset of a symptom, and the lethal phase during influenza, respectively.The international normalized ratio of PT (PT-INR) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 concentrations were examined as blood coagulation parameters. As shown in Fig. 1a, the PT-INR level, a clinical index of the duration of blood coagulation, was elevated in PR8 virus-infected mice at 3 and 6 dpi (0.90 ± 0.03 in control mice and 1.16 ± 0.09 in infected mice at 3 dpi, p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA; 0.89 ± 0.02 in control mice and 1.46 ± 0.11 in infected mice at 6 dpi; p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). A time-dependent elevation of the PT-INR level in the host with severe influenza was also indicated (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). Moreover, the serum level of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, a specific indicator of activated thrombin generation, drastically increased in infected mice (Fig. 1b). The levels were 3.89 ± 2.79 ng/mL in control mice and 2.08 ± 2.08 ng/mL in infected mice at 1 dpi, 2.66 ± 2.17 ng/mL in control mice and 26.04 ± 14.48 ng/mL in infected mice at 3 dpi, and 5.77 ± 3.48 ng/mL in control mice and 143.77 ± 14.62 ng/mL in infected mice at 6 dp. A significant difference between control and infected mice was observed only in samples collected at 6 dpi (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). These results clearly showed that abnormal blood coagulation demonstrated by both prolonged PT and increased thrombin generation from prothrombin is induced in the host at the lethal phase of severe influenza. On the other hand, PR8 virus infection at 25 PFU did not induce the elevation of serum prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 or PT-INR in 6 days in our preliminary experiment. Therefore, subsequent experiments were conducted using lethal infection conditions of 500 PFU to investigate blood coagulation abnormalities in severe influenza.Figure 1Blood coagulation parameters in control versus PR8 virus-infected mice at 1, 3, and 6 dpi. Mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus, and whole-blood and serum samples were collected for the measurement of (a) PT-INR [n = 11 (PR8-6 dpi group) or 12 (the other groups)] and (b) prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 [n = 6 (PR8-6 dpi group) or 8 (the other groups)], respectively, at 1, 3, and 6 dpi.

Thoracic aorta and lung samples from control and PR8 virus-infected mice were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi, and gene expression related to inflammation and endothelial functions was investigated (Fig. 2). Interleukin-6 (Il6), a proinflammatory cytokine, was significantly increased by 15.8- and 3.6-fold in the aorta (Fig. 2a) and by 228.46- and 63.78-fold in the lung (Fig. 2d) of infected mice at 3 and 6 dpi, respectively (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (Icam1), which encodes adhesion molecules for leukocytes, was expressed at slightly but significantly increased levels in the infected mouse aorta (1.69- and 1.49-fold at 3 and 6 dpi, respectively, p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 2b), whereas its expression in the lungs was significantly increased only at 3 dpi (2.53-fold, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 2e). OLR1, an endothelial receptor for LDL, is a key player in oxidized LDL-induced atherogenesis and endotoxin-induced inflammation14,19. Interestingly, aortic Olr1 expression was significantly increased in PR8 virus-infected mice by 5.6- and 3.0-fold at 3 and 6 dpi, respectively (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 2c). The lung of infected mice also showed a significant level of induction of Olr1 at 3 dpi (1.33-fold, p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 2f). Also, expression levels of Il6 and Olr1 were significantly correlated in samples collected at 3 dpi (aorta, R2 = 0.8585, p < 0.0001; lung, R2 = 0.6488, p < 0.05; linear regression analysis). Aortic samples collected at 6 dpi also showed a weaker but significant correlation between the levels of these genes (R2 = 0.4516, p < 0.0005, linear regression analysis). Given its critical role in endotoxin-induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction14,17, OLR1 was hypothesized to be involved in local and systemic inflammation as well as abnormal blood coagulation observed in mice with severe influenza. This hypothesis led to conduct influenza virus infection experiments in Olr1 KO (KO) mice, which was previously established19, to confirm whether this host factor is involved in those pathological events.Figure 2Expression of inflammation-related genes in the aorta and lungs. Mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus, and (a–c) aortic and (d–f) lung samples were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi.

PR8, influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34; dpi, days post-infection.Full size imageSimilar body weight loss and virus titer in the lungs of Olr1 KO mice upon influenza virus infection to those in WT micePR8 virus was intranasally infected to WT and KO mice at a dose of 500 PFU/mouse. Blood coagulation parameters and serum cytokine levels as well as the histopathological changes in the lungs were also evaluated. Both mice showed significant body weight losses from 3 dpi onward (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 3a). At 6 dpi, body weight changes were 103.2% ± 0.2% in WT-control mice, 78.8% ± 0.9% in WT-PR8 virus-infected mice, 103.5% ± 0.7% in KO-control mice, and 80.7% ± 0.8% in KO-PR8 virus-infected mice. No significant difference was detected in body weight losses between WT and KO mice at any time points (p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). All infected mice were euthanized at 6 dpi for a humane endpoint indexed by weight loss, but the hair gloss looked better in KO mice, and they were more active than WT mice. The average lung virus titers of WT and KO mice at 3 and 6 dpi were 4.16 × 105 ± 0.90 × 105 in WT mice and 4.94 × 105 ± 0.58 × 105 in KO mice at 3 dpi and 2.78 × 104 ± 0.41 × 104 in WT mice and 3.04 × 104 ± 0.77 × 104 in KO mice at 6 dpi (Fig. 3b). No significant difference was detected between WT and KO at both time points ((p > 0.05, two-way ANOVA). These results indicated that the absence of OLR1 did not affect the infection and replication of the virus in the lungs, at least under this experimental condition.Figure 3Effect of OLR1 on virus infection-induced body weight decrease and lung viral replication. WT and KO mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus, and (a) body weight change and (b) lung virus titers were evaluated. (a) The body weight change of mice was calculated as a percentage of the original weight. Symbols represent mean ± SEM (WT-control, n = 9; WT-PR8, n = 9; KO-control, n = 6; KO-PR8, n = 8).

No significant difference was detected between WT and KO mice at each time point by two-way ANOVA. (b) At 3 and 6 dpi, mice were euthanized for the collection of lung samples, and plaque assays on MDCK cells were performed to calculate the lung viral titers in each sample (n = 5).

When comparing WT and KO mice, a significant difference in the infection-induced PT-INR level was detected (p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA). In contrast, elevated serum prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 was observed only in infected WT mice (95.524 ± 29.8 ng/mL), whereas the value was not altered in KO mice after virus infection (Fig. 4b). These results indicated that the host factor OLR1 plays an important role in pathological blood coagulation during severe influenza. Particularly, thrombin generation from prothrombin in mice with severe influenza was considered critically regulated by OLR1.Figure 4Effect of OLR1 on virus infection-induced blood coagulation abnormalities. WT and KO mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus, and whole-blood and serum samples were collected for the measurement of (a) PT-INR (WT control, n = 9; WT PR8, n = 9; KO control, n = 7; KO PR8, n = 7) and (b) prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (n = 4), respectively, at 6 dpi.

Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine IL-6 (Fig. 5a), interferon-γ-induced protein-10 (IP-10; Fig. 5b), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; Fig. 5c), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β; Fig. 5d) were detected in PR8 virus-infected KO mice at very similar levels to those in infected WT mice. For example, the serum IL-6 levels were 3.68 ± 1.73 pg/mL in WT-control mice, 218.4 ± 32.9 pg/mL in WT-PR8 virus-infected mice, 0.39 ± 0.24 pg/mL in KO-control mice, and 217.0 ± 28.7 pg/mL in KO-PR8 virus-infected mice. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated only effects of virus infection on all cytokines and chemokines (p < 0.0001) but not in the presence or absence of OLR1 (p > 0.05). Consistently, there was no difference in the induced levels of Il6 gene expression in the aorta and lungs between WT and KO mice (Supplemental Fig. S1). The results further suggested that OLR1 is dispensable for local cytokine production. Collectively, these results revealed that OLR1 plays a role in the activation of thrombin generation in severe influenza without affecting the production of inflammatory cytokines.Figure 5Effect of OLR1 on virus infection-induced systemic inflammation. WT and KO mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS alone or PBS comprising PR8 virus, and serum samples were collected at 6 dpi. Serum levels of (a) IL-6, (b) IP-10, (c) MCP-1, and (d) MIP-1β were measured by a multiplex assay. (a–d) Bars represent the mean ± SEM of 3 (KO control group) or 8 (the other groups) animals.

WT, wild type mice; KO, Olr1 knockout mice; NS, not significant.Full size imageSuppression of the influenza-induced thrombosis in the lungs of Olr1 KO micePulmonary inflammation and thrombus formation in the lungs at the lethal phase of influenza were further investigated utilizing the severe influenza mouse model, and the results from WT mice were compared to those from KO mice (Fig. 6). No apparent difference was found in the microscopic observation of the lungs between WT and KO mice (Fig. 6a, b). The degree of lung inflammation caused by PR8 virus infection was examined in hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections from WT and KO mice sacrificed at 6 dpi when mice showed severe body weight losses. Lungs from both WT and KO mice demonstrated obvious peribronchial inflammation, inflammatory cells in alveoli, thickened alveolar walls, and alveolar hemorrhage after virus infection (Fig. 6c, d). Also, leukocytes in the vascular intima and perivascular spaces were observed in infected mice (Fig. 6c, d, inserts), suggesting activated leukocyte migration. No clear difference was observed between WT and KO mice. This result was compatible with serum cytokine data representing similar systemic cytokine secretion in KO mice to that in WT mice.Figure 6Effect of OLR1 on virus infection-induced inflammation and intravascular thrombosis in the lungs. WT and KO mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS alone or PBS comprising the PR8 virus. Lung samples were collected at 6 dpi, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5 μm. For histopathological analyses, sections were stained with (a–d) HE or (e and f) PTAH. (a) WT control, (b) KO control, (c and e) WT infected with PR8 virus, and (d and f) KO infected with PR8 virus. Scale bars, 100 μm. (c and d) Arrowheads in inserts indicate the leukocytes in the vascular intima. (e and f) Arrows indicate the intravascular clots stained in blue by PTAH.

PR8, influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34; WT, wild type mice; KO, Olr1 knockout mice; HE, hematoxylin and eosin; PTAH, phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin.Full size imageTo confirm thrombus formation associated with severe influenza, phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) staining was performed, in which fibrin is stained in blue and thrombi can be visualized as well as fibrin deposition. As shown in Fig. 6e,f, increased intravascular thrombus formation in the lungs of WT mice infected with PR8 virus was indicated by multiple fibrin clots in blood vessels (Fig. 6e, arrows). In contrast to WT-infected mice, only sporadic thrombi were found in blood vessels of KO-infected mice similar to those in the uninfected groups, although HE staining indicated severe pulmonary inflammation in KO mice (Fig. 6f). Intravascular fibrin deposition observed in the lungs of infected KO mice seemed due to the clotting of residual blood in the blood vessels of the lungs after euthanasia, as they were found mainly in small veins, even in areas of less severe inflammation as in uninfected mice. The average numbers of clots [± standard error of the mean (SEM)] in the lung sections were 6.5 ± 2.7 in WT-control mice (n = 4), 53.8 ± 4.5 in WT-infected mice (n = 4), 7.7 ± 2.9 in KO-control mice (n = 3), and 9.8 ± 3.3 in KO-infected mice (n = 4). The number was significantly larger only in the WT infection group, compared to those in other groups (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA). These results demonstrated a critical role of OLR1 in severe influenza-induced intravascular thrombus formation in the lungs.DiscussionThis study demonstrated prolonged PT and increased thrombin generation from prothrombin at the lethal phase of severe influenza in a mouse model. The results were consistent with previous findings in mouse and ferret influenza models6,7. Also, this study revealed a significant induction of aortic Olr1 and its critical contribution to the thrombin generation and intravascular thrombosis in the lungs of mice with severe influenza. The important physiological roles of OLR1 have already been demonstrated in platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, leukocyte migration, plaque formation, and atherosclerosis as a consequence of these pathological events12,14,16,20. In the context of acute coronary syndrome as a result of the progression of atherosclerosis, OLR1 has been thought to be involved in prothrombotic pathways induced by oxidized LDL21. Also, this study shows that OLR1 is critically involved in the first step of thrombus formation by promoting thrombin production in severe influenza. Although the detailed molecular mechanism needs to be elucidated, OLR1 induced in the vascular cells of mice infected with influenza virus may have promoted adhesion between platelets and the endothelial surface, as reported previously16, and increased thrombin generation by activated platelet. The contribution of OLR1 to PT prolongation in severe influenza was also demonstrated in this study. Suppose consumptive coagulopathy is the cause of PT prolongation as already suggested in a ferret influenza model7, the suppression of thrombin formation in KO mice would have reduced the consumption of coagulation factors, resulting in only mild PT prolongation.Interestingly, increased intravascular fibrin clotting was not evident in other tissues of infected mice, e.g., the liver (data not shown), despite the elevation of circulating thrombin. Therefore, not only circulating thrombin but also factors associated with virus infection and/or a severe inflammatory response in the lung during influenza appear involved in a stable fibrin clot formation. For example, integrating previous reports on influenza and thrombus formation, increased expression of tissue factor, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and decreased blood flow velocity induced in the lungs by influenza virus infection are considered to promote thrombus formation preferably in the tissue22,23,24,25.OLR1 expression is very low under normal conditions and upregulated in response not only to its ligand oxidized LDL26 but also various stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)27,28,29. Several transcription factors have been reported to regulate Olr1 transcription. Given the genetic regulation of Olr1 by inflammatory cascades through the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB30,31, influenza virus infection-induced systemic cytokine secretion could have induced Olr1 in this study. A strong positive correlation between gene expression levels of Olr1 and Il6 suggested a link between OLR1 and inflammation. Because inflammation in the lungs and elevated blood cytokine levels in KO mice were similar to those in WT mice after virus infection, OLR1 does not regulate inflammatory responses but is a downstream factor induced by inflammation in the present experimental condition. The detailed mechanisms of Olr1 induction by influenza virus infection remain elucidated. In addition to systemically secreted cytokines, of course, the possibility that the virus directly infects the cells of blood vessels32 and induces Olr1 needs to be taken into account. However, given that Olr1 is induced by various factors, its expression may have been induced by others aside from inflammatory molecules, such as oxidized LDL, angiotensin II, and metabolic abnormalities26,33,34, which have been previously reported to be induced during acute influenza18,35,36. Further studies on the mechanisms of Olr1 induction by a viral infection will provide insights into biological responses to and pathogenesis of infectious diseases far beyond just cytokine induction.Influenza virus infection-induced lung inflammation and systemic cytokine secretion were not affected by the absence of OLR1 in this study. However, OLR1 was involved in endotoxin-induced acute lung inflammation in a previous study in which an anti-OLR1 antibody pretreatment completely blocked immune cell activation and infiltration into the lungs after intraperitoneal injection with endotoxin15,37. This difference may reflect a pathophysiological difference between the host response to endotoxin and that to virus infection. In septic models, the administered LPS binds to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 on the cell membrane and causes an inflammatory response by activating NF-κB signaling in each cell in the first step. OLR1 has been reported to colocalize and cooperate with TLR2 to activate inflammatory responses by the outer membrane protein A of Gram-negative bacteria38. Furthermore, OLR1 functions as a bacterial receptor that enhances the adhesion of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to cells39. Therefore, because OLR1 is involved in the very early steps of TLR-mediated signaling on the cell membrane, the absence of OLR1 and its blockade may have strongly suppressed the inflammatory responses in the septic model. In contrast, during viral infection, virus entry into cells occurs first, and various viral molecules, such as viral membrane glycoproteins, viral constituent proteins, and nucleic acids, activate inflammation-related transducing cascades inside the infected cells, leading to the activation of NF-κB and other transcription factors to promote cytokine production40. Especially in the case of the influenza virus, at least two pathways thought to be independent of TLR2/4 have been reported to activate NF-κB: (1) endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by the overload of viral protein hemagglutinin41 and (2) double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase42. Therefore, cytokine production in viral infection could be activated independently on OLR1. WT and KO mice showed a similar degree of weight loss after virus infection. This may be due to anorexia caused by increased circulating cytokines43. When focusing on biological responses after cytokine induction, weight loss does not seem to be a good indicator of the severity of the disease.In summary, the findings indicated that influenza virus infection induces Olr1 gene expression in the vascular system to promote thrombin generation and resultant intravascular clotting in the lungs. Thus, OLR1 is a promising novel therapeutic target to suppress the prothrombotic state during severe influenza. In addition, thrombosis has been observed to occur in many viral infections and is thought to be involved in the symptoms and severity of the diseases, including coronavirus disease 201944. The importance of OLR1 in thrombosis should be considered in a wide range of infectious diseases.Materials and methodsVirusInfluenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) was kindly provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Tokyo, Japan). The virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 °C for 48 h, and aliquots of collected allantoic fluids were stored at − 80 °C until further analysis.MiceThe Olr1 KO mice B6.129P2-Olr1tm1Saw (KO mice in this manuscript) were generated as previously reported19. Male C57BL/6 mice purchased from Hokudo (Sapporo, Japan) and KO mice kindly given by Dr. Sawamura were kept in a BSL-2 laboratory and a clean room, respectively, at the International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature 22 °C ± 2 °C, relative humidity 50% ± 10%) and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. For infectious experiments, KO mice were transferred to a BSL-2 laboratory and kept during experiments. Mice were administered a standard CE-2 chow diet purchased from CLEA Japan (Sapporo, Japan) with water ad libtum. Experiments were performed on 9- to 14-week-old male mice.Virus infection and sample collectionVirus infection and sample collection was carried out as previously reported18. PR8 virus particles at 500 PFUs in 50 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS only (control) were intranasally inoculated into mice under inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane. Body weight was monitored daily. At 1, 3, or 6 dpi, mice were euthanized by overdose of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation, and their blood, liver, and aorta, samples were collected. Blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h to clot and then centrifuged at 1000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected as serum and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis. Tissue samples were stored in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at − 80 °C until further analysis. This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines except for blinding. Investigators could not be blinded because genetically modified animals because of the obligation to clearly indicate on the cage cards the treatment of animals, including viral infection, and the genetic modification information of the animals.Measurement of coagulation parametersWhole-blood samples collected from mice were immediately used for PT-INR measurement with a CoaguChek Pro II (Roche Diagnosis, Mannheim, Germany) using a PT test strip. The concentrations of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 in thawed serum samples were measured with a Mouse Prothrombin Fragment 1 + 2 ELISA kit (LS Bio, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum samples were diluted tenfold in a sample dilution reagent provided by the kit.Measurement of selected gene expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using TRIzol and was used for cDNA synthesis using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Il6 (Mm00446190_m1), Icam1 (Mm00516023_m1), and Olr1 (Mm00454582_m1) gene expression was quantified using real-time PCR with a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with indicated TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). The obtained gene expression was normalized to 18S (Mm03928990_g1) from the same samples, and relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt).Measurement of the serum levels of cytokines and chemokinesMeasurement of cytokines and chemokines in serum samples was carried out as previously reported18. The serum levels of IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1β were determined using a MAGPIX Milliplex kit (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 25 μL serum samples, standards, and controls were added to a 96-well plate comprising an equal amount of assay buffer for serum samples or serum matrix for standards and controls. Next, magnetic beads coated with antibodies against the target cytokines were added to each well, and the plates were incubated on a plate shaker overnight at 4 °C. After washing with washing buffer in the kit, the samples were reacted with biotinylated detection antibodies for 1 h and then with streptavidin–phycoerythrin for 30 min. After washing and the addition of loading buffer from the kit, the samples were analyzed by the MAGPIX system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).Measurement of lung viral titersMice were euthanized at 3 and 6 dpi, and their lung samples were collected and homogenized in 1 mL RPMI-anti medium [RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20 µg/mL gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)]. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatants were collected and stored at − 80 °C until further analysis. For plaque assays, monolayers of MDCK cells were prepared by seeding 1.2 × 106 cells in 3 mL RP10 medium (RPMI-1640) supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 20 µg/mL gentamicin in each well of the tissue culture six-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The monolayers were washed with RPMI-anti, and 125 µL tenfold serially diluted lung lysates were added to each well. The viruses were allowed to adsorb to the monolayers for 45 min, with shaking of the plates at 15 min intervals. Then, 3 mL prewarmed overlay medium consisting of Leibovitz L-15 with glutamine at pH 6.8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.028% (w/v) NaHCO3 (Merck), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.1% (w/v) TPCK-treated trypsin (Merck), and 0.9% (w/v) agarose (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 days. Plaques on the monolayers were then counted without staining.Histopathological analysesAt 1, 3, or 6 dpi, mice were euthanized, and their lung samples were collected, immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5 μm. Slides were stained with HE or PTAH after dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in decreasing ethanol concentrations. HE-stained lung sections were microscopically evaluated to assess the character and severity of pathologic lesions. Fibrin deposition and clotting were evaluated in PTAH-stained sections.Ethical statementAll mouse experiments were performed with approval (approval# 17-003) from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University following the Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan. Body weight losses were monitored daily after infection, and mice were humanely euthanized when weight loss reached 25%.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Share this item with your network: By Eric Wicklund Published: 04 Aug 2021 A new study makes a strong case for telehealth as an alternative to the doctor’s office, particularly during flu season. Researchers from the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School and the university’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and athenahealth have found that people who visit their doctor’s office after someone infected with the flu has visited that office are much more likely to come down with the flu themselves. That same increase wasn’t seen in people seeking treatment for issues like urinary tract infections. The study, published this month in Health Affairs, suggests that primary care providers embrace virtual visits as a means of reducing that chance of infection. “It’s a widely accepted fact that patients can acquire infections in hospital settings, but we show that infection transmission can happen when you visit your doctor’s office, too,” Hannah Neprash, an assistant professor at UM’s School of Public Health and one of the study’s authors, said in a news release issued by the university. “Our findings highlight the importance of infection control practices and continued access to telemedicine services, as health care begins to return to pre-pandemic patterns,” she added. "In-person outpatient care for influenza may promote nontrivial transmission of these viruses. This may be true for other endemic respiratory illnesses too, including COVID-19, but more research is needed." The study, which tracked office visits from a national sample of insurance claims and EHR data compiled by athenahealth, is reportedly the first to connect the dots between office visits and the progression of a flu outbreak. According to that data, patients visits their primary care provider were almost 32 percent more likely to contract the flu within two weeks if that PCP had seen someone with the flu within the previous two weeks. In addition, that office would then serve as an incubator for the flu, infecting more patients over time. Neprash and her fellow researchers say their study supports the need for “triage to telemedicine” policies in clinics and medical offices when a patient shows signs of a contagious viral infection like the flu. “Given that upper respiratory symptoms are among the most common reasons for any patient to see a physician, these results highlight the importance of protocols to mitigate the risk for transmission,” the study notes. “Clinically, many of these patients will be at low risk for complications with telemedicine evaluation.” It also suggests that care providers develop “strict infection control practices” whenever a patient showing signs of the flu or a similar virus need to be seen in person. This would include mask-wearing, hand hygiene and putting patients in separate exam rooms that can be decontaminated after a visit. Finally, the study makes a case for continued support for telehealth coverage at a rate equal to in-person care. “Lawmakers in Congress are actively debating the future of telemedicine policy and how it should be reimbursed after the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic recedes,” the study notes. “It is possible that telemedicine reimbursement after the pandemic will be restricted to certain specialties or diagnoses or reimbursed at a rate low enough that many clinicians decide to forgo telemedicine as a mechanism for care delivery. Our results argue that clinically, for infection control, telemedicine should remain a financially viable option for clinicians to provide care for viral respiratory symptoms.” Next Steps California Hospital Uses mHealth Platform to Automate Contact Tracing Related Resources Advancing Value-Based Care Through Digital Healthcare Avenues –Talk Integrating Advanced Connected Care Technologies into the Care Continuum –Talk TeamViewer Tensor: A Remote Access and Support Solution for the Healthcare ... –TeamViewer Meeting the Healthcare Needs of Illinois’ Medicaid Enrollees –SafeRide Dig Deeper on Telehealth Telehealth use associated with physician satisfaction By: Anuja Vaidya Patient-Reported Symptom Data May Hinder Telehealth-Based Flu Diagnosis By: Shania Kennedy Telehealth Effective in Treating OUD Patients with Hepatitis C Virus By: Anuja Vaidya NIH Researchers Begin Clinical Trials on a Universal Influenza Vaccine By: Veronica Salib Sponsored News Driving Digital Transformation in Healthcare –Dell Technologies Exploring the Impact of Cost on Patient and Provider Dynamics –CareCredit Empowering Patients Through Early Financial Discussions –CareCredit Related Content Patient-Reported Symptom Data May Hinder ... – Healthtech Analytics California Hospital Uses mHealth Platform to Automate... – Virtual Healthcare Scripps Turns to mHealth Wearables to Help Plot ... – Virtual Healthcare Latest TechTarget resources Health IT Healthtech Security Rev Cycle Management Healthcare Payers xtelligent Health IT and EHR How generative AI in healthcare is helping cut admin burden Over 90% of healthcare workers feel optimistic about the promise of generative AI in healthcare to alleviate administrative ...

Since then, the contagious viral strain has devastated that country and spread to 131 others as of Friday, according to the World Health Organization. Genetic variants of viruses, according to the the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are like nearby branches of the same tree. By studying them, we can uncover related symptoms or characteristics that will help in the overall fight against COVID-19.🔬 Science is on our side—we'll help you make sense of it.So far, there are four variants of SARS-CoV-2 that the CDC considers "variants of concern," meaning that there is "evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures." ➡️ Get the Facts: COVID-19Everything You Need to Know About mRNAHow Deep Cleaners Kill the CoronavirusWill the Pandemic Usher In a Surveillance State?They're named for Greek letters in order, so there's Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and most notably, Delta, which health officials first observed in the U.S. in March. In a confidential report last week, the CDC said that the Delta variant is more contagious than chickenpox, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the original COVID-19 strain. Publicly, the Atlanta, Georgia-based health agency has reversed prior recommendations, urging vaccinated adults to mask up again.Understandably, the public is confused and concerned about the Delta strain. So what does the latest scientific research have to say about this highly contagious variant, which the CDC says is now the "dominant" strain in new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.?What Is the Delta Variant?The CDC categorizes variants using the terms "variant of interest," "variant of concern," and "variant of high consequence." These are based on factors like "transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape," the CDC explains. There are currently several variants of interest, which is the lowest level of worry. Fortunately, right now there are no known variants of high consequence. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta are all variants of concern.All this means that the Delta variant is a mutated strain of COVID-19 (coronavirus) with notable characteristics like increased transmission—meaning it's more contagious than the original virus strain. It also reduces the effectiveness of some treatments and vaccines compared to the Alpha strain. The Delta strain's official names are "21A" or "B.1.617.2," helping health officials to catalog different strains in a clear way for their communications and research.Where Did the Delta Variant Come From?Joao Paulo Burini//Getty ImagesA virus like SARS-CoV-2 constantly changes by mutating, with the evolutionary goal of continuing to infect new host organisms. There are multiple active mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2 that the CDC is monitoring, but the Delta variant has attracted the most attention due to its high rate of contagion.Viruses constantly mutate, especially if their genetic material contains ribonucleic acid (RNA), as is the case with coronaviruses and influenza viruses. When a virus gets inside your body, it attaches itself to one of your cells, injecting its genetic material inside. From there, it makes copies of itself that can infect other cells in your body. Sometimes, an error occurs during this replication process—what we know as a mutation. Usually, it's nothing to worry about, and the mistakes can even weaken a virus. But sometimes, the mutations are beneficial. "If these advantageous genetic mistakes are included when the virus replicates, they're passed on and eventually become part of the virus's normal genome," Dr. Daniel Rhoads, a microbiologist and pathologist at the Cleveland Clinic, explains in a blog post. Do Vaccines Work Against the Delta Variant?A pre-print study (meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed) looking at new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom found that the Pfizer vaccine is 88 percent effective against the Delta variant, which is just slightly below its efficacy against the original Alpha virus strain. A very small pre-print study of Moderna vacci​​ne recipients found that they had an increased number of effective titers against the Delta variant—a measure of antibody activity in the blood indicating increased immunity. View full post on XFurther research will confirm or refute these initial findings, especially for different vaccine manufacturers and formulations.How Contagious Is the Delta Variant?One pre-print study of household transmissions in the U.K. found that Delta variant cases spread more quickly in households compared with the rate of sporadic contamination outside of households. That indicates that the Delta variant can get a better foothold more quickly—meaning a higher rate of transmission. Screenshot/CDCAs of press time, the Delta variant accounts for over 80 percent of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to CDC data.So far, evidence indicates that the Delta variant is also more contagious. A July study posted to the pre-print server MedRxiv followed 62 people in China who were some of the first to become infected with the Delta variant. Researchers found that the individuals' viral loads, which measure the density of viral particles in the body—were 1,260 times higher than those who were infected with the Alpha strain.As of press time, the Delta variant accounts for over 80 percent of confirmed cases in the U.S.How Serious Is the Delta Variant?A June study published in the medical journal The Lancet found that the Delta variant especially hit younger, more affluent people, and patients were twice as likely to be hospitalized as those with the original Alpha strain. In this study, people with five or more comorbidities—conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity—were found even more likely to be admitted to the hospital. For people at high risk of complications from the Alpha strain, the Delta variant is likely even more dangerous for the same reasons.Will the Delta Varia​​nt Make You Sicker?People with the Delta variant seem more likely to require hospitalization, which indicates that it can make you sicker than the original virus. The symptoms, though, are slightly different from those of the Alpha strain. One Yale physician says that the Delta variant is less likely to cause loss of smell or taste or a persistent cough. Instead, it causes headache, sore throat, runny nose, and fever.➡️ Mask UpN95 Vs. KN95 Masks: What’s the Difference?What Is the Best Face Mask for Omicron?What's the Last Word on the Delta Variant?Research is still ongoing and very active concerning all strains of SARS-CoV-2. For now, it looks like the Delta variant is more contagious and more likely to lead to hospitalization when compared with the original virus strain.

According to the latest reports from the national veterinary agency to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), these bring the country’s total outbreaks since March of this year to 44. Directly impacted have been more than 2.76 million poultry. Registering cases have been several commercial ostrich flocks, as well as unspecified poultry, in the provinces of Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The most recent outbreaks were confirmed on July 19. Recent civil unrest in South Africa has added to the already challenging conditions for the country’s poultry sector. One leading company alone has estimated its losses at more than US$1 million as a result of the disruption. H5N8 HPAI “resolved” in South African poultry sector At the end of July, the national animal health agency declared to the OIE that the situation with respect to this virus in poultry had been “resolved.” According to OIE reports, this virus variant was first detected in South African in June of 2017. Broiler breeders at a commercial premises in Mpumalanga were first to test positive for this virus. Since then, 114 outbreaks have been confirmed. Directly impacted have been more than 5.9 million birds. With the most recent cases identified at a commercial ostrich farm in Western Cape in November of 2020, it is thought that the H5N8 variant has now been eliminated from South Africa’s poultry sector. New cases of HPAI among South African wild birds Since the start of July, the veterinary authority has confirmed that wild birds at a further nine locations have tested positive for the H5N1 HPAI virus. These included a variety of wild bird species and one hobby flock of chickens in Cape Town, other regions of Western Cape, Gauteng and Eastern Cape. Since the start of the current wave of outbreaks linked to this virus in March of this year, 154 cases have been identified of virus-positive birds. Avian flu returns to Ghana More than 10,000 poultry in the West African state have died from HPAI, reported news agency Xinhua in mid-July. Affected were seven farms in the southern coastal regions of Greater Accra, Central, and Volta. More than 5,800 birds are reported to have died, and around 4,500 have been culled to prevent further spread of the infection. While the virus type is not identified in this report, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicates that the H5N1 HPAI variant has been detected in Ghana since 2017. In the official notification to the OIE, Ghana’s veterinary authority records all seven outbreaks occurring among village poultry flocks of between 57 and 6,600 poultry in the last week of June. Presence of an HPAI virus of the H5 was confirmed. All affected flocks appear to be within around 30 kilometers of the capital city, Accra. Last time the H5 virus was detected in the country was in July of 2018. Bordering Ghana to the east is Togo, where the H5N1 HPAI virus has been present since early June of this year. Following the outbreak, Ghana suspended poultry imports from Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mauritania and Senegal as a precaution, reported Thomson Reuters Foundation. Avian flu situation stable in Togo According to recent reports to the OIE, no new cases of HPAI have been detected in Togo (Togolese Republic). After an absence of around 20 months, the H5N1 HPAI variant was detected at two adjacent farms in the southern Maritime region in early June. Affected were two farms, each with a flock of around 1,000 laying hens. Of these, 752 birds died, and the rest were destroyed. Also located in West Africa, Togo shares an international frontier with Ghana. Losses mount in Nigerian avian flu outbreak series Following a nine-month hiatus, the H5N1 HPAI virus returned to Nigeria in December of 2020. Official notifications from the national animal health agency confirms 89 outbreaks in poultry. Almost 487,000 poultry have been directly impacted by the disease, including more than 78,000 mortalities. According to the latest notification to the OIE, 17 outbreaks across six states were confirmed between February 10 and June 26 this year. Since the first cases at the end of last year, the infection has spread to poultry in 12 of Nigeria’s states.

The Ministry of Food and Agriculture confirmed the outbreak in 3 out of the 16 regions of the country in a statement signed by the Director of Veterinary Services Directorate, Dr. Patrick Abakeh on July 16, 2021. “More than 41, 000 birds have been affected and destroyed so far,” a Risk Communicator at the Veterinary Services Directorate, Dr Benjamin Sasu told GhanaFact on August 5. Meanwhile, cases of the virus have now been confirmed in a fourth region – Ashanti Region, after some farmers alerted authorities to unusual deaths of domestic poultry. A breakdown of cases according to regions affected In the Greater Accra region, 18 farms have been affected with 19,320 birds destroyed. Out of this, 11,491 died naturally while 7,829 were destroyed by the Veterinary Services Directorate for containment of the disease. In the Central region, 3 farms have been affected and 13,657 birds have been affected. 4,100 died naturally and 9,557 were destroyed for containment. In the Volta region, only one farm has been affected so far. However, 2,482 birds have been destroyed. (i.e. 495 died naturally and 1,987 were destroyed for containment.) The Ashanti region has 3 farms affected and recording 5,992 deaths. Out of that 2,728 died naturally while 3,264 have been destroyed for containment. “There has been some improvement but still there is more work to be done and the farmers have to play a key role,” Dr Benjamin Sasu stressed. What is bird flu? Bird flu is a viral infection that can infect not only birds but also humans and other animals. “Humans can be infected with avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian influenza virus subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N9), and A(H9N2) and swine influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2).” The World Health Organization(WHO) has stated. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, but these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. The WHO explains that avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans may cause diseases ranging from; Mild upper respiratory tract infection (fever and cough), early sputum production. Rapid progression to severe pneumonia, sepsis with shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, encephalitis and encephalopathy have also been reported to vary degrees depending on subtype. No human infection in Ghana Meanwhile, the Veterinary Services Directorate has confirmed that all samples taken from people directly working with the affected birds in Ghana didn’t yield a positive result for the virus. According to the health agency, appropriate measures have also been taken to ensure that the affected birds are safely disposed of, so they do not get onto the markets. “We collaborate with other agencies like the Ghana Health Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Municipal Assemblies. Once we get there, they give us a place that we can dig deep and then put all the birds, pour chemicals on them and then cover them.” Dr Benjamin Sasu stated. To ensure public safety, citizens are advised to: Report any unusual death of domestic poultry and wild birds to the nearest veterinary office and public authorities. Avoid the handling of dead birds with bare hands at all cost. Consume only well-cooked poultry meat and poultry products. First Bird Flu outbreak in Ghana Ghana first detected cases of Bird Flu in 2007 when the H5N1 virus was confirmed on a small scale poultry farm near the port city of Tema. Consequently, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture declared the Tema Municipality an Avian Influenza infected area and banned the movement of live birds within and out of the municipality until the virus was contained. The country has since recorded cases of bird flu disease in 2015, 2016 and 2018.

(Photo: Getty Images) Publishing the flu specifications for 2021/2022, NHS England also revealed that practices will be permitted to vaccinate non-registered patients under this year’s enhanced service.The document notes that the flu campaign will run from 1 September 2021 to 31 March 2022, with all practices invited to sign up to the ES before midnight on Monday 16 August.A second service specification allows surgeries to continue to vaccinate children aged 2-3 against flu, while NHS England has also suggested that GPs could be allowed to jab over 18s ‘using vaccines ordered and supplied centrally’.Flu vaccine campaignThe enhanced service document provides an update on the likelihood of COVID booster jabs being administered alongside flu vaccinations, stating that ‘early evidence...supports the delivery of both vaccines at the same time’.NHS England has said that practices working as part of a PCN may choose to work together to deliver flu vaccinations. It adds that a GP practice ‘may require the ability to sub-contract the delivery of the required clinical services to another GP practice in the PCN Grouping or another party.’Where a vaccination is given to a registered patient of the GP practice by a provider other than the GP practice - and the patient’s record is not automatically updated electronically - the GP practice must update the records on the same day the vaccine is administered.Those taking part in the ES will receive a payment of £10.06 for each completed vaccine treatment, with surgeries asked to make monthly payment claims.JCVI recommendationAll frontline health and social care workers are expected to have influenza vaccination to protect those they care for - locum GPs are also specifically mentioned within the eligible cohorts.In an official communication to GP practices, NHS England leaders said: ‘Today, we have published the two enhanced service specifications for the seasonal influenza vaccination programme 2021/22.‘The service specifications for 2021/22 are largely based on the 2020/21 flu service specifications, with the exception that the seasonal influenza vaccination programme specification (covering adults and at-risk groups) will be commissioned as an enhanced service this year to enable greater responsiveness to any subsequent JCVI advice or government policy.‘A further key change to the seasonal influenza vaccination programme 2021/22 enhanced service specification is that for this season, practices will be able to vaccinate various cohorts of patients that are not registered with the practice.’COVID booster jabsThe document says planning for influenza vaccination should ‘continue as usual for this autumn’, but warns the ES could be updated should co-administration of the COVID and flu vaccine be recommended by the JCVI.GPs had previously warned that uncertainty over how the flu campaign would work alongside COVID-19 vaccination - including whether the jabs can be administered at the same time - had left them with a planning nightmare.GPonline understands that most practices decided to sign up to deliver COVID booster jabs, despite the fact that practices will have to deliver these jabs at PCN-level. LMCs have warned that some practices could U-turn on this decision should the terms of the flu ES make work to deliver the two campaigns complicated.
