Researchers have discovered a distant relative of influenza viruses in sturgeon, suggesting that the flu virus may have originated in fish. The finding highlights the importance of studying aquatic creatures in understanding the evolution and spread of influenza and related viruses. This information contributes to the understanding of the genetic origins of influenza and provides insights into how it infects different species. The study also emphasizes the need for continued research on the origins of viruses and their potential to cause pandemics.
