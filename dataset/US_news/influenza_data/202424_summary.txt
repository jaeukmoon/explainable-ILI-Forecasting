Program Purpose: The Influenza and Zoonoses Education Among Youth in Agriculture program aims to educate youth about flu and other diseases shared between animals and humans, deliver disease prevention messages, and strengthen One Health networks.

Background: The program was created in 2011 after multiple outbreaks of flu in people caused by viruses that usually spread in pigs. It was developed in collaboration with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Program Goals and Objectives: The program aims to improve participants' awareness and knowledge of variant and avian flu virus infections and other zoonotic diseases, motivate behavior changes to prevent disease spread, enhance understanding of public and animal health roles in disease prevention, develop relationships among stakeholders for better responses to health issues, increase awareness of careers in public and animal health, and foster collaboration at the state and national levels.

Timeline: The program was initiated in 2011, piloted in partnership with Georgia 4-H in 2012, and expanded to include collaborations with health departments and academic institutions in subsequent years.

Benefits: The program increases awareness and knowledge of zoonotic diseases, promotes behavior changes to prevent disease spread, builds partnerships for effective responses to health issues, and encourages careers in public and animal health.
