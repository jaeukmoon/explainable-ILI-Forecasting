Colorized transmission electron micrograph of influenza A virus particles.NIAID What Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have identified antibodies targeting a hard-to-spot region of the influenza virus, shedding light on the relatively unexplored “dark side” of the neuraminidase (NA) protein head. The antibodies target a region of the NA protein that is common among many influenza viruses, including H3N2 subtype viruses, and could be a new target for countermeasures. The research, led by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine Research Center, part of NIH, was published today in Immunity. Influenza, or flu, sickens millions of people across the globe each year and can lead to severe illness and death. While vaccination against influenza reduces the burden of the disease, updated vaccines are needed each season to provide protection against the many strains and subtypes of the rapidly evolving virus. Vaccines that provide protection against a broad range of influenza viruses could prevent outbreaks of new and reemerging flu viruses without the need for yearly vaccine reformulation or vaccinations. One way to improve influenza vaccines and other countermeasures is to identify new targets on the virus’s surface proteins in “conserved” regions—portions that tend to be relatively unchanged between different strains of the virus. Influenza NA is a surface protein containing a globular head portion and a narrow stalk portion. The underside of the NA head contains a highly conserved region with targets for antibodies—known as epitopes—that make it vulnerable to antibody binding and inhibition of the virus, as well as not being impacted by mutations common in drug-resistant strains. This region is termed the “dark side” due to its partially hidden location and relatively unexplored characteristics. The researchers isolated human antibodies that target the NA dark side from the blood of two people who had recovered from influenza type A subtype H3N2, a major subtype of seasonal flu viruses. In lab tests, the antibodies inhibited propagation of viruses from subtype H2N2, the subtype that caused pandemic influenza in 1957-58, and H3N2 viruses from humans, swine, and birds. The antibodies also protected mice from lethal infection by a subtype H3N2 virus when given to the animals either one day before or two days after infection, showing that the antibody may treat and prevent influenza in this model. The scientists analyzed the structure of two of the antibodies while bound to NA using advanced microscopy techniques known as cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody targeted different, nonoverlapping regions of the dark side, demonstrating that this region has multiple areas that may be useful to explore for countermeasure development. These findings show that the NA dark side has unique, previously untapped epitopes that could be applied to the development of new vaccine and therapeutic strategies. They suggest that antibodies targeting the NA dark side could be useful in combination with antivirals or other types of antibodies for interventions against influenza, as they are effective against influenza viruses with drug-resistant mutations. The researchers also note that NA dark side targets could be included in the next generation of broadly protective vaccines against influenza. Reference Lederhofer, J. et al.

We aimed to assess the association between FluVac and the risk of dementia and Parkinson’s disease (PD) in people aged 60 years or older through a prospective population-based cohort from the UK Biobank. A time-varying Cox regression model adjusted for baseline and repeatedly measured covariates was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the association between influenza vaccination and risk of dementia/PD. We took into account 70,938 participants in the cohort, including 38,328 participants who got vaccinated. During a median follow-up period of 12.2 years, 2087 incident dementia cases occurred, including 281 cases who received FluVac and 1806 cases who were not vaccinated. In addition, 742 incident PD cases occurred, among whom 131 cases received FluVac and 611 PD cases did not receive FluVac. FluVac was associated with reduced dementia risk with an HR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72–0.95) but was not associated with PD incidence (HR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87–1.32) after controlling baseline and repeatedly measured covariates. Further, among all dementia cases, there were 733 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (94 vaccinated cases and 639 non-vaccinated cases), 307 vascular dementia (VD) (34 vaccinated cases and 273 non-vaccinated cases), and 1047 cases with other dementias (OD) (153 vaccinated cases and 894 non-vaccinated cases). The HRs for the associations between FluVac and AD, VD, and OD were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63–1.00), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.39–0.86), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78–1.14) respectively. A dose-response relationship was found in the association between FluVac and dementia but not in the association with PD. A major limitation of the study is the low accuracy in the diagnosis of dementia subtypes, namely AD, VD, and OD. However, Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analyses. In conclusion, influenza vaccination is significantly associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia but not PD in community-dwelling adults in the UK Biobank population.

It is estimated that there are more than 55 million dementia patients and over six million people living with PD worldwide1,2. As populations are growing and aging, prevalence of these diseases is predicted to increase substantially over the next decades2,3,4. However, to date, there are no definitive treatments for dementia and PD that can modify the pathological process of these disorders. An alternative strategy that repositions and repurposes available interventions for other conditions to prevent or treat dementia and PD has attracted accumulating attention in recent years.Previous studies indicated that infections can increase the risk of dementia and PD in older populations5,6, thus, vaccinations may play a promising role in decreasing the risk of these diseases. Influenza vaccination (FluVac) is the key public health intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality of influenza, with the traditional strategy to vaccinate those at high risk of severe complications, such as the elderly, pregnant women, children, and adults with underlying chronic medical conditions7. In recent years, several epidemiological studies found a protective effect of FluVac against dementia in older adults based mainly on retrospective claim data or electronic health records8,9, thus suffering from limitations of real-world data studies, such as unmeasured confounders of lifestyle factors10. However, the population in these studies were only from North America and the West Pacific, thus the results may not be directly extrapolated to other populations. Further, some of current studies were based on prevalent receiver of FluVac, which could induce selection bias11. Moreover, no population-based study has investigated the association between FluVac and the incidence of PD. Given this background, in this study we assessed the associations between FluVac and the incidence of dementia and PD through a prospective cohort of community-dwelling adults based on the UK Biobank (UKB). Annual vaccination against influenza is well established in the UK and much of the influenza vaccine program is delivered through primary care7, of which the data is available in the UKB through external data link12.ResultsBasic characteristicsA total of 70,938 participants were included in the final analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the first year 4443 participants got vaccinated and the cumulative number of participants receiving FluVac increased obviously in the first seven years of follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall, 38,328 participants got vaccinated in the study period and the Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of participants who were vaccinated and those not vaccinated. The mean age was 64.4 (3.1) years and 46.4% (32,884) participants were male. The two groups of participants were significantly different in most of the baseline characteristics except for family history of dementia and PD, smoking status, healthy diet, regular physical activity, and mental health score. Vaccinated participants tended to have higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and were more likely to receive drugs for chronic diseases.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants in the study cohort based on the UK BiobankFull size tableAssociation between FluVac and risk of dementia/PDDuring a median follow-up period of 12.2 years (interquartile range, 11.4–13.0) and 817,936 person-years, 2087 incident dementia cases occurred, including 281 dementia cases in subjects who received FluVac and 1806 dementia cases in subjects who did not receive FluVac. Moreover, 742 incident PD cases occurred, including 131 PD cases in participants who received FluVac and 611 PD cases in participants who did not receive FluVac. FluVac was associated with dementia risk with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.65–0.84) but not PD incidence with an HR of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80–1.20) in the crude analyses controlling no potential confounders (Table 2). After controlling all baseline and repeatedly measured covariates in the time-varying model, FluVac was associated with a 17% reduction in the risk of dementia (HR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) but not associated with the PD incidence (HR = 1.07, 95% CI, 0.87–1.32). Further, among incident dementia cases, there were 733 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (94 in vaccinated cases and 639 in non-vaccinated cases), 307 vascular dementia (VD) (34 in vaccinated cases and 273 in non-vaccinated cases), and 1047 cases with other dementias (OD) (153 in vaccinated cases and 894 in non-vaccinated cases). The HRs for the association between FluVac and AD, VD, and OD were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63–1.00), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.39–0.86), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78–1.14) respectively.Table 2 Association between influenza vaccination and risk of dementia or Parkinson’s disease, HR (95% CI)Full size tableSubgroup analyses and cumulative influenza vaccinationIn the subgroup analyses (Fig. 1), we did not find any significant interactions between FluVac and baseline characteristics in the associations between FluVac and dementia/PD (p for interactions >0.05 for all subgroup analyses). For instance, the HRs were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64–0.97) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.71–1.04) in ApoE ε4 noncarriers and carriers for the risk of dementia (p for interaction 0.7158); in participants with education of A level or above and other education level the HRs were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.73–1.24) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66–0.92) with an insignificant interaction (p 0.2470); and the HRs were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.75–1.33) and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.87–1.57) in participants aged <65 years and ≥65 years respectively for PD risk (p for interaction 0.5302). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship in the association between FluVac and dementia incidence (Fig. 2), the fully adjusted HRs for the average number of influenza vaccinations per year (AvgFluVac) ≤ 0.4, 0.41 ~ 0.6, 0.61 ~ 0.8, and >0.8 were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.95–1.28), 1.07 (95% CI, 0.91–1.26), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.78–1.13), and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71–0.94) respectively (p for trend 0.0139). However, there was no dose-response association between FluVac and PD (p for trend 0.5568). Results of continuous AvgFluVac are presented in Supplementary Fig. 3 which were in line with the results modeling the AvgFluVac as categorical variable and indicated that participants with an AvgFluVac larger than 0.5 had a significantly lower risk of dementia but not PD.Fig. 1: Association between influenza vaccination and risk of dementia or Parkinson’s disease in different subpopulations.*FluVac influenza vaccination; PD Parkinson’s disease; CCI Charlson comorbidity index; P_Inter P value of interaction.

Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.Full size imageSensitivity analysesSensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the primary analyses (Fig. 3). First, in the marginal structural model (MSM) HRs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.73–0.95) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.84–1.27) for dementia and PD risk respectively after adjusting confounding and censoring using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and censoring weighting (IPCW). Second, a total of 6120 deaths (5194 never vaccinated and 926 ever vaccinated) occurred during following-up. However all-cause mortality did not have impacts on the results and the competing risk model got highly consistent estimates, with an HR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72–0.95) for dementia risk and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.87–1.32) for PD risk. Third, alternative washout periods of two years got HRs of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71–0.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.86–1.29) for the risk of dementia and PD. Further analyses with a three-year washout period were also in line with the primary analyses. Fourth, when excluding cases within two, three, and four years of follow-up, the HRs for dementia were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72–0.95), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71–0.94), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69–0.92) respectively and all HRs were not significant for PD risk. Fifth, there were only 16 participants received live-attenuated influenza vaccine and the sensitivity analyses excluding or censoring these participants had little impact on the results. Finally, we found no association between FluVac and hip fracture, with an HR of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.83–1.25).Fig. 3: Results of sensitivity analyses.*FluVac influenza vaccination; PD Parkinson’s disease. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.Full size imageDiscussionIn a prospective cohort based on the UKB our analyses indicated that FluVac was associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia but not PD during a median follow-up of over 12 years. A dose-response relationship was also found in the association between FluVac and dementia but not PD. Various subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the primary analyses and the negative control outcome (NCO) analysis found no association between FluVac and hip fracture, showing the robustness of our results against potential unmeasured confounding.Our results aligned closely with several retrospective cohort studies, all of which reported a negative association between FluVac and dementia with HRs ranging from 0.60–0.8613,14,15,16,17. The discrepancy in the association magnitude might be attributed to heterogeneity in population, methodology, and outcome definition. For instance, the studies conducted by Luo et al.15, Lee et al.16, Liu et al.17, and Wiemken et al.14 defined new receivers of FluVac with only six months of washout period and measured FluVac exposure in the follow-up period. However, they did not explicitly show that FluVac status was modeled as a time-dependent variable, which could correctly divide the follow-up time into non-exposed before receiving FluVac. Consequently, these studies might have a risk of immortal-time bias, which could overestimate the potentially protective effect of FluVac18. Moreover, all of these studies did not consider the latency time of dementia except the one conducted by Wiemken et al.14, which required a minimum follow-up of 90 days and excluded cases that occurred in this period, thus latency time bias and reverse causality could not be ruled out in these studies19. In contrast, we minimized the above bias through a longer washout period, time-vary exposure, and longer latency time, as well as a series of sensitivity analyses against potential bias. Furthermore, the dose-response relationship in the association between FluVac and dementia, which indicated a potential risk reduction with an increasing number of vaccinations, corroborated the findings proposed by Luo et al.15 and Liu et al.17. In addition, similar views were presented by Wiemken et al.14, suggesting that patients with 1, 2, or 3–5 vaccines versus none exhibited similar risks for dementia but patients with 6 or more influenza vaccines had a significantly lower risk for dementia. Despite these studies, our results additionally illustrated that receiving FluVac continuously was also important for the potential protective effects against dementia. However, the absence of associations in most AvgFluVac categories indicated that our results need further repetition in other populations. Moreover, our study identified associations of FluVac with the risk of AD and VD, which were consistent with previous studies by Verreault et al.20, Luo et al.15, and Bukhbinder et al.13.However, studies investigating the association between FluVac and PD incidence were very scarce and our analyses did not reveal a significant association between FluVac and the risk of incident PD. The association between influenza infection and PD is also controversial. A meta-analysis combining data from four small, case-control studies indicated a lack of a significant association between influenza infection and PD21. However, a recent large-scale case-control study with more than 10 thousand PD cases suggested that influenza was associated with diagnoses of PD more than 10 years after infection22. One hypothesis was proposed to explain these contradictory results, that is that the role of influenza on PD risk may be specific to the circulating virus strain6,22. Therefore, studies with more details of FluVac compositions and longer follow-up may provide additional valuable evidence on the association between FluVac and PD risk.Influenza vaccination might have a protective effect on dementia by preventing infections, which in recent studies are illustrated to increase risk of dementia5. However, so far, research on the mechanism of influenza vaccines in affecting dementia risk has been mainly conducted on animals8 and several potential mechanisms directly linking influenza vaccination to dementia have been proposed. The first is non-influenza-specific training of the immune system. Given that human studies have not identified evidence that influenza leads to a risk of dementia8, it suggests that the association between vaccination and dementia might not be entirely explained by influenza prevention, and there might be other multi-effects at play9. Some studies have shown that vaccination might lower the risk of dementia by training the immune system to strengthen immunity against pathogens23, reducing central nervous system inflammation and subsequent off-target effects caused by the progression of dementia. This offers non-specific protection against neurotoxic inflammation and oxidative stress related to infectious diseases, which might significantly reduce cerebral vascular damage. This could perhaps explain the inverse association between VD and vaccination found in studies9,14. Moreover, FluVac might also increase the activity of microglial cells, leading to the clearance of β-amyloid proteins, disrupting the Treg-regulated immune system, and exerting immunomodulatory effects on amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 18,9, thus contribute to some protective effects on AD. In addition to this, other potential mechanisms include non-influenza-specific changes in adaptive immunity mediated by lymphocyte cross-reaction and influenza-specific mechanisms, including mitigating secondary damage from influenza infections and/or epitope similarity between influenza proteins and AD pathology13.Although a series of observational studies, including ours, have indicated an association between influenza vaccination and dementia, the real mechanism by which the influenza vaccine provides potential protection against dementia, with the anti-inflammatory mechanism potentially being one of them, still necessitates further clinical trials and biochemical research to offer conclusive evidence13,16. This is necessary to explain and support the results of epidemiological studies and the implementation of corresponding public health measures.The influenza vaccine, as a potential public health intervention to prevent and reduce the risk of dementia, is relatively inexpensive, low-risk, and easily accessible8,14, and can further reduce societal burdens and caregiving costs17. More importantly, the vaccination coverage for influenza is low among the elderly population prone to dementia9. These facts emphasize the need to increase influenza vaccination among the elderly. This approach might be more effective than most other preventive measures, like public policies on dementia prevention that involve changing the general population’s lifestyles and dietary habits, which are difficult to implement14. Therefore, cost-effectiveness and policy promoting influenza vaccination may consider not only the short-term effects of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza but also some long-term health benefits including reduced risk of dementia.To our knowledge, this study is the first prospective cohort analysis to simultaneously assess the associations between FluVac and the risk of dementia and PD, which are the most common neurodegenerative disorders and share some pathological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction24. We applied a new-user design and evaluated the potential effects of time-varying FluVac exposure with controlling for time-invariant and time-varying confounders, which were rarely considered in previous studies. This design allowed us to accurately measure exposure in fine detail and control for possible selection bias, such as depletion of susceptibles in study based on prevalent users11. However, our study has limitations. Our results should not be interpreted as causal effects on account of the observational nature and more studies in other populations are needed to repeat this study. Since secondary outcomes related to a dementia syndrome (AD, VD, and OD) were identified with low diagnostic accuracy25, the occurrence of such outcomes was susceptible to misclassification bias. Accordingly, a quite high percentage (about 50.2%) of the 2087 cases with incident dementia were diagnosed as cases with OD, namely with a dementia syndrome not due to AD or VD. Given such low accuracy in the diagnosis of disorders associated with dementia, further studies on the association between FluVac and dementia subtypes are needed. In addition, because most of the vaccination records in the primary care data contained no detailed information on the compositions of influenza vaccine, we did not conduct an in-depth analysis of the potential effects of different FluVac compositions which were usually annually updated. Future studies focusing on specific effects of different FluVac compositions, such as valence and viral strain, could provide more valuable insights into the mechanism of the association between FluVac and dementia. Although our analyses adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders, including baseline and repeatedly measured factors, as well as environmental and genetic characteristics, we could not fully rule out residual confounding. The NCO analysis found no association between FluVac and hip fracture, indicating that the observed association was less likely caused by unmeasured confounders. Moreover, most of the lifestyle factors were self-reported, and some cases of dementia and PD were not recorded in the medical records or death registers. However, misclassification errors were likely to have biased the findings to the null and previous studies have established good agreement between dementia and PD case ascertainment and primary care records25,26,27. Besides, our analyses were restricted to UKB participants with primary care data, and the response rate of the UK Biobank survey was only 5.5%. Thus, the current cohort of participants might not be a representative sample of the UK population. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating the findings of the present study to other populations.In conclusion, FluVac was significantly associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia but not PD in the UKB population. The association between FluVac and dementia was dose-dependent and thus stronger in people receiving multiple doses of vaccination. Further studies with more details of vaccine compositions in a higher representative population would provide more insights into the mechanism that underlies the effect of FluVac on dementia risk.MethodsStudy populationThis study used data from the UKB, which recruited more than half a million participants of middle and old age across the United Kingdom in 2006–2010. All participants provided informed consent, completed touch-screen questionnaires and verbal interview, provided biological samples, and underwent physical examination28. The UKB got initial ethical approval from its own Ethics Advisory Committee (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ethics/).We restricted our analyses to a subset of the entire cohort that could be linked to primary care data. This dataset contains variables that are considered the most important for epidemiological research, including coded clinical events, prescriptions, and a range of administrative codes12. Data on vaccination were available from England, Scotland, and Wales and were included in the primary care data. We further excluded individuals aged <60 years at baseline from the analysis as young people rarely develop dementia and PD. Comparisons between participants with and without primary care data are given in Supplementary Table 1. There were no significant differences between these two groups of participants in almost all characteristics except the distribution of assessment center.Exposure of influenza vaccineParticipant’s vaccination status was obtained from the GP events and GP prescription records in the primary care data by using Read v2, Read v3 (Clinical Terms Version 3), dm+d, and British National Formulary (BNF) codes. All of these codes for FluVac are given in the Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3. The composition of influenza vaccines could be annually updated to best match the constantly changing influenza viruses, thus the elderly is recommended to get an annual influenza vaccine. Therefore, influenza vaccination status was defined as a time-varying exposure, which was measured in one-year intervals and before the start of each interval.Outcome definition and follow-upThe primary outcomes were incident all-cause dementia and PD, which were ascertained through an algorithm combining self-reported medical conditions, linked data from hospital admissions, death registries, and primary care data29. Incident cases were identified using Read v2, Read v3, and International Classification of Diseases 9th/10th (ICD-9/10) version codes, which are all given in the Supplementary Table 4. This algorithm has been validated and has a positive predictive value of 82.5% for all-cause dementia and 91% for PD25,26,27. We also defined three secondary outcomes including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and all other dementias (OD) except AD and VD (Supplementary Table 4).We defined the index date as the date participants first attending the assessment center for the baseline survey or one year after the first GP record, whichever occurred later. This would guarantee that the participants had at least one year of GP records before the index date. Follow-up started on one year after the index date until the first occurrence of one of the following events: diagnosis of dementia or PD, death, loss to follow-up, or the last date of hospital admission (30 September 2021 for England and Wales, and 24 September 2021 for Scotland). Thus, participants who had less than one year of follow-up were excluded, including those diagnosed with dementia or PD within one year of the index date. We also excluded participants who received influenza vaccine or had a diagnosis of dementia or PD before the index date (Supplementary Fig. 1) for identifying new receivers of FluVac and incident cases of dementia and PD.CovariatesPotential confounders were categorized as baseline and repeatedly measured covariates. All factors were collected at baseline through self-reported questionnaires, including sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, education qualification, Townsend deprivation index (TDI), average household income, and region of assessment center), general health factors (self-reported health rating, family history of dementia/PD and body mass index [BMI]), mental health (mental health score), lifestyle (smoking and drinking status, diet, tea and coffee intake, physical activity, and social isolation). Further, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype was defined by the SNP rs429358 and rs7412. As ApoE ε4 is a well-recognized genetic risk factor for dementia30, we divided the study population into ApoE ε4 carriers (+/+ or +/−) and noncarriers (−/−).Repeatedly measured factors were measured in a one-year interval lag before every influenza season, including FluVac invitation, comorbidities and medication use (aspirin, glucose-lowering agents, statins, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB], proton-pump inhibitors [PPI], beta blocking agents (BBA), and diuretics).Family history of dementia and PD was ascertained according to the illnesses of father, mother, and siblings. BMI was calculated using weight divided by height squared and was categorized as obesity (≥30.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 ~ 29.9 kg/m2), healthy weight (18.5 ~ 24.9 kg/m2), and underweight (<18.5 kg/m2). Mental health score was measured using 13 data fields related to mood and feeling according to a previous study31. Social isolation was defined based on the number of persons in the household, frequency of friend/family visits, and leisure/social activities and was further divided into least isolated, moderately isolated, or most isolated32. The consumption of at least four of seven commonly eaten food groups following recommendations on dietary priorities for cardiometabolic health was used to define a healthy diet33. Participants were considered to keep regular physical activity if they meet the recommendations of at least 150 min of moderate activity or 75 min of vigorous activity per week33. Comorbidities were measured using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), which included 16 classes of diseases. Commonly used medications and FluVac invitation were ascertained according to GP prescriptions and GP clinical events respectively. More details about the covariates are given in the Supplementary Tables 5 and 6.Statistical analysesWe first reported summary statistics of participants according to whether they received influenza vaccine or not in the study period. Missing values were treated as a separate category and frequency and percentage for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous covariates were calculated. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for comparisons of categorical and continuous factors. We applied a multivariable time-varying Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between incident dementia/PD and FluVac which was modeled as a time-varying variable. The full model was adjusted for all potential baseline and repeatedly measured confounders listed above including sociodemographic characteristics, general health factors, mental health, lifestyle, comorbidities and medication use. Robust sandwich-type variance estimators were applied to calculate confidence intervals and p-values as repeated measures of participants were used in the model.Secondary analysisWe assessed the associations between FluVac and the three secondary outcomes, including AD, VD, and OD. We next examined the association between FluVac and dementia/PD within different subgroups defined according to baseline characteristics for checking potential interactions: sex (female and male), age (60 ~ 64 and ≥65 years), education qualification (A levels or above and others), self-reported health rating (fair/poor and excellent/good), CCI (0 and ≥1), and ApoE4 gene type (ε4 carriers and noncarriers).A dose-response relationship of the association was examined between the incidence of dementia/PD and cumulative FluVac, which was measured as the average number of influenza vaccinations per year (AvgFluVac) since the first vaccine dose. The AvgFluVac took a value in the interval of [0, 1] and a value approximating one indicated continuous vaccination while the value zero represented non-vaccinated status. We did not apply the total number of FluVac as the cumulative exposure because this measure could not differentiate between different patterns of vaccination that resulted in the same cumulative number34. For example, a participant who received five non-consecutive doses of FluVac would have the same total number as a participant who got vaccinated continuously for five years, regardless of how recently vaccination occurred. However, the AvgFluVac would change at different rates based on the vaccination pattern if participants were not vaccinated continuously. Then the AvgFluVac was modeled as a time-varying variate in two ways: categorical (0, ≤0.4, 0.41 ~ 0.6, 0.61 ~ 0.8, and >0.8) and continuous (restricted cubic spline functions with five knots at 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 according to Desquilbet et al.35).Because multiple comparisons in the analyses of subgroups, causal-specific dementia, and secondary analyses may increase the risk of type I error, findings of our secondary analyses should be interpreted as exploratory.Sensitivity analysisSeveral sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results in the primary analysis. First, a marginal structural model (MSM) with time-varying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and censoring weighting (IPCW) was applied to check the potential effects of time-varying confounding that was affected by previous exposure. Stabilized IPTW and IPCW were applied and potential selection bias by all-cause death was controlled using IPCW in the MSM. Second, the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model was fitted to check possible competing risk from all-cause mortality. Third, we used a washout period of two years and three years to define new receivers of FluVac, in which participants were required to have at least two or three years of GP records and be not vaccinated before the index date. Fourth, in the primary analyses, outcome cases that occurred within one year of the index date were excluded, in sensitivity analyses we further excluded dementia/PD cases diagnosed within two, three, and four years after the start of follow-up respectively, to eliminate possible prevalent cases and consequent causal inversion. Fifth, a small number of participants received live-attenuated influenza vaccine, which was mainly indicated for people aged 2 to 16 years and had different mechanisms of action from those of the intramuscular influenza vaccines7. For this, in sensitivity analyses we censored these participants at the time that they received a live-attenuated vaccine or excluded all of them from the final cohort. Sixth, we conducted a negative control outcome (NCO) analysis with hip fracture as the NCO to detect potential unmeasured confounding as no previous study has reported the association between FluVac and hip fracture. Thus, an association between FluVac and NCO would indicate the existence of unmeasured confounders.All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R version 4.2.1. P values were two-sided with statistical significance set at less than 0.05 (Figs. 1–3).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner by Rick A. Bright February 27, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Copy link In defending against a potential influenza pandemic, Vietnam has responded impressively. During the 2005 outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, it rapidly diagnosed and shared data on H5N1 infections and vaccinated and culled poultry to slow the outbreak. Those actions contributed to global efforts to thwart the emergence and spread of dangerous influenza viruses. Vietnam deepened its commitment to countering influenza threats by moving toward producing its own vaccines. Vietnam's success partly lies in the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP), a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative launched in 2006 that boosted Vietnam's capacity to make influenza vaccines locally. The world would be wise to build on such projects as efforts to expand vaccine production in developing countries get under way after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Global Action Plan The WHO created the GAP in response to the rapid, worldwide spread of H5N1 avian influenza. The specter of a potential pandemic revealed a glaring vulnerability: less than 2% of the world's influenza vaccine supply would reach low- and middle-income countries quickly during a crisis. Back then, more than 90% of influenza vaccine production was done in only nine countries, mostly in Europe and North America, that represented only 10% of the global population. That disparity rendered people in countries across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East vulnerable because, in an emergency, countries with local production would likely prioritize their own populations before distributing to others. Recognizing a need to address that collective risk, the WHO announced the GAP, which continued through 2016. Less than 2% of the world's influenza vaccine supply would reach low- and middle-income countries quickly during a crisis The GAP's chief aim was to boost vaccine production capability across the developing world so that more countries could protect populations against threats emerging locally that could spark global crises. The plan also promoted seasonal influenza vaccine programs that drive vaccine demand and support research on new vaccines. To meet the production pillar, the WHO selected 15 countries that were not making pandemic influenza vaccines but could, including Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Romania, Serbia, Thailand, South Africa, and Vietnam. At launch, the GAP had $10 million, but a $98 million commitment from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) drove donors and other countries—particularly those receiving GAP assistance—to commit additional funds. By 2016, such countries had invested an average of $17 for every dollar spent by BARDA. When the GAP ended in 2016, participating countries had the cumulative capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses of pandemic influenza vaccines annually as needed for pandemic response—potentially amounting to 20% of the global emergency supply. When not making pandemic vaccines, those countries produced vaccines against seasonal influenza. The world went from having the capacity to produce 350 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine in 2006 to the ability to make more than 1.47 billion doses in 2016. Pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity increased from approximately 1.46 billion to 6.37 billion doses. Workers arrange vaccines at Sinovac Biotech Co. Ltd.'s headquarters, in Beijing, China, on November 24, 2005. REUTERS/Claro Cortes IV Influenza Vaccines from Scratch Vietnam showcases the potential of vaccine-production initiatives. When the GAP launched in 2006, Vietnam appeared disadvantaged relative to other GAP-supported countries because it had one of the smallest economies and no influenza vaccine production. However, Vietnam's repeated experiences with avian influenza—and delays of nearly a year in securing vaccines from other countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic—highlighted a dire need for self-sufficiency. In addition, expensive imported vaccines were not always effective against the viruses circulating in the region. Vietnam's manufacturing company, the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), took longer to develop and obtain regulatory approval for vaccines than entities in other GAP-supported countries. IVAC's steady efforts culminated in the licensure in 2019 of its first domestically produced human seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza vaccines. One barrier that Vietnam faced was the lack of a reliable source of vaccine-quality chicken eggs. After several years of attempting to import eggs from other countries, the government decided to build a new chicken facility to supply the vaccine factory. That decision eliminated a critical supply chain issue that an influenza outbreak could easily exacerbate. National production reduced vaccine prices by nearly a third of the cost per dose, making influenza vaccination economically viable for a broader demographic. A 2020 report indicated that the willingness to pay for influenza vaccines among Vietnamese women aligns closely with costs. Further, nationally branded vaccines garnered trust. Nationally branded vaccines garnered trust South Korea, a high-income country with a decent biotechnology sector, was, unsurprisingly, the first GAP-supported country to have locally made pandemic influenza vaccines approved. As a result, it quickly developed and produced vaccines to protect the country during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Economic status, however, was not the main predictor of success. For example, Brazil, China, India, and Thailand became seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine producers through the GAP, whereas Romania, a high-income country, continues to rely on imports. Instead, government prioritization, sustained financial support, and the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines mattered most. After all, manufacturers cannot survive without an adequate marketplace for their products. That issue might have contributed to halting South Africa's GAP-supported program at the government-run facility, Biovac. In one study in South Africa, only about a quarter of health-care workers, who are at high risk of severe influenza, opted to take seasonal influenza vaccines. Influenza vaccine production in Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Romania also failed to flourish after the GAP ended. Those countries succeeded in producing authorized, domestic influenza vaccines but continue to import most of what they need because their national facilities cannot make enough doses. Indonesia imports vaccine components and formulates them into final vials. Romania closed its original facility but plans to open a new one in 2025.

REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak Pandemic Preparedness Beyond scaling up influenza vaccine production, the GAP sought to empower countries to develop the scientific foundation needed to curb local outbreaks rapidly. During the GAP's existence, more than 300 manufacturing and regulatory experts trained on advanced biomanufacturing and quality systems at two facilities in the United States. Vaccine production experts from BARDA and PATH helped ensure that such training strengthened the operation of local facilities. Frequent workshops between GAP participants and leading vaccine experts around the world created a global network of colleagues that continues to share knowledge. National regulatory capabilities grew as well. At the outset, only four GAP-supported countries had a functional national regulatory authority qualified by the WHO to evaluate clinical trials, license products, and conduct postmarketing surveillance. At the plan's conclusion, that number had grown to 10, and the remaining countries were on course to accomplish the milestone. By meeting the WHO's regulatory quality standards, countries have the opportunity to distribute their vaccines to other countries. Another aspect of the GAP proved broadly beneficial. Global pandemic influenza vaccine capacity had been limited by a small number of companies holding patents for making ingredients—called adjuvants—that enhance vaccine efficacy and expand vaccine supply by reducing the main ingredients needed in each dose. The GAP helped fund the development of generic adjuvants at the Infectious Disease Research Institute and the University of Lausanne, an effort that led to the creation of the Vaccine Formulation Institute in Switzerland. By supplying the GAP's manufacturers, the institute nearly doubled the overall capacity of pandemic influenza vaccines produced by those companies. Cracking the Egg for COVID-19 Vaccines The foundation laid by the GAP became important during the COVID-19 pandemic when vaccines were again in short supply and many nonproducing countries were at the end of a long line for vaccines. GAP-supported companies in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam leveraged their systems for making egg-based influenza vaccines to produce those against COVID-19. Those facilities could be converted to make COVID-19 vaccines when not making seasonal influenza vaccines. Capacity in these three countries combined could yield hundreds of millions of doses per year. The GAP-supported Serum Institute in India played an outsized role in COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution nationally and globally. Capacity in these three countries combined could yield hundreds of millions of doses per year In addition, companies from the GAP network are collaborating with scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the University of Texas at Austin to develop and evaluate a COVID-19 vaccine by using a modified Newcastle disease virus that grows in chicken eggs and produces the spike protein for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Partnerships with PATH developed under the GAP program are also accelerating the production of a COVID-19 pandemic vaccine. Local Solutions for Global Outbreaks The GAP demonstrated the feasibility of expanding global vaccine production and empowering countries to respond to outbreaks. The plan helped unlock the immense latent value of local vaccine infrastructure when international supply chains fracture amid a public health crisis. A more recent initiative launched in 2021, the WHO's mRNA technology transfer hub, seeks to replicate the GAP's success. Again, the WHO has selected 15 countries that would benefit from local vaccine production. The initiative focuses on a promising platform—mRNA—rather than a specific disease. Nonetheless, like the GAP nearly 20 years ago, the hub seeks to assist nations' quests for sustained agency, rather than persistent dependency, in the face of biological threats.

"We're right in the range that we typically see when the vaccine is a good match with the viruses that are circulating. Good VE, and it's working consistent with past years," said Sascha Ellington, head of the CDC's influenza prevention and control team. The exact strains selected to be targeted by flu vaccines are tweaked each year based on what health authorities project will be the best match to the circulating viruses each season. In recent years, vaccines have been designed to target four different subtypes of flu: two from the influenza A group of viruses and two from influenza B.The estimates are from four ongoing studies backed by the agency which put together actively test patients and draw on records from immunization registries, clinics, urgent care services, emergency rooms, hospitals and health insurance claims around the U.S. Estimates show vaccines this season were between 52% and 61% effective in protecting children against influenza hospitalization. In adults, the shots were estimated to be 41% to 44% effective.While effectiveness looks good for this season, Ellington warned that declining vaccination rates means the U.S. could still see fewer hospitalizations and deaths prevented by vaccines this season."To prevent flu hospitalizations and deaths on the population level, we need both good vaccine effectiveness and we need people to get vaccinated," she said. Ellington said the agency continues to recommend that people get a flu vaccine if they have not yet this season. The CDC says significant flu activity can last until May. Some regions of the country have reported renewed increases in flu activity for recent weeks, after a slowdown from a peak during the winter holidays.High effectiveness for influenza BEffectiveness looked especially high so far this season for influenza B infections, Ellington said.This season marked the first since before 2020 with significant amounts of influenza B cases, after the COVID-19 pandemic upended the usual spread of the virus. Based on data from outpatient settings, like urgent care clinics and emergency rooms, the vaccines were 78% effective in adults and at least 64% in kids for cutting the risk of a visit from influenza B."We really have to go back a number of years to look at influenza B effectiveness. And when you go back for those older years, you do see it ranging usually in the 40 to 60 percent range," said Ellington.Usual effectiveness for influenza AEffectiveness estimates for influenza A, which typically makes up the lion's share of cases, looked similar to previous years overall: from 46% to 59% in kids and 27% to 46% in adults for outpatient settings.Overall, a majority of tests reported so far this season from public health labs have been from a subtype of influenza A known as A(H1N1)pdm09, the descendant of the swine flu virus that drove a flu pandemic in 2009. That is different from last year, when the influenza A(H3N2) virus dominated cases. Ellington said that experts sometimes see vaccine effectiveness trend higher during seasons dominated by H1N1. But she cautioned that other factors, like changes to the virus and what strains were selected to be in the season's shots, muddy the picture."I think the general consensus is that they would expect perhaps a little higher VE when it's an H1N1 season, but that doesn't always come to fruition," she said.Major change to the influenza vaccines comingThe new estimates come as the Food and Drug Administration is set to vote on the recipe used for next season's influenza vaccines, at a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.A major change could be in store. FDA and World Health Organization panels have called on flu manufacturers to strip out an obsolete component of the vaccines targeted at the influenza B Yamagata subtype, which disappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic.That could effectively open up one of the seats in the vaccines, dropping them next season from quadrivalent formulations – targeting four different antigens in a single shot – to trivalent."As a result, it is likely that in the United States, all influenza vaccines in the 2024–2025 season will be trivalent," wrote committee member Dr. Arnold Monto Wednesday, in an article published by the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by officials from the FDA and the U.K. Health Security Agency.Removing influenza B Yamagata could make room for new components in the flu vaccine recipe that might boost effectiveness, though these additions could be years away. "Replacing the B/Yamagata component with another component or formulation will require further stepwise planning and is more of a long-term goal for improving vaccine effectiveness," they wrote.

Scientists from the University at Buffalo (UB) and McGill University have developed a new recombinant flu vaccine which shows promising results and could compete with existing vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines, such as the Novavax vaccine used for COVID-19, provide several advantages over conventional vaccines. They are safer and possibly more effective, easier to precisely produce, and require smaller doses. However, to date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only one such vaccine. Dr Jonathan Lovell, senior co-author of the study and SUNY Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at UB explained: “Because of the variable nature of the viruses that cause influenza, current vaccines are not optimally effective among the overall population. We believe our vaccine candidate has the potential to improve upon this by inducing stronger and broader immunity and reducing the likelihood of illness and death.” Conventional flu vaccines are based on weakened forms of the disease or contain deactivated microbes that cause influenza. Typically, they are made using fertilised chicken eggs or, less commonly, through cell culture-based production. However, the UB-led vaccine is based on a nanoliposome created by the team, named cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP). The CoPoP platform enables immune response by promoting proteins to be displayed on the surface of the nanoliposome, resulting in potent vaccine efficacy. Combining the nanoliposomes with recombinant influenza proteins, that can be generated based on genetic information from viruses, enhance the immune system’s response to disease. The researchers attached a total of six proteins to the nanoliposome: three each from two different protein groups, hemagglutinins and neuraminidases. Also, they added two adjuvants, PHAD and QS21, to boost immune response, and then evaluated the resulting “hexaplex” nanoliposome in animal models with three common flu strains: H1N1, H3N2 and type B. The hexaplex nanoliposome provided superior protection and survival from H1 and N1 even when administered in low doses, when compared to Flublok, the sole licensed recombinant influenza vaccine in the US, and Fluaid, an egg-based vaccine. Tests, which were conducted via vaccination and through blood serum transfer from vaccinated mice into non-vaccinated mice, demonstrated comparable levels of protection against H3N2 and type B viruses. Lead author Zachary Sia, a PhD candidate in Lovell’s lab, commented: “The combination of the two groups of proteins led to synergistic effects. In particular, the adjuvanted nanoliposomes excelled in the production of functional antibodies and the activation of T cells, which are critical to fighting off serious infection of the flu.” Dr Bruce Davidson, co-author of the study and research associate professor of anaesthesiology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB, added: “using not only hemagglutinin but also neuraminidase antigens to create vaccines is important because it translates into broader immunity and companies will be able to create more doses with less materials. That’s critical for not only the flu but also potential outbreaks like what we saw with COVID-19. There is still much work to be done in fully testing and validating this flu technology, but at this point these early results are quite promising.” This study was published in Cell Reports Medicine.

The study is published in the British Medical Journal. Study: Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children: population based cohort study. Image Credit: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock Background Recent guidelines by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise administering influenza vaccination among children and older adults in September or October to maximize its protective efficacy against seasonal influenza virus infection. Administering the vaccine too early, i.e., in the summer months, may lead to the waning of vaccine efficacy during the upcoming influenza season (September to May). Similarly, delaying vaccination may result in exposure to the circulating influenza virus without gaining vaccine-induced immunity. The timing of influenza vaccination is particularly vital for young children who are at higher risk of severe infections and related hospitalization. Young children primarily receive vaccines during protective care visits, which are often purposefully scheduled around their birthdays. Thus, a child's birthday is likely to impact the timing of influenza vaccination. In this study, scientists have analyzed the rate of influenza diagnosis among vaccinated children to determine optimal vaccination timing. Study design The study population included commercially insured children aged 2 – 5 years who received influenza vaccination between 2011 and 2018. Only children with birthdays between August 1 and January 31 were included because these children are expected to have their birthday influence on the timing of influenza vaccination.

Confounding factors that were considered in the analysis included age, sex, healthcare use, and medical comorbidities of the child, number of beneficiaries on the same policy, and medical comorbidities and healthcare use of family members. Data were analyzed to determine the optimal timing of influenza vaccination and its impact on the rate of influenza diagnosis among vaccinated young children. Important observations A total of 819,223 children who received influenza vaccination between August and January of a given influenza season were included in the analysis. A similar pattern of vaccination timing and a differential pattern of influenza diagnosis timing was observed in the study. The analysis of medical data revealed that the majority of children received influenza vaccination in October. The lowest possibility of influenza diagnosis was observed among children who received vaccination in November or December, as compared to those vaccinated in other months. As mentioned by the scientists, the timing of vaccination may be influenced by many confounding factors. Thus, they could not derive a causal relationship between vaccination timing and influenza diagnosis. Instead, they assessed relationships between birth month, the timing of preventive care visits and vaccination, and the risk of influenza infection. Birth month and vaccination timing About 90% of enrolled children who received vaccination during August-January had a preventive care visit during that period. Among children aged 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years, about 56%, 59%, 51%, and 41% had a visit in the two weeks around their birth months, respectively. The majority of these children received vaccination on the day of the preventive care visit. In contrast, a lower probability of receiving the vaccine on the preventive care visit day was observed for children born in December or January. One possible reason could be that many of these children may have received the vaccine earlier in the fall. A variation in vaccination timing was observed across birth months. The average duration between birth month and vaccination timing was 10 weeks for August-born children, 12 weeks for October-born children, and 14 weeks for December-born children. Children born in October showed a significantly higher probability of being vaccinated in the same month compared to children born in other months. Birth month and influenza diagnosis The lowest rate of influenza diagnosis was observed for children born in October. Specifically, the average infection diagnosis rate across influenza seasons was 3% for August-born children, 2.7% for October-born children, and 2.9% for December-born children. Study significance The study finds that October-born children are most likely to be vaccinated against the influenza virus in the month of October and are least likely to be diagnosed with influenza infection in the following flu season. These findings support the CDC recommendations that promote October vaccination to prevent influenza outbreaks. Journal reference: Worsham CM. 2024.

This brings a unified, practical approach to addressing risk from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses, such as influenza and RSV, that have similar routes of transmission and symptoms and similar prevention strategies. Executive Summary The 2023-2024 fall and winter virus season, four years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, provided ongoing evidence of the changing face of respiratory diseases. COVID-19 remains an important public health threat, but it is no longer the emergency that it once was, and its health impacts increasingly resemble those of other respiratory viral illnesses, including influenza and RSV. This reality enables CDC to provide updated guidance proportionate to the current level of risk COVID-19 poses while balancing other critical health and societal needs. Key drivers and indicators of the reduction in threat from COVID-19 Fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths Due to the effectiveness of protective tools and high degree of population immunity, there are now fewer hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. Weekly hospital admissions for COVID-19 have decreased by more than 75% and deaths by more than 90% compared to January 2022, the peak of the initial Omicron wave. Complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are now also less common, and prevalence of Long COVID also appears to be decreasing. These reductions in disease severity and death have persisted through a full respiratory virus season following the expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 and its associated special measures on May 11, 2023. Availability of protective tools Protective tools, like vaccines and treatments, that decrease risk of COVID-19 disease (particularly severe disease) are now widely available. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of symptomatic disease and hospitalization by about 50% compared to people not up to date on vaccination. Over 95% of adults hospitalized in 2023-2024 due to COVID-19 had no record of receiving the latest vaccine. Treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) in persons at high risk of severe disease has been shown to decrease risk of hospitalization by 75% and death by 60% in recent studies. High population immunity There's a high degree of population immunity against COVID-19. More than 98% of the U.S. population now has some degree of protective immunity against COVID-19 from vaccination, prior infection, or both. Monitoring and investments continue The updated guidance on steps to prevent spread when you are sick particularly reflects the key reality that many people with respiratory virus symptoms do not know the specific virus they are infected with. Importantly, states and countries that have already shortened recommended isolation times have not seen increased hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19. Although increasingly similar to other respiratory viruses, some differences remain, such as the risk of post-COVID conditions. CDC will continue to evaluate available evidence to ensure the recommendations in the guidance provide the intended protection. This includes monitoring data to identify and model patterns in respiratory virus transmission, severity, hospitalizations, deaths, virus evolution, and Long COVID. In addition, CDC continues to make systems-level investments to protect the American public. Examples include Measuring and enhancing effectiveness and uptake of vaccines and antiviral treatments, particularly for those at increased risk for severe disease Integrating healthcare and public health systems to prevent, identify, and respond to emerging public health threats more rapidly Strengthening partnerships across sectors to ensure a strong public health infrastructure Situations Where Respiratory Virus Guidance Doesn't Apply‎ The Respiratory Virus Guidance covers most common respiratory viral illnesses. It shouldn't supplant specific guidance for pathogens that require special containment measures, such as measles. However, the recommendations may still help reduce spread of various other types of infections. The guidance may not apply in certain outbreak situations when more specific guidance may be needed.CDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (COVID-19, flu, and general infection prevention and control). Transitioning from an emergency state Since 2020, CDC provided guidance specific to COVID-19, initially with detailed recommendations on many issues and for specific settings. Throughout 2022 and 2023, CDC revised COVID-19 public health recommendations as the pandemic evolved. These changes to the guidance reflected the latest scientific evidence as well as the progression through the pandemic. The expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 in 2023 also reflected a shift away from the emergency response phase to the recovery and maintenance phases in which COVID-19 is addressed amidst many other public health threats. Measures appropriate to an emergency setting are less relevant after the emergency ended. The continuum of pandemic phases View LargerDownload There is a continuum of pandemic phases. Changing Risk Environment In developing this updated Respiratory Virus Guidance, CDC carefully considered the changing risk environment, particularly lower rates of severe disease from COVID-19 and increased population immunity, as well as improvements in other prevention and control strategies. Trends in outcomes Hospitalizations In 2024, COVID-19 is less likely to result in severe disease than earlier in the pandemic because of greater immunity from vaccines and previous infections and greater treatment availability. COVID-19 remains a greater cause of severe illness and death than other respiratory viruses, but the differences between these rates are much smaller than they were earlier in the pandemic. This difference is even smaller among people admitted to the hospital. Studies show the proportion of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (15.5%) or influenza (13.3%) who were subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was similar, and patients 60 years and older hospitalized with RSV were 1.5 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU than those with COVID-19. Hospital admissions for COVID-19 peaked in January 2022 with more than 150,000 admissions per week, based on data from CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) covering all U.S. hospitals. During the week ending February 17, 2023, there were 18,977 hospital admissions for COVID-19. During this same week, there were 10,480 hospital admissions for influenza. Another data source—called Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) — collects hospitalization data on 8–10% of the U.S. population since before pandemic. The RESP-NET figures below demonstrate how COVID-19 hospitalizations have decreased over time and are now in the range of those for influenza and RSV.A View LargerDownload COVID-19 hospitalizations have declined year-over-year since 2022, with winter peaks more closely resembling those of influenza. Download Cumulative annual rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (Oct. 1–Sept. 30 to align with start of typical fall and winter virus season) have declined since 2021–2022. Hospitalizations by age group Over time, rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 have decreased across all ages but have remained higher among adults ages ≥65 years relative to younger adults, children, and adolescents. Among older children, rates have decreased, and rates among children are now highest among infants ages <6 months. As of the end of December 2023, about 70% of hospitalizations were among people ages ≥65 years, and 14% were among those ages 50–64 years. Download An increasing proportion of COVID-19 hospitalizations are in older adults, as well as the youngest children. The proportion of hospitalizations caused by each of these viruses in the 2022–2023 season varied by age group. Among children <5 years RSV caused the most hospitalizations. Among children and adolescents 5–17 years, influenza caused the most hospitalizations, and hospitalizations overall were the lowest in this age group. Among adults, COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were higher than those for influenza or RSV. These patterns have been broadly consistent thus far in the 2023-2024 season. View LargerDownload RSV caused the most hospitalizations among children <5 years. View LargerDownload Influenza caused the most hospitalizations among children 5 through 17 years old. View LargerDownload COVID-19 caused the most hospitalizations among adults 18 through 49 years old. View LargerDownload COVID-19 caused the most hospitalizations among adults 50 through 65 years old. Download COVID-19 caused the most hospitalizations among adults 65 years or older. Deaths As of February 10, 2024, 1,178,527 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the United States. In 2021 COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death (12% of all deaths) and in 2022 it was the fourth leading cause of death (5.7% of all deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injury. In preliminary data from 2023, COVID-19 was the 10th leading cause of death. Among deaths from COVID-19 occurring from January–September 2023, 88% were among people ≥65 years. COVID-19 is increasingly a contributing rather than the primary (underlying) cause of death. In 2020, COVID-19 was listed as the primary cause for 91% of deaths involving COVID-19. During January–September 2023, that number had fallen to 69%. Reported deaths involving COVID-19 are several-fold greater than those reported to involve influenza and RSV. However, influenza and likely RSV are often underreported as causes of death. CDC estimates that from October 1, 2023, to February 17, 2024, 17,000–50,000 influenza deaths occurred, several times greater than the number of reported deaths. As such, the data on reported deaths should be interpreted with caution when assessing the true burden of deaths and comparing across diseases. Current estimates of total COVID-19 deaths are not available, but COVID-19 deaths are not likely to be as underreported as are deaths involving influenza because of widespread COVID-19 testing and intensive focus on COVID-19 during the pandemic. Total COVID-19 deaths, accounting for underreporting, are likely to be higher than, but of the same order of magnitude as, total influenza deaths. Supporting this idea, the cumulative rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations during October 1, 2023–February 3, 2024, was 97 per 100,000 population, compared with 52 per 100,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 44 per 100,000 RSV hospitalizations. In-hospital death was about 1.8 times higher for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (4.6%) vs. those for influenza (2.6%). COVID-19-associated deaths based on reports on death certificates declined over 5-fold since their peak in 2020-2021 and are now at the same order of magnitude as estimated influenza deaths. Year corresponding with start of influenza season (Oct. 1- Sept. 30) Reported COVID-19 deaths* Reported influenza deaths Estimated influenza deaths** Reported RSV deaths 2018-2019 0 7,181 19,000–96,000 243 2019-2020 208,601 9,432 17,000–85,000 345 2020-2021 517,783 876 Not estimated 85 2021-2022 331,885 2,856 4,000–24,000 396 2022-2023 89,573 9,559 18,000–97,000 736 2023-2024 (through Feb. 17) 32,949 to date 5,854 to date 17,000–50,000 to date 587 to date *Reported death data from CDC’s National Vital Statistics System based on death certificates, available at CDC WONDER. Data from 2022-2024 are provisional and subject to change. ****Estimated influenza deaths, accounting for underreporting, based CDC modeling available here: Disease Burden of Flu, including confidence intervals. It has been long recognized that only counting deaths where influenza was recorded on death certificates would underestimate influenza’s overall impact on mortality. Influenza can lead to death from other causes, such as pneumonia and congestive heart failure; however, it may not be listed on the death certificate as a contributing cause for multiple reasons, including a lack of testing. Therefore, CDC has an established history of using models to estimate influenza-associated death totals. While under-reporting of deaths attributed to RSV and COVID-19 likely also occurs, regularly updated model estimates are currently not available. Modeled burden estimates for influenza are not directly comparable to death certificate derived counts for COVID-19 and RSV. Divergence between infection and severe disease Although hospitalizations and deaths involving COVID-19 have declined substantially since 2022, rates of infections with the virus have not. For example, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 tests that are positive, a key indicator of community spread, reached peak levels of 14.6% in August 2023 and 12.9% in January 2024, similar to the peak levels observed in earlier years. Differences in testing practices between time periods might influence these data, but these high levels of test positivity are consistent with high levels also seen in wastewater. View LargerDownload SARS-CoV-2 test positivity (orange line) has remained elevated, a marker of ongoing COVID-19 spread, but deaths (blue bars) have declined substantially. View LargerDownload Wastewater viral activity levels of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate ongoing community transmission. MIS-C MIS-C is a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different parts of the body become inflamed. As of January 2024, more than 9,600 cases of MIS-C have been reported to CDC, including 79 children who died. Before March 2022, the end of the initial Omicron wave, most weekly totals of MIS-C cases exceeded 50, with some weeks involving >150 cases. The number of cases declined substantially after that point, with no week exceeding 25 cases. The reduction in MIS-C cases is likely due to multiple factors, including an increase in population immunity from both infection and vaccination, as well as differences in development of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants. View LargerDownload Weekly U.S. MIS-C cases (blue bars) have declined markedly despite ongoing high levels of COVID-19 test positivity (orange line). Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions CDC broadly defines Long COVID as signs, symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop ≥4 weeks after COVID-19. It can include a wide range of health conditions that can last weeks, months, or years. Although COVID-19 is becoming more similar to influenza and RSV in terms of hospitalizations and death over time, important differences remain, like the potential for these post-infection conditions. Long COVID occurs more often in people who had severe COVID-19 illness but can occur in anyone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, including children and people who were asymptomatic. Estimates of Long COVID vary widely and can differ based on study methods and how long after infection symptoms were assessed. Based on the nationally representative 2022 National Health Interview Survey, 3.4% of adults reported Long COVID and 0.5% of children. In Census Bureau's Household Pulse Surveys, one quarter of people currently reporting Long COVID reported significant activity limitations. Accumulating evidence suggests that vaccination prior to infection can reduce the risk of Long COVID. There is mixed evidence on whether the use of antivirals, including nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), during the time of acute infection can reduce the risk of Long COVID. Decreases in Long COVID prevalence have been reported in several countries including the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, likely due to less severe illness from COVID-19 overall, protection from vaccines, and possible changes in risk with new variants. Increase in population immunity against COVID-19 Now, more than ever before, most people have some degree of protection because of underlying immunity. Data from a national longitudinal cohort of blood donors aged ≥16 years provide insight on the proportion of the population with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from infection, vaccination, or both (referred to as hybrid immunity). Hybrid immunity has been described as providing better protection with longer durability against severe illness compared to immunity from vaccination or infection alone. In January 2021, only an estimated 22% of people aged ≥16 years had antibodies against COVID-19. By the third quarter of 2023 (July–September), 98% had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 14% from vaccination alone, 26% from infection alone, and 58% from both. An estimated 96% of children aged 6 months to 17 years had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in November–December 2022, including 92% with antibodies from a prior infection, according to blood samples from commercial laboratories. Although immunity against SARS-CoV-2 tends to decline from high levels initially generated by vaccination and infection, substantial protection persists for much longer, especially against the most severe outcomes like requiring a ventilator and death. New data show that the 2023–2024 updated COVID-19 vaccine can provide an additional layer of protection against severe disease. View LargerDownload Since January 2021, there has been an increasing trend in the prevalence of vaccine-induced and infection-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among a cohort of U.S. blood donors ≥16 years. Immunizations As of February 3, 2024, 22% of adults reported they had received an updated 2023-2024 vaccine, including 42% of people aged ≥65 years. Vaccine uptake varies geographically and by other demographics. As of February 11, 2024, 40% of nursing home residents were up to date with a COVID-19 vaccine. Reductions in COVID-19-associated hospitalizations over time could be even greater if more people, especially those at greater risk, receive updated COVID-19 vaccines. Among adults with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations during October–November 2023, over 95% had not received an updated (2023–2024) COVID-19 vaccine, and most (70%) had also not received an updated vaccine from the previous year (2022–2023).B View LargerDownload Over 95% of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during October–November 2023 had not received an updated (2023–2024) COVID-19 vaccine (preliminary data). Vaccine effectiveness data provide the best real-world information on impact of COVID-19 vaccines on hospitalization. Data shown below from two studies presented at the Feb. 28–29, 2024, meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices demonstrate that the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine is associated with an additional ~50% increase in protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization. View LargerDownload Vaccine effectiveness of 2023-2024 vaccine against hospitalization among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years varied. Data from another study suggest that these vaccines provide similar protection against disease caused by different co-circulating variants. Vaccines continue to provide protection to both people who have had a prior infection and those who have not. To be optimally protected against COVID-19, everyone 6 months and older should receive the latest CDC-recommended vaccine. Infants <6 months are not eligible for COVID-19 vaccines but vaccination during pregnancy helps protect both pregnant people and their young infants from hospitalization due to COVID-19. For people with immunocompromising conditions, vaccine responses can be impaired, but vaccines provide protection against severe illness in this population. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised are recommended to receive at least 1 dose of updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Immunizations are the cornerstone of protection not just for COVID-19 but also for influenza. New in the 2023-2024 season, immunizations are available to protect those at highest risk from RSV, including older adults and infants. Vaccines substantially reduce the risk of hospitalization, and many people at higher risk of severe disease are missing this layer of protection.

More detail, including confidence intervals around these point estimates, is available on CDC’s Respiratory Virus Data Channel. Data on percentage of older adults vaccinated for COVID-19 and influenza are for those 65+ years and for those 60+ years for RSV. ***RSV vaccination is recommended for older adults aged 60+ years based on shared clinical decision-making with a healthcare provider. RSV protection for young children is available through vaccination of pregnant people or use of an immunization called nirsevimab for young children. As of January 2024, an estimated 16% of pregnant people 32+ weeks gestation reported receiving RSV vaccine, and among females with an infant <8 months, 41% reported their infant received nirsevimab. SARS-CoV-2 evolution, variants, and vaccines RNA viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, accumulate random mutations over time as they replicate. Out of the many mutations that happen, a small number can provide advantages that lead to new variant lineages with increased fitness (e.g., infect people more easily or be more transmissible). Early in the pandemic, circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes were relatively stable. Because the virus was so new, our immune systems did not recognize it, and the virus did not need new mutations to escape existing immunity to continue spreading. As population immunity increased and more people developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, this immune pressure selected for mutations that helped the virus escape from neutralizing antibodies, generating new variants. This evolving situation led to viruses that had many changes in the virus spike protein, such as early Omicron variants (e.g., BA.1, BA.2). These ongoing changes in the spike protein, called antigenic drift, from early virus lineages like the Alpha variant to the first Omicron variants resulted in significant escape from neutralizing antibodies, allowing reinfections of people who had been infected by early variants and leading to reduced vaccine effectiveness. Currently, all SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating are descendants of the early Omicron variants. Changes in the spike protein that enable escape from neutralizing antibodies are the major driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, since they allow the virus to better escape people's existing immunity. To better target the changing virus and increase protection against new variants, the COVID-19 vaccine is periodically updated. For example, the updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2023–2024 includes uses XBB.1.5 antigen, a variant that was dominant for much of 2023. View LargerDownload A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been causing infections over time, most recently dominated by JN.1, representing increased transmission or immune escape by successive variants. In 2023, a variant called BA.2.86 emerged with many changes in the spike protein compared to other circulating variants, raising concerns that it might lead to a similar degree of immune escape as the initial Omicron variant. This variant, in the form of its offspring JN.1—just one mutation different from BA.2.86, displaced the other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, demonstrating it had higher fitness than other variants. However, vaccines continued to work well against JN.1, and the number of U.S. COVID-19-associated hospitalizations occurring at this time did not exceed that of the previous year. These findings suggest that hybrid immunity induced by the updated vaccines, provided robust cross-protection against this variant and likely a wide range of variants, although continued vigilance is critical. SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve, and new variants will continue to replace previous viruses. Therefore, genomic surveillance is used to identify and track variants, and representative viruses are phenotypically characterized as part of coordinated global efforts to develop updated vaccines as needed. CDC along with partners (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and World Health Organization) continue to conduct genetic surveillance to monitor for new variants, perform epidemiologic and laboratory studies to understand immune escape, and monitor key indicators like hospitalizations and emergency department visits to help inform prevention strategies. This is a continuous and iterative process that will help prepare for the upcoming 2024–2025 fall and winter season. SARS-CoV-2 shedding and transmission dynamics Even as the SARS-CoV-2 virus has continued to evolve, the duration of shedding infectious virus has remained relatively consistent, with most individuals no longer infectious after 8-10 days. The presence of certain COVID-19 symptoms, most prominently fever, is associated with greater infectious virus on the day of symptom. The highest levels of culturable virus typically occur within a few days before and after symptom onset. Since Omicron BA.1 variant, there is a slightly shorter time between infection to symptom onset than previous variants. Overall, these data suggest most SARS-CoV-2 transmission, regardless of variant, largely occurs early in the course of illness. Notably, over half of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is estimated to come from people who are asymptomatic at the time, including both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, meaning exposure to the virus in the community from people who do not know they are infected is likely common. View LargerDownload Highest levels of culture-positive SARS-CoV-2, an indicator of infectiousness, occur in the days around and after symptom onset, with a small proportion of people continuing to have culturable virus beyond one week. In the Delta variant era, vaccination was associated with reduced infectious virus, demonstrating the potential impact of immunity on viral shedding and transmission. Immunity from vaccination, as well as previous infections, wanes over time, which likely attenuates this impact. Additionally, the continued evolution of variants better able to escape existing immunity may also affect the impact of vaccination and previous infection on shedding of infectious virus. Improvements to other prevention and control strategies In addition to greater population understanding of effective prevention strategies like hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, cleaning, masks, and physical distancing, advancements in awareness, accessibility, and the science base related to treatment, air quality, tests, and steps to prevent spread when you're sick have also enabled people to act to lower the risk from respiratory viruses. Treatment Several medications are available for outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 for people at increased risk of severe illness. Data for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), the first-line drug available for oral use, suggest that it reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by half or more. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined nirmatrelvir-ritonavir effectiveness and efficacy found that people who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had 75% lower odds of death and 60% lower odds of hospitalization. People who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir had 83% lower odds of hospitalization and death as a composite outcome compared with people who did not use nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. However, uptake of these treatments remains suboptimal, meaning many people are missing this layer of protection against hospitalization and death. A study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration reported that among all persons with SARS CoV-2 infection, 24% used outpatient antiviral medications in 2022, remaining at that level through early 2023. Similar overall rates of use, with a maximum of 34%, were found using observational data of a large cohort from health care systems participating in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). This study also highlighted racial and ethnic differences in treatment uptake. During April–July 2022, treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among adults aged ≥20 years was 35.8%, 24.9%, 23.1%, and 19.4% lower among Black, multiple or other race, American Indian or Alaska native or other Pacific Islander, and Asian patients, respectively, than among white patients (31.9% treated). A CDC study found that among 699,848 U.S. adults aged ≥18 years eligible for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir during April–August 2022, 28.4% received a prescription with 5 days of being diagnosed with COVID-19. CDC and NIH continue to monitor real-world effectiveness data for COVID-19 treatment. Current evidence suggests that effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is retained among persons who have been vaccinated and confers incremental benefit among persons at high risk for severe disease, although this is an underutilized treatment. Air quality Ventilation and related strategies to improve indoor air quality can reduce infective viral particle concentrations in indoor air. In 2023, informed by accumulating evidence, CDC issued recommendations for using Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) 13 or greater and getting at least 5 air changes per hour of clean air in occupied spaces through air flow, filtration, or air treatment. CDC also now provides a similar tool for building owners and operators. In addition, the U.S. Government issued a Clean Air in Buildings Challenge to help building owners and operators improve indoor air quality and protect public health. Tests Laboratory tests are currently widely available and can be readily accessed for diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. At-home antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are also widely available and increasingly familiar to the public. At-home rapid tests for influenza have recently received FDA approval and may become more widely accessible over time. Staying home when sick and other steps to prevent spread The importance of staying home and away from others when sick became more widely understood during the COVID-19 pandemic. When individuals have the option to stay home and be compensated while sick, they are much more likely to do so. Similarly, people with prior telework experience are more apt to work from home when they have respiratory symptoms, rather than work in person at an office. Unified, practical guidance Unlike early in the pandemic when COVID-19 was nearly the only respiratory virus causing illness, it is now one of many, including influenza, RSV, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and other common human coronaviruses. CDC is focusing guidance on the core measures that provide the most protection across respiratory viruses. The updated guidance emphasizes the importance of staying home and away from others when sick from respiratory viruses, regardless of the virus, as well as additional preventive actions. Virus not known in most respiratory infections Viruses cause most acute respiratory illnesses, but it is rarely possible to determine the type of virus without testing, and oftentimes testing does not change clinical management. Testing for most respiratory pathogens is rarely available outside of healthcare settings. Although at-home antigen testing is widely available for COVID-19, most infections likely go undiagnosed. In a recent CDC survey, less than half of people said they would do an at-home test for COVID-19 if they had cold or cough symptoms, and less than 10% said they would get tested at a pharmacy or by a healthcare provider. Even when testing occurs, COVID-19 is often not identified early in illness. The overall sensitivity of COVID-19 antigen tests is relatively low and even lower in individuals with only mild symptoms. Significant numbers of false negative test results occur early in an infection. This means mildly symptomatic cases are not always detected, and when they are detected, it often occurs several days into an illness, which is typically past when peak infectiousness occurs. Public interest in prevention is not limited to COVID-19 A November 2023 survey from the Harvard Opinion Research Program found people were not meaningfully more concerned about any one respiratory virus, with roughly similar proportions reporting being concerned about getting infected with COVID-19, seasonal influenza, RSV, and a cold. Relatedly, a CDC survey found that a majority of Americans take precautions when sick with cold or cough symptoms (i.e., avoiding contact with people at higher risk, avoiding large indoor gatherings) even if they don't know what virus is causing the illness. Respiratory Virus Guidance does not imply all viruses are the same Respiratory viruses are certainly not all the same. Some, like SARS-CoV-2, spread more through respiratory particles in the air, whereas others, like RSV and adenovirus, are thought to also spread via surface transmission. As such, this guidance is not meant to apply to specialized situations, like healthcare or certain disease outbreaks, in which more detailed guidance specific to the pathogen may be warranted. For example, adenoviruses are resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain infectious for hours on environmental surfaces. For the general public, however, an overall focus on hygiene, indoor air improvements, and mask use, coupled with necessarily specific recommendations about vaccines and treatment, provides a practical approach that addresses the key prevention measures. Numerous factors impact updated guidance when sick The updated Respiratory Virus Guidance recommends people with respiratory virus symptoms that are not better explained by another cause stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after both resolution of fever AND overall symptom are getting better. This recommendation addresses the period of greatest infectiousness and highest viral load for most people, which is typically in the first few days of illness and when symptoms, including fever, are worst. This is similar to longstanding recommendations for other respiratory illnesses, including influenza. A residual risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains, depending on the person and circumstances, after the period in which people are recommended to stay home and away from others. Five additional days of interventions (i.e., masking, testing, distancing, improved air quality, hygiene, and/or testing) reduce harm during later stages of illness, especially to protect people at higher risk of severe illness. Some people, especially people with weakened immune systems, might be able to infect others for an even longer time. It is important to note that a similar residual risk of transmission is also true for influenza and other viruses. In addition to the overall reduction in risk from COVID-19, other factors considered in developing this component of the guidance included assessment of personal and societal costs of extended isolation (e.g., limited paid sick time), analysis of the period of peak infectiousness ( see section 4.), and acknowledgement that many people with respiratory virus symptoms do not often know the pathogen that is causing their illness. Case examples from states and countries that changed their COVID-19 isolation guidance to recommendations similar to CDC's updated guidance did not experience clear increases in community transmission or hospitalization rates. Examples include the most populous Canadian provinces (Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia), Australia, Denmark, France, and Norway, as well as California (on January 9, 2024) and Oregon (May 2023). In California and Oregon, for the week ending February 10, COVID-19 test positivity, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were lower than the national average. View LargerDownload National trends in COVID-19 emergency department and hospitalization rates varied over time. View LargerDownload There was no appreciable difference in COVID-19 emergency department and hospitalization trends in Oregon compared to national data after guidance changes. View LargerDownload Washington state also saw no appreciable difference in COVID-19 emergency department and hospitalization trends compared to national data after guidance changes. Ongoing vigilance and action Need for ongoing implementation of recommendations Vaccines remain an underused layer of protection, even for groups at higher risk. For example, only 42% of adults aged 65 years or greater had received an updated COVID-19 vaccine as of February 16, 2024, compared with 73% for flu. COVID-19 antiviral treatments are also substantially underused to prevent severe COVID-19, meaning many people are missing out on important protection. Influenza treatment is also underused. Ongoing data monitoring The SARS-CoV-2 virus will continue to evolve, and new variants will continue to replace previous viruses. Genomic surveillance to monitor for new variants, epidemiologic studies to understand immune escape, infectiousness, severity, and monitoring of key indicators like hospitalizations and emergency department visits, all help inform prevention strategies. Various data systems are in place to continue to monitor for changes in how COVID-19 affects us. These include monitoring laboratory-based percent positivity and wastewater as indicators of changes in infections. Data on hospitalizations and deaths are indicators of severe illness while data on hospital occupancy and capacity provide information on stress on the healthcare system. Epidemiologic studies continue to assess how infectious the virus is and how efficiently it transmits between people as well as the severity of disease it causes. Ongoing monitoring through genomic surveillance and viral characterization will continue to be important to identify and describe new SARS-CoV-2 variants that may emerge. Vaccines will continue to be updated based on circulating variants, and other protective measures can be scaled up as needed. If variants emerge that have significant immune escape from existing vaccines and therapeutics, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking, distancing, and ventilation will be particularly important. Conclusion COVID-19 remains an important public health threat, but it is no longer the emergency that it once was, and its health impacts increasingly resemble those of other respiratory viral illnesses, including influenza and RSV. Protective tools, like vaccination and treatment that decrease risks of COVID-19 disease are now widely available and resultantly, far fewer people are getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and Long COVID are now less common as well. Data indicate rates of hospitalizations and deaths are down substantially, and that clinically COVID-19 has become similar to, or even less severe in hospitalized people, than influenza and RSV. These factors have enabled CDC to issue updated Respiratory Virus Guidance that provides the public with recommendations and information about effective steps and strategies tailored to the current level of risk posed by COVID-19 and other common respiratory viral illnesses.

Massachusetts Department of Public Health releases updated data on a weekly basis at Viral Respiratory Illness Reporting | Mass.gov. The most recent hospital emergency department data, which includes visits from February 11th through February 17th, show 13.4% of all emergency department (ED) visits statewide were attributable to acute respiratory illness. Of those acute respiratory illness visits, 19% were diagnosed with influenza, 10% with COVID-19, and 1.5% with RSV. While influenza-like illness activity is holding steady statewide, it is still presenting at HIGH levels. Young children (<5 years old) are still the highest risk age group for influenza-related ED visits. The severity level for influenza, which includes emergency department visits and hospitalizations, remains MODERATE. It is important to note that influenza can surge multiple times each season, as seen in other parts of the United States. COVID-19 emergency department (ED) visits have decreased to MINIMAL, while hospital admissions have remained LOW. The very old (>80 years) and very young (<5 years) continue to be disproportionately affected. Vaccination uptake is plateauing, at a lower rate than previous years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory on December 14, stating the urgent need to increase immunization coverage for influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Vaccine coverage data can be found at: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases. RSV severity (based on the number of ED visits) continues to remain stable and LOW. Ways to Protect Yourself and Others Stay up to date with vaccines: Everyone 6 months and older should get a yearly flu vaccine and a current COVID-19 vaccine. Find a vaccine at Vaccines.gov. CDC recommends that all infants receive protection from one of these tools to protect them from getting very sick with RSV. An RSV vaccine given during pregnancy An RSV immunization given to infants and some older babies Adults 60 years and older also may receive one dose of RSV vaccine and should talk with their healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. Additional Measures: Seek testing and possible treatment if you get sick Improve airflow and ventilation Options include bringing in as much fresh air as possible, filtering the air, using a portable air cleaner, turning on exhaust fans, or choosing outdoor options. Practice good hand hygiene and cover your coughs and sneezes Stay home when you are sick and avoid others who are sick Masks can help reduce the amount of germs you breathe in, and can also help protect others if you are sick. Their effectiveness against different viruses varies.

A California Department of Food and Agriculture technician performs a culture swab on a rooster to test for avian influenza.(Damian Dovarganes / Associated Press) By Susanne RustStaff Writer Feb. 25, 2024 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print An “apocalyptic” mass mortality event that has left thousands of sea lions and elephant seals dead on the beaches of South America is raising alarms among some California sea mammal experts who fear similar scenes could play out along California’s Pacific Coast and other continents as the H5N1 bird flu continues its march across the globe.The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has become notorious for its devastating affects on wild and domestic bird populations over the last four years, but only recently has it inflicted so many deaths in a mammal population. Up until now, the ability of the virus to jump from mammal to mammal has been limited, but the scale of infections and deaths in South America has raised troubling questions about whether something has changed. Climate & Environment In a remote corner of California, roaming dog packs leave a trail of blood and terror It’s a rarely discussed problem, but dogs are the No. 2 predator of livestock in the U.S. In California, roaming dog packs have even killed a human.Jan. 4, 2024 While it remains unclear whether this particular strain of H5N1 has improved its ability to pass easily between mammals, such a development would have potentially devastating consquences for endangered and non-endangered species alike. Advertisement The disease “presents an existential threat to the world’s biodiversity,” wrote Chris Walzer, executive director of health for the Wildlife Conservation Society in a January statement, noting that the scene of dead elephant seals could “only be described as apocalyptic.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 viruses circulating in birds “are believed to pose a low risk to the general public in the United States; however, people who have job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds may be at higher risk of infection and should take appropriate precautions outlined in CDC guidance.” The World Health Organization has also deemed the risk of human-to-human transmission to be low, and notes that candidate vaccines have been developed for pandemic preparedness. Yet the speed with which the virus has destroyed once-thriving animal populations is breathtaking, said Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian with UC Davis’ One Health institute, who is based in Argentina. In October, the mortality rate for newborn elephant seal pups reached 96% on one beach in Argentina — astronomically higher than the 0.8% mortality rate observed there in 2022. “Ten days and it’s done. There’s nothing left alive,” Uhart said.Die-offs have also been observed in South American dolphins and fur seals. And the virus is practically knocking on Antarctica’s front door, where more than 100 million birds, including colony-living penguins, and marine mammals congregate. Advertisement “There’s climate change and habitat destruction,” which are taking their toll on the planet’s wildlife species, said Rebecca Duerr, an avian veterinarian with International Bird Rescue in Long Beach. “And then this. It’s grim.”In California, some experts say they worry about the vulnerability of sea lions and sea otters. “California has been spared some of the huge die-off events being seen somewhere else in the world. But we still have species that are very vulnerable to it. We’re not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination,” Duerr said. Sea lion pups congregate at a rookery at Boomer Beach, next to Point La Jolla, in San Diego, in August 2020. (Eduardo Contreras / San Diego Union-Tribune) Colony nesting of seabirds and breeding of marine mammals occurs all along the California Coast, the Channel Islands and Farallon Islands. They are seasonally populated by such species as terns, sea lions and sea otters, among others. “There’s a whole lot of concern still for what will happen in the bigger picture over time,” she said. “This summer is breeding season, the time that other areas of the world have seen huge die-offs at breeding colonies.” Advertisement The effects wouldn’t be limited to just the infected animals either, Duerr said. These animals are critical within wider ecosystems. Guano produced from breeding bird colonies provides nutrients for marine invertebrates and fish, for instance.And if sea otters were to suffer such losses, that would endanger the health of California’s vast kelp forests, which would be left prey to sea urchins, said Christine Johnson, professor of epidemiology and ecosystem health at UC Davis. And although Southern and Northern hemisphere populations of marine mammals don’t have much, if any contact, Johnson said the world is changing so quickly, we can’t really be sure about anything. “The distribution of marine species is largely dictated on where their food goes, which itself is dictated by ocean trends and warming,” Johnson said. “Are there species that are now overlapping that hadn’t been before, based on climate or other factors?”She said forces such as climate change and habitat destruction could have played a role in the virus’ geographical expansion, as well as its initial and sustained grasp on wildlife. “There’s increasing evidence that pandemics that come from wildlife, in particular, are increasing in frequency,” Johnson said. “There’s not a lot of segregation or separation between wild animals and their pathogens” and domestic animals and people. Advertisement Climate & Environment California mountain lion population is thousands fewer than previously estimated Scientists have completed the first comprehensive estimate of mountain lions in California, a vital statistic needed to shape puma-friendly land-use decisions and ensure that the predators can find room to roam, mate and find prey. Jan. 7, 2024 Until recently, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was considered strictly a poultry disease. It would flare up here and there — primarily in Asia — and get stomped out quickly by killing all the birds on an infected farm. But in 2002, the virus jumped to wild birds, and in 2005, it had spread to Eastern Europe, where seven people were infected after de-feathering wild swans. Four of the people died. Nine years later, the disease reached North America — presumably via Alaska, where birds from around the world migrate and feast during the summer. And although it died down for a bit in Canada and the U.S. — flaring up occasionally in Asia, Europe and Africa — it came back with a vengeance in 2021.Since that time, not only have hundreds of millions of domestic birds been culled, but countless numbers of wild birds and animals have contracted the virus. Julianna Lenoch, the national coordinator of wildlife services for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said that while scientists are waiting for genetic information from South America, there is no “evidence that is of high concern yet in the United States, but I think watching mammal spillover and potential mammalian spread is something the global community is looking for.” The agency routinely samples wild birds, and only samples mammals in which there is suspicion.“We pick them up from state agencies or wildlife rehabilitation facilities or from someone who has an indication of suspicion ... so, what we have is probably an undercount,” she said. Advertisement But so far, the situation in North America is different from the “craziness” being seen in South America.In the United States and Canada, the only mammals that have gotten the disease — such as foxes, skunks, coyotes and bears — are those known to scavenge on dead birds. There is no indication there is any mammal-to-mammal passage. Sea otters relax in the Morro Bay marina. Some marine mammal experts worry that the furry mammals may be vulnerable to the spreading H5N1 bird flu. (Marc Martin / Los Angeles Times) But North American animals may also share a defense that South American wildlife does not.Because the virus has had a presence in North America since 2014, most of the continent’s wildlife has “some sort of base immunity to influenza,” said Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “They have some antibodies. Maybe not the perfect ones ... but they’ve seen the virus before.”“In South America ... those populations were basically naive, and had not seen high path (influenza) before. ... So they just don’t have that type of immunity that we have in our seals as well as our birds,” she said.So, whether the massive marine mammal die-offs are the result of a novel exposure to the disease, or because the virus has acquired the ability to move between mammals, remains unclear. Advertisement California Bay Area birdwatchers mourn the failed rescue of ‘Tuffy,’ the kidnapped baby hawk The story of Tuffy, a baby red-tailed hawk who was kidnapped by a family of bald eagles, has come to a sad end following a failed rescue attempt. July 6, 2023 In either case, however, it does not bode well for wildlife in the last remaining areas of the world where the disease has not been detected: Antarctica and Oceania — the region that includes Australia, New Zealand and the surrounding islands.Uhart said she was setting out in late February to sample animals in Antarctica — hitching a ride on a cruise ship. Before tourists are allowed off the boat for a landing, she said, she’ll go out and do surveillance and make sure everything looks normal; she’ll also collect samples.“We’ve seen it enough,” she said. “I know really well what it looks like.”Johnson said the nations of the world need to be on heightened surveillance as the virus continues its scourge. Just as in the case of the coronavirus that caused COVID-19, this flu strain is constantly evolving and changing — with new variants appearing all the time. Yet, fatigue is setting in among many governments across the world that have been battling the virus for three or four years now.“Nobody wants to think about or talk about another pandemic,” she said. But keeping a handle on its whereabouts and changes is critical for conservation, the ecosystem and human health.“I think countries need to start preparing for the response efforts that’s needed for ... big biosafety concerns,” she said. “It does have a high mortality rate in people and we’re talking about a lot of virus on the landscape.” More to Read Bird flu virus found in Los Angeles County wastewater Nov. 1, 2024 A deadly fungus that has killed millions of bats may have arrived in Southern California Oct. 31, 2024 A concerning development: H5N1 bird flu has infected a pig in Oregon, officials say Oct. 30, 2024 Climate & EnvironmentCaliforniaWorld & NationAnimals & Pets Susanne Rust Follow Us X Instagram Email Facebook Susanne Rust is an award-winning investigative reporter specializing in environmental issues.

Yet, our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to such variation remains limited. Here we performed in-depth genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional profiling on primary macrophages derived from individuals of European and African ancestry before and after infection with influenza A virus. We show that baseline epigenetic profiles are strongly predictive of the transcriptional response to influenza A virus across individuals. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed highly coordinated genetic effects on gene regulation, with many cis-acting genetic variants impacting concomitantly gene expression and multiple epigenetic marks. These data reveal that ancestry-associated differences in the epigenetic landscape can be genetically controlled, even more than gene expression. Lastly, among QTL variants that colocalized with immune-disease loci, only 7% were gene expression QTL, while the remaining genetic variants impact epigenetic marks, stressing the importance of considering molecular phenotypes beyond gene expression in disease-focused studies.

(B) Comparison of infection effects for the union of genes tested in our study and Randolph et al.8. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and a 95% confidence interval are plotted). (C) Distribution depicting the relationship between gene expression changes and epigenetic changes in response to flu infection as seen in Fig. 1e but here focusing on epigenetic changes nearby genes that are downregulated in response to infection. Downregulated genes are defined as genes with beta < -0.5 and FDR < .01. Epigenetic changes are those with FDR < .01, except for methylation changes (FDR < .20).Extended Data Fig. 2 Classification of ancestry-associated differences.(A) Correlation of population differentially expressed (popDE) effects calculated with global or local ancestry effects (Pearson’s correlation coefficient reported). (B) Distribution depicting the relationship between popDE genes and popDE epigenetic changes across both conditions. Genes more highly expressed in individuals with high proportions of European ancestry (fold change < -0.5, FDR < 0.10) are nearby popDE epigenetic regions (FDR < .10) that show increased levels of chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in individuals with increased European ancestry levels. Black lines represent means. (C) Distributions of individual mean scores of inflammatory pathways in the flu-infected condition comparable to Fig. 2c which shows non-infected condition distributions. A higher score indicates a strong expression of genes or epigenetic marks nearby genes within the Hallmark inflammatory response pathway. (D) Individual mean score differences between the population-groups for the Hallmark “inflammatory pathway” in the non-infected and (C) flu-infected conditions remain consistent when reducing popDE effects FDR from 10% to 5%. P values in panels C and D calculated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. (E) Population-group differences utilizing popDR effects to calculate individual transcriptional response score across 6 immune pathways remain consistent with varying FDR thresholds (20%, 10% and 5%). (n = 35 individuals: 14 AF, 21 EU) P values calculated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. The maxima and minima are the upper and lower points, respectively. The center line represents the median, and the top and bottom lines are the 75% and 25% percentile, respectively. (F) The distribution of Spearman’s correlation between the predicted and observed mean scores for the various pathways using different alphas.Extended Data Fig. 3 Power calculations and validation of the QTL identified using external data sets.(A) Power calculations for QTL with effect sizes ranging from 0.1-0.3. Power to detect QTL increases as the effect size of the variant increases. (B) Validation of significant FDR < .10 QTL in our dataset. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and a 95% confidence interval are shown. First row: Left- Comparison of non-infected eQTL with Randolph et al. Middle- Comparison of flu-infected eQTL with Randolph et al. Right- Comparison of non-infected eQTL with Nedelec et al. Second row: Left- Comparison of non-infected caQTL with Alasoo et al. Right- Comparison of non-infected meQTL with Husquin et al. (C) ASE hits are enriched for QTL. Mean and 95% confidence interval measured by logistic regression.Extended Data Fig. 4 QTL mapping of the different molecular traits.(A) Proportion and number of SNP-QTL at a significance threshold of FDR < .10 in each condition (B) Proportion and number of STR-QTL at a significance threshold of FDR < .10 in each condition. (C) Proportion and number of genes/features associated with at least one SNP or STR QTL in non-infected macrophages. Shared QTL were defined as those genes/features associated with a QTL at an FDR < .10 when performing the QTL mapping against SNPs and STRs separately. SNP- or STR-specific are those only identified as significant (FDR < 0.1) against either SNPs or STRs. (D) The mean percent variance explained by the top SNP and STR across all features in the non-infected condition. Both is the sum of the PVE of the top SNP and top STR (E) The enrichment of TF binding sites across non-infected specific SNP-QTL using a logistic regression. TF clusters are shown. (See Supplementary Table 4 for full results).Extended Data Fig. 5 Overlap of QTL across molecular traits.(A) Left: The number of overlaps for each QTL type for the permuted analysis in the non-infected condition. More than one overlap indicates the QTL is shared with at least one other datatype. Center: The number of overlaps for each QTL type in the flu-infected condition. Right: The number of overlaps for each QTL type for the permuted analysis in the flu-infected condition. (B) The percentage of QTL in one data type that are also QTL for another data type in the flu-condition. The starting QTL (rows) are the QTL that are tested for sharing while the overlapping QTL (columns) are the percentage of each starting QTL that are shared with that datatype. The color of each circle corresponds to the percentage of sharing. (C) QTL sharing patterns for those QTL overlapping 2≥ data types) in the non-infected condition. Y axis the proportion of overlapping QTL (that is, the denominator is the number of QTL that are shared in at least 2 or more data types). (D) QTL sharing patterns for those QTL overlapping 3≥ data types) in the non-infected condition highlighting that caQTL, K4me1 QTL and meQTL are the most commonly shared. The Y axis is the same as described in (C) above.Extended Data Fig. 6 Genetically driven variation in epigenetic levels has no impact on the magnitude of transcriptional responses upon IAV infection.(A) Genotypes for epigenetic QTL at baseline have no impact on the transcriptional response of nearby genes. The light blue marks the mean for each genotype and gray the median across all genotypes. The center line of the boxplot represents the median, and the top and bottom lines are the 75% and 25% percentile, respectively. The maxima and minima are the upper and lower points, respectively. As detailed in Fig. 5, we restricted to QTL nearby upregulated genes that are not eQTL (P < .30). (B) Association between genetically encoded baseline differences in chromatin accessibility and baseline differences in other epigenetic marks. Left- Meta caQTL plot (at baseline condition) across caQTLs for accessibility regions associated with up-regulated genes (n = 681 caQTLs associated with 506 genes). Individuals with genotypes associated with increased chromatin accessibility also show significantly increased levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (P < 2.2×10-16), and to a lesser extent, a reduction in the repressive mark.Extended Data Fig. 7 Calculating the contribution of cis-acting regulatory variants to ancestry-associated differences.(A) Relationship between the observed and predicted betas for significant population differentially expressed (popDE) features (FDR < .10) for each of the data types in both conditions (adjusted R2 reported). (B) Boxplots of individual transcriptional response scores after regressing out the effects of the top SNP and STR in each condition for the 6 immune response pathways. (n = 35 individuals: 14 AF, 21 EU) P-values were calculated using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. The maxima and minima are the upper and lower points, respectively. The center line represents the median, and the top and bottom lines are the 75% and 25% percentile, respectively.Extended Data Fig. 8 Epigenetic QTLs overlap with genetic variants associated with immune-related diseases.(A) Summary of colocalization results for duplicated immune related diseases (11 diseases were investigated through 14 GWAS). Points represent the number of significant hits defined as PP3 + PP4 > 0.5 and PP4/(PP3 + PP4) > 0.8 in either condition. (B) Summary of PrediXcan results. Each point represents the total number of genes (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.05) associated with the disease trait in either condition. A gene is only counted once even if multiple peaks are associated with the gene. (C) Schematic depicting the proposed hypothesis that epigenetic QTL may act as a proxy for genetic variation that under particular environmental conditions has an impact on gene expression levels. Blue boxes represent gene exons and green peaks represent ATACseq peaks. A genetic variant at the QTL location impacts TF binding, such that differential binding of the TF is associated with variation in chromatin accessibility (that is, an caQTL). If the activity of this enhancer requires the recruitment of an additional TF (here labelled “environment-induced TF”) only induced in response to specific environmental/developmental conditions, the caQTL will not be associated with variation in gene expression levels. Yet, this caQTL will be a proxy for a genetic variant that on the “right environment” will ultimately be associated with an eQTL. Under this model, epigenetic QTLs that colocalize with GWAS variants (but not with eQTLs) can be thought of as a means to identify genetic variants that have an impact on gene expression in a yet unmeasured environment.

(Photo credit: Sabrina Greene-Rusk)TOPICS:AidanFluGreene-RuskRuskHeart failureType B influenzaEmergency roomBanjoWAYNESVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) — Aidan Hoglen loved to play the banjo, among other things.“He was creative,” his mother Sabrina Greene-Rusk said. “He was a free spirit. You absolutely couldn’t keep him inside the house.”“He was the kindest, most gentle soul you’d ever meet,” his stepfather JJ Rusk said.Last week, Aidan became sick. According to Aidan’s mom, doctors said it was Type B influenza."I said don’t panic because I’d heard about the flu and COVID-19 and things like that. I said it’s OK, you could just have a cold,” Greene-Rusk said. “He said it’s confirmed Type B, and I’d never heard of that. The urgent care centers here, when he was taken to the doctors, said it was confirmed Type B flu. They gave him ibuprofen and that was it.”BUNCOMBE COUNTY REPORTS FIRST FLU-RELATED DEATH OF THE 2023 - 2024 SEASONHowever, this past Monday, Aidan experienced swelling in his face among other symptoms. His mother took him to the emergency room, where things took a turn.“What we didn’t know until later is that when we pulled into the emergency room, the doors opened and I went in for help, he was having a heart attack,” Greene-Rusk said. “He went into cardiac arrest. They took him in and immediately started doing CPR going down the hall. At that point, I went into shock.”Soon after, Greene-Rusk was told her son was in critical condition.“[The doctor] said, 'I’m not going to lie to you, the flu for children this year is weird, and it’s something horrible,’” she said.On Tuesday, Aidan passed away after complications of heart failure.“I would’ve never dreamed in a million years that this would have happened,” Rusk said.“It happened so quickly,” Greene-Rusk said. “It was cruel.”MEDICAL DIRECTOR URGES VIGILANCE FOR FLU, RSV, COVID DESPITE WINTER PEAK DECLINEThe family is still awaiting the autopsy, but no matter the results, Aidan’s loved ones have learned not to underestimate any illness.“This needs to be taken seriously,” Rusk said. “It’s not a joke. I’m going to tell you it’s not a joke. I wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone. Not even my worst enemy, ever.”Other local health officials said the same.“It’s important that people are washing their hands, covering their coughs and staying home when they’re sick,” Buncombe County Health and Human Services Public Health Director Ellis Matheson said. “All these measures together are going to help prevent infection and reduce the spread of infection in our community.”Aidan’s mother said one thing is going to stick with her going forward.“The moment he left, every fear I’ve ever had in my life is gone,” Greene-Rusk said. “I’m afraid of nothing. I have to live boldly like he did.”For more information on how to donate to Aidan’s family, click here.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCWLOSWMYAWMYAPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Study reveals BCG vaccine's unexpected role in fighting influenza Skip to content Menu Medical Home Life Sciences Home Become a Member Search Medical Home Life Sciences Home About COVID-19 News Health A-Z Drugs Medical Devices Interviews White Papers More...

Scholars from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) have discovered a surprising facet about a century-old vaccine for tuberculosis, Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG). The study, published in the journal Nature Immunology, uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that extends the vaccine's shield to combat influenza A virus-;the most prevalent flu strain. The immune interactions involved here can 'train' the lungs, which are frequently exposed to infectious agents in the environment. If we can map out the protective immune pathways involved in the lungs, this will revolutionize our conceptual and clinical approaches in developing vaccines against infections, including emergent respiratory viruses." Maziar Divangahi, lead author, pulmonary immunologist, senior scientist at the RI-MUHC, and Professor of Medicine at McGill University The discovery paves the way for future studies to assess whether BCG could be used to prevent other emergent viruses. Notably, research on the vaccine's protection against COVID-19 has had promising results. Source:McGill UniversityJournal reference:Tran, K. A., et al. (2024).

It's important for people with cancer to call their doctor immediately if they get a fever. Treatment overview Antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. Plan in advance with your doctor about what to do if you get sick. Flu-like symptoms also can be a sign of a very serious infection that is not flu, including COVID-19. The plan includes when to call your doctor and how to get a prescription for flu antiviral medication quickly if needed. What to do if you get sick If you have flu symptoms: Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. Your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine. Keep away from others as much as possible to avoid making them sick. It's important for people with cancer to call their doctor immediately if they get a fever. If you get a fever during your chemotherapy treatment, it's a medical emergency. What Should You Do If You Get Flu? none Low Resolution Video This video lists flu symptoms and explains what to do if you get sick or have a high risk of getting very sick from flu. Antiviral drugs CDC recommends you take flu antiviral drugs to treat flu illness, if your doctor prescribes them. If you get sick, antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications. It's very important that antiviral drugs be used promptly to treat flu in people who are very sick with flu (for example, people who are in the hospital) and people who are sick with flu and have a greater chance of getting serious flu-related complications, including cancer patients. Call your doctor immediately and ask if you should receive antiviral drugs if you have been within 6 feet of someone known or thought to have the flu and: You have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the last month, or You have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer.

Currently, all influenza vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent, meaning that they protect against four different flu viruses. In a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers detail the spread of influenza B/Yamagata virus, which has not been in circulation since early 2020; the regulatory discussions and recommendations on updating vaccines; and the manufacturing considerations for new vaccine formulations for the U.S. and abroad. The removal of B/Yamagata virus is logical as we do not want to include a virus in vaccine formulation that is no longer in circulation.” Arnold Monto, professor emeritus of epidemiology and global public health, U-M School of Public Health “It also gives us the space to replace B/Yamagata virus with a component that will give improved protection against the circulating influenza viruses. That will take additional studies to accomplish.” Monto has dedicated his career to researching the occurrence, prevention and control of respiratory infections. He also serves as a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Co-authors include Maria Zambon of the U.K. Health Security Agency and Jerry Weir of the Division of Viral Products, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Is it seasonal influenza (commonly called the flu)? Or could you have COVID-19? While the two illnesses share many similarities, there are a few differences. Path to improved health COVID-19 and the flu are both caused by viruses. But they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses have been around for a long time and can cause you to get the common cold. Flu, on the other hand, is caused by the influenza virus. This is a seasonal virus with two types: Influenza A and Influenza B. You can catch COVID-19 and the flu in similar ways. When a person talks, sneezes, or coughs, tiny, invisible particles leave their mouth and nose and travel through the air. These particles are where the virus can live. If you breathe in these particles, the virus is then inside your body and can make you sick. Also, if you get the particles on your hands and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes, you can get sick. This is why it’s so important to wash your hands frequently. COVID-19 is much more contagious than the flu. That means it passes more quickly and easily from one person to another. People most at risk While anyone can get COVID-19 and the flu, some groups of people are at a higher risk of getting sick. For both COVID-19 and flu, adults over 65, people who are pregnant, people with lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes have a greater risk. Read more about flu risks for people with chronic conditions. Children are also at risk for both COVID-19 and flu. Symptoms COVID-19 and the flu have many of the same symptoms, including: Fever Cough Trouble breathing Extreme tiredness Sore throat Stuffy nose Body aches, including headache Diarrhea Vomiting You may also lose your sense of smell or taste if you have COVID-19. COVID-19 and the flu can cause severe illness and complications that require hospitalization. If you have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They can diagnose which illness you have and offer advice about what you should do next. How long are you sick? It’s possible to spread COVID-19 and the flu to others before you even know you’re sick. If you have COVID-19, you can spread the virus 2 to 3 days before you have symptoms. After symptoms begin, you’re likely contagious for 10 days. It’s important to stay away from other people during this time to keep them from getting sick. If you’re around someone who has COVID-19, it can take between 2 and 14 days for you to develop symptoms. With the flu, you can spread it 1 day before your symptoms begin. Once you have symptoms, you’re contagious for up to 7 days. This time can be longer for kids and seniors. If you’re exposed to someone with the flu, it can take between 1 and 4 days for you to develop symptoms. People are usually sicker for a longer time with COVID-19 than with the flu. Testing There are different tests that can confirm if you have COVID-19. Some tests require a cotton swab to be put in your nose. The end of the swab collects a sample from your nasal cavity because this is where the germs live. The swab is then sent to a laboratory for testing. The swab may also be used for a rapid antigen test, however, you may need to confirm a positive or negative result with a laboratory (PCR) test if you still have symptoms or if you need a negative test to return to school or work. A saliva test may be offered and at home (over the counter) tests are also available. Be sure to check that the test is authorized by the FDA before purchasing. If your doctor thinks you have the flu, they can perform one of two tests. One test involves putting a swab up your nose. This swab will be sent to the lab for testing. The other test involves collecting a sample from the back of your throat. It will be sent to the lab for testing, too. Rapid tests are also available for flu. Laboratories have also developed tests that can detect both flu and COVID-19. Talk with your doctor to see if they are available in your area. Treatment COVID-19 Three vaccines for COVID-19 were initially developed for use in the United States during the pandemic. However, in September 2023, the CDC strongly recommended everyone over age 6 months get a dose of the updated, 2023-2024 version of the vaccine. People aged 65 years and older may get a second dose of the updated vaccine. If you have not received a COVID-19 vaccine in the past 2 months, get an updated vaccine to protect yourself through fall and winter. Safety and efficacy data has been collected in more than 220 million people who have gotten at least one dose of vaccines. Some rare side effects have been observed, but overall the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death. These vaccines do not give you COVID-19, and do not cause complications during pregnancy or cause decreases in fertility. If you do have COVID-19, one treatment medicine your doctor may prescribe is nirmatrelviritonavir (brand name: Paxlovid). It is an antiviral medicine to prevent people from getting so sick from COVID-19 that they need to be hospitalized. Flu There is a vaccine you can get to help protect you against the flu. It’s given as a shot in your arm. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends everyone older than 6 months old get the yearly flu shot, unless their doctor says otherwise. If you get the flu, there are medicines your doctor can prescribe to help you relieve symptoms. The flu shot doesn’t give you the flu. Recovery time If you’ve had COVID-19, it may take you a long time to recover or weeks before you feel like yourself again. For some people, it may take months (also known as long COVID). Talk with your doctor if you have symptoms that continue, as there are options for management of these ongoing symptoms. People who have had the flu usually feel much better about 2 weeks after getting sick. Things to consider COVID-19 and the flu share many complications. These include pneumonia, respiratory failure, kidney failure, and blood infections. These illnesses can also make existing conditions—including issues with the heart, lungs, and diabetes—worse. In severe cases, both illnesses may lead to death. If you have COVID-19, you may also develop blood clots in your legs, lungs, heart, or brain. Your chances for these side effects go up if you have heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes. Some children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome. This is a serious condition, but it isn’t very common. If you’ve had the flu, you may develop a sinus infection or an ear infection. You may also get pneumonia, which can be serious. Severe side effects are more common in people who are younger than 5 years old or older than 65 years old, pregnant, or who have asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.

WuIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: lesichkadesign / Getty.February 28, 2024 ShareSave Four years after what was once the “novel coronavirus” was declared a pandemic, COVID remains the most dangerous infectious respiratory illness regularly circulating in the U.S. But a glance at the United States’ most prominent COVID policies can give the impression that the disease is just another seasonal flu. COVID vaccines are now reformulated annually, and recommended in the autumn for everyone over the age of six months, just like flu shots; tests and treatments for the disease are steadily being commercialized, like our armamentarium against flu. And the CDC is reportedly considering more flu-esque isolation guidance for COVID: Stay home ’til you’re feeling better and are, for at least a day, fever-free without meds.These changes are a stark departure from the earliest days of the crisis, when public-health experts excoriated public figures—among them, former President Donald Trump—for evoking flu to minimize COVID deaths and dismiss mitigation strategies. COVID might still carry a bigger burden than flu, but COVID policies are getting more flu-ified.Read: The flu-ification of COVID policy is almost completeIn some ways, as the population’s immunity has increased, COVID has become more flu-like, says Roby Bhattacharyya, a microbiologist and an infectious-disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. Every winter seems to bring a COVID peak, but the virus is now much less likely to hospitalize or kill us, and somewhat less likely to cause long-term illness. People develop symptoms sooner after infection, and, especially if they’re vaccinated, are less likely to be as sick for as long. COVID patients are no longer overwhelming hospitals; those who do develop severe COVID tend to be those made more vulnerable by age or other health issues.Even so, COVID and the flu are nowhere near the same. SARS-CoV-2 still spikes in non-winter seasons and simmers throughout the rest of the year. In 2023, COVID hospitalized more than 900,000 Americans and killed 75,000; the worst flu season of the past decade hospitalized 200,000 fewer people and resulted in 23,000 fewer deaths. A recent CDC survey reported that more than 5 percent of American adults are currently experiencing long COVID, which cannot be fully prevented by vaccination or treatment, and for which there is no cure. Plus, scientists simply understand much less about the coronavirus than flu viruses. Its patterns of spread, its evolution, and the durability of our immunity against it all may continue to change.And yet, the CDC and White House continue to fold COVID in with other long-standing seasonal respiratory infections. When the nation’s authorities start to match the precautions taken against COVID with those for flu, RSV, or common colds, it implies “that the risks are the same,” Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, told me. Some of those decisions are “not completely unreasonable,” says Costi Sifri, the director of hospital epidemiology at UVA Health, especially on a case-by-case basis. But taken together, they show how bent America has been on treating COVID as a run-of-the-mill disease—making it impossible to manage the illness whose devastation has defined the 2020s.Each “not completely unreasonable” decision has trade-offs. Piggybacking COVID vaccines onto flu shots, for instance, is convenient: Although COVID-vaccination rates still lag those of flu, they might be even lower if no one could predict when shots might show up. But such convenience may come at the cost of protecting Americans against COVID’s year-round threat. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, told me that a once-a-year vaccine policy is “dead wrong … There is no damn evidence this is a seasonal virus yet.” Safeguards against infection and milder illness start to fade within months, leaving people who dose up in autumn potentially more susceptible to exposures by spring. That said, experts are still torn on the benefits of administering the same vaccine more than once a year—especially to a public that’s largely unwilling to get it. Throughout the pandemic, immunocompromised people have been able to get extra shots. And today, an advisory committee to the CDC voted to recommend that older adults once again get an additional dose of the most recently updated COVID vaccine in the coming months. Neither is a pattern that flu vaccines follow.Read: Fall’s vaccine routine didn’t have to be this hardDropping the current COVID-isolation guideline—which has, since the end of 2021, recommended that people cloister for five days—may likewise be dangerous. Many Americans have long abandoned this isolation timeline, but given how new COVID is to both humanity and science, symptoms alone don’t yet seem enough to determine when mingling is safe, Popescu said. (The dangers are even tougher to gauge for infected people who never develop fevers or other symptoms at all.) Researchers don’t currently have a clear picture of how long people can transmit the virus once they get sick, Sifri told me. For most respiratory illnesses, fevers show up relatively early in infection, which is generally when people pose the most transmission risk, says Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. But although SARS-CoV-2 adheres to this same rough timeline, infected people can shed the virus after their symptoms begin to resolve and are “definitely shedding longer than what you would usually see for flu,” Gordon told me. (Asked about the specifics and precise timing of the update, a CDC spokesperson told me that there were “no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time,” and did not respond to questions about how flu precedents had influenced new recommendations.)At the very least, Emily Landon, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Chicago, told me, recommendations for all respiratory illnesses should tell freshly de-isolated people to mask for several days when they’re around others indoors; she would support some change to isolation recommendations with this caveat. But if the CDC aligns the policy fully with its flu policy, it might not mention masking at all.Read: No one really knows how much COVID is silently spreading … againSeveral experts told me symptom-based isolation might also remove remaining incentives to test for the coronavirus: There’s little point if the guidelines for all respiratory illnesses are essentially the same. To be fair, Americans have already been testing less frequently—in some cases, to avoid COVID-specific requirements to stay away from work or school. And Osterholm and Gordon told me that, at this point in the pandemic, they agree that keeping people at home for five days isn’t sustainable—especially without paid sick leave, and particularly not for health-care workers, who are in short supply during the height of respiratory-virus season.But the less people test, the less they’ll be diagnosed—and the less they’ll benefit from antivirals such as Paxlovid, which work best when administered early. Sifri worries that this pattern could yield another parallel to flu, for which many providers hesitate to prescribe Tamiflu, debating its effectiveness. Paxlovid use is already shaky; both antivirals may end up chronically underutilized.Flu-ification also threatens to further stigmatize long COVID. Other respiratory infections, including flu, have been documented triggering long-term illness, but potentially at lower rates, and to different degrees than SARS-CoV-2 currently does. Folding this new virus in with the rest could make long COVID seem all the more negligible. What’s more, fewer tests and fewer COVID diagnoses could make it much harder to connect any chronic symptoms to this coronavirus, keeping patients out of long-COVID clinics—or reinforcing a false portrait of the condition’s rarity.The U.S. does continue to treat COVID differently from flu in a few ways. Certain COVID products remain more available; some precautions in health-care settings remain stricter. But these differences, too, will likely continue to fade, even as COVID’s burden persists. Tests, vaccines, and treatments are slowly commercializing; as demand for them drops, supply may too. And several experts told me that they wouldn’t be surprised if hospitals, too, soon flu-ify their COVID policies even more, for instance by allowing recently infected employees to return to work once they’re fever-free.Early in the pandemic, public-health experts hoped that COVID’s tragedies would prompt a rethinking of all respiratory illnesses. The pandemic showed what mitigations could do: During the first year of the crisis, isolation, masking, distancing, and shutdowns brought flu transmission to a near halt, and may have driven an entire lineage of the virus to extinction—something “that never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think would be possible,” Landon told me.Most of those measures weren’t sustainable. But America’s leaders blew right past a middle ground. The U.S. could have built and maintained systems in which everyone had free access to treatments, tests, and vaccines for a longer list of pathogens; it might have invested in widespread ventilation improvements, or enacted universal sick leave. American homes might have been stocked with tests for a multitude of infectious microbes, and masks to wear when people started to cough. Vaccine requirements in health-care settings and schools might have expanded. Instead, “we seem to be in a more 2019-like place than a future where we’re preventing giving each other colds as much as we could,” Bhattacharyya told me.Read: Next winter, what if we test for even more viruses? That means a return to a world in which tens of thousands of Americans die each year of flu and RSV, as they did in the 2010s. With COVID here to stay, every winter for the foreseeable future will layer on yet another respiratory virus—and a particularly deadly, disabling, and transmissible one at that. The math is simple: “The risk has overall increased for everyone,” Landon said. That straightforward addition could have inspired us to expand our capacity for preserving health and life. Instead, our tolerance for suffering seems to be the only thing that’s grown.About the AuthorKatherine J.

This H5N1 outbreak is thought to have killed millions of wild birds globally since 2021, and has spread to every continent except Oceania.Avian flu reached the wider Antarctic region in October last year when it was reported on sub-Antarctic islands. The virus was first detected on the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, about 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the continent of Antarctica. It was also found in the Falkland Islands, which is 600 miles north-west of South Georgia.View image in fullscreenThe Argentinian research station on Primavera Cape where scientists detected the first cases of H5N1 on mainland Antarctica. Photograph: Gerald Corsi/Getty Images/iStockphotoInitially it was reported in birds such as gulls, skuas and terns, but has since been found in albatross, penguins and southern fulmars. It has also spread to Antarctic mammals, with mass deaths of elephant seals and fur seals. The virus is also ripping through wildlife populations in the Arctic. In December, it was confirmed that the first polar bear had died of H5N1.“There are many reports now of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) affecting several species in the Antarctic regions this season,” said Matthew Dryden from the UK Health Security Agency. “It may not have been reported on the Antarctic mainland until now because of the difficulties of accessing and sampling wildlife [there].”The dead birds from mainland Antarctica were found by Argentinian scientists and sent to scientists from the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa in Madrid, who were working at the Spanish Antarctic base on Deception Island.“The problem is how long is it going to take before it transmits to other species like penguins. We need to monitor that,” said Antonio Alcamí, a researcher from the Spanish National Research Council who works at the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa CSIC, who is based at the Spanish Antarctic base and tested the carcasses. “I’m afraid I think it probably will transmit into penguins. The skuas live pretty close, and so there are many opportunities for transmission, but we will see.”Bird flu causing ‘catastrophic’ fall in UK seabird numbers, conservationists warnRead morePrevious outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina have shown that penguins are susceptible to the virus. Since H5N1 arrived in South America, more than 500,000 seabirds have died of the disease, with penguins, pelicans and boobies among the most heavily affected.Researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper in November last year: “If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times.”Diana Bell, the emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, said the news was “sadly not surprising, given its previously reported presence on Antarctic islands in birds and elephant seals. It seems unlikely that the penguins there will not be infected.”Dryden added: “Biosecurity is important so that humans are not exposed to the virus. HPAI can rarely infect humans but close, prolonged contact is required.”While a number of wildlife sites had been closed to tourists to limit spread of the virus, Dryden said, little else could be done to stop it spreading. “Nothing more can be done to limit transmission in wildlife and the outbreak will have to resolve naturally.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and featuresExplore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionBirdsWildlifeAnimalsAntarcticaConservationnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

PDF FILE Although avian influenza has been present in all continents except Australia, its arrival in Antarctica is of concern due to the vulnerability of penguins to climate change. After several suspicions due to the mortality of birds on several antarctic islands, a teamwork between spanish and argentine scientists confirmed the presence of avian influenza in Antarctica. According to the scientists, a deadly strain of avian flu was detected for the first time in continental Antarctica, raising concerns about the risk of mass mortality of the continent's huge colonies of penguins and other animals found nowhere else on Earth. The finding Researchers confirmed on February 24 the presence of the H5 subtype of avian influenza in two dead seabirds, called skuas (Stercorarius skua), near an argentinean base and scientific research station located on the antarctic peninsula, according to the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC). The finding demonstrates for the first time that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has reached Antarctica, despite the distance and natural barriers that separate it from other continents. In recent years, this highly infectious disease has devastated wild and domestic animal populations, making its way across the globe via bird migration routes. Now, the arrival of avian influenza in the southernmost continent threatens its unique wildlife, including its iconic penguins. The virus is potent enough to jump from birds to mammals, hitting elephant seals and other aquatic mammals that congregate along the coast. It has reached every continent except Australia. For farms, the global outbreak is a high economic cost as the virus kills millions of chickens and other poultry. In the wild, the disease threatens to disrupt ecosystems and bring threatened birds closer to extinction. Regarding penguins Penguins in Antarctica most likely do not have much immunity to the disease, as the presence of the virus on the continent has not been documented until now. Outbreaks among penguins in South America and Africa demonstrate their vulnerability. These birds, which like to walk together in colonies, are not very good at social distancing. Many Antarctic penguins are already at risk of disappearing as rising temperatures deplete the sea ice they need for feeding, breeding and defense. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared that the continent's emperor penguins are at risk of extinction due to climate change. The CSIC said scientists obtained samples from the two dead skuas using "maximum security measures to avoid transmission of the virus to humans", sending them by ship to the spanish base on Deception Island for analysis.Continue after advertising. Avian flu has been creeping towards the mainland for months. In recent weeks there have been other suspected cases of bird flu in Antarctica, according to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. For many scientists, its arrival was inevitable. In October 2023, british scientists discovered the virus in brown skuas about 1,000 kilometers from Antarctica, on Bird Island in the british territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. And in January 2024, in the Falkland Islands off the coast of Argentina, researchers detected the flu in Gentoo penguins for the first time. Another 35 penguins were found dead or showing flu symptoms. Sources: Available upon request.

Meanwhile, wild birds have tested positive for HPAI in 18 nations across Europe. While the number of HPAI outbreaks among Europe’s poultry, captive and wild bird populations remains relatively low, new cases have been detected widely across the region over recent weeks.In commercial poultry, total outbreaks have reached 105 so far this year. This is according to the latest update of the Animal Disease Information System from the European Commission (EC; as of February 23). Monitoring the animal disease situation in European Union (EU) member states and neighboring countries, the System has recorded one or more outbreaks so far in 2024 in 15 states. Since the previous update dated February 2, this represents an increase of 37 outbreaks, and first cases of the year appear to have been confirmed in Italy, Northern Ireland, and Norway.So far registering the highest outbreak total is Moldova with 35 for the year to date, followed by Poland (20), and Germany (nine).Of the recently reported outbreaks, 13 were in Poland, five in Moldova, four in Bulgaria and Denmark, three in the Czech Republic (Czechia) and Germany, and two in Slovakia. First farm cases of the year in Italy, Norway, U.K.According to the EC’s System, each of these three countries has recorded its first cases of HPAI in poultry for 2024 over the preceding three weeks. Notifications from the respective veterinary agencies to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) offer further details of the disease situation. The presence of the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype was detected in each case.The outbreak in Italy was confirmed after 50 meat turkeys died suddenly at a farm in the province in Padua in the Veneto region earlier this month. Later, it was reported the affected flock comprised a total of around 37,400 birds.According to the national reference lab for avian influenza IZSVe, this was Italy’s sixth HPAI outbreak of the season, which began in mid-November of 2023.Norway had experienced a 12-month hiatus from HPAI until around 70 birds at a farm in Rogaland county tested positive for an H5 virus earlier this month, according to the WOAH report. Affected was a total of around 18,000 chickens, reported the Norwegian veterinary institute. The birds were kept in two separate houses, and the infection appears to be contained in one of the buildings. That group was culled immediately, but the fate of the remaining birds is not yet reported.While the EC’s System appears to include the first outbreak of 2024 in Northern Ireland, this may be inaccurate. No cases of HPAI in poultry have been reported by the agriculture department there recently. In recent years, the disease situation in the rest of the United Kingdom (U.K.) has not been monitored by the EC System. However, it is possible that the one outbreak recorded by the EC in Northern Ireland was in fact that confirmed on February 12 in the northeast English region of East Yorkshire. According to the WOAH notification, that affected a flock of around 48,000 laying hens. Avian flu developments elsewhere in European poultryOver the past two weeks, Poland has registered HPAI cases at a further nine commercial premises to WOAH. So far this year, 23 outbreaks have been confirmed by the Polish chief veterinary office (up to February 27). Total birds impacted by these outbreaks has passed 529,000.Since the first week of February, eight of the 13 confirmed outbreaks have occurred in the same county — Ilawa – in the northeastern province of Warmia-Masuria. Mainly affected over this period have been meat turkeys and meat ducks.In Bulgaria, the 2024 outbreak total has risen to seven with the confirmation to WOAH of three new affected farms. One of these represents the fifth of the year in the central province of Plovdiv, while the others were the first in Veliko Tarnovo and Dobrich, which are further north and east. Outbreak total in the Czech Republic currently stands at five. Two outbreaks reported to WOAH in the middle of February involved one flock of point-of-lay pullets, and another of broiler breeders. Both were located in the central-southern region of Vysocina. Last week, WOAH received a report from the Danish authorities about country’s fifth outbreak in commercial poultry. Affected was a flock of around 20,000 laying hens in the Zealand region. France makes progress with duck vaccination programThe latest update from the French agriculture ministry puts the number of commercial ducks that have received their first dose of H5N1 HPAI vaccine at more than 18.5 million (as of February 12). All mainland regions of France have now begun vaccination of commercial ducks, according to the national policy.The national authority has recently declared to WOAH that the H5 HPAI situation in poultry has been “resolved.” This declaration follows confirmation of outbreaks at 10 premises since November of last year, but no further cases have been detected since early January. New cases in captive birds recorded in 7 states According to EC System, veterinary agencies of seven European nations have confirmed HPAI cases in this category so far this year. Including non-commercial poultry, zoos, and similar premises, the total has reached 41 (as of February 23). This is an increase of 14 since the edition published 21 days previously. With a total of 20, the Czech Republic has registered the most outbreaks in this category so far, followed by Germany and Ukraine, each with seven. First outbreaks of the year have been recorded by Denmark and Poland, and the Austrian total has risen by one since the previous edition.Further HPAI cases in wild birds across EuropeAs of February 23, 24 European countries have reported HPAI cases in their respective wild bird populations with the EC. This includes first cases of 2024 for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Slovenia.Since the previous update on February 2, the outbreak total has increased by 144 to 289.Of the total, 91 have been reported by Germany, and 56 by Denmark. Each registering between 10 and 20 outbreaks in this population for the year so far were Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden.

What’s notable about this season compared with seasons past, though, is that for the first time, immunizations are available for all 3 major respiratory diseases: influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).1 For some, the pharmacy is the first stop when illness sets in. In order to provide the best care, it’s crucial that pharmacists stay up-to-date on the latest guidance and data for flu, COVID-19, and RSV—even when that information is constantly changing.To help pharmacists rise to the challenge, we’ve collected all of the latest information on vaccines, tests, and treatments in the following reference guide for pharmacists to look back on all respiratory season long.A note about vaccines: According to the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations,2 pharmacists in every state are allowed to administer immunizations; however, the details of that authorization vary by state. Pharmacists should check their state laws for the most up-to-date immunization authority.READ MORE: Respiratory Resource CenterReferences1. Immunization overview for fall and winter 2023-2024. CDC.

North Carolina's flu death toll stands at 266, including at least 12 children.Posted 2023-12-06T18:00:30+00:00 - Updated 2024-02-28T23:51:57+00:00Flu deaths jump by 10, NC has had 266 people die fro mfluBy WRAL staffThe latest data reported Wednesday from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services showed respiratory viruses overall dropped for the fifth consecutive week.COVID-19, influenza and RSV collectively accounted for 10% of all emergency room visits.North Carolina's flu death toll stands at 266, including at least 12 children.COVID-19 accounted for most emergency room visits with 3.8%. That’s down 0.5% compared to last week and down nearly 2% from its peak in December 2023.17.4 million fewer COVID-19 virus particles were found in wastewater. The data is a significant drop from the 80.7 million gene copies from last week’s data.Flu also saw a slight 0.1% decrease overall, now making up roughly 2% of all emergency room visits within the past week.RSV makes up the lowest of all respiratory cases with just 0.4% of all emergency room visits.Across the state, available bed space in pediatric ICUs continues to be an issue.According to the latest data from the North Carolina Pediatric Society Dashboard, combined PICU capacity statewide was 86% full.In the Triangle, WakeMed Children’s PICU capacity was reported to be 100% full. Duke Children’s and UNC Children’s were both reported to be 95% full.WRAL News has reported concerns among physicians regarding the trickle-down effect of capacity strains and delayed procedures.Doctors urge parents to help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses by keeping children home from school when they are sick.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the peak of the season may be over, but people should still be conscientious of these viruses.Dr. Daniel Park, who leads the pediatric emergency department at UNC Medical Center, told WRAL News hospital capacity is still a concern, and we’re not yet out of the woods."The numbers have started to come down, which is encouraging, but we are still experiencing capacity concerns from time to time," Park said.According to Park, one of the easiest ways to slow the spread of these illnesses is keeping children at home if they have a fever. Children should be fever-free for at least 24 hours before you send them back to school.North Carolina's flu season runs from October until May. In late January, Dr. Cameron Wolfe, infectious disease specialist at Duke Health, said the hospitals shared a word of caution with North Carolinians."I want to be cautious and say we’re not out of the woods yet but certainly less busy than it was a fortnight ago," Wolfe said. "Suddenly you get this wash of respiratory viral infections ... surgeries get delayed, ED admissions get delayed, people can’t get out to their nursing homes and rehabs as quickly. All of those things, unfortunately, take place in the middle of winter, and I think we’re starting to see that just start to relax a little bit, which is great news.”How do NC flu numbers compare to previous years?WRAL data trackers looked back at five years of pre-COVID flu data and determined the average number of deaths per flu season in North Carolina is 211. Historically, the majority of deaths occur late in the season, in February or March."It’s very typical for us to get a light rise in influenza-B cases that can sometimes be as late as March or even April," Wolfe said. "So I don’t think we’re through all of that yet by any means."The rise in flu deaths comes as the CDC reports flu vaccinations are the lowest in the last five years."Demand has slightly decreased for the flu and COVID vaccines, but demand has remained steady for the RSV and pneumonia vaccines," said CVS Regional Director Gaurang TrivediThe demand for COVID-19 vaccines is greatest in the 65 and older age group.Why you shouldn’t postpone your flu vaccinePark said there have been high rates of children with respiratory illnesses like RSV and the flu in hospitals.Hospital's visitation precautions ask for children experiencing active symptoms to not come to the hospital unless they are experiencing worsen symptoms such as difficulty breathing and high fever.Comparing flu, COVID, cold and RSV: Understanding the differences and how to protect yourselfIs it flu or COVID-19?According to the CDC, you can’t tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by the symptoms alone. Specific testing is needed to tell what the illness is and confirm a diagnosis.CDC guidance states that influenza, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines can all be given at the same time to eligible people.When to see a doctorAccording to the Mayo Clinic, most common cold symptoms can be treated at home with rest and over-the-counter medicine.Adults should see their doctor if they experience any of the following:Symptoms that get worse or do not get betterFever greater than 101.3 degrees that lasts more than three daysFever returning after a fever-free periodShortness of breathWheezingIntense sore throat, headache or sinus painChildren should see a doctor if they experience:Fever of 100.4 degrees in newborns up to 12 weeks.Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any ageMore-intense symptoms, such as headache, throat pain or coughTrouble with breathing or wheezingEar painFussiness or drowsiness that isn't typicalNo interest in eatingMore On This watch · 0:32Flu deaths jump by 10, NC has had 266 people die fro mflunull MINS AGO watch · 1:24Triangle hospitals report fewer COVID, flu, RSV patientsnull MINS AGOrelatedrsvcoronavirusflucoronavirus vaccinevaccinationTrending No. 9 NC State falls in Final Four rematch vs. No. 1 South Carolina Raleigh children's store hit by truck, shoppers thankful to be unharmed57 MINS AGO Two high-speed chases and stolen cars lead to arrest in Wake and Durham counties29 MINS AGO Pineiro's 36-yard field goal in OT lifts Panthers to 20-17 win over Giants in Germany Duke rises to No. 6, UNC falls to No. 10 in AP Top 25 pollVideos watch · 2:07WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch · 1:27Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 58 MINS AGO watch · 1:01Powerball Drawing30 MINS AGO watch · 1:21Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch · 1:05:14President Biden and VP Harris participate in Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony•CreditsGrace HaybaReporterCopyright 2024 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: The 2023-24 formula COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are about 50% effective at preventing severe disease. The pace and frequency of new COVID-19 variants underscores the need for monitoring of vaccine effectiveness. The latest COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk for hospitalization or visits to an ED or urgent care by around 50%, according to interim data published in MMWR. This season’s influenza vaccines were similarly protective against hospitalization among children and adults, early estimates published in MMWR showed. Data derived from DeCuir J, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2024;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7308a5. The updated, monovalent COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the CDC in September target omicron XBB subvariants of SARS-CoV-2. “Although studies have found that updated COVID-19 vaccines elicit broadly cross-protective neutralizing antibodies, including against XBB lineages and JN.1” — currently the predominant omicron lineage — “the pace and frequency with which new SARS-CoV-2 lineages have displaced predecessors underscores the need for ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and for periodic COVID-19 antigen updates,” Jennifer DeCuir, MD, PhD, from the CDC’s Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Diseases Division, and colleagues wrote in MMWR. DeCuir and colleagues analyzed data on 128,825 people who had a medical encounter (ME) or were hospitalized for COVID-19 at one of 369 EDs and 229 hospitals in eight states in the Methods for Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses Network (VISION). Of these, 17,229 received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and 111,569 received a negative test. Among VISION MEs and hospitalizations, 8% of people with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had received an updated COVID-19 vaccine and 12% of people with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test had received the updated vaccine. Overall, VE against COVID-19-associated ME or hospitalization was 51% (95% CI = 47%-54%) in the first 7 to 59 days after receiving an updated vaccine dose and 39% (95% CI = 33%-45%) in the 60 to 119 days after an updated vaccine dose. Another study published in MMWR showed that the 2023-2024 influenza vaccines have VEs that are relatively similar to previous vaccines. “These interim estimates indicate that receipt of a 2023-2024 influenza vaccination reduced the risk for medically attended influenza-associated outpatient visits and hospitalization among children and adolescents and among adults, including those older than age 65 years, consistent with results from previous years,” Aaron M. Frutos, PhD, from the CDC’s Influenza Division, and colleagues wrote. Frutos and colleagues analyzed data from four CDC-affiliated VE networks of health care facilities in 22 states on people who received outpatient medical care or were hospitalized for acute respiratory illness (ARI). It was the first time that interim influenza VE data were available at the same time for both adults and children from four different vaccine effectiveness networks. They estimated that interim VE against any influenza-associated ARI among adults ranged from 33% to 49% in outpatient settings and 41% to 44% against influenza-associated hospitalization. Among children, interim VE against influenza was 59% to 61% in outpatient settings and 52% to 61% against influenza-associated hospitalization. A second study of 2023-2024 influenza vaccine effectiveness by Sophie Zhu, PhD, an investigator in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, and colleagues found similar VE rates based on nearly 680,000 people in California who had an influenza test between Oct. 1, 2023, and Jan. 31, 2024. Zhu and colleagues found that 28% of people who received an influenza test had received an influenza vaccine, including 18% of people who tested positive and 29% of people who tested negative. Overall, they found that adjusted VE was 45% against receiving a positive influenza test, with VE highest among people aged younger than 18 years at 56%, and that it declined among older age groups — 48% among adults aged 18 to 49 years, 36% among people aged 50 to 64 years and 30% among people aged older than 65 years.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News Study Shows ‘Long Flu’ Is Real, but Long COVID Is Worse By Claire Bugos Published on February 27, 2024 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Photo Illustration by Amelia Manley for Verywell Health; Getty Images Close Key Takeaways People with serious cases of both flu and COVID can experience symptoms throughout their body for months to years after the acute illness has resolved, according to a study.People hospitalized with COVID had a greater burden of disease, disability, and death than those with severe flu infections. Rather than trivialize a COVID infection by comparing it to flu, experts say that the public should recognize the serious risk of lingering complications of both diseases. Four years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s a general sentiment that COVID has become just like the flu. This raises a question: if some people develop long COVID after the acute infection goes away, do some people experience long-term flu, too? To compare the long-term consequences of seasonal influenza and COVID, researchers tracked people hospitalized with either illness over 18 months. They found that both illnesses often left people with lingering health problems that can last for months or years. Influenza has been around for a very long time, but there’s been little attention paid to the symptoms of the illness that linger long after the initial infection is gone, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, senior author of the study and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. “The whole narrative is that COVID is like the flu, as if the flu is some benign entity,” Al-Aly said. But the flu kills between 30,000 and 70,000 Americans each year. “Let’s not trivialize this infection,” he added. Overall, the study participants with long COVID fared worse, with a higher risk of death and likelihood of disability in the long run. People hospitalized with the flu also had long-term, negative health impacts, especially in their lungs and airways. “My biggest frustration these days is this strange cognitive disconnect where someone will say that now COVID may be similar to influenza in its morbidity and mortality. That is merely to say that now you have at least two really bad viruses, as opposed to saying now we’re okay,” said Marc Sala, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist and co-director of the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive COVID-19 Center, who wasn't involved with the study. How Bad Can the Flu Be? Making Sense of Long Flu and Long COVID “Long flu,” like long COVID, is a catch-all term used to describe the long-term effects of a flu infection. Al-Aly said this term is rarely used because the long-term outcomes of flu are typically overlooked. “Because we all lived under the assumption that you get the flu, you get over it,” he said. The long-term manifestations of the illness tend to come in the form of lingering respiratory problems, like lung fibrosis or shortness of breath. While the latest research iterates the seriousness of a flu infection, it also indicates that COVID can wreak havoc in the body in even more severe and sustained ways than the flu does. What Should We Expect From Long COVID Treatment? The study included more than 81,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 between 2020 and 2022 and nearly 11,000 with seasonal influenza between 2015 and 2019. Researchers examined 94 potential long-term health outcomes for each disease. People with COVID were more likely to experience 64 of those outcomes, while the flu was associated with six. Those with COVID had a higher risk of various health complications, such as heart conditions, blood clotting, blood disorders, impaired kidney function, musculoskeletal problems, and neurological effects. The death rate was also greater in the COVID groups. People hospitalized with COVID were also more likely to experience disability because of their illness—they lost, on average, 2.8 years of healthy life per person. “To my eyes, studying post-viral complications is more important than ever,” Sala said. “For some reason, we’re seeing more people with long COVID now than we’ve ever seen with people describing long flu historically, and I think it is worth understanding why.” Unlike the flu, which is a “bona fide respiratory illness,” in Al-Aly’s words, COVID is a multisystemic illness. Though COVID takes hold in and causes harm to the respiratory tract, it tends to affect multiple organ systems throughout the body, especially in its post-acute phase. Sala said that continuing to categorize COVID as a respiratory disease remains useful for the majority of people who only get mild illnesses. “I think it’s still very helpful to frame it as a respiratory pathogen, though, simply because that is its mode of transmission and the vast majority of the symptoms in people who don’t have long COVID tend to be sniffles and cough,” he said. Flu Tests: Who Should Test and When? Future Research on Long Flu and Long COVID The new study only focused on people hospitalized with COVID or flu. Sala said that most people experience mild illness, and the findings from this study don’t pertain to them. Besides, as COVID variants evolve, they tend to become more transmissible but less likely to cause people to get really sick. The researchers could conduct such a large study by using data from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S. The downside is the demographics of that group: about 95% of the participants in this study were men, and most were White and older. Al-Aly said the analysis was adjusted for these variables and that VA data has historically been generalizable to the U.S. population. However, Sala said that younger women—the group most likely to experience long COVID—is largely absent from the VA data and ought to be a focus of future research. The two experts agreed it’s important to continue studying the long-term effects of both diseases in people with mild and severe infections. “We normalized a lot of risks in this pandemic. We normalized death, disability, and suffering to a very large extent,” Al-Aly said. “I don’t think we should trivialize acute infections and treat them as inconsequential because in some people, they may be actually hugely consequential and leave them with chronic disability and disease.” Long Colds vs. Long COVID: Here's What Researchers Know So Far What This Means For You The best way to avoid long flu and long COVID is to get vaccinated for both and to minimize your exposure to people who are sick. 1 Source Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Tags influenzavaccinesviruses University University at Buffalo Researchers are developing a new recombinant flu vaccine that has the potential to compete with existing vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines, like the Novavax vaccine used to fight COVID-19, offer several advantages over conventional vaccines. They’re easy to precisely produce. They’re safe, and potentially more effective. And they could require smaller doses. Because of these traits, there is much interest in developing recombinant influenza vaccines. To date, however, the Food and Drug Administration has approved only one such vaccine. The researchers at the University at Buffalo hope to add to that number. “Because of the variable nature of the viruses that cause influenza, current vaccines are not optimally effective among the overall population,” says Jonathan Lovell, professor in the biomedical engineering department at the University at Buffalo and senior coauthor of the study in the journal Cell Reports. “We believe our vaccine candidate has the potential to improve upon this by inducing stronger and broader immunity, and reducing the likelihood of illness and death.” Conventional flu vaccines contain either deactivated microbes that cause influenza, or they are based on weakened forms of the disease. They are made using fertilized chicken eggs or, less commonly, through cell culture-based production. The vaccine the research team is developing is based on a nanoliposome—a tiny spherical sac—that Lovell and colleagues created called cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid, or CoPoP. The CoPoP platform enables immune response promoting proteins to be displayed on the surface of the nanoliposome, resulting in potent vaccine efficacy. Alone, these nanoliposomes do not fight disease. But when combined with recombinant influenza proteins that can be generated based on genetic information from viruses, they enhance the immune system’s response to disease. In the new study, the team attached to the nanoliposome a total of six proteins—three each from two different protein groups, hemagglutinins and neuraminidases. They also added two adjuvants (PHAD and QS21) to boost immune response. Researchers evaluated the resulting “hexaplex” nanoliposome in animal models with three common flu strains: H1N1, H3N2, and type B. Even when administered in low doses, the hexaplex nanoliposome provided superior protection and survival from H1 and N1 when compared to Flublok, which is the sole licensed recombinant influenza vaccine in the US, and Fluaid, an egg-based vaccine. Tests showed comparable levels of protection against H3N2 and type B viruses. The tests were performed via vaccination and through blood serum transfer from vaccinated mice into non-vaccinated mice. “The combination of the two groups of proteins led to synergistic effects. In particular, the adjuvanted nanoliposomes excelled in the production of functional antibodies and the activation of T cells, which are critical to fighting off serious infection of the flu,” says lead author Zachary Sia, a PhD candidate in Lovell’s lab. Bruce Davidson, a research associate professor of anesthesiology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, is a senior coauthor of the study. He says “using not only hemagglutinin but also neuraminidase antigens to create vaccines is important because it translates into broader immunity and companies will be able to create more doses with less materials. That’s critical for not only the flu but also potential outbreaks like what we saw with COVID-19. There is still much work to be done in fully testing and validating this flu technology, but at this point these early results are quite promising.” Additional coauthors are from the University at Buffalo and McGill University. While not part of this study, the CoPoP vaccine platform underwent phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials in South Korea and the Philippines as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. This is a partnership between UB spinoff company POP Biotechnologies, cofounded by Lovell, and South Korean biotech company EuBiologics. The researchers have filed patents with The Research Foundation for the State University of New York. Lovell and coauthor Wei-Chiao Huang, postdoctoral scholar in Lovell’s lab, are employed by POP Biotechnologies. The National Institutes of Health funded the work.

The flu could devastate animal populations across Antarctica and possibly make it to Australia.The arrival of a devastating strain of avian influenza, which has killed millions of animals globally, to the Antarctic mainland makes Australia the last continent free of the virus.The highly-contagious strain of bird flu, known as H5N1, was confirmed over the weekend in two brown skua, which are large seabirds that prey on fish, small mammals and other birds like penguin chicks.Scientists from Spanish National Research Council tested the two dead birds, which were collected by Argentine researchers in early February.The brown skua is a large seabird which hunts live prey and scavenges carrion. (Steve B, Brown Skua, CC0 1.0 DEED)The birds were found near Argentina's Primavera Base, which is on the western side of Antarctica, close to South America.While avian influenza had previously been detected on islands between South America and Antarctica, this is the first confirmed detection on the mainland.Scientists expected the flu to reach Antarctica's mainland this year or next, and are concerned it could lead to the deaths of thousands of the frozen land's unique animal species.Here's five quick things to know about the virus and its likelihood of getting to Australia.What is H5N1?Different types of bird flu have been around as long as we've had birds.Sometimes the viruses are not all that deadly and do not spread far.But there are also strains of high-pathogenicity avian influenza, which can do a lot more damage.In 1996 a strain of the flu, known as H5N1, was first detected in a goose in Guangdong, China.This virus was able to kill domestic chicken flocks within a matter of days.The strain was a precursor to the current outbreak known as H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, which started in Europe in 2020 when gene-swapping of the virus between wild and domestic birds created an even deadlier version.Just how deadly is it?That strain made its way to the shores of North America in 2021 thanks to trans-Atlantic migration pathways for shorebirds.Since then some 81 million domestic birds have been killed or euthanised because of the virus.The number of wild birds around the world that have succumbed to the disease is unknown, but it is believed to be in the millions.H5N1 spread quickly around the rest of the world and rapidly made its way down the South America coastline to the subantarctic region at South Georgia and the Falkland Islands.So far Oceania, including Australia and New Zealand, has remained free of the virus.The outbreak has been called a panzootic, which is like an animal version of a pandemic with a worldwide spread of an infectious disease.About 600,000 wild birds died in South America between October, 2022, when the virus was first detected on the continent, up to November last year.The hardest hit species were cormorants and Peruvian boobies with a combined 504,000 deaths.The virus has also killed different species of mammals around the world.In South America, at least 50,000 mammals have died, most of these were sea lions.At the other end of the world, the virus has affected mammals in the Arctic region and was recently found in a dead polar bear.Avian influenza was detected in a dead polar bear from the Arctic region last month. (National Park Service, Polar Bears, PDM 1.0 DEED)Since 2020 there have been 26 cases of the virus in humans who have been infected by birds in Asia, Europe and the Americas.Most recently there were four cases of the virus in people detected in Cambodia.What happens now the virus is Antarctica?The detection of bird flu in the skuas potentially signals a serious event that could wipe out whole colonies of Antarctica's unique wildlife.Australian Antarctic Division seabird ecologist Dr Louise Emerson recently visited the southern continent and subantarctic islands before the detection of avian flu at Primavera Base.She said the concern about the virus being in Antarctica was because so many species from penguins to seals aggregated in large colonies."Which provides opportunity for the virus to spread between individuals," Dr Emerson said.Antarctic fur seals are at risk of infection from avian influenza. (Australian Antarctic Division: Evelyn Sandoval)A recent study found about 70 per cent of elephant seal pups born at a high-density breeding site in Argentina last year died from bird flu.Dr Emerson said there were a lot of unknowns about what the virus would do in Antarctica and she hoped the harsh weather conditions would hinder the spread of the virus.She also hoped the spread to East Antarctica, where Australia's research bases are, was slowed by the distance from West Antarctica."There's a lot we just don't know at the moment," Dr Emerson said."We don't know how the virus will cope with dry and cold Antarctic conditions ... we don't know how close birds need to be to spread."Scientists are concerned about mass animal mortality events in Antarctica because of how bird flu might spread in close-knit colonies. (Eli Duke, Emperor Penguins, CC BY-SA 2.0 DEED)But University of Melbourne microbiologist Dr Michelle Wille believes the virus will cope well in Antarctic conditions.Dr Wille is part of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research's wildlife health network and helps keep a database of avian influenza cases in the region."We know that [other] low pathogenic avian viruses are present in Antarctica," she said."If those viruses can survive fine, I'd suspect this one will do just fine."How could it get to Australia?Spread of avian influenza from Antarctica is one of three possible scenarios of how the virus could get to Australia suggested by the international expert group OFFLU, which provides animal influenza advice to the World Health Organization.The transmission of the disease from Antarctica is seen as the least likely way for the virus to spread to Australia, although there is a great deal of uncertainty because of a lack of tracking data.OFFLU considered two possibilities for a spread from Antarctica.First, a long-distance flying seabird, like the northern petrel or albatross, could make its way from a subantarctic island near South America to New Zealand.An albatross could make the trip in just under six days and still be infectious when they arrive.A wandering albatross could possibly carry the virus from subantarctic islands to New Zealand. (JJ Harrison, wandering albatross, CC BY-SA 3.0 DEED)The second possibility could happen once the virus reached East Antarctica.OFFLU suggested it could be possible for short-tailed shearwaters, which breed in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, to be exposed to the virus from other animals while foraging in the polar region for food.Dr Wille said the spread of the virus from Antarctica to Australia was plausible, but not as likely as the spread by shorebirds making annual migrations south using the East Asian-Australasian flyway.Migratory birds fly south from Siberia and Alaska every year to countries including Australia. (Supplied: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Millions of birds use the flyway travelling from breeding grounds in places like Siberia and Alaska through Asia before arriving in Australia from about September. The other most likely scenario would be the spread of the virus from waterfowl in the Papuan region.How prepared is Australia for the virus?If the virus reached Australia it could bring mass death for birds and other species.Not only would poultry and egg industries be under pressure, but so too would wildlife with the potential for species like black swans to be wiped out.Dr Wille and Deakin University ecology chair Marcel Klaassen have been testing migratory shorebirds that arrive in Australia each year.Black swans could be completely wiped out by the arrival of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain to Australia. (Ellie RH, black swan, CC BY-SA 4.0 DEED)Their latest season of testing which finished in December took them all over the country from west to east."All the migratory birds from the north have arrived now in Australia," Professor Klaassen said."None of those that we looked at had any signs of an infection or a past infection."Testing of wild birds will continue next migration season and there is also ongoing testing of suspicious bird deaths in the different states and territories.ABC Science on YouTubeWant more science — plus health, environment, tech and more?

(Spectrum News/Maria Serrano) Pair of swans at Lake Eola died of bird flu, Orlando officials say By Maria Serrano Orange County PUBLISHED 6:23 PM ET Feb. 28, 2024 PUBLISHED 6:23 PM EST Feb. 28, 2024 SHARE ORLANDO, Fla. â Over the last two weeks, workers with the city of Orlando have found several dead birds near Lake Eola. Just this week, officials found two dead swans that tested positive for avian influenza, also known as bird flu. What You Need To Know Officials with the city of Orlando recently found a pair of dead swans at Lake Eola that tested positive for avian influenza, also known as bird flu They say that due to the discovery, itâs important for visitors to take precautions while at Lake Eola Experts say that the avian influenza is fatal for most birds that catch it The city is now placing signage throughout Lake Eola, temporarily removed food from bird feeders and reached out to residents and business owners to let them know to let them know to take precautions while visiting Lake Eola. Samantha Little, a raptor conservation specialist at Audubon Center for Birds of Prey, said like the seasonality with the flu virus that humans catch, the bird variety of influenza has some seasonality to it too. She said that some years are worse than others. âIt has been around in Florida since last year, so weâve been dealing with it with some of our patients,â said Little. âIn general, itâs always something that were concerned of, because it is something that causes high mortality so birds die from it.â She said not many birds survive after contracting the bird flu. âWe have had a few that have pulled through,â said Little. âItâs whether or not they can walk and stand and maneuver to be able to be released once they recover.â To limit the spread of the illness, the city of Orlando has disinfected multiple surfaces around Lake Eola and will continue to do so. The city has also advised its staff to wash their shoes, uniforms and equipment. Little also recommended precautions for private citizens who have birds on their property. âIf you have chickens at home or if you have birds, make sure you have different shoes that youâre keeping at home versus those that youâre going out and walking with,â she said. In a statement to Spectrum News, the city of Orlando said, in part: âA top priority of the city is the safety and well-being of our residents, staff and the preservation of local wildlife. As outlined by the CDC, avian influenza can be transmitted to humans, although it is extremely rare with only one case reported in the U.S., since 2022.â The city's statement also said that based on the size of the park and the bird population, experts believe the avian influenza will run its course as some birds may build immunity, and estimate it will be a month before infections dissipate. Park goers are advised to avoid direct contact with birds and bird excrement at Lake Eola Park â a recommendation that applies to pets, as well.

In a lengthy background document, the agency laid out its rationale for consolidating COVID-19 guidance into general guidance for respiratory viruses—including influenza, RSV, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and others, though specifically not measles. The agency also noted the guidance does not apply to health care settings and outbreak scenarios. "COVID-19 remains an important public health threat, but it is no longer the emergency that it once was, and its health impacts increasingly resemble those of other respiratory viral illnesses, including influenza and RSV," the agency wrote. The most notable change in the new guidance is the previously reported decision to no longer recommend a minimum five-day isolation period for those infected with the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Instead, the new isolation guidance is based on symptoms, which matches long-standing isolation guidance for other respiratory viruses, including influenza. "The updated Respiratory Virus Guidance recommends people with respiratory virus symptoms that are not better explained by another cause stay home and away from others until at least 24 hours after both resolution of fever AND overall symptom are getting better," the document states. "This recommendation addresses the period of greatest infectiousness and highest viral load for most people, which is typically in the first few days of illness and when symptoms, including fever, are worst." “Residual risk” The CDC acknowledged that the eased isolation guidance will create "residual risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission," and that most people are no longer infectious only after 8 to 10 days. As such, the agency urged people to follow additional interventions—including masking, testing, distancing, hygiene, and improving air quality—for five additional days after their isolation period. "Today’s announcement reflects the progress we have made in protecting against severe illness from COVID-19," CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said in a statement. "However, we still must use the commonsense solutions we know work to protect ourselves and others from serious illness from respiratory viruses—this includes vaccination, treatment, and staying home when we get sick." Overall, the agency argued that a shorter isolation period would be inconsequential. Other countries and states that have similarly abandoned fixed isolation times did not see jumps in COVID-19 emergency department visits or hospitalizations, the CDC pointed out. And most people who have COVID-19 don't know they have it anyway, making COVID-19-specific guidance moot, the agency argued. In a recent CDC survey, fewer than half of the people surveyed said they would test for SARS-CoV-2 if they had a cough or cold symptoms, and fewer than 10 percent said they would go to a pharmacy or health care provider to get tested. Meanwhile, "The overall sensitivity of COVID-19 antigen tests is relatively low and even lower in individuals with only mild symptoms," the agency said. The CDC also raised practical concerns for isolation, including a lack of paid sick leave for many, social isolation, and "societal costs." The points are likely to land poorly with critics. “The CDC is again prioritizing short-term business interests over our health by caving to employer pressure on COVID guidelines. This is a pattern we’ve seen throughout the pandemic,” Lara Jirmanus, Clinical Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in a press release last month after the news first broke of the CDC's planned isolation update. Jirmanus is a member of the People's CDC, a group that advocates for more aggressive COVID-19 policies, which put out the press release. Another member of the group, Sam Friedman, a professor of population health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, also blasted the CDC's stance last month. The guidance will "make workplaces and public spaces even more unsafe for everyone, particularly for people who are high-risk for COVID complications," he said. COVID and flu But, the CDC argues that the threat of COVID-19 is fading. Hospitalizations, deaths, prevalence of long COVID, and COVID-19 complications in children (MIS-C) are all down. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe disease, death, and to some extent, long COVID—we just need more people to get them. Over 95 percent of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the 2023–2024 respiratory season had no record of receiving the seasonal booster dose, the agency noted. Only 22 percent of adults got the latest shot, including only 42 percent of people ages 65 and older. By contrast, 48 percent of adults got the latest flu shot, including 73 percent of people ages 65 and older. But even with the crummy vaccination rates for COVID-19, a mix of past infection and shots has led to substantial protection levels in the overall population. The CDC even went as far as arguing that COVID-19 deaths have fallen to a level that is similar to what's seen with flu. "Reported deaths involving COVID-19 are several-fold greater than those reported to involve influenza and RSV. However, influenza and likely RSV are often underreported as causes of death," the CDC said. In the 2022–2023 respiratory virus season, there were nearly 90,000 reported COVID-19 deaths. For flu, there were 9,559 reported deaths, but the CDC estimates the true number to be between 18,000 and 97,000. In the current season, there have been 32,949 reported COVID-19 deaths to date and 5,854 reported flu deaths, but the agency estimates the real flu deaths are between 17,000 and 50,000. "Total COVID-19 deaths, accounting for underreporting, are likely to be higher than, but of the same order of magnitude as, total influenza deaths," the agency concluded. In all, the CDC was ready to fold SARS-CoV-2 into the gang of common seasonal respiratory viruses, with most cases mild and undiagnosed. "Viruses cause most acute respiratory illnesses, but it is rarely possible to determine the type of virus without testing, and oftentimes testing does not change clinical management," the agency wrote.

Ad ChoicesConfirmed: Dead Ducks At Lake Have Avian Flu - TribPapers Civic Community Culture Arts Sports Business Inspirational Commentary Obits Submit Legals View Legals TribPapers Home Delivery Newsletter TribPapers Home Delivery Newsletter Advertising Community Confirmed: Dead Ducks At Lake Have Avian Flu Clint ParkerFebruary 25, 2024 Ducks at lake Louise might have Avian Flu. Photo by Clint Parker. Weaverville – The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission District Biologist recently announced the detection of Avian Influenza (Flu) in two ducks found deceased at Lake Louise in Weaverville, triggering worries among both the local populace and officials. This development, communicated through a town press release, has heightened awareness and concern regarding the potential implications of the disease’s presence in the local wildlife population. The confirmation of Avian Flu in these waterfowl has underscored the importance of vigilance and preventive measures to mitigate any possible spread of the virus, reflecting the seriousness with which local authorities are approaching the situation. Last month, the Tribune reported that residents were concerned with the number of deceased ducks at the lake. Weaverville Town Manager Selena Coffey told the Tribune last month it was more than likely people feeding the ducks, which is against the town ordinance, but that dead duck had been sent off for testing. The ducks, found on January 26 and subsequently sent for testing, tested positive for the avian flu virus, prompting District Biologist Justin McVey to issue a cautionary advisory. McVey highlighted the important distinction that, despite Avian Flu’s presence in infected waterfowl and water sources, it does not pose an immediate threat to human health. However, he voiced a strong caution regarding the significant danger it presents to domestic poultry populations, encompassing not only commercial operations but also backyard flocks and various other waterfowl species. He pointed out the particularly alarming aspect of the disease—its potential to be fatal for poultry that contract it. This underlines the critical need for vigilance and proactive measures to prevent the spread of the Avian Flu within these vulnerable bird populations, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the poultry industry at large. The discovery of Avian Influenza in waterfowl, while alarming, aligns with expectations within the scientific and agricultural communities. McVey elucidated that it’s not uncommon for infected birds to show no outward symptoms of the illness, effectively making them silent carriers of the virus. These carriers have the potential to spread the disease to new locations. This transmission occurs through the excretion of fecal matter or oral discharges, especially during their migration periods. Such a mode of dissemination underscores the challenges in tracking and controlling the spread of Avian Influenza, as these asymptomatic carriers can introduce the virus to previously unaffected areas and populations, posing a significant risk to both wild and domestic bird species. For those seeking additional information and guidance on Avian Influenza, the USDA APHIS website offers comprehensive resources and guidance at the QR code below. In light of these developments, the public is strongly advised against handling wild birds suspected of carrying Avian Influenza. Instead, individuals encountering sick waterfowl or domestic poultry are urged to promptly report their observations to the North Carolina Wildlife Helpline at (866) 318-2401, available Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm, or via email at HWI@ncwildlife.org. Any instances of sick or dying captive birds should also be reported to local veterinarians, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Science (NCDA&CS) Veterinary Division at (919) 707-3250, or the North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System at (919) 733-3986. Such proactive measures are essential in containing the spread of Avian Influenza and safeguarding both wildlife and domestic poultry populations from its adverse effects.

A skua in Antarctica for representation: iStockHimanshu NitnawarePublished on: 27 Feb 2024, 4:20 amCopiedHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has infected bird populations in mainland Antarctica for the first time, threatening penguin populations.Scientists from Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Centre of the Higher Council for Scientific Research, Spain have confirmed the presence of H5N1 virus causing the bird flu among two dead skuas from Primavera, the Antarctic base of Argentinian scientific research station located on the Antarctic Peninsula.Another confirmed case of a wandering albatross has also been reported, but on Bird Island in the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Read more: First cases of avian flu found in Antarctic regionThe confirmation came on February 24, 2024 after the samples were collected earlier this month and analysed. Other suspected cases of fur seals, Antarctic fur seal, south polar skua and kelp gull have been reported from Rosita, Stromness, Bahia Esperanza or Hope Bay, according to Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.A statement from the Spanish government read, “Analysis has conclusively shown that the birds were infected with the H5 subtype of avian influenza and at least one of the dead birds contained the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.”These analyses consisted of specific PCRs for the influenza virus and the H5 subtype, followed by sequencing of the protease cutting region, which defines with 100 per cent certainty the presence of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus.The discovery shows that the avian flu has reached the mainland region despite the vast distances and natural barriers that separate it from other continents, the scientists noted.Read more: Surging bird flu cases may increase human infection risk, warn UN agencies & WOAH“This finding could also explain the bird deaths recorded during the Antarctic summer,” the scientists said.Earlier in January, HPAI was also reported in polar bears, confirming the presence of the virus in the Arctic. The polar bear is suspected to have fed on an infected carcass of a bird. The HPAI clade H5N1 2.3. 4.4b has infected and killed millions of birds across continents since 2021. The presence of the variant has been confirmed in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In South America alone, more than 500,000 seabirds, including penguins, pelicans and boobies, have died. A preprint research paper released in November 2023 anticipated the fears of the virus reaching the mainland region and thereby raising concerns of mass mortality among isolated but densely populated penguin colonies.

The internationally renowned expert in vaccine development comes to Vienna from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (USA). His work will alternate between the two institutions. Florian Krammer is Professor of Vaccinology in the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. His laboratory investigates antibody responses to RNA viruses. The main focus is on influenza viruses, but antibody responses to coronaviruses, hantaviruses, filoviruses and other emerging RNA viruses are also of interest. In their studies, the researchers want to elucidate the mechanisms by which these antibodies protect the host from viral infection and disease. The aim is to translate these findings into novel vaccines and therapeutics, and a universal influenza virus vaccine developed by Florian Krammer and his team is currently in clinical development. Florian Krammer's focus in Vienna will be on characterising viral pathogens and developing vaccines and therapies against them with special emphasis on viruses with pandemic potential, also from a local, Austrian perspective. In addition, his research will include human respiratory viruses such as human influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. "I am delighted to welcome Florian Krammer to MedUni Vienna," explains Rector Markus Müller in a statement, "his expertise in the field of infection medicine will make a significant contribution to research in this important area. We look forward to benefiting from his expertise and experience and working together to further advance medical research." About the person Florian Krammer studied biotechnology at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna. His dissertation focussed on glycoproteins and influenza viruses. Since 2010, Krammer has been researching universal influenza vaccines and vaccines against corona, Lassa, Hanta and Ebola viruses at the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine a Mount Sinai. Since 2019, he has been the endowed Mount Sinai Professor in Vaccinology and Principal Investigator of the Sinai-Emory Multi-Institutional Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centre (SEM-CIVIC). The goal of SEM-CIVIC is to develop improved seasonal and universal influenza virus vaccines that provide long-lasting protection against seasonal, zoonotic and future pandemic influenza viruses. Krammer is also co-director of the Centre for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Preparedness (C-VaRPP). The Krammer lab - which is also part of the NIH-funded Centre of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) - focuses on understanding broadly protective immune responses against the surface glycoproteins of RNA viruses such as influenza virus with the aim of developing better vaccines and new therapeutics. Florian Krammer has published more than 400 papers, is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Virology, Plos One, Plos Pathogens and Vaccine, is an elected member of the American Academy of Microbiology and the Henry Kunkel Society, sits on the Board of Directors of the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza (ESWI) and is one of the chairs of the SAVE initiative which is monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants for the US National Institutes of Health.

NIAID/Flickr cc In a press release, the company said vaccine efficacy against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, defined by three or more symptoms, after season two was 77.8% (95.0% confidence interval [CI], 51.4% to 91.1%). For comparison, vaccine efficacy after season one was 88.9% (95% CI, 53.6% to 98.7%). Efficacy was consistent across the seasons for both RSV A and RSV B strains. Researchers also saw sustained efficacy against less severe symptoms: 65.1% after season one and 55.7% after season two. No new adverse events were reported through the second season. Durable protection against 2 strains Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, senior vice president and chief scientific officer of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said the company is encouraged by the level of protection after two full RSV seasons. "This new data indicate that broad and durable protection against both types of RSV that cause disease, RSV A and RSV B, is the potential benefit to having a bivalent vaccine." Broad and durable protection against both types of RSV that cause disease, RSV A and RSV B, is the potential benefit to having a bivalent vaccine. The company said it will submit the data to regulatory authorities and vaccine technical committees and will publish the findings in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Abrysvo for people ages 60 and older in May 2023, and the following month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Abrysvo and the RSV vaccine made by GSK (Arexvy) for adults ages 60 and older based on shared clinical decision making with health providers. In September, the CDC recommended that pregnant women receive Abrysvo as a strategy to protect newborns from RSV. CDC midseason estimate shows moderate protection for flu vaccines News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza Vaccines Interim estimates for how well this year's flu vaccines protected against medically attended flulike illness showed moderate vaccine effectiveness (VE) overall, with higher levels in children than in adults, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their state health partners reported today in the latest edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Prathan Chorruangsak/iStock The data come from four networks that the CDC uses to track vaccine effectiveness, which cover patients in 22 states. This is the first year that pediatric and adult VE estimates from the four networks have been presented together. The study did not measure how VE waned after vaccination. For adults, VE against flu diagnosed in outpatient settings ranged from 33% to 49% and against flu hospitalization ranged from 41% to 44%. For the pediatric age-group, VE for flu detected in outpatient settings was 59% to 67% and against flu-linked hospitalization was 52% to 61%. "These findings demonstrate that the 2023–24 seasonal influenza vaccine is effective at reducing the risk for medically attended influenza virus infection," the group wrote, noting that the interim results were consistent with findings from previous years. The vaccines were effective against both influenza A, which has mainly been the 2009 H1N1 strain this season, and influenza B, similar to recent estimates from Canada and Europe. For seniors, a group at higher risk for flu complications, VE was similar to adults ages 18 to 64 years old. The CDC noted that flu vaccine coverage has been lower this season than last season and is even lower than prepandemic uptake. California estimate also finds moderate protection In a separate report in the same MMWR issue, an analysis of surveillance data from California found that flu vaccines so far this season have provided moderate protection against lab-confirmed flu across all age-groups. Overall, VE was 45%, highest in children younger than 18 years old. VE declined with age and was 30% in adults ages 65 and older. Most pet dog diarrhea contains multidrug-resistant E coli, study finds News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics E coli Antimicrobial Stewardship Daniela Bermudez / Flickr cc A Chinese study published yesterday in PLOS One finds that more than half of the isolates from pet dogs diarrhea contained multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, which the researchers say may pose a threat to both animal and human health. Researchers from Sichuan Agricultural University evaluated the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in 135 E coli isolates from the dogs using the disc-diffusion method. They also screened for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence-associated genes (VAGs), and population structure using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 74 MDR strains and analyzed the link between AMRs and ARGs or VAGs. Minimizing MDR E coli spread from pets to people Of the 135 isolates, 54.8% were identified as MDR E coli, 71.1% were highly resistant to ampicillin, 62.2% were resistant to tetracycline, and 59.3% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Twelve ARGs in six categories and 14 VAGs in four categories were observed in the 74 MDR strains, with fimC (100%) and tetA (96.0%) the most prevalent. The widespread use of antibiotics has significantly caused the increase of MDR E. coli which were isolated from companion animals. The analysis of associations between ARGs and AMRs or VAGs in MDR strains showed 23 significant positively associated pairs between ARGs and AMRs, while only 5 associated pairs were seen between ARGs and VAGs (3 positively and 2 negatively associated pairs). "The widespread use of antibiotics has significantly caused the increase of MDR E. coli which were isolated from companion animals," the study authors wrote. "Measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of MDR E. coli between companion animals and humans, as the fecal shedding of MDR E. coli from pet dogs may pose a threat to humans." They called for future research with more samples and expanded sampling areas and the use of high-throughput or whole-genome sequencing to provide more comprehensive data on MDR E coli strains from dogs with diarrhea. Data demonstrate higher risk of surgical-site infection at US safety net hospitals News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Healthcare-Associated Infections Patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery at safety net hospitals are at increased risk of surgical-site infections (SSIs), according to a research letter yesterday in JAMA Surgery. Using data from the Nationwide Readmissions Database for, researchers from Memorial Regions Hospital in Florida assessed SSIs identified during initial admission or readmission within 90 days of gastrointestinal surgery from 2019 to 2020. Safety net hospitals were identified as publicly funded, metropolitan teaching, and large by number of beds per US region. To account for risk factors such as age, comorbidities, low household income, and lack of insurance, the researchers performed a propensity score matching analysis. 30% increased risk in safety net hospitals Of the 392,368 patients identified, 23,447 (6.0%) were treated at safety net hospitals (mean age 52.4 years, 50.2% female). The overall SSI rate was 3.0%, of which 59.2% of infections were found during readmission, but the rate in safety net hospitals was 7.8%. After propensity score matching, the overall SSI rate was 3.5%, and SSI risk was increased by nearly 30% in safety net hospitals (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.42). SSI risk was higher at safety net hospitals for all sites (eg, superficial incisional, deep incisional, organ space). The findings are noteworthy because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has imposed financial penalties on hospitals that have high rates of healthcare-associated infections since 2014, and those penalties to date have proven ineffective at reducing infection rates at safety net hospitals. Although CMS made adjustments to hospital penalties for readmissions in 2019 to account for the socioeconomic differences among patients treated at safety net hospitals, the study authors say their findings indicate similar adjustments are needed for SSIs.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Stabilisation of the number of RSV cases at a low level. Influenza: Decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 19 to 25 February 2024 (week 8), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 41 cases, compared to 56 cases the previous week (-27%). The positivity rate fell to 2.6% compared to 3.3% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in the wastewater was similar to the previous week[1]. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (86.7%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.1%). It should be noted that variant JN.1, a descendant of variant BA.2.86, has predominated since week 47 of 2023. [2] Influenza For the week of 19 to 25 February 2024 (week 8), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 312 cases from 455 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 31% compared to the previous week. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 19 to 25 February 2024 (week 8), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 11 cases, compared with 12 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 8%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

Image credit: shutterstock Reading Time: 3 Minutes • Print this page It’s the news conservationists have been expecting, but dreading. The avian influenza H5N1 virus has reached mainland Antarctica. The highly contagious and deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza has not only killed millions of birds around the world, but has jumped to mammals. Thousands of deaths have been recorded globally, including a mass mortality event of elephant and fur seals during the disease’s recent spread across South America. Scientists tracked its path as it moved down the west coast of South America, reaching Antarctica’s subantarctic islands in October last year. Now, it has officially reached mainland Antarctica. The disease has been confirmed in two brown skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus) – also known as Antarctic skuas – on the western tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Argentinian researchers found and collected the two deceased birds in early February, before handing them over to scientists at Spain’s Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) for testing. The disease was detected in the bodies of two deceased brown skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus) – also known as Antarctic skuas – on the western tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Image credit: Angela N Perryman/shutterstock This week the Spanish government released a statement, announcing that, indeed, the two skuas were infected with the disease. “The presence of the virus, confirmed on February 24, has been found in samples of two dead skuas, which were found by Argentine scientists near the Primavera Antarctic base,” the statement reads. “Analysis has conclusively shown that the birds were infected with the H5 subtype of avian influenza, and that at least one of the dead birds contained the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. These analyses consisted of specific PCRs for the influenza virus and the H5 subtype, followed by sequencing of the protease cutting region, which defines with 100 per cent certainty the presence of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus. “The virus has recently been described in the subantarctic islands, but to date, although significant deaths of some birds had been reported in the Antarctic territory, no country had demonstrated the presence of said virus in Antarctic territory.” A map (above) showing confirmed and suspected cases of the avian influenza H5N1 virus in the Antarctic region, and (below) a close view of the map showing (with a red pin) where the first confirmed case has been found on mainland Antarctica [screenshots taken February 28, 2024]. Image credits: Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) ‘Absolutely terrifying’ The confirmation is a realisation of the Antarctic scientific community’s worst fears, many of whom relayed these concerns to AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHIC late last year. “Bird flu is absolutely terrifying because it’s so deadly and it doesn’t just affect birds,” saidProfessor Dana Bergstrom, the former lead of Biodiversity Conservation with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD). AAD seabird ecologist Dr Louise Emmerson echoed this, adding the seabird research community was anticipating a massive loss of life among Antarctica’s wildlife when the disease inevitably reached mainland colonies. “[We are all] feeling like an existential crisis is bearing down on us and our study ecosystems,” said Louise. “We’re all incredibly attached to our study species, and it feels horrendous that there’s very little we can do, apart from monitor the impacts, avoid spreading it [bird flu] further, and maintain the resilience of the wildlife through other management actions.” Emily Grilly, WWF-Australia’s Antarctic conservation manager, predicted, “I think we’re going to see some haunting images… And it’s the last thing that Antarctic wildlife needs right now, when it’s trying to adapt to this changing climate.” Related: Antarctica: a continent in crisis TAGS Apple Newsbirdsnaturescience Read Next OPINION: Refuge from extinction Safeguarding landscapes less impacted by climate change can help secure biodiversity, argues environmental biologist Gunnar Keppel.

With vaccination, the infection and death rates dwindled dramatically, as well as the seriousness of the disease for most of the population. Even so, the high rate of transmissibility of the virus and the unpredictability of mutations impose a kind of "precarious equilibrium" on the current epidemiological situation. Antonio Augusto Moura da Silva, an epidemiologist and professor of the Graduate Program in Collective Health at the Federal University of Maranhão (UFMA, in Portuguese), states that, as the population acquires immunity against the virus, a pandemic may evolve to an “endemic”, that is, when a disease becomes recurring in a region, but without a significant number of cases or deaths. “The question that emerges is whether we have already reached this balance, that is, whether the situation has evolved into what we call an endemic. Currently, it’s difficult to determine whether or not it was reached. We can’t affirm it. However, every state of equilibrium for all infectious diseases is always very fragile and can be disrupted by anything new," says the professor. :: Brazil intends to eliminate measles and risks of other diseases with vaccination campaign :: Moura da Silva says that, although Brazil has not reached this stage, “evidence indicates” the country is walking "in this direction”. However, any balance is precarious, especially if the virus develops a more aggressive mutation. A lethal mutation is a possibility. Mutations are random events, and we can't predict which way they will go," he explains. This analysis has the same conclusion as Paulo Lotufo, a professor of Internal Medicine at the University of São Paulo Medical School, to whom there isn’t yet a total comprehension of the diseases’ behavior. He believes that, when dealing with the peaks of COVID-19 cases, it’s “interesting” to compare them to those of influenza. “While the influenza season follows a well-defined time pattern, COVID still did not show this clarity, making it difficult to predict how things will develop. The vaccine, although its contribution to decreasing serious cases and deaths, doesn’t provide for a broad comprehension of covid-19 peaks of cases,” he states. The current perception is that, as seen in other diseases, there will be more vulnerable individuals, such as those with heat conditions. This dynamic is similar to that of influenza, but the pandemic continues to uncover particularities yet to be totally understood and recorded given the complexity constantly evolving.” :: Brazil and Cuba strengthen ties at a summit that united the Global South; countries sign a health agreement :: In this sense, the continuous collection and recording of data is crucial due to the constant transformations, contributing to a more complete and efficient understanding in the management of the health system. Isaac Schrarstzhaupt, an epidemiologist and data scientist at the Rede Análise Covid (Covid Analysis Network, in English), also agrees that there is no pattern to the virus's behavior. He affirms further: he doesn’t know whether it will be possible to identify some pattern due to the virus's high transmissibility. Schrarstzhaupt says the SARS-CoV-2 is so infectious that it doesn’t depend, for instance, on the seasons, which happens to flu during the winter, when people crowd indoors. In Covid's case, it’s more related to people’s behavior. For instance, with people adopting prevention measures less frequently, such as the use of protective face masks, there is an increase in the rate of infection, regardless of whether it is winter or summer. As a result, there is a greater chance of the virus mutating and breaking the current control over the disease. "Mutation is a consequence of this high transmission rate because the virus enters the body, enters cells, begins to replicate, and then mutation occurs. A mutation can make the virus completely useless, or smarter. And then it becomes a new predominant variant." It is mainly through this explanation that Schrarstzhaupt can't see the establishment of a pattern for the disease’s behavior. "For this to happen, the virus would have to lose the capacity to mutate and create so many variants, and the predominant variant that remains would have to be more or less predictable, like influenza. SARS-CoV-2's high mutation rate is what makes me believe it’s unpredictable, at least not in the medium term," says the data. Vaccination In addition to being highly infectious, there is a low COVID-19 vaccination rate, especially among children. Researchers emphasize that the current epidemiological situation is significantly different from the scenario seen before the vaccine. Even so, adherence to the latest doses of the vaccine is lower than desired. According to the Ministry of Health, from the beginning of COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil, on January 17, 2021, until February 6, 2024, 517 million doses were administered to the general public, 6.7 million of which were to children under five years of age. Up until now, only 6% of children aged between six months and two years and 6.4% of children aged between three and four years have concluded the monovalent vaccination schedule (bivalent coverage is only for children aged 12 and over). The percentage is well below the target of 90% immunization coverage. "To reduce cases, the population must adopt protective measures. However, to reduce serious cases and deaths, it's only through vaccination. Data show that the pandemic is nowhere near the emergency phase, but it is still serious and responsible for a large percentage of serious respiratory cases," especially among children and the elderly, says the data researcher. :: Government launches program to eliminate and control malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids :: In 2024, up to the sixth epidemiological week (February 10-16), there were 4,937 hospitalized cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with 41% (2,020) of them identified as respiratory viruses. Of these, 64% were due to COVID-19. Regarding deaths, 506 SARS deaths were reported in the same period, with 56% (283) identified as respiratory viruses. Of these, 91% were due to COVID-19. The data is from the Ministry of Health's latest Epidemiological Bulletin. The Ministry's data shows that the elderly are more infected than children. In terms of deaths, the elderly lead. What does the Ministry of Health say? Ethel Maciel, Secretary of Health and Environmental Surveillance at Brazil’s Ministry of Health, says the current epidemiological situation is "very different" from when the pandemic was considered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). "After vaccination, there was very significant control of the disease. So we've gone from 3,000 people dying a day to an average of between 30 and 50 people a day," she explained. This year, the COVID-19 vaccine became part of the country’s National Immunization Program (PNI, in Portuguese). The Ministry of Health's priority is children aged between six months and five years old and groups with a higher risk of developing severe forms of the disease: the elderly, immunocompromised people, pregnant and postpartum women, health workers, people with comorbidities, Indigenous people, river dwellers and quilombola people; people in long-term care institutions and their workers, people with permanent disabilities, people deprived of their liberty, teens and young people serving socio-educational measures, workers of the prison system, and people living on the streets. The secretary highlights that "new strains may emerge. However, in the current scenario – where the Omicron and its subvariants dominate – our vaccines still protect. Our concern lies with those who are falling seriously ill and dying, which are mainly children under the age of two and adults over 70. Therefore, these groups are our current major concern." "We've already seen a reduction in the number of deaths. Since we have a vaccine and medication, we don't want anyone to die. So one death is already a bad result. But we won't be able to eliminate it overnight. And we never can. We'll always have some remnants. But we're going to work towards an even greater reduction," says Maciel.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Early estimates suggest flu shots are performing OK in the current U.S. winter flu season. The vaccines were around 40% effective in preventing adults from getting sick enough from the flu that they had to go to a doctor’s office, clinic or hospital, health officials said during a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccines meeting Wednesday. Children who were vaccinated were roughly 60% less likely to get treatment at a doctor's office or hospital, CDC officials said.COLD AND FLU SEASON IS COMING: KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS NOWOfficials generally are pleased if a flu vaccine is 40% to 60% effective. The shots tend to do better when they are well matched against the circulating flu strains. Officials say that's what's happened during this — relatively typical — flu season. Annual flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older in the U.S. About half of eligible kids and just under half of adults got flu shots in the last several months, according to CDC data. The CDC uses several systems to track the vaccines. One is a network of hospitals that offer information on how well the vaccines prevent flu-related illnesses bad enough to require admission. Another draws on outpatient data from urgent care clinics and hospital emergency departments.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)Estimates from four different surveillance systems were presented at Wednesday's meeting of a committee that advises the CDC on vaccines. The findings were reported as ranges, but their midpoints hovered close to 40% for adults and around 60% for adults. The adult effectiveness estimate is similar to what CDC initially reported for last flu season. The shots proved less effective in some other recent seasons, the results influenced by what virus strain was dominating and how well the vaccines were matched to it.One committee member expressed disappointment at recent effectiveness findings. "There seems to be diminishing returns for annual influenza immunization," said Dr. Sarah Long, of Drexel University. Long asked whether repeated vaccinations, year-after-year, might be leading to lower immune system responses. A CDC official said some researchers have been exploring that question, so far without conclusive results.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"One thing that does seem to arise consistently from these things is that in general you are better off if you got vaccinated than if you didn't," said the CDC's Dr. Lisa Grohskopf.

In a statement on Monday, it had said he was suffering from “light” flu symptoms.“I still have a bit of a cold,” the pope, who has scaled back his agenda in recent days, told worshippers.Monsignor Filippo Ciampanelli, one of his aides, read the catechesis during the audience as he had done on previous occasions when the pope was feeling unwell.Francis, who has been blighted by ill health in recent years, was admitted to the Gemelli in March last year with acute bronchitis. Initially, the Vatican said he was there for scheduled tests, but the pontiff later revealed he had felt pain in his chest and was rushed to the hospital, where bronchitis was diagnosed. After being discharged, he quipped: “I am still alive.”He was readmitted to the Gemelli in June for health checks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Australian vaccine company has accelerated supply of the vaccines after an early rise in flu cases in New Zealand. Seasonal influenza is associated with over 3,240 all-cause hospitalisations and 400-500 deaths annually in New Zealand. 86% of flu deaths occur in people aged 65 and over. Older adults are at higher risk of severe influenza and serious complications due to comorbidities and an age-related decline in the immune system’s ability to fight diseases. This immune system decline makes older adults more susceptible to severe influenza and also reduces the effectiveness of conventional flu vaccines. Fluad Quad is an adjuvanted vaccine for the prevention of flu in New Zealanders aged 65 and over. An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to help boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine. It is available as a private market (unfunded) vaccine in New Zealand. Clinical trials and real-world evidence of Fluad Quad have shown that the vaccine can provide up to 12 months protection from influenza, compared to standard egg vaccines which can wane after 3 – 4 months. Studies also showed an 18-36% reduction in influenza-related GP visits when using Fluad Quad over a standard influenza vaccine. Vicky Chan, pharmacist says flu vaccination is important for all New Zealanders, especially older adults. “We’re potentially seeing an early start to the flu season in Southern Hemisphere countries. We’re hearing stories from clinics and rest homes around New Zealand, while data in Australia is showing they’ve had more flu cases in January and February 2024 than in other years since more detailed records began,” said Ms Chan. “So far, we’re seeing circulation of Influenza A strains, which we know can affect older adults more severely. People might remember the 2017 flu season, when Australia and New Zealand had lots of Influenza A circulating and a high number of people were hospitalised or sadly passed away.” “It’s really important that New Zealanders talk to their healthcare professional about influenza vaccination early this year, especially if you’re over 65.” Edith Rosenberg, Head of New Zealand Medical Affairs at CSL Seqirus, says the company is pleased to accelerate access to its enhanced vaccines so New Zealanders can access protection against influenza. “Flu is unpredictable so we never know exactly when the season might begin or when cases might peak. Vaccination typically begins in April but we’re pleased to have accelerated supply so that our vaccines are available now on the private market to help protect people.” “In the past, vaccination wasn’t made available earlier as standard vaccines waned after 3-4 months, especially in older people. Enhanced vaccines, like Fluad Quad, last for up to 12 months, so they are a really important tool in providing protection from flu for our older loved ones.” Ms Rosenberg also said that enhanced vaccines can also help protect the capacity of New Zealand’s health system which may help save lives. “New Zealand has committed and caring doctors, nurses and pharmacists but resources are really stretched at the moment. One important thing we can do to protect our health system and our loved ones is to vaccinate and help prevent flu in older age groups.” “Enhanced vaccines are more effective at helping prevent flu and severe cases in older adults. This could have a potentially significant impact on our health system, given that adults aged 65 and over have the highest rates of flu-related hospital admissions.” The cost of critical care and associated hospital costs for influenza patients in NZ has been calculated to be higher than those for the average patient admitted to an ICU. The flu virus mutates every year which is why people are recommended to receive an annual flu vaccination. Vaccination is the most important tool to help protect New Zealanders from influenza and its complications. Fluad Quad is available in pharmacies and GP clinics that have ordered stock. The cost will vary but is expected be within the range of $45-$65.

That's up by 3,514 on the same period last year.Those aged 65 or over were the most viral age group (248 cases), more than doubling the rate of any other age group, according to the HPSC.Flu symptoms include, among others, a sudden high temperature, an aching body, a dry cough, a sore throat and/or a headache.Looking deeper into the data shows there have been worrying 84 outbreaks recorded across the last four weeks — including 14 in the most recent data for week seven (February 11 to February 18.)Hospitals (26 outbreaks across four week period) and nursing homes (30 outbreaks across the four-week period) remain the most viral areas for influenza so far this year.No other infectious disease has seen as much of an increase year-on-year as flu.Free flu vaccines are available from the HSE for groups that are eligible, which include those over 65, as well as healthcare workers, pregnant people, or those who have health conditions that put them at higher risk of flu. In comparison, there has been a decrease in covid-19 cases, with almost 5,000 fewer cases than this time last year.There were 271 positive covid cases from February 18 to February 24, giving a yearly total of 5,364 cases, compared to 10,059 last year.There have been 12 suspected cases of measles so far this year — with the HPSC saying one case has been confirmed while the remainder classified as possible.At the beginning of February, a man died in a hospital in the Dublin and Midlands Health Region having been confirmed to have had measles. Meanwhile, a total of 10,991 patients were forced to wait for a hospital bed in February, according to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO).The top five most overcrowded hospitals were University Hospital Limerick (2,247 patients), Cork University Hospital (1,070 patients), University Hospital Galway (987 patients), St Vincent’s University Hospital (651 patients) and Sligo University Hospital (649 patients).INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said numbers had not fallen since the St Brigid's Day bank holiday, and warned with two bank holidays to come in March the HSE "must outline what steps they are taking in the run up to St Patrick's Day".Read MoreTusla saw 500% jump in number of unaccompanied children needing a bed Irish Examiner’s WhatsApp channelFollow and share the latest news and stories more hospital overcrowding articles More than 500 patients waiting on trolleys in hospitals with UHL worst hit Inquest: Woman who had weight loss surgery died from blood clot after 44-hour hospital wait Bill to expand Hiqa's authority to wait until after General Election More in this section Co-operation to stop climate change not 'out for the count', Cop29 told Ireland urged to 'lead by example' at Cop29 Watch: Election 2024 - Housing dominates the agenda for students #COVID-19#Hospital overcrowdingOrganisation: Health Protection Surveillance Centre Donald Trump victory sees surge in US citizens searching Irish property websiteREAD NOW Subscribe Now Lunchtime News Sign up to the best reads of the week from irishexaminer.com selected just for you.

(Getty)Maximum security measures were immediately taken and the viruses were inactivated to protect people and stop the spread. ﻿The council believed the find could explain the number of bird deaths recorded during the Antarctic summer.Australia is now the only continent that has not seen cases ﻿of the virus.Bird flu is typically found in sick birds and is lethal to flocks once spread.

Last year, state compensation funds ran out.Open image viewerNearly half a million animals were killed at fur farms to prevent the spread of avian influenza. Image: Marcus Lillkvist / YleYle News29.2. 16:03The Finnish state is paying fur farms more than 50 million euros in compensation for animal culls ordered to prevent the spread of bird flu last year.On Thursday, the government’s ministerial finance committee approved a proposal by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to exceed a previously earmarked amount in the state budget by 45.2 million euros.Of this amount, 44.4 million euros will be paid to fur farms, while 800,000 euros will be paid to compensate for pigs ordered to be killed due to salmonella infection.The Food Agency had estimated the amount needed based on compensation applications and the value of the animals at the time.Reimbursements to be paid out by summerBased on the Food Agency estimate, 50.7 million euros will be paid in compensation for culled fur animals. Just over six million of that amount has already been paid as advance compensation from the 2023 allocation.The funds ran out last year, so more compensation could not be paid.Last year, evidence of bird flu was found on 71 fur farms. All animals in those facilities, some 485,000 in total, were ordered to be put down.Terhi Laaksonen, head of the animal health and welfare department at the Food Agency, said that decisions on farmers' compensation applications are now being fast-tracked."We'll start sending out compensation decisions to applicants in March,” she said. "The goal is to have the compensations paid to the fur farms by summer."MPs to weigh fur farming banParliament is to consider a citizens' initiative calling for a ban on fur farming, after it received more than the required 50,000 signatures in just one day last autumn.In a survey published by the daily Helsingin Sanomat in November, more than 80 percent of respondents said they opposed fur farming in its current form in Finland.Fifty-six percent of respondents supported a complete ban on fur farming as soon as possible or with a transition period of several years. That figure was up from 45 percent a year earlier.Users with an Yle ID can leave comments on our news stories. You can create your Yle ID via this link.

Credit: Disney Going on a vacation is typically meant to be a magical experience, especially if you are visiting Walt Disney World Resort. For months leading up to their vacation, guests dream of meeting Mickey Mouse, seeing Cinderella Castle, and riding Space Mountain; what they don’t dream about it getting sick. While you can certainly get sick while you are at home in your own city, when you visit a densely populated area that leaves you coming in close contact with others constantly, sharing the same touch surfaces, germs are able to pass through much more frequently. That is why during the pandemic, Disney had to up its game when it came to health and safety, taking sterilization and social distancing much more seriously. While guests were used to cramming into the “dead center of the room” in the Haunted Mansion, for a period of time, that was gone. We even saw cast members sterilizing attractions like “it’s a small world” between each ride. Credit: Disney Now, those measures have been relaxed, but it seems a new concern is rising in the Orlando area. The City of Orlando (@thecitybeautiful) shared new warning signage that is being put up around the city warning residents and visitors of the bird flu (Avian Influenza). The post states: “A top priority of the city is the safety and well-being of our residents, staff and the preservation of local wildlife. Recently, we became aware of some bird deaths at Lake Eola Park. After an investigation, the birds were found to be positive for Avian Influenza. This virus naturally spreads among wild aquatic birds, worldwide, including swans. Per the CDC, people very rarely get sick with bird flu, however to limit exposure to the virus, please take the following precautions when visiting Lake Eola Park: -Avoid direct contact with birds and only observe them from a distance. -Do not feed birds. -Avoid contact with any bird excrement. -Remove your shoes before entering your home and clean them off if contamination is suspected. Remember, our Lake Eola swans are wild animals and should never be handled or touched by members of the public. Per the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, they recommend allowing the Avian Influenza to run its course as some birds may build immunity and estimated a month of dissipation of infections. We will continue to follow their recommendations, track, monitor and report any new infections to FWC while remaining vigilant in our efforts related to disinfecting the park and keep the public informed. For more information, please visit orlando.gov/parkalert” View this post on Instagram A post shared by City of Orlando (@thecitybeautiful) As noted by UC Davis, “It emerged in 2020, while the human world was reeling from a different pandemic, COVID-19. Avian influenza began killing tens of thousands of sea birds in Europe before moving to South Africa. In 2022, it entered the U.S. and Canada, threatening poultry and wild birds”. At the moment, the post focuses on birds in the Lake Eola area being contaminated, but as birds are able to migrate easily, those visiting Orlando should stay away from birds in any capacity for the time being. It is important to know that Avian flu viruses do not normally make humans sick but human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred.

As our article stated, “This also comes as an outbreak of the Norovirus has been reported in the Northeastern United States, with concerns of it spreading to highly populated areas, like Central Florida.” Have you ever gotten sick after a Walt Disney World vacation? in Disney Parks, Walt Disney World Tagged:Walt Disney World Alessia Dunn Orlando theme park lover who loves thrills and theming, with a side of entertainment.
