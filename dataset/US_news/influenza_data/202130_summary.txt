- Posts circulating on Facebook and Instagram claim that the CDC's PCR test for COVID-19 cannot differentiate between the COVID virus and flu viruses, suggesting that flu cases have been added to COVID cases when using the test.
- The CDC announced that it would withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel. This is a standard practice for tests that have not yet undergone full FDA approval.
- The CDC's PCR test is not a tangible product, but rather a protocol for testing for COVID-19. It specifies the reagents needed to test samples for the presence of the virus.
- The claim that the CDC's PCR test cannot differentiate between COVID and flu viruses is false. The test is specifically designed to detect and amplify the genetic material of the COVID virus and does not cross-react with flu viruses.
- The withdrawal of the emergency use authorization request for the CDC's test is due to the availability of other tests that have received FDA approval and are widely used. It does not indicate any problems with the accuracy or validity of the test.
- The CDC encourages laboratories to adopt multiplexed methods that can detect and differentiate between COVID and flu viruses, but this does not suggest that the CDC's PCR test is unable to do so. Multiplexed methods can provide additional information but are not necessary for diagnosing COVID-19.
