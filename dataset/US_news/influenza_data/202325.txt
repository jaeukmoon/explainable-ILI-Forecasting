Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) CDC Tracks Ongoing Flu Activity in the Southern HemisphereNo clear patterns have emerged at this time EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages As flu activity in the United States continues at low levels that are typical for this time of year, CDC also is tracking flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere, which generally has its “flu season” at this time. Surveillance data show that several Southern Hemispheric countries are currently experiencing higher or earlier flu activity compared to what was seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, activity varies by country or region. According to flu activity data submitted to the World Health Organization: Influenza A(H1N1) viruses have been most commonly reported. Chile has reported an early start to their flu season. Argentina is experiencing typical levels of flu activity. South Africa has been experiencing high flu activity for this time of year. Australia is experiencing typical levels of flu activity. While not in the Southern Hemisphere, Mexico has been experiencing abnormally high flu activity in May and June. Typically, Mexico has low flu activity during this time of the year. Limited data are available on flu-related hospitalizations in Southern Hemisphere countries at this time, but South Africa has reported a “moderate” level of flu related hospitalizations, while Australia has reported a “normal” level of flu-related hospitalizations compared with historic trends. Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere usually occurs between April and September, compared with October through May in the Northern Hemisphere. Experts often look at Southern Hemispheric flu activity for clues as to what could happen in the United States. This 2023 Southern Hemisphere flu season, some Central and South America countries have early or intense influenza A(H1N1) activity, while others have typically timed seasons with a mix of influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1), and influenza B/Victoria. What happens in the Southern Hemisphere does not necessarily predict what will happen next in the Northern Hemisphere because different influenza viruses may predominate in different parts of the world and immunity may be different between populations. Nevertheless, flu seasons in the Southern Hemisphere remind us of what could happen in the United States and help us think of scenarios to better prepare for our flu season. While flu activity is always challenging to predict, it has been especially unpredictable since the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued impact of COVID-19 on the circulation of respiratory viruses like influenza, remains unclear, but ongoing global flu surveillance remains important for trying to understand flu virus seasonality going forward. CDC will continue to monitor ongoing flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere as their season progresses.

This process, termed host shutoff, is thought to promote viral replication by preventing antiviral responses and redirecting cellular resources to viral processes. Several viruses from divergent families accomplish host shutoff through RNA degradation by endoribonucleases. However, viruses also need to ensure expression of their own genes. The influenza A virus endoribonuclease PA-X solves this problem by sparing viral mRNAs and some host RNAs necessary for viral replication. To understand how PA-X distinguishes between RNAs, we characterized PA-X cut sites transcriptome-wide using 5′ rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends coupled to high-throughput sequencing. This analysis, along with RNA structure predictions and validation experiments using reporters, shows that PA-Xs from multiple influenza strains preferentially cleave RNAs at GCUG tetramers in hairpin loops. Importantly, GCUG tetramers are enriched in the human but not the influenza transcriptome. Moreover, optimal PA-X cut sites inserted in the influenza A virus genome are quickly selected against during viral replication in cells. This finding suggests that PA-X evolved these cleavage characteristics to preferentially target host over viral mRNAs in a manner reminiscent of cellular self versus non-self discrimination.

(b) Protein lysates of XRN1 knock out A549 cells infected with WT PR8 or PR8-PA(∆X), or mock infected, were probed with antibodies against PR8 PA or β-tubulin as a loading control. Images are representative of 2 experiments. (c) Protein lysates of WT or XRN1 knock out (ko) A549 cells were probed with antibodies against Xrn1 or β-tubulin as a loading control to check for loss of XRN1. Images are representative of 2 experiments. (d, e) Representation of individual chromosomal positions in the 5′ RACE-seq data. For each sample, reads with their 5′ end mapping to the same nucleotide were counted and plotted to compare different datasets: (d) mock samples from replicate 1 vs. replicate 2, (e) replicate 1 WT PR8 vs. PR8-PA(∆X) (top), WT PR8 vs. mock infected (middle) and PR8-PA(∆X) vs. mock infected (bottom). For each plot, light blue dots correspond to locations that are unique to one sample, while red and black dots correspond to locations that are common in the two samples. Red dots represent locations that have two-fold or more reads in the sample on the x axis vs. than in the sample on the y axis. Similar plots were obtained when comparing other replicates. (f) PyDegradome was run on concatenated read files comparing WT PR8 vs. PR8-PA(∆X) infections using different parameters as indicated on the x axis (see Methods for parameter explanation). cl = confidence levels, mf = multiplicative factor. The window of analysis was 4 nucleotides in all cases. The total number of cut sites identified by PyDegradome (red circles, left y axis) and the percentage of shared cut sites also found as concatenated cut sites (blue diamonds, right y axis) were plotted for each set of parameters.

The reads used in B are from WT PR8 replicate 1 as an example, but other samples have similar read distribution. The difference between reads and PA-X cut site distribution in introns vs. exons is statistically significant (P < 0.001), but the difference between reads and ∆X specific sites distribution in the concatenated analysis is not (P > 0.2), Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit with degree of freedom 1. While only 3% of PR8-PA(∆X) fragments from the shared analysis mapped to introns (0.025 < P < 0.05 compared to reads distribution, Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit with degree of freedom 1), this may stem from the very low number of sites, 37, found with this method. (d–f) XRN1 knock out A549 cells were infected with WT PR8 or PR8-PA(∆X), or mock infected. 5′RACE was performed and PCR products were run on an agarose gel.

The bottom graph shows levels of the unspliced pre-mRNA (obtained using one primer in an exon and one primer in the intron). (c, d) RNA was also used to run 5′ RACE. PCR products were separated on an agarose gel. The top gel in C and the gel in D represent products obtained using the green arrow primer from A, and the bottom gel in C using the magenta arrow primer from A. Blue dotted arrow indicates size of PCR products originating from the original luciferase cut site, red dotted arrow indicates the predicted sizes of PCR products that would originate from the sequence inserted in the introns. Gel images are representative of 3 experiments.Extended Data Fig. 8 GCUG tetramers are enriched in the human transcriptome.The percentage of tetramers in the human and viral genomes and transcriptomes was calculated by counting the number of each tetramer and dividing it by the total number of tetramers in the sequence (that is length of the sequence minus 3). Percentages for each tetramer are plotted to visualize which tetramers are more abundant in the human genome vs. transcriptome (a) and the human transcriptome vs. the transcriptome of 3 influenza A virus strains (c-e). Each dot represents a specific tetramer, with the red dot representing the GCUG tetramer.

Continuous surveillance, development of new vaccines, and public health measures are crucial in managing and mitigating the impact of influenza outbreaks. Methods: Nasal swabs were collected from individuals with influenza-like symptoms in Jining City during 2021-2022. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect influenza A viruses, followed by isolation using MDCK cells. Additionally, nucleic acid detection was performed to identify influenza A H1N1, seasonal H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata strains. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted on 24 influenza virus strains, and subsequent analyses included characterization, phylogenetic construction, mutation analysis, and assessment of nucleotide diversity. Results: A total of 1,543 throat swab samples were collected. The study revealed the dominance of the B/Victoria influenza virus in Jining during 2021-2022. Whole-genome sequencing showed co-prevalence of B/Victoria influenza viruses in the branches of Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 and Victoria clade 1A.3a.2, with a higher incidence observed in winter and spring. Comparative analysis demonstrated lower similarity in the HA, MP, and PB2 gene segments of the 24 sequenced influenza virus strains compared to the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019. Mutations were identified in all antigenic epitopes of the HA protein at R133G, N150K, and N197D, and the 17-sequence antigenic epitopes exhibited more than 4 amino acid variation sites, resulting in antigenic drift. Moreover, one sequence had a D197N mutation in the NA protein, while seven sequences had a K338R mutation in the PA protein. Conclusion: This study highlights the predominant presence of B/Victoria influenza strain in Jining from 2021 to 2022. The analysis also identified amino acid site variations in the antigenic epitopes, contributing to antigenic drift. 1. Introduction The influenza virus is a common pathogen in the human respiratory tract, causing approximately 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year. It is considered one of the major public health problems worldwide (Chavez and Hai, 2021; Tyrrell et al., 2021). Influenza virus is a single positive-stranded RNA virus, which is further divided into four types: type A, type B, type C, and type D based on the antigenicity of nucleoprotein and matrix protein (Carascal et al., 2022). Influenza A and B viruses are the primary cause of illness in humans. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the antigenicity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is divided into 18 subtypes, while NA is divided into 11 subtypes (Duraes-Carvalho and Salemi, 2018). In contrast, the influenza B virus has only one subtype, which is further divided into two lineages: Victoria lineage and Yamagata lineage based on the antigenic characteristics and HA sequence of influenza B (Hay et al., 2001; Toure et al., 2022). Both influenza A and B viruses are composed of eight segments of the gene, including haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), nucleoprotein (NP), nonstructural (NS), polymerase acidic (PA), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) genes. These gene segments between different types can undergo genetic recombination (Zhu et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2022). Among these segments, the HA protein of influenza virus is a major surface antigen prone to mutation, which can cause antigenic changes that help the virus evade host immunity and cause influenza outbreaks (Liu et al., 2018; Wu and Wilson, 2020). Currently, the seasonal influenza virus pathogens that infect humans are mainly influenza A H1N1 influenza virus, seasonal influenza A H3N2 subtype virus, B Victoria series influenza virus, and B Yamagata series influenza virus (Wu and Wilson, 2020). These four influenza viruses alternate in prevalence during different years (Liu et al., 2022). The influenza virus can cause fever, cough, sore throat, pneumonia, and even death, and the general population is susceptible. Vaccination is an effective method to prevent influenza. However, the influenza virus is prone to mutation, undergoes antigenic drift, and produces immune escape. Both NA and PA inhibitors are specific drugs for treating influenza; however, with the continuous use of drugs, the virus may develop drug-resistant mutations, which reduces the therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs. Influenza is highly prevalent during the winter and spring months in northern China, and monitoring typically occurs from April to March of the following year (Liu et al., 2022). Jining, being one of the most densely populated cities in northern China, the threat of seasonal flu outbreaks in this region should not be underestimated. In this study, we analyzed the epidemic patterns and genome-wide characteristics of the influenza virus monitored in Jining City from 2021 to 2022. Our goal was to gain insight into the epidemic characteristics of the influenza virus and the evolutionary trends of circulating strains in order to improve outbreak prevention strategies. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Specimens collection According to the requirements of the National Influenza Center of China, between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, throat swab specimens for influenza-like illness (ILI) (body temperature ≥ 38°C, with either cough or sore throat) were collected at Jining First People’s Hospital and Rencheng District Maternal and Child Health Planning Service Center. A minimum of 10 samples were collected each week from April 2021 to September 2021, and a minimum of 20 samples were collected each week from October 2021 to March 2022, resulting in a total of 1,543 samples. The collected specimens were immediately stored at 2–8°C and transferred to the Influenza Surveillance Network Laboratory of Jining Center for Disease Control and Prevention within 24 h for testing. 2.2. Laboratory testing A volume of 200 μl throat swab sample was taken, and the automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument (GeneRotex 96) of Xi’an Tianlong Technology Co., Ltd. and the virus nucleic acid extraction reagent (T138) of Xi’an Tianlong Technology Co., Ltd. for nucleic acid extraction were used. Also, Guangzhou Daan Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Type A H1N1 (DS0042), Seasonal H3N2 (DS0091), B/Victoria series (D0970), and B/Yamagata series (D0960) influenza virus nucleic acid detection kit (PCR-fluorescent probe method) were used for nucleic acid detection. 2.3. Influenza virus culture Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO 11995–065) medium with 10% FBS (GIBCO 16000–044) at 37°C. After the cells reached 90% confluence, the culture medium was discarded and washed with 5-ml PBS for three times. Then, 1 ml of a throat swab sample with positive influenza virus was inoculated; incubated at 35°C for 1 h; discarded the throat swab sample; added 5 mL of DMEM (containing 2 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml chain tetracycline), and incubated at 35°C. After 3–4 days, the cells were frozen–thawed three times, and 1% red blood cells were used to measure the HA titer of influenza virus strains. Twenty-four influenza virus strains with virus titer ≥1:8 was isolated, and the strain numbers were as follows: B/shandongrencheng/11484, 11,485, 11,486, 11,487, 11,488, 11,494, 11,495, 11,499, 11,504, 11,506/2021; B/shandongrencheng/1115, 1,122, 1,125, 1,126, 1,127, 1,128, 1,169, 1,176, 1,210, 1,211, 1,252, 1,291, 1,354, 1,356/2022. Sampling dates for the 24 strains were 5 November 2021 (5 strains), 5 December 2021 (5 strains), 6 January 2022 (6 strains), 5 February 2022 (5 strains), and 3 March 2022 (3 strains). Of the 24 strains, 16 strains were isolated from the male patients and 8 strains were isolated from the female patients. Age distribution was as follows: 1 patient aged 0–5 years, 8 patients aged 6–15 years, 6 patients aged 16–25 years, 8 patients aged 26–60 years, and 1 patient aged above 61 years. 2.4.

No cases of influenza A H1N1, seasonal H3N2, and BY influenza viruses were detected. The BV influenza viruses were not detected from April 2022 to September 2022, but began to be detected in ILI in late October 2022. The highest positive rate of influenza viruses in ILI was observed in December 2022 and January 2022. The favorable rates of BV influenza viruses in different months were statistically significant (χ2 = 409.002, p < 0.001). The favorable rates of BV influenza virus in males and females were 22.67 and 26.69%, respectively (χ2 = 3.382, p = 0.07). The positive rates of BV influenza virus in different age groups were 8.15% for 0–5 years; 32.22% for 6–15 years; 26.91% for 16–25 years, 33.98% for 26–60 years, and 9.46% for those above 60 years, respectively (χ2 = 103.411, p < 0.001) (Table 1). In summary, the study found a high prevalence of BV influenza virus in ILI cases in Jining City from October 2021 to March 2022, with the highest positive rate observed in December 2021 and January 2022. The virus showed significant differences in favorable rates across different age groups and months. TABLE 1 Table 1. The positive rate of nucleic acid testing and composition characteristics of BV influenza in Jining between 2021–2022. 3.2. Nucleotide diversity of B/Victoria influenza viruses This study successfully sequenced 24 whole genomes of B/Victoria influenza viruses. The nucleotide similarity of 8 gene fragments in the sequences of 24 strains ranged from 98.3 to 100%. Compared with the WHO-recommended BV influenza virus vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019 for the Northern Hemisphere 2021–2022, the nucleotide similarity of the 8 gene segments varied from 98.2 to 99.7%. The amino acid similarity of the encoded protein was the lowest at 97.2% and was the highest at 100% (Table 2). TABLE 2 Table 2. Similarity analysis of the whole genome of BV influenza virus in Jining. Additionally, the evolutionary distances of HA, NA, MP, NP, NS, PA, PB1, and PB2 genes in the 24 sequences were 0.0076, 0.0078, 0.0069, 0.0056, 0.0045, 0.0052, 0.0048, and 0.0065, respectively, when compared with B/Washington/02/2019. The evolutionary distances of HA, NA, MP, NP, NS, PA, PB1, and PB2 genes were 0.0129, 0.0093, 0.0159, 0.0063, 0.0090, 0.0078, 0.0048, and 0.0159, respectively (Table 2). Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the genetic characteristics and evolutionary distances of B/Victoria influenza viruses, which can help inform the development and selection of appropriate vaccine strains. 3.3. Analysis of genetic variation and evolution of B/Victoria influenza viruses In this study, the genetic evolution of B/Victoria influenza viruses in Jining was analyzed using the sequences of their eight segments. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the eight-segment sequences from 24 B/Victoria strains, including the global BV influenza virus (2021–2022), influenza vaccine strains recommended by WHO, and early BV isolates. The results revealed that the eight segments of the seven sequences were all closely related and located in the same evolutionary clade. Notably, the HA genes of these sequences all belonged to the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1. The remaining strains were found in a separate evolutionary clade, with their HA genes belonging to the Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 (Figure 1). Overall, the phylogenetic analysis of the eight-segment sequences of B/Victoria influenza viruses in Jining revealed two distinct evolutionary clades, with the HA genes of the sequences belonging to either the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 or the Victoria clade 1A.3a.2. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. The phylogenetic analysis of influenza viruses circulating in Jining during 2021–2022 (red) compared with the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019 (green). HA, hemagglutinin. NA, neuraminidase. 3.4. Amino acid variant analysis Compared with B/Washington/02/2019, the HA, NA, and PA genes showed the highest number of amino acid variation sites. HA is crucial for the antigenic variation of the influenza virus, and its heavy chain region contains both antigenic determinants and receptor binding sites (Liu et al., 2018). These include the 120-loop (116–137 aa), 150-loop (141–150 aa), 160-loop (160–172 aa), and 190-helix (193–202 aa) for antigenic epitopes, as well as the 140-loop (136–143 aa), 190-helix (193–202 aa), and 240-loop (237–242 aa) for the HA receptor binding site (Wang et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2018). Table 3 shows that out of the 24 HA protein sequences, 20 variations were found, with 9 occurring in epitopes, including 5 in the 120-loop, 2 in the 150-loop, 1 in the 160-loop, and 1 in the 190-helix. Additionally, there were three mutations in the HA receptor binding site, with 1 in the 190-helix and 2 in the 240-loop. TABLE 3 Table 3. Analysis of amino acid variation sites of B/Victoria influenza viruses in Jining City during 2021–2022. The active catalytic site of NA protein is composed of 19 amino acids, including R116, E117, D149, R150, R154, W177, S178, D197, I221, R223, E226, H273, E275, E276, R292, N294, R374, Y409, and E428 (Chen et al., 2019). Among the 24 sequences, 20 sites of NA protein were mutated, and one of the sequences had the D197N mutation in the catalytic site of NA. The NA inhibitors are the primary antiviral drugs used to treat influenza. However, mutations such as E105K, P139S, G140R, D197N, and H273Y in BV influenza viruses can cause resistance to NA inhibitors (Farrukee et al., 2015, 2018). In this study, it was observed that one sequence had a D197N drug resistance mutation. Nucleoprotein is a crucial structural protein that makes up the nucleocapsid of the influenza virus. It contains specific amino acid sites that are important for its nuclear import and export, including K44, R45, and F209, and the 125–149 aa region of the RNA-binding domain of NP (Ng et al., 2012; Sherry et al., 2014). In the 24 sequences analyzed, nine amino acid sites in NP proteins were found to be mutated, with the E128D mutation appearing in the RNA binding domain of 7 sequences. M1 is a crucial matrix protein that forms the structure of the influenza virus. It contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), nuclear export signal (NES), and phosphorylation modification sites, which play a role in promoting the nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP). In the influenza B virus, the NLS is located at amino acids 76–94, while the NES is located at amino acids 3–14 and 124–133. The key phosphorylation sites are T80 and S84 (Cao et al., 2014). The present study found that none of the 24 sequences analyzed showed mutations in the NLS, NES, T80, and S84. NS1 and NEP are nonstructural proteins of influenza; NS1 has diverse biological functions, including binding to host mRNA, inhibiting interferon, and interacting with many host proteins (Nogales et al., 2018). It consists of two functional domains, an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD, 1–90 aa) and a C-terminal effector domain (ED, 120–261 aa), which are connected by a short interdomain linker region (LR, 91–119 aa) (Jumat et al., 2016). Among the 24 sequences analyzed, 14 amino acid site variations were observed in NS1, with 1 variation found in the RBD, 4in the linker region, and 9 in the effector domain. On the contrary, NEP is a nuclear export protein that facilitates the nuclear export of viral RNP. Its nuclear export signal (NES) is located at 11–23 aa of NEP (Paragas et al., 2001). In the 24 sequences, three amino acids were identified in NEP, but none of them were found in the NES sites. Polymerase acidic inhibitors are currently important specific drugs for treating influenza B, and their sites of action are T20, F24, M34, N37, and I38. None of the 24 strains examined in this study had mutations at these sites (Takashita, 2021). However, the K338R mutation in PA was present in 7 out of 24 sequences and is known to enhance the replication ability of influenza (Bae et al., 2018). The PB1 gene can also undergo mutations that enhance replication ability (Binh et al., 2013), such as D27V/N and N44Q; however, none of the 24 sequences had mutations in these sites. PB2 binds to the cap structure through Q325, W359, and Y434 alleles (Kim et al., 2018), and none of the 24 sequences had mutations in these sites either. In this study, multiple amino acid variations were observed in the PA, HA, NA, NP, and NS1 proteins of the influenza B virus, with some mutations potentially affecting drug resistance and viral replication. In contrast, the M1 and NEP proteins showed no mutations in the analyzed sequences. 3.5. Glycosylation site analysis Glycosylation of the HA and NA of influenza virus is a crucial mechanism for immune evasion and persistent viral infection (Kim et al., 2018). One HA sequence has an N59K mutation that eliminates a glycosylation site in N59. The N197D variant in all 24 sequences results in the loss of the glycosylation site at N197. An S109F mutation in NS1 of 11 sequences also leads to losing a glycosylation site at N107. Finally, one PB2 sequence has a D473N mutation, creating a new glycosylation site at N473 (Table 3). Overall, the mutations N59K in HA, N197D in both HA and NA, S109F in NS1, and D473N in PB2 alter glycosylation sites, potentially affecting immune evasion and persistent viral infection. 4. Discussion Over the past two decades, studies on viruses have been extensively carried out due to their association with both acute self-limiting and long-term chronic diseases in humans, including the influenza virus responsible for the common “flu” (Li et al., 2016; Chen X. et al., 2017; Chen Y. et al., 2017; Jiao et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Duan et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2023). Many pathogens cause influenza-like illnesses, the most important of which is the influenza virus (Clementi et al., 2021). Influenza virus infection can cause severe disease burden, causing fever, cough, headache, pneumonia, and even death, resulting in a severe disease burden (Feng et al., 2020; Castillo-Rodriguez et al., 2022). The WHO influenza established a global surveillance network and recommends annual influenza vaccine strains for the northern and southern hemispheres. China is one of the most crucial member countries for influenza surveillance and has established a surveillance network covering all prefecture-level cities (Liu et al., 2022). Jining City is an ordinary medium-sized prefecture-level city in northern China, with a total area of 11,000 km2 and a population of 8.358 million. It has a warm temperate monsoon climate with four distinct seasons. Jining City has built an influenza surveillance network laboratory. According to the epidemic characteristics of influenza with high incidence in winter and spring, about 1,500 influenza-like case specimens from two sentinel hospitals are monitored for influenza from April to March of the following year. From April 2021 to March 2022, Jining City’s influenza surveillance network laboratory reported a 24.63% positive rate of influenza virus among influenza-like illnesses, with BV influenza virus being the primary prevalent subtype during the winter and spring seasons in northern China (Feng et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022). The highest positive rate was observed in December and January, followed by November and February, while the lowest positive rate was observed from April to September. Additionally, the percentage distributions by age category showed slightly higher rates in the 6–60 year groups and lower rates in the 0–5 year groups and above 65 year groups as shown in Table 1. Compared to the vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019, the HA and PB2 gene segments of the Jining strain exhibit the lowest similarity and the highest gene evolution distance. Although both strains belong to the Victoria clade 1A branch on the evolutionary tree (162–164 aa missing in HA); they are located in different clades. Jining has two epidemic strains the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 and Victoria clade 1A.3a.2, which are cocirculating. In the 2019–2020 influenza season, BV lineage influenza viruses in Jining City were mainly located in the Victoria clade 1A.3 branch, indicating that the BV lineage influenza viruses in Jining City have evolved from the Victoria clade 1A.3 branch to the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 and Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 evolutionary branches. In addition, on the phylogenetic tree, the isolated strains worldwide are also mainly distributed in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 and Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 evolutionary branches. However, a small number of strains in the 2021–2022 season were located in the Victoria clade 1A.3 branch, indicating that the global circulation of BV lineage influenza viruses in the 2021–2022 season is a polymorphic epidemic with multiple units coexisting, mainly in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 and Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 evolutionary branches. Variant strains with different amino acids on hemagglutinin (HA) continue to emerge due to the high mutation rate of influenza viruses. When there are more than four amino acid variations in the HA antigenic determinants, and the variations are distributed on at least two antigenic determinants, antigenic drift occurs, forming a new influenza variant (Liu et al., 2018). Out of the 24 sequences analyzed, the HA epitope of 7 sequences located in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 only had 3 amino acid changes. In contrast, the HA epitope of 17 sequences found in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 clusters had 5–8 amino acid site variations distributed across 3 or 4 antigenic determinants. These variations may change the antigenicity of the influenza virus, lead to the formation of new variants, and possibly affect the protective effect of vaccine strains. The receptor binding sites of HA have 2–3 amino acid mutations, which may impact the binding of HA and receptors. The N197D variant found in all 24 sequences is not only located in the antigenic epitope of HA but also in the receptor binding site. However, the mutation of N197, an important glycosylation site in the B/Victoria virus, resulted in the loss of the N197 glycosylation site in these 24 sequences. This loss, in turn, affects the changes in HA antigenicity and promotes the reproduction of the influenza virus in embryonated eggs (Nakagawa et al., 2004; Saito et al., 2004). Currently, NA, PA, PB1, and PB2 inhibitors are all specific drugs used for the treatment of influenza A virus. However, only NA and PA inhibitors are specific drugs for the treatment of influenza B infection (Takashita, 2021). The function of NA is to cleave the glycosidic bonds between the HA and the influenza receptor, allowing the virus to be released from the host cell surface. The NA inhibitors can specifically bind to the active site of the NA enzyme, inhibit the activity of the NA enzyme, and inhibit the release of the virus. PA is a component of the polymerase of the influenza virus, and PA inhibitors can inhibit the endonuclease activity of the viral polymerase, thereby inhibiting the replication of the influenza virus. However, with the continuous mutation of the influenza virus genes, especially when the active site or adjacent amino acid sites of NA and PA undergo mutations, it may reduce the binding of the inhibitor to NA and PA, and reduce the virus’s sensitivity to the inhibitor, resulting in drug-resistant mutants that make the treatment of influenza more challenging (Takashita, 2021). The D197N mutation may result in resistance to NA inhibitors, indicating the possible emergence of NA inhibitor-resistant variants in B/Victoria influenza viruses in Jining City. Studies have shown that the N197D mutation can affect the antigenic properties of the HA protein, potentially allowing the virus to evade recognition by the host immune system. This is because the glycosylation site can act as a shield to mask the virus from antibodies produced by the host. Additionally, the mutation may alter the shape of the HA protein, making it more difficult for antibodies to bind and neutralize the virus (Tsai and Tsai, 2019). This demonstrates that PA and NA inhibitors can still be used to treat influenza, but there is a need to strengthen the monitoring of drug-resistant mutations. PA, PB1, and PB2 are the three subunits that make up the RNA polymerase of influenza virus (Wandzik et al., 2021). Among them, K338 of PA is located in the polymerase’s core position. The K338R mutation in PA has been shown to enhance the activity of B/Victoria influenza virus RNA polymerase, thereby increasing its pathogenicity (Bae et al., 2018). In this study, it was found that none of the 17 sequences in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.2 had the K338R mutation, while all 7 sequences in the Victoria clade 1A.3a.1 had the K338R mutation in their PA subunit. This study analyzed the influenza epidemic and gene evolution variation in Jining City from 2021 to 2022, showing that the B/Victoria influenza virus’s antigenic epitopes have partially mutated and formed new variants. These new variants are poorly matched with the WHO-recommended northern hemisphere vaccine strains, which should be adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, the 24 nucleic acid and protein sequences in Jining have undergone some variation, displaying differences in variation sites, homology, evolutionary characteristics, and genetic distances. This suggests that the B/Victoria strain of influenza virus is still evolving and mutating; thus, influenza surveillance needs further strengthening.

A(H5N1) viruses continue to spread among wild birds and poultry in the United States and many regions of the world. Surveillance can also identify human infections with swine influenza A viruses, which are referred to as variant influenza A virus infections. These sporadic infections typically occur during the summer and early fall after exposures to pigs at agricultural fairs. Given the pandemic risk posed by novel influenza A virus infections, healthcare providers should remain alert to the possibility of human infections with influenza viruses that can spread between animals and people. During this COCA call, presenters will give a comprehensive overview of novel influenza A viruses, focused on avian influenza A(H5N1) virus and variant influenza viruses. They will discuss CDC’s guidance for clinicians on testing, specimen collection, and antiviral treatment for people with suspected or confirmed infections. Presenters will also address patient exposure histories and review questions to ask patients to help guide clinical diagnosis and testing for novel influenza A virus infections.

Here, we report interim findings on the primary and secondary objectives of the safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity of a quadrivalent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against seasonal influenza, mRNA-1010, from the first 2 parts of a 3-part, first-in-human, phase 1/2 clinical trial in healthy adults aged ≥18 years (NCT04956575). In the placebo-controlled Part 1, a single dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg) elicited hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers against vaccine-matched strains. In the active-comparator-controlled Part 2, mRNA-1010 (25 µg, 50 µg, or 100 µg) elicited higher HAI titers than a standard dose, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for influenza A strains and comparable HAI titers for influenza B strains. No safety concerns were identified; solicited adverse reactions were dose-dependent and more frequent after receipt of mRNA-1010 than the active comparator. These interim data support continued development of mRNA-1010.

However, the effectiveness of currently available influenza vaccines varies each season and is impacted by mismatch with circulating influenza strains, poor vaccine uptake, and weak, short-lived immunity2,3,4. Consequently, the burden of disease remains substantial worldwide2,5. Seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually, following a temporal circulation pattern, with increased cases during the winter months6. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza is estimated to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths worldwide each year2. While influenza affects all age groups, adults with chronic medical conditions7 and older adults8 are at increased risk of serious influenza-associated complications, with 67% of influenza deaths occurring in those ≥65 years of age9.Four types of influenza viruses exist: A, B, C, and D; however, only A and B are responsible for the majority of human illness, with influenza A the major cause of severe disease and death in older adults2,9,10,11. The main surface glycoprotein of influenza viruses is hemagglutinin (HA), which undergoes continual antigenic change (antigenic drift) that is particularly evident for type A and results in novel variant strains2,12,13. Accordingly, the WHO continuously monitors influenza activity and recommends seasonal influenza vaccine compositions twice a year that cover 1 strain for each of the influenza A subtypes (i.e., H1N1 and H3N2) and the influenza B lineages (i.e., Yamagata or Victoria lineage)2.Generally, the overall effectiveness of currently available seasonal influenza vaccines, which utilize egg-, cell-, or recombinant protein-based platforms3, is variable across different populations and seasons. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that overall vaccine effectiveness among the general population ranges between 40 and 60% during seasons when vaccines are well-matched to circulating strains14. Notably, in the most recent season (2021–2022), vaccine effectiveness against medically attended acute respiratory infection associated with A/H3N2 (the predominantly circulating strain) was only 16% for individuals of all ages15. Several factors can impact effectiveness, including population age, low vaccine-elicited immunogenicity, and strain mismatch2,13. Strain mismatch can in part be due to the lengthy production process, resulting in a long lag time from initial strain announcement to vaccine availability, and mutations acquired due to propagation of the virus in eggs or cells (used for the majority of seasonal influenza vaccines)3,16,17. Therefore, there remains a public health need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines.Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology has recently become a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches against infectious diseases18,19. As demonstrated by mRNA-based vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as mRNA-1273 (Spikevax®; Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA)20, this technology can enable rapid development of vaccines with a favorable safety profile and high effectiveness against disease21,22,23,24. An mRNA-based approach to seasonal influenza vaccines could offer several advantages over current methods, including an ability to rapidly respond to strain changes to potentially deploy vaccines more closely matched to circulating strains of a given influenza season and avoidance of egg- and cell-based acquired mutations that can limit vaccine effectiveness.The investigational mRNA-1010 vaccine is a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine encoding membrane-bound HA surface glycoproteins of four influenza strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) recommended by the WHO for cell- or recombinant vaccines2,3. Here, we report interim findings from a first-in-human, phase 1/2 clinical trial of mRNA-1010 in healthy adults aged ≥18 years that evaluated the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the vaccine against placebo (Part 1) or a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine as an active comparator (Part 2).ResultsParticipantsIn Part 1 of the study, a total of 180 participants aged ≥18 years were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1 dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg) between July 6, 2021, and August 18, 2021 (Fig. 1). All participants received vaccination; 6 participants subsequently discontinued from the study due to withdrawal of consent or were lost to follow-up. The majority of participants were White and non-Hispanic or Latino; in the mRNA-1010 groups, the median age was 51.0 years and 57.0% were female; in the placebo group, the median age was 50.0 years and 51.1% were female (Supplementary Table S1).Fig. 1: Participant disposition by study part.One participant in the mRNA-1010 100-µg group in Part 2 of the study died due to cardiac arrest. This adverse event was considered by the investigator as unrelated to the study vaccination. All randomly assigned participants who received study vaccination were included in the safety population; participants were included in the group based on the actual vaccine received. The immunogenicity per-protocol population included all randomly assigned participants who received vaccination and complied with immunogenicity blood sampling timing to have baseline and ≥1 post-vaccination time point assessment, did not have influenza infection at baseline through Day 29 (as documented by polymerase chain reaction), and had no major protocol deviation that impacted the immune response. mRNA messenger RNA. *There was 1 dosing error in Part 1 (n = 1 participant randomized to mRNA-1010 200 µg but received 100 µg) and 2 dosing errors in Part 2 (n = 1 participant randomized to mRNA-1010 25 µg but received 50 µg; n = 1 participant randomized to mRNA-1010 50 µg but received active comparator).Full size imageIn Part 2 of the trial, a total of 501 participants aged ≥18 years were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Afluria (n = 53) or mRNA-1010 (25 µg, n = 152; 50 µg, n = 149; 100 µg, n = 147) between November 10, 2021, and November 15, 2021; 498 participants received vaccination (Fig. 1). No participants in the Afluria group discontinued; reasons for study discontinuation in the mRNA-1010 groups were lost to follow-up (n = 9), withdrawal of consent (n = 5), and death (n = 1; not treatment related (see “Safety”). Most participants in Part 2 were White and non-Hispanic or Latino. In the mRNA-1010 groups, the median age was 52.0 years and 57.3% were female; in the Afluria group, the median age was 53.0 years and 54.7% were female (Supplementary Table S1).SafetyIn Part 1 of the trial, any solicited local ARs within 7 days of mRNA-1010 vaccination were reported by 82.6%, 85.7%, and 91.3% of participants aged 18–49 years in the 50-µg, 100-µg, and 200-µg groups, respectively, and by 63.6%, 92.0%, and 90.5% of participants aged ≥50 years, respectively (Fig. 2a). Any solicited local ARs after placebo were reported by 20.0% and 20.8% of participants aged 18–49 years or ≥50 years. Grade 3 local ARs were more frequent for participants aged 18–49 years and at the 100-µg and 200-µg mRNA-1010 dose levels. The most common AR was pain at the injection site (Supplementary Fig. S2); this AR was predominantly grade 1, although grade 2 pain was the most common AR after the 200-µg mRNA-1010 dose. Solicited systemic ARs within 7 days of mRNA-1010 vaccination were reported by 78.3%, 90.5%, and 91.3% of participants aged 18–49 years in the 50-µg, 100-µg, or 200-µg groups, respectively, and by 54.5%, 92.0%, and 95.2% of participants aged ≥50 years, respectively (Fig. 2a); 30.0% and 33.3% of participants aged 18–49 and ≥50 years reported a systemic AR after placebo, respectively. The most common systemic ARs were headache, fatigue, myalgia, and chills (Supplementary Fig. S2). Across all mRNA-1010 groups, participants aged 18–49 years more frequently reported grade 3 systemic ARs after vaccination than older participants (13.0–47.8% vs 9.1–23.8%). Overall, grade 3 systemic ARs were more common with higher mRNA-1010 dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg). No grade 4 local or systemic ARs were reported.Fig. 2: Summary of any solicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days after vaccination by age group in each study part.Percentages of participants in the solicited safety population reporting any solicited adverse reactions in Part 1 (a) or Part 2 (b). In Part 1, number of participants in the placebo group were 20 (18–49 years) and 24 (≥50 years); number of participants in the mRNA-1010 groups were 23 (50 µg), 21 (100 µg), and 23 (200 µg) for 18–49 years, and 22, (50 µg), 25 (100 µg), and 21 (200 µg) for ≥50 years. In Part 2, number of participants in the Afluria group were 21 (18–49 years), 19 (50–64 years), and 13 (≥65 years); number of participants in the mRNA-1010 groups were 60 (25 µg), 57 (50 µg), and 58 (100 µg) for 18–49 years; 58 (25 µg), 58 (50 µg), and 57 (100 µg), for 50–64 years; and 31 (25 µg), 31 (50 µg), and 30 (100 µg) for ≥65 years. mRNA, messenger RNA.Full size imageIn Part 2, any solicited local ARs within 7 days of mRNA-1010 vaccination were reported by 83.3%, 84.2%, and 93.1% of participants aged 18–49 years in the 25-µg, 50-µg, and 100-µg groups, respectively. Among participants aged 50–64 years, 72.4%, 84.5%, and 80.7% of participants reported local ARs for each respective vaccine group, and 67.7%, 83.9%, and 80.0% of participants ≥65 years, respectively, reported local ARs (Fig. 2b). Any solicited local ARs after Afluria were reported by 42.9%, 36.8%, and 30.8% of participants aged 18–49 years, 50 to 64 years, and ≥65 years, respectively. The most common local AR across vaccine groups was pain at the injection site (Supplementary Fig. S3A), which was predominantly grade 1. Across mRNA-1010 vaccine groups, grade 3 local ARs were more frequent in participants aged 18–49 years (0–15.5% participants) than in participants aged ≥50 years; grade 3 local ARs after Afluria were reported by 1 participant (5.3%) aged 50–64 years. In the 25-µg, 50-µg, or 100-µg mRNA-1010 groups, any solicited systemic ARs within 7 days of vaccination were reported by 85.0%, 73.7%, and 91.4%, respectively, of participants aged 18–49 years; 68.4%, 75.9%, and 75.4% of participants aged 50–64 years; and 48.4%, 77.4%, and 76.7% of participants ≥65 years (Fig. 2b). After Afluria, 42.9%, 31.6%, and 38.5% of participants aged 18–49 years, 50 to 64 years, and ≥65 years reported a systemic AR, respectively. Headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and chills were the most common systemic ARs (Supplementary Fig. S3). Across mRNA-1010 groups, fever (primarily grade 1 and 2) was reported by 10.2–22.4%, 3.6–8.6%, and 3.2–20.0% of participants aged 18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥65 years, respectively. Overall, grade 3 systemic ARs after mRNA-1010 vaccination were reported less frequently for older participants (aged ≥65 years) than those aged 18–49 years and 50–64 years. No grade 4 local or systemic ARs were reported during this part of the study.Within 28 days of vaccination in Part 1 of the trial, unsolicited TEAEs were reported by 6 to 7 participants (13.0–15.9%) across each mRNA-1010 group and 6 participants (13.3%) in the placebo group (Table 1). Seven TEAEs were considered treatment-related, including 1 in the placebo group. One participant in the placebo group reported 2 SAEs (acute cystitis and hyponatremia); no SAEs or severe AEs were reported after mRNA-1010 vaccination. MAAEs within 28 days after vaccination were reported by 1 to 3 participants (2.2–6.8%) and 3 participants (6.7%) after mRNA-1010 and placebo, respectively; none were considered related to study vaccination. No deaths or AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported up to Day 29.Table 1 Summary of unsolicited treatment-emergent adverse events through 28 days after vaccination by study part (safety population)Full size tableIn Part 2 of the trial, TEAEs within 28 days of vaccination were reported in 28–41 participants (18.7–27.9%) across mRNA-1010 groups and 8 participants (14.8%) in the Afluria group (Table 1). Twenty-five (5.6%) and 1 (1.9%) participants reported TEAEs that were considered treatment-related in the mRNA-1010 groups and the Afluria group, respectively. Treatment-related severe unsolicited TEAEs were reported by 2 participants (n = 1, mRNA-1010 50 µg (injection site erythema); n = 1, mRNA-1010 100 µg (headache)); neither were medically attended. MAAEs were reported by 8–17 participants (5.4–11.6%) and 4 participants (7.4%) in the mRNA-1010 and Afluria groups, respectively; 1 MAAE in the mRNA-1010 25-µg group was considered by the Investigator to be treatment-related (mild upper respiratory tract infection), despite a negative respiratory pathogen polymerase chain reaction panel. Three unsolicited SAEs were reported within 28 days of vaccination in the mRNA-1010 groups; all events were assessed as not related by the Investigator. Two SAEs were reported by participants with a significant medical history of cardiovascular disease (n = 1, mRNA-1010 100 µg (cardiac failure congestive in a participant with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and aortic insufficiency/stenosis; event was considered related to medication non-compliance); n = 1, mRNA-1010 50 µg (angina pectoris with negative troponins in a participant with a history of coronary artery disease)). The third SAE was a fatal event of unwitnessed cardiac arrest occurring 15 days after vaccination in a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. The participant reported grade 1 injection site pain on Days 2 through 6 after vaccination but did not report any AEs or safety complaints during the scheduled routine safety call at Day 12 after vaccination (3 days prior to his death). This event and the other 2 above-mentioned SAEs were reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board and were considered unrelated to study vaccination. No events of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported.In Part 1, sporadic grade 1 and 2 abnormalities for chemistry and hematology tests were observed in all groups, but there was no association with mRNA-1010 or dose level. Three grade 3 abnormalities were reported: 1 low hemoglobin level reported in the mRNA-1010 200-µg group, 1 low neutrophil count reported in the mRNA-1010 50-µg group, and 1 elevated alkaline phosphatase reported in the placebo group. No grade 4 laboratory test abnormalities were recorded in Part 1 up to Day 29. No safety laboratory tests were done in Part 2 of the study.ImmunogenicityIn Part 1 of the trial, all dose levels of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, and 200 µg) elicited immune responses in participants aged 18–49 years and ≥50 years against all vaccine-matched influenza strains at Day 29 (28 days after vaccination) as measured by HAI (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Immune responses after placebo remained close to baseline values. At Day 29, GMTs for all age groups combined exceeded a titer of 1:160 for all strains, which is above the 1:40 level associated with 50% protection against influenza illness25. All dose levels of mRNA-1010 generally elicited similar GMTs at Day 29, ranging from 343.8 to 598.2 for A/H1N1, 317.5 to 537.3 for A/H3N2, 173.7 to 281.0 for B/Victoria, and 324.0 to 456.4 for B/Yamagata. From baseline to Day 29, GMFRs for influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) exceeded the 4-fold rise threshold considered for seroconversion in both age groups; however, GMFRs for influenza B strains were lower and did not consistently exceed this 4-fold threshold (GMFRs, B/Victoria: 1.6–2.3 and 1.6–2.1 (18–49 years and ≥50 years, respectively); B/Yamagata: 2.8–3.4 and 3.2–4.9 (18–49 years and ≥50 years, respectively)), which might be driven by high titers at baseline (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S2). Seroconversion rates at Day 29 are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.Fig. 3: GMTs and GMFRs of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies for vaccine-matched seasonal influenza strains in adults in Part 1.Hemagglutination inhibition GMTs with associated 95% CIs against seasonal influenza A strains (A/Wisconsin/588/2019[H1N1]pdm09 and A/Hong Kong/45/2019[H3N2]) or influenza B strains (B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)) are shown at Day 1 (baseline) and Day 29 (28 days after vaccination) among participants a 18–49 years and b ≥50 years of age in the per-protocol population for Part 1. Dots correspond to participant-level titers (18–49 years, n = 19 (placebo), 22 (mRNA-1010 50 µg), 21 (mRNA-1010 100 µg), and 22 (mRNA-1010 200 µg); ≥50 years, n = 22 (placebo), 21 (mRNA-1010 50 µg), 24 (mRNA-1010 100 µg), and 19 (mRNA-1010 200 µg). GMFRs at Day 29 from Day 1 are shown above each Day 29 bar plot. LLOQs were 10 (H1N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) or 14 (H3N2); ULOQs were 6400 (H1N1, H3N2, and B/Yamagata) or 3200 (B/Victoria).

Among older adults in particular (aged ≥65 years), the ratio of GMTs (95% CIs) for mRNA-1010 versus Afluria ranged from 1.4 (0.6–3.3) to 2.3 (1.0–5.2) for A/H1N1 and 1.6 (0.8–3.2) to 2.9 (1.4–5.7) for A/H3N2 (Fig. 5). For influenza B strains (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata), GMTs at Day 29 across age groups were comparable between all mRNA-1010 dose levels and Afluria. For all age groups combined (Supplementary Fig. S4), GMTs across mRNA-1010 groups ranged from 351.2 to 492.2 for A/H1N1 (Afluria: 186.4), 170.0 to 239.3 for A/H3N2 (Afluria: 101.7), 110.9 to 136.6 for B/Victoria (Afluria: 160.1), and 238.7 to 249.6 for B/Yamagata (Afluria: 204.7); Supplementary Table S2 shows GMTs by each age group. GMFRs from baseline to Day 29 were higher with mRNA-1010 than Afluria for the influenza A strains and were comparable between vaccines for influenza B strains. For all age groups combined (Supplementary Fig. S5), ratios of GMTs (95% CIs) for mRNA-1010 versus Afluria ranged from 1.9 (1.3–2.7) to 2.7 (1.9–3.9) for A/H1N1, 1.8 (1.3–2.5) to 2.6 (1.8–3.6) for A/H3N2, 0.7 (0.5–0.9) to 0.9 (0.7–1.1) for B/Victoria and 1.1 (0.9–1.5) to 1.2 (0.9–1.6) for B/Yamagata. Ratios of GMTs were generally consistent across participants aged 18–49 years, 50–64 years, and ≥65 years (Fig. 5). Seroconversion rates at Day 29 trended higher for the mRNA-1010 groups compared with Afluria for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B/Yamagata, while comparable seroconversion rates to Afluria were observed for B/Victoria (Supplementary Table S2).Fig. 4: GMTs and GMFRs of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies for vaccine-matched seasonal influenza strains in adults in Part 2.Hemagglutination inhibition GMTs with associated 95% CIs against seasonal influenza A strains (A/Wisconsin/588/2019[H1N1]pdm09 and A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020[H3N2]) or influenza B strains (B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)) are shown at Day 1 (baseline) and Day 29 (28 days after vaccination) among participants a 18–49 years, b 50–64 years, and c ≥65 years of age in the per-protocol population for Part 2. Dots corresponding to participant-level titers; numbers of participants in the Afluria groups were 20 (18–49 years), 20 (50–64 years), and 12 (≥65 years); numbers of participants in the mRNA-1010 groups were 55 (25 µg), 53 (50 µg), and 58 (100 µg) for 18–49 years; 57 (25 µg), 54 (50 µg), and 54 (100 µg) for 50–64 years; and 31 (25 µg), 31, (50 µg), and 30 (100 µg) for ≥65 years. GMFRs at Day 29 from Day 1 are shown above each Day 29 bar plot. LLOQs were 10 for each influenza strain; ULOQs were 6400 (H1N1 and B/Yamagata), 1280 (H3N2), or 3200 (B/Victoria).

The placebo-controlled Part 1 of this study showed that a single dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg) elicited HAI antibodies against vaccine-matched strains at 28 days after vaccination in both younger and older healthy adults. Based on the comparable immunogenicity across the mRNA-1010 dose levels in Part 1, a lower dose level range of mRNA-1010 (25 µg, 50 µg, or 100 µg) was evaluated in a larger number of participants in Part 2. Findings in Part 2 suggest that mRNA-1010 could elicit higher immunogenicity than a standard-dose influenza vaccine for influenza A strains and comparable immunogenicity for influenza B strains in medically stable adults. Higher responses for influenza A strains remain important, as the A/H3N2 strain in particular causes a larger burden of severe outcomes in older adults9,10, thus raising the potential for mRNA-1010 to further address this burden in vulnerable age groups.In both parts of the trial, no treatment-related SAEs were reported nor any safety concerns identified. In Part 1 of the trial, the frequency and severity of solicited ARs generally increased in a dose-dependent manner and was higher among younger (18–49 years) than older (≥50 years) adults. In Part 2, all three mRNA-1010 dose levels had an acceptable reactogenicity profile. For all age groups, solicited ARs were more common with mRNA-1010 than Afluria and were typically grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. No grade 4 solicited ARs were reported for any vaccine group and grade 3 events were less frequent for lower dose levels and for older adults (≥65 years). Overall, these safety data support the continued evaluation of mRNA-1010.A single dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg) in Part 1 of the trial elicited HAI antibodies against all vaccine-included strains at Day 29 in adults irrespective of participant age. Overall, the 50-µg dose level induced HAI titers that were comparable to those elicited by higher dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg). In both younger and older adults, the GMFRs from baseline exceeded 4-fold for influenza A strains, which is notable, as influenza A strains are the primary drivers of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in older adults9. Although the 4-fold threshold was not consistently met for influenza B strains, these findings could reflect high baseline titers; however, lower influenza B strain responses have also been observed for other licensed influenza vaccines1. Immunogenicity findings from Part 2 of the trial showed that all dose levels of mRNA-1010 (25 µg, 50 µg, or 100 µg) elicited high levels of HAI antibodies on Day 29, exceeding the 1:40 threshold associated with a 50% reduced risk of infection. Overall, regardless of participant age, all dose levels of mRNA-1010 induced functional antibody responses that were higher than Afluria for influenza A strains and were similar for influenza B strains. Notably, GMT ratios for mRNA-1010 versus Afluria were generally in line with those from a clinical trial comparing enhanced influenza vaccines to a standard dose vaccine in older adults1. Taken together, these preliminary immunogenicity findings suggest that mRNA-1010 has the potential to further address the high burden of influenza, particularly in older adults.Overall, these first-in-human safety and immunogenicity findings in adults aged ≥18 years support the continued investigation of mRNA-1010 against seasonal influenza and highlight the potential of the mRNA platform to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Vaccines using mRNA technology are readily amenable to both antigenic drift and shift in influenza strains, allowing for rapid deployment of vaccines that are more closely matched to currently circulating strains and can avoid aberrant mutations in vaccine antigens caused by egg- or cell-culture approaches26,27. In addition, mRNA-based platforms can allow for expression of multiple antigens, raising the possibility for increased breadth of protective responses against seasonal influenza or against multiple respiratory diseases. Further, based on findings with mRNA-1273, an mRNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, mRNA vaccines may also induce strong cellular immune responses and prolonged germinal center reactions28,29,30,31 that can improve protection in older adults, a population at particular risk for infection and severe outcomes10. Further laboratory assessments to evaluate these potential advantages are ongoing. While mRNA-1010 had an acceptable safety profile in this trial, transient solicited ARs were more common after mRNA-1010 than with the active comparator. Additional clinical trials are ongoing to further assess the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of this vaccine and a licensed influenza vaccine comparator (NCT05566639 and NCT05415462).Study strengths include the randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled (Part 1) and active comparator (Part 2) design. The study design did not specify any hypothesis testing; thus, the sample sizes of participants enrolled (Part 1, N = 180; Part 2, N = 501) restricted statistical comparisons across groups. Potential limitations of the study include the enrollment of higher percentages of White, non-Hispanic or Latino participants that may limit generalizability to other demographics. Additional information on the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1010 will be gained from the final analyses of these 2 parts of the phase 1/2 trial, which will assess the longevity of immune responses through Day 181, as well as the phase 2 extension of this trial that will evaluate lower dose levels of mRNA-1010 in adults. Subsequent analyses will also include assessments of HA-specific T-cell and B-cell responses. Larger phase 3 trials of mRNA-1010 safety and immunogenicity in ~6000 adults aged ≥18 years (NCT05415462) as well as the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 in approximately 23000 adults aged ≥50 years (NCT05566639) are also currently underway. Further studies will also evaluate mRNA-based seasonal influenza vaccines against enhanced influenza vaccines (ie, high-dose, recombinant protein, or adjuvanted vaccines) in adult populations (NCT05397223, NCT05606965, and NCT05333289).In conclusion, the interim analysis findings from the placebo-controlled Part 1 and active comparator controlled Part 2 of this phase 1/2 trial of mRNA-1010 in adults aged ≥18 years raised no safety concerns and showed that the vaccine was immunogenic against all tested influenza strains in both younger and older adults. Further, the investigational mRNA-1010 vaccine elicited either higher or comparable immune responses to a standard-dose, quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. These findings support the continued clinical development of mRNA-1010 to combat seasonal influenza.MethodsTrial design and participantsThis is a first-in-human, phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blinded study at 20 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA-1010 in adults ≥18 years of age (NCT04956575). The study comprises 3 parts, which assessed mRNA-1010 or placebo in healthy adults in Part 1, followed by additional dose-ranging assessments in Parts 2 and 3 to evaluate mRNA-1010 versus licensed comparator vaccines in medically stable adults. This report summarizes interim findings for Parts 1 and 2 of the study, with final results to be separately reported.Eligible participants in Part 1 of the study were healthy adults ≥18 years of age (Supplementary Fig. S1). A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as further design details for each part of this study, are included in the Supplementary Methods as well as the Trial Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan within the Supplementary Information. The initial stage of Part 1 planned for ~36 participants (9 participants in each group) to be randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive a single dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, or 200 µg) or placebo. The randomized allocation schedule was generated by the sponsor’s biostatistics department or designee. Safety data up to 7 days after vaccination were reviewed by a blinded internal safety team; after confirmation that no study pause rules were met, the remaining participants (~36 in each group for a total of 144 participants) were randomly assigned in the Part 1 expansion stage. Randomization at this stage was stratified by age (18–49 years and ≥50 years) and was balanced within each group. Strain selection for mRNA-1010 in Part 1 was based on WHO recommendations for the 2021 Southern Hemisphere (SH) vaccine composition.Part 2 of the study enrolled medically stable adults ≥18 years of age, excluding those adults with chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical intervention within the 3 months before enrollment and with immunocompromising conditions or medications. Approximately 500 participants were planned to be randomly assigned (3:3:3:1) to receive a single dose of mRNA-1010 (25 µg, 50 µg, or 100 µg) or a licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (Afluria®; Seqirus Pty Ltd, Parkville, Victoria, Australia; Supplementary Fig. S1). The sponsor’s biostatistics department or designee generated the randomized allocation schedule for vaccine assignment. Randomization was performed in parallel among the 4 vaccine groups, and participants were stratified by age (18–49 years, 50–64 years, or ≥65 years) and vaccination status in the previous influenza season (received or not received). As vaccinations during Part 2 of the study were planned during the NH influenza season, strain selection for mRNA-1010 in Part 2 was based on WHO recommendations for the 2021/2022 NH vaccine composition.In each part of the study, participants were followed for approximately 6 months, with a single dose of the vaccine administered on Day 1 and the final study visit on Day 181 (Month 6). Both parts of the study had a planned interim analysis to evaluate safety and immunogenicity data of all participants through Day 29. Participants in Part 1 were recommended to receive a licensed 2021–2022 NH seasonal influenza vaccine after Day 29 of the study.The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable laws, and regulatory requirements, as well as International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines. The protocol was approved by the central institutional review board (Advarra, Inc., Columbia, MD) prior to study initiation, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment.VaccinesIn Part 1, participants received mRNA-1010 or placebo (normal saline), while in Part 2, participants received mRNA-1010 or a licensed standard dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Afluria). mRNA-1010 includes mRNAs encoding for the surface glycoprotein HA of four influenza virus strains formulated in lipid nanoparticles. In Part 1, mRNA-1010 encoded influenza strains recommended by the WHO for 2020-2021 SH cell- or recombinant-based vaccines (see Supplementary Methods for details). In Part 2, mRNA-1010 encoded strains recommended by the WHO for 2021–2022 NH cell- or recombinant-based vaccines (see Supplementary Methods for details). mRNA-1010 was provided as a sterile liquid for injection and diluted to different dose levels with normal saline. All vaccines were administered intramuscularly as a single 0.5-mL injection.ObjectivesThe primary objectives of Part 1 were to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of mRNA-1010 (50 µg, 100 µg, and 200 µg) versus placebo and to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of mRNA-1010 against vaccine-matched influenza A and B strains at Day 29. The objectives of Part 2 were to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1010 (25 µg, 50 µg, and 100 µg; primary) and to evaluate the humoral immunogenicity of mRNA-1010 and active comparator against vaccine-matched influenza A and B strains at Day 29 (primary and secondary).Safety assessmentsSafety endpoints included solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) for 7 days after vaccination, safety laboratory abnormalities (Part 1 only), unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 28 days after vaccination, as well as serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs), and medically attended AEs (MAAEs) through the end of the study (Day 181). Interim safety data through Day 29 are included in this report. Participants used an electronic diary to record local ARs (ie, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site hardness, or axillary swellingenderness ipsilateral to the side of injection), or systemic ARs (ie, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, chills, and fever). Safety laboratory assessments in Part 1 (at baseline and Day 8) included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine.Immunogenicity assessmentsBlood samples for immunogenicity assessments were collected on Days 1 (baseline), 8 (Part 1 only), 29, and 181 (end of study). This report summarizes immunogenicity assessments at baseline and Day 29. Immunogenicity endpoints included geometric mean titers (GMTs) at Day 1 and 29, geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) at Day 29 over Day 1 (baseline), and percentage of participants with seroconversion at Day 29 of serum anti-HA antibodies against vaccine-matched influenza A and B strains as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay using red blood cells from guinea pig and cell-grown viruses as described in the Supplementary Methods.Statistical analysesThis phase 1/2 study did not test any formal statistical hypotheses. Sample size (described in the Supplementary Methods) was considered sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of the safety and immunogenicity of different dose levels of mRNA-1010. All safety assessments except for solicited local and systemic ARs were assessed in the safety population, which included all randomized participants who received vaccination. Solicited ARs were assessed in all participants in the safety population who contributed any solicited AR data (solicited safety population). The number of events of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs were summarized, while descriptive summary statistics were provided for all other safety analyses.Immunogenicity analyses were performed in the per-protocol population, which included all randomly assigned participants who received vaccination and complied with immunogenicity blood sampling timing to have baseline and ≥1 post-vaccination time point assessment, did not have influenza infection at baseline through Day 29 (as documented by polymerase chain reaction), and had no major protocol deviation that impacted the immune response. The geometric mean of specific antibody titers with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at Day 29 and GMFRs of specific antibody titers with corresponding 95% CI at Day 29 over Day 1 (baseline) were calculated for each vaccination group; 95% CIs were calculated based on the t distribution of the log 2-transformed values and then back transformed to the original scale. The seroconversion rate from baseline was determined along with two-sided 95% CIs using the Clopper–Pearson method. The rate of seroconversion was defined as the percentage of participants with either a prevaccination HAI titer <1:10 and a postvaccination HAI titer ≥1:40 or a prevaccination HAI titer ≥1:10 and a minimum fourfold rise in postvaccination HAI antibody titer. In Part 2, GMTs and seroconversion rates at Day 29 were compared in the mRNA-1010 groups with the active comparator group (see Supplement for details). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Back to Resources No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs No greater risk of reaction than for those without an allergy Share No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs June 22, 2023 No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs For many years, people with an egg allergy were told to avoid or take special precautions when getting a flu shot because most influenza vaccines are grown in eggs and contain a tiny amount of egg protein. A practice parameter from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters stresses that people with egg allergy should receive their yearly flu shot, and that no special precautions are required. Health care providers often ask those getting flu shots if they are allergic to eggs. Health care providers and people with egg allergy should know there is no need to ask this question anymore, and no need to take any special precautions. Overwhelming evidence has shown that a flu shot poses no greater risk to those with egg allergy than those without. There have been dozens of studies involving thousands of patients with egg allergy who have received a flu shot without allergic reactions – including hundreds with life-threatening egg allergy. This is because the influenza vaccine does not contain enough egg protein to cause an allergic reaction, even in patients with severe egg allergy. The practice parameter stresses that no special precautions are needed or recommended for those with egg allergy. There is no longer a need to: see an allergy specialist for the flu shot; give special flu shots that don’t contain traces of egg; require longer-than-normal observation periods after the shot; or even ask about egg allergy before giving the vaccine. If the vaccine is age-appropriate, it can be used for anyone with or without egg allergy. These recommendations from the allergy community are consistent with those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, all emphasizing the safety and importance of egg-allergic patients receiving their annual influenza vaccine. There are hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States every year because of the flu, most of which could be prevented with a flu shot. Egg allergy primarily affects young children, who are also particularly vulnerable to the flu. It’s very important that everyone, including children with egg allergy, is encouraged to get a flu shot. One of the main concerns with any vaccine is a severe allergic reaction – known as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can happen with any vaccine at a rate of about one per million, no matter the type or whether the person has an allergy. That is why it is always recommended that all personnel and facilities providing vaccines have procedures in place for responding to this rare event.

SAVE & ACCEPTPhysical Activity Is Associated with Fewer Influenza and Pneumonia Deaths - BJSM blog - social media's leading SEM voice Skip to content Home Submit a blog BJSM Physical Activity Is Associated with Fewer Influenza and Pneumonia Deaths Posted on June 23, 2023 by bjsm Authors: Bryant Webber; Heather Yun; Geoffrey Whitfield After reviewing 25 studies during the pandemic, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that being physically inactive increases the chance of severe COVID-19 illness. Given emerging interest in the relationship between physical activity and infectious diseases, we explored the impact of types and amounts of physical activity on influenza and pneumonia deaths. Analyzed collectively (as they often are in vital statistics systems), influenza and pneumonia are a top-ten cause of death in the United States and around the world. This blog provides an overview of our recently published review. Why is this study important? Guidelines from the United States and World Health Organization recommend physical activity for a variety of physical and mental health benefits. Released respectively in 2018 and 2020, these guidelines do not include infectious disease control as a benefit. Our study (recently published in BJSM) provides compelling evidence that regular leisure-time physical activity can lower the risk of dying from influenza or pneumonia. The evidence is compelling because it is based on a large and nationally representative sample, for whom we had baseline physical activity information and up to 22 years of follow-up data. Our findings may be valuable for health care providers and their patients as they search for additional actions, beyond vaccination, to protect themselves against influenza and pneumonia. How did the study collect physical activity and death data? We reviewed data on leisure-time physical activity participation from more than 575,000 U.S. adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1998 and 2018. We categorized adults as meeting the guidelines if they reported at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and at least 2 episodes/week of muscle-strengthening activity. We also categorized them into five levels of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (<10, 10–149, 150–300, 301–600, and >600 min/week) and five levels of muscle-strengthening activity (<2, 2, 3, 4–6, and ≥7 episodes/week). Using the National Death Index, we determined who had died from influenza or pneumonia through 2019. We then assessed the risk of influenza and pneumonia death by different levels of physical activity, controlling for other factors that may have increased or reduced this risk, such as demographics, smoking and alcohol habits, body mass index, vaccination status, and health conditions (such as heart disease and asthma). What did the study find? A total of 1,516 influenza and pneumonia deaths were recorded among study participants. Adults who reported meeting the aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity guidelines were 48% less likely to die from influenza and pneumonia compared to those who reported not meeting the guidelines. We also found that any level of aerobic physical activity, even at amounts below the recommended level, lowered the risk of death from these causes compared to no aerobic activity. For muscle-strengthening activity, adults who performed 2 episodes/week had a 47% lower risk of death from influenza or pneumonia than those who performed fewer than 2 episodes/week. In contrast, risk was 41% higher among adults reporting very high levels of muscle-strengthening activity (7 or more episodes/week). What are the key take-home points? Regular physical activity may reduce the risk of death from influenza and pneumonia. Lower risk is seen even with low levels of aerobic physical activity (at least 10 min/week) and with just 2 episodes/week of muscle-strengthening activity. Health care providers may wish to screen all their patients for physical activity and promote aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity among those who are inactive. In the bigger picture, this study adds to the growing body of science showing that physical activity is not just valuable for preventing chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. It may even have a role in preventing death from influenza and pneumonia.

Researchers have just uncovered how it's able to thrive by slicing and dicing genetic material inside our cells while keeping itself intact. The finding might open a new pathway to combating the virus.According to the World Health Organization, the flu causes three to five million cases of severe illness each year, with 290,000-650,000 deaths from respiratory complications. The two main viruses that cause the flu — influenza A and B — have existed for centuries and, although some antiviral advances have been made, these bugs have proven extremely difficult to eradicate. Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) have identified at least one secret to the success of influenza A, a finding that might arm researchers with another way to combat it.The finding hinges on understanding how the virus is able to wield a protein known as PA-X to make myriad cuts in the RNA of host cells without harming its own RNA.Host shutoffWhen the flu bug uses this protein to slice up the RNA in its host, it is able to keep the RNA from doing one of its key jobs when it comes to infections – triggering the immune system to fight the bug. It also allows the virus to take over the host cell and create copies of itself in a process known as host shutoff. Yet, somehow the protein doesn't affect the virus' own RNA.What the researchers found is that the RNA sequence targeted by PA-X is extremely specific. In fact, it's one that exists in abundance in humans and other animals susceptible to infection by the virus, but one that is barely found in the virus' own RNA.If researchers can learn to block this scalpel-like precision of PA-X, they may come up with a tool that can help bolster our defenses against influenza A.Flipping the scriptThe UW-Madison findings further shed light on an ability that's not been seen in viruses before called selfon-self recognition. It refers to a mechanism by which the virus can differentiate between its own RNA and that of its host. While it's been seen in reverse – host cells being able to tell the difference between themselves and viruses – knowing that the virus itself can do it is new information."It's interesting to see the virus also has found a way to do that, flipping the script," said lead author, Marta Gaglia, a UW-Madison associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology.The team plans to continue its research focused on PA-X and hopes to unravel how the protein and the sequences of RNA it acts on might help identify stronger and weaker strains of the flu."An ideal world that we would like to get to is: If you give me a sequence, I could take a look and say, 'This is a really active version,' or, 'This is a less active version,'" said Gaglia. "And in simplistic terms, that could indicate whether it could be a more dangerous strain."The research has been published in the journal Nature Microbiology.Source: UW-Madison Tags Infectious DiseasesInfluenzaInfectionsRNAUniversity of Wisconsin Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn 3 comments Michael Franco Michael Franco has combined a masters degree in creative writing with a passion for peeking under the hood of life on Earth to write about the serious and silly sides of science and technology for years.

Karmudjun June 26, 2023 12:37 PM Once again Science provides an incremental understanding of a common disease progression. Knowing how influenza uses a CRISPR type of process that is targeting susceptible RNA while protecting viral RNA codes merely gives us more knowledge of the viral process. When an intervention is tested, the microbiology - the molecular biology of the influenza attack may be muted in the beginnings of infection.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 22 June 2023 New interim analysis from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) indicates that excess deaths in England associated with flu infection were higher (14,500) than the average figure (13,500) for the 5 years before the pandemic. This is the highest figure since the 2017 to 2018 season, when there were 22,500 excess deaths associated with flu. The report also shows that the season started relatively early in the winter, but peaked quickly. Hospitalisations across all ages were higher than average, although some of this may be attributed to increased testing by the NHS compared to previous winters. There are likely multiple reasons for the above average number of deaths and hospitalisations, but the impact will have been influenced by the dominant circulating strain. Influenza A(H3N2), which was the predominant subtype in 2022 to 2023, is known to be more severe in older age groups. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that lower population immunity due to reduced flu circulation from social distancing measures during the pandemic meant that, overall, the population was more susceptible to catching flu than usual, contributing to the timing, shape and scale of the influenza season. The vaccines were well matched to the predominant circulating strain. Vaccine effectiveness against being hospitalised by flu was analysed by looking at patients who were tested for influenza, and was consistent with analysis from previous seasons. The analysis found that getting vaccinated cuts the risk of being hospitalised by flu by a quarter in adults aged 65 years and older, a third in other adults and reduces the risk two-thirds in children. This is on top of the collective protection we all get from the vaccines reducing flu transmission. This indicates that flu vaccination again this season had an important role preventing serious illness and keeping people out of hospital. Dr Conall Watson, Consultant Epidemiologist, UKHSA, said: Flu returned at scale last winter after being locked out by COVID-19 control measures. Lower population immunity following flu’s absence played a part in the season starting relatively early and led to lots of people catching flu in a short timeframe. Many people needed advice from NHS 111 services and there were high numbers of severe flu episodes that required hospital care, placing pressure on the heath system. The best protection against getting seriously ill and needing hospitalisation is to get the flu vaccine ahead of winter. We have clear evidence that the protection from last season’s vaccine programme helped prevent a much worse winter. Plans for the delivery of this winter’s flu vaccine programme are well underway and we strongly advise all those eligible to take up the offer of vaccination this autumn.

Georgia Department of Natural Resources survey leader Bob Sargent said he breathed a sigh of relief when it became clear that the eagles’ nesting rates were back to within the normal range. “Last year’s exceptionally poor nesting results on the coast, as well as the lower than usual success rate in southwest Georgia, was worrisome because those areas combine for about 85% of our known eagle nests,” he said. “The comeback of the bald eagle in Georgia is a great conservation success story, but the species is listed as threatened in the state and if high nest failures continued they could chip away at population gains,” he added. “I’m pleased to see the nest success rates rebound this year.” The number of successful nests on the coast dropped about 30% last year, and fewer than half of the nests surveyed produced even one eagle. Bald eagles typically lay up to three eggs each year, according to the American Eagle Foundation. Newly-hatched eaglets are completely reliant on their parents, but they grow quickly, usually taking their first flight at 10 to 14 weeks old. This year’s survey found 232 newly-fledged eagles across the state, averaging 1.6 young per nest, slightly more than the state’s long-term average. Nests along the coast this year produced an average at 1.5 young per nest, amounting to 89 eaglets fledged from 59 nests, compared with 50 eaglets fledged from only 34 successful nests last year. In southwest Georgia, the birds went from producing an average of 1.5 fledglings from 62 nests to an average 1.6 from 69 nests. Sargent said no influenza cases have been reported in bald eagles in Georgia for more than a year, and there have been no cases in other species for about four months. The DNR calls the recovery of the bald eagle in Georgia an environmental success story. According to the department, the state went from no known successful nests during most of the 1970s to one in 1981, 48 by the turn of the century and more than 200 today. The department cites a U.S. ban on the pesticide DDT in 1972, the enactment of the federal Clean Water and Clean Air acts, protection through the Endangered Species Act, increased public awareness, restoration of local populations through release programs and forest regrowth as factors in that recovery.

While the temporal aspects of viral spread at the epidemiological level have been increasingly well characterized, the spatial aspects of viral spread are still understudied due to a striking absence of theoretical expectations of how spatial dynamics may impact the temporal dynamics of viral populations. Characterizing the spatial transmission and understanding the factors driving it are important for anticipating local timing of disease incidence and for guiding more informed control strategies. Using a unique data set from Nova Scotia, Canada, the objective of this study is to apply a new novel method that recovers a spatial network of the influenza-like viral spread where the regions in their dominance are identified and ranked. We, then, focus on identifying regional predictors of those dominant regions. Our analysis uncovers 18 key regional drivers among 112 regions, each distinguished by unique community-level vulnerability factors such as demographic and economic characteristics. These findings offer valuable insights for implementing targeted public health interventions and allocating resources effectively.

The importance of understanding the dynamics of underlying process in viral spread in response to its epidemiological factors such as weather-dependent correlates and most importantly non-pharmaceutical interventions has become more evident with the recent COVID-19 pandemic. While a large number of studies have examined individual-level risk factors for COVID-19, few studies have examined geographic hotspots and community drivers associated with spatial patterns in local transmission.This study aims to offer insights into the socio-spatial factors impacting the spatial distribution of influenza-like illness by utilizing a novel methodological approach and unique granular data at the FSA level. Through the identification of dominant regional drivers and their associated socio-spatial predictors, our work seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the factors shaping the spatial transmission network. We hope our findings can help inform public health policy discussions, potentially enabling more targeted and effective interventions in addressing infectious diseases like COVID-19 and promoting healthier communities.Studies investigating outbreaks by social geography provide us invaluable tools for understanding spatial and temporal determinants of the spread. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, it has been well-demonstrated that social, geographic, and economic factors impact the rate of infectious disease transmission1,2,3,4,5,6. Socio-spatial influences that have historically contributed to the rapid spread of infections are poor hygiene6,7,8,9,10, low income6,8,11,12,13,14, high population density6,15, public and mass transit7,16,17, malnutrition18,19,20, and disadvantaged socioeconomic status21. There are several recent studies22,23,24,25,26,27 focusing on spatial risk factors associated with the COVID-19 spread. The evidence unambiguously shows that climatic variables, mobility restrictions, and place-based factors like median household income, income inequality, and ethnic diversity in the local population explain a significant spatial variation in COVID-19 incidence. Overall, these studies report strong evidence of the spatial associations between the COVID-19 spread with selected local socioeconomic factors.This study extends the previous work that investigates how contextual factors can contribute to the spatial distribution of a viral spread in several new directions. Unlike studies using cross-sectional incidence densities, regional hotspots, or spatial clusters (Spatial Scan Statistics28), we use a novel method related to a recent literature on granular time series29 to explore the formation of spatial dependence in the network of regions. We identify and rank the dominance of each region in the spatial transmission network using the temporal dynamics in the data. With the application of this new method to epidemiological surveillance, we uncover "dominant regional drivers" and associated socio-spatial predictors rather than their associations with regional differences in incidence densities. The set of regional attributes used to identify socio-spatial factors of a spread in earlier studies are very limited due to its availability at a finer spatial scale (i.e., at the postal code). For example, most studies use county-level geographical classifications in the U.S. with few selected variables that are manually identified with a prior knowledge. We use regional data at the FSA (3-digit postal codes—Forward Sorting Area) level with more than 1400 demographic, economic, and social regional variables. Finally, to isolate important space-specific predictors of being a "dominant regional driver" of a viral pathogen, we exploit a framework that provides unbiased conditional variable importance yielded by random forest for feature selection.DataIn this study, our focus is on the province of Nova Scotia, Canada, which is situated on the east coast as one of the country's Atlantic provinces. Covering an area of approximately 55,284 square kilometers (21,345 square miles), Nova Scotia ranks as the second-smallest province in Canada. With a population of around one million, a substantial portion resides in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). As the capital city of the province, Halifax serves as a major economic and cultural hub for the region. The climate in Nova Scotia is primarily influenced by its maritime location, resulting in comparatively mild weather conditions throughout the year.This study uses a confidential and administrative dataset obtained as a part of Research Nova Scotia (RNS) project (HRC-2020-112) investigating the efficacy of mobility restrictions. The project’s research team selected to the Nova Scotia COVID-19 Research Coalition is the only (as of March 2022) group of researchers that have been permitted to access the data out of Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA). We start with a heatmap that summarizes the test numbers for Nova Scotia and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) in Fig. 1.Figure 1COVID-19 Tests in Nova Scotia, Canada: March-October 2020.

Beginning in the first week of March 2020, the local health authority implemented a set of testing guidelines for COVID-19. Individuals experiencing two or more symptoms such as fever (higher than 38C), cough, sore throat, runny nose, and headache were instructed to call 811, which functioned as an initial assessment point operated by registered nurses. The number of daily tests conducted substantially increased, ranging from 700 to 1200, with positivity rates between 1 and 3%. As COVID-19 tests during the first 4 months of the initial wave in 2020 were regulated by the 811 Triage, each referral by the triage represents a significant and accurate level of information about the spatial and temporal distribution of influenza-like illness.We received the test data in May 2021 containing information by FSA with few unique characteristics: number of tests each day, average age, gender distribution, delay between test and test results, and the test results (positive or negative). The temporal structure of the test data in our study is highly granular, with daily records provided by test centers in each Forward Sortation Area (FSA) in Nova Scotia. Although the COVID-19 case numbers are very rare around 1000 incidents in the first 3 months of the pandemic, this level of detail enables us to comprehensively analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of influenza-like illness within the province.As a result of the stringent triage process prior to COVID-19 testing, the number of individuals directed to test centers accurately reflects the daily count of symptomatic people who do not have COVID-19 but are experiencing influenza-like illness within each FSA in the province. We employ the incidence density (also known as the incidence rate, calculated as the number of symptomatic individuals/population) from the 1st of March to the 1st of July in 2020 for our analysis. The primary reason for confining our examination to the initial 4 months of the pandemic is the considerable alteration in the testing procedure that took place after this period. As a result, the dataset from the first 4 months serves as a highly focused and precise representation of the spatial and temporal distribution of influenza-like illness.The data for the socio-spatial risk factors are obtained from Canadian Census Analyser (CHASS) for the year 2016 at the FSA level [Although the 2021 Canadian Census was made available in early 2023, at the time of this study, "Profile of Forward Sortation Areas (FSA)" was not available at Canadian Census Analyser.]. The census profile variables are grouped in 16 subcategories: Population and Dwellings, Age and Sex, Dwelling (dwelling characteristics and household size), Marital Status, Language, Income, Knowledge of Language, Immigration, Aboriginals and Visible Minorities, Housing, Ethnic Origin, Education, Labour, Journey to Work, Language of Work, Mobility. In each category, variables represent averaged values at each FSA and for each gender type. When we include all categories, we obtain more than 1400 socio-spatial variables for each of 112 FSAs in Nova Scotia. Although the richness of data at this level of spatial scale is very desirable, it brings issues due to the curse of dimensionality, which will be addressed later.MethodsDominant units using graphical modelsDominant units are units which influence the entire cross-section, that is all other units. In factor models they can often be modelled as observed common factors29. The degree a cross-sectional unit influences others varies. If a unit affects only the units closest to it, a shock of such unit will wear out when travelling through the network. This concept is called weak or spatial dependence and usually estimated by spatial methods. An additional unit, marked in red, is connected to two neighbours. The figure on the left in Fig. 2 describes such a setup. Dominant units in turn affect all other units and are at the core of a star type network (on the right): when the dominant unit Number 1 experiences a shock, this shock will influence all other units. Further, if the number of units increases, dominant units will affect those as well.Figure 2The difference between spatial and network analyses.Full size imageThe identification of dominant units has recently received much attention and can be differentiated into two strands. One based on correlation matrices and the other on measures of connectedness. There are few recent examples for the former29 and for the latter Kapetanios et al.30 and Pesaran and Yang31. Other contributions such as Ditzen and Ravazzolo32 or Gumundsson and Brownlees33 combine both.Kapetanios et al.30 estimate the number of dominant units from residual variances from regressions of the individual time series on a prespecified number of common factors. In a second step the variances are thresholded to identify the dominant units. In case the dominant units affect only a subset of the other units, the authors propose a multiple testing approach34 on the thresholded variances. A disadvantage of the approach is that it requires precise knowledge of the number of common factors and a threshold. Pesaran and Yang31 propose an extremum estimator for degree of dominance based on a network or spatial approach. The estimator is based on the ratio between the maximum and of the sum of individual connectivity measures such as a spatial weight matrix.Brownlees and Mesters29 define dominant units with respect to the column norm of the concentration matrix. This implies that in a first step the inverse of the covariance matrix is calculated, limiting the approach to data with more observations than variables. The number of dominant units is then estimated using a growth criterion using a similar approach as the eigenvalue ratio criterion proposed in Ahn and Horenstein35. Finally, Gumundsson and Brownlees33 identify dominant groups in a VAR using eigenvalues of the autoregressive coefficients. Both methods use the intuitive way to identify dominant units using covariance matrices. However, this is impossible if the number of variables is larger than the number of observations. A partial correlation matrix would be more precise, but hinges on estimation problems and suffers from potential noise in the correlations. A solution is to estimate the covariance matrix using dimensions reduction methods such as the lasso estimator. This approach is followed by Ditzen and Ravazzolo32. The authors suggest identifying dominant units using a two-step approach. In the first step a graphical network is estimated using a lasso estimator, following on the lines of Meinshausen and Bühlmann36 and Sulaimanov and Koeppl37. In a second step the estimated inverse of the covariance matrix is then used to determine the number of factors as in Brownlees and Mesters29. A disadvantage of the approach is that it assumes at least one dominant unit. Important to note is that, with exception of Gumundsson and Brownlees33, the here mentioned literature originates from factor models. Dominant units are modelled as a special form of a common factor. This is very different from using lasso methods to select the appropriate number of lags in a VAR.Rigorous LassoThis paper follows the approach in Ditzen and Ravazzolo32. The authors assume that the data generating process for dominant units is:$${x}_{it}={u}_{it}, i\in {\Gamma (N}_{d}), \quad t= 1,\dots ,T; \; i= 1, \dots , N$$and for non-dominant units:$${x}_{it}=\sum_{j\in\Gamma \left({N}_{d}\right)}{\beta }_{ij}{x}_{jt} +{u}_{it}, \quad i\in {\Gamma (N}_{nd}),\; t= 1,\dots ,T; \; i= 1, \dots , N$$where \({\Gamma (N}_{d})\) is the set of dominant units, \({\Gamma (N}_{nd})\) the set of non-dominant units and \({u}_{it}\) is a random noise component, allowed to be autocorrelated and heteroscedastic but stationary. The index i identifies the cross-sectional unit and t the time periods. The identification of dominant units therefore depends on the estimation of \({\Gamma (N}_{nd})\) and the coefficients \({\beta }_{ij}\), which measures the extend unit j influences unit i. Implicitly the problem requires the estimation of \(N(N-1)\) coefficients, whereas the number of observations is NT which is potentially smaller than \(N(N-1)\). To solve the high dimensional problem, Ditzen and Ravazzolo32 suggest the following optimisation problem which is repeated for each of the N cross-sections:$$\underset{{{\varvec{\beta}}}_{i}}{\mathrm{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}{{(x}_{i,t}-{x}_{-i,t}{{\varvec{\beta}}}_{i}^{{\prime}})}^{2}+ \frac{\lambda }{T}\sum_{j=1,j\ne i}^{N}{\psi }_{ij}\left|{\beta }_{ij}\right|,$$where \({x}_{i,t}\) is a T × 1 matrix containing the observations over time for the i-th unit. \({x}_{-i,t}\) is a T x (N-1) matrix containing all other cross-sections. \({{\varvec{\beta}}}_{i}=[{\beta }_{i1},{\beta }_{i2},\dots {\beta }_{ii-1 ,},{\beta }_{ii+1},\dots ,{\beta }_{iN}]\) is a 1 × (N − 1) sparse vector containing coefficients, where the coefficient \({\beta }_{ij}\) measures the effect of unit j on unit i. In a graphical model, \({\beta }_{ij}\ne 0\) implies that unit i and j are connected and thus they have a common edge. \(\frac{\lambda }{T}\sum_{j}^{N}{\psi }_{ij}\left|{\beta }_{ij}\right|\) is the penalty term with the tuning parameter \(\lambda\) and the loading \({\psi }_{ij}\). Both need to be specified prior to estimation, depending on the estimation method. Ditzen and Ravazzolo (2022) find that the rigorous (or plugin) lasso38,39,40 or the adaptive lasso41,42 works best to uncover the graphical representation in a framework with dominant units. The rigorous lasso has the advantage that it is data driven and therefore does not require any parametrisation or specification of hyperparameters. In detail, it sets \(\lambda =2c \sqrt{N}{\phi }^{-1}\left(1-\frac{\gamma }{2N}\right)\) with c a slack parameter, γ the probability of the regularisation event and \({\phi }^{-1}\) is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution39. Both parameters are commonly set to c = 1.1, γ = 0.1/log(N). The penalty loading \({\psi }_{ij}\) is estimated as \({\widehat{\psi }}_{ij}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T}{\left({ \dddot{x}}_{itj}{\widehat{\epsilon}}_{it}\right)}^{2} }\) where \({\dddot{x}}_{itj}\) are the deviations from the unit specific means and \({\widehat{\epsilon}}_{it}\) is obtained from an auxiliary regression. Ahrens et al.40 show that \({\psi }_{ij}\) can be consistently estimated using autocorrelation and autocorrelation heteroskedasticity robust estimators in the presence of such.If the adaptive lasso is used, the penalty loadings \({\psi }_{ij}\) are estimated using an unbiased and consistent estimator. Depending on the ratio of variables to observations uni- or multivariate OLS is proven to lead to the desired oracle properties41,43. The tuning parameter is commonly specified by either cross-validation or information criteria such as the AIC or BIC. As the rigorous and adaptive lasso both perform similar with respect the identification of the dominant units32, we choose the data driven rigorous lasso for our analysis.The estimated \({\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}}_{i}\) are then stacked together \({\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}=(\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}}_{1},{\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}}_{2},\dots ,{\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}}_{{\varvec{N}}})^{\prime}\) into a N x N matrix, where the diagonal elements are zero:$$\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}=\left(\widehat{{{\varvec{\beta}}}_{1}},\dots ,\widehat{{{\varvec{\beta}}}_{N}}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}0& {\widehat{\beta }}_{\mathrm{1,1}}& \cdots & \cdots & {\widehat{\beta }}_{1,\mathrm{N}}\\ {\widehat{\beta }}_{\mathrm{2,1}}& 0& {\widehat{\beta }}_{\mathrm{2,3}}& \cdots & {\widehat{\beta }}_{2,\mathrm{N}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ {\widehat{\beta }}_{\mathrm{N},1}& \cdots & \cdots & {\widehat{\beta }}_{\mathrm{N},N-1}& 0\end{array}\right)$$Based on Sulaimanov and Koeppl37 we obtain the concentration matrix by multiplying the estimated coefficients with the inverse of the unit specific residual variances:$$\widehat{{\varvec{\kappa}}}=\widehat{{\varvec{D}}}\left(I-\widehat{{\varvec{\beta}}}\right)$$$$\widehat{{\varvec{D}}}=diag\left({\widehat{\sigma }}_{1}^{-2},\dots ,{\widehat{\sigma }}_{N}^{-2}\right)$$A feature of this step is that the sparsity of the estimated coefficients carries over to the concentration matrix. It implies that two connected (or dependent) units will be connected in the concentration matrix, while two independent units will be represented by a zero.Following Brownlees and Mesters29 and Ditzen and Ravazzolo32 the column norm is used to identify dominant units. Define \({\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{i}\) as the i-th column of \(\widehat{{\varvec{\kappa}}}\), then unit i is more dominant than unit j if the column norm of i is larger than of j, hence \({||\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{i}||>{||\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{j}||\). This implies that a shock to unit i has a larger effect to the entire network than a shock to unit j. Brownlees and Mesters29 and Ditzen and Ravazzolo32 suggest identifying the number of dominant units by ordering the column norms by their size and then calculate the growth rate. The maximum of the growth rate defines the estimated number of dominant units \(\widehat{k}\):$$\widehat{k}= \underset{i=1 ,\dots ,\mathit{ N}}{\mathrm{max}}{||\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{i}||/{||\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{i+1}||$$The set of dominant units \({\Gamma (N}_{nd})\) is then defined as the units with the \(\widehat{k}\) largest column norms \({||\widetilde{{\varvec{\kappa}}}}_{i}||.\)Random forestsIn order to identify the community-level vulnerability factors of regional drivers, we employ the random forest method as a robust and efficient approach for handling high-dimensional data and uncovering important predictors. High-dimensional data has become a significant focus in recent decades, as technological advancements enable the processing of situations where the number of predictors is larger than the number of data points (i.e., n < p). In many empirical applications, researchers often handpick explanatory variables without relying on a data-driven approach. However, it is not always clear which features are essential and which ones can be dropped without compromising predictive power.Machine learning, particularly tree-based methods, has proven helpful in identifying relevant predictors in high-dimensional settings with complex interactions. The random forests algorithm44 generates multiple trees using randomly selected subsets of observations and features. Averaging these trees results in a smoother and more accurate prediction than a single tree. Random forests are effective in handling sparse settings with many unrelated features45, maintaining strong performance even when faced with a large number of features46,47.Random forests offer an efficient approximation of the test error calculated from out-of-bag (OOB) sets through the bootstrap resampling process for each tree. This eliminates the need for cross-validation or a separate test set to obtain an unbiased estimate of the prediction error. As each tree is constructed using a different bootstrap sample from the original data, about one-third of the cases (observations) are left out of the bootstrap sample and not used in the construction of the kth tree. This allows for a test set classification to be obtained for each case in approximately one-third of the trees. The proportion of times that the selected class for the observation differs from the true class over all observations in the OOB set is called the OOB error estimate, which has proven to be unbiased in many tests48.Variable importance measures for random forests have been instrumental in variable selection for various classification tasks in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology49,50. Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andrés51 offer a comparison of random forests and other classification methods for gene expression data analysis. They propose a new gene selection method based on random forests for sample classification using microarray data.There are several options for evaluating the importance of a specific variable in predictions. One such method is the permutation-based variable importance, which assesses the effect of a variable by randomly reshuffling its data. This method involves taking the original data for the variable, permutating (mixing) the values, and generating "new" data. It then measures the decrease in the model's predictive accuracy after the permutation. If a variable is an important predictor in the model, the model's accuracy will decrease significantly after the variable's permutation. This measure of significance is known as Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and relies on the out-of-bag error estimate.Note that this approach is distinct from the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) method, which evaluates the importance of a variable by calculating the average decrease in impurity (such as Gini impurity) for all trees in the model when the variable is used for splitting. The empirical properties of both criteria have been extensively explored and compared in the statistical computing literature. For example, Archer and Kimes52 point out that MDA may behave poorly when correlation increases, which is experimentally tested by Auret and Aldrich53 and Tolosi and Lengauer54. Auret and Aldrich53 show three trends in their simulation study: (1) as the association between a variable and the response increases, the proportion of times that that variable is correctly identified increases; (2) as the correlation of within-group variables increases, the proportion of times the true variable is identified decreases; (3) as the correlation of within-group variables increases, the proportion of times the true group is identified increases.Strobl et al.55 and Hothorn et al.56 have suggested a conditional permutation framework to reduce this effect and applied a conditional permutation to their new random forest algorithm forests (conditional forest—CF). Although CF appears to work better for identification of significant variables, it has its own shortcomings specially when the number of trees is large53,57. Hence, it is suggested that, when it is feasible, the best practice is to include expert knowledge of the process under consideration in data preprocessing by reducing the presence of correlated variables.ResultsIn this section, we first present the outcomes of the dominance analysis, as outlined in the "Methods" section, to illustrate the spatial network of the influenza-like viral spread where the regions in their dominance are identified and ranked. Following this, we explore the findings of the random forest analysis, which highlights the community-level vulnerability factors of regional drivers.In our dominance analysis, we utilize the incidence density (or incidence rate), calculated as the number of symptomatic individuals per population, spanning from March 1st to July 1st, 2020. By standardizing the data through first-differencing and scaling, we successfully identify 18 dominant regions among the 77 FSAs, which are illustrated in Fig. 3. The heatmap provides a visual representation of the column norms of rigorous lasso for the 77 FSAs in Nova Scotia, Canada. These norms are used to identify the regional drivers of influenza-like illness. The heatmap illustrates five distinct clusters based on the column norms, with the following thresholds: 58 regions with column norms of 0, 1 region with a column norm of 0.1885, 7 regions with column norms between 0.2742 and 0.3282, 7 regions between 0.3597 and 0.4012 and,5 regions with column norms between 0.4833 and 0.6151.Figure 3Regional drivers of influenza-like illness in Nova Scotia, Canada. Note: the map is created by authors using Esri (Canada) and the map data copyrighted OpenStreetMap contributors and available from https://www.openstreetmap.org.Full size imageThe varying shades of color in the heatmap reflect the magnitude of the column norms within each FSA with darker shades representing regional drivers. The FSA with a column norm of 0.1885 is not considered a driver region, as it does not meet the criteria for being a dominant contributor to the spread of the virus.After removing four FSA’s with missing observations, we have 77 FSA’s and 1378 regional predictors. We obtain the results reported in Table 1 based on 2000 runs of the random forest algorithm. This is because a random forest algorithm gets its final estimations as the average of trees using bootstrapped subsamples of observations and features. Therefore, two random forest model estimated from the same data may have slightly different results due the fact that its trees would be different in each model. This particularly true when we have the data that has a very low n/p ratio, which is around 5.0% (77/1378) in our case.Table 1 OOB results of 2000 runs.Full size tableAfter eliminating a few rural FSAs with a very low population density and one outlier region, we include 74 total FSAs (18 "Dominants", 56 "Followers") in our initial application. Although the class balance is not skewed drastically (18/56 = 0.321), we use a stratified random forest algorithm to reduce the bias in each split. We also use the default setting of randomly selected features ("mtry" = \(\sqrt{p}\)= 37) in each tree. The OOB results are shown in Table 1. Note that the confusion table is obtained by averaging 2000 runs and the values rounded down to the nearest integer. All the results indicate a decent prediction accuracy of our initial application without preprocessing and explicit training.In our study, the outcome variable is categorical (Y = 1 for spreader, 0 otherwise). The random forest algorithm calculates the predicted probability of success (Y = 1) and uses a fixed cut-off threshold (c) to determine the prediction outcome. The predictive accuracy of the model depends on the cut-off threshold (c) and can be summarized by the Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), which illustrates the trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).Using the out-of-bag (OOB) probabilities averaged over 1500 trees, we determine the optimal cut-off threshold (c) and calculate the AUC for each run. After averaging over 2000 runs, the AUC is found to be 74.6%, with a standard error of 0.019051. By setting the number of selected features (\(\sqrt{p}\)) as a hyperparameter and performing a grid-search with a fivefold cross-validation process repeated 5 times, the OOB AUC improves to 81.56%, with a standard error of 0.03787.These results reflect the out-of-sample prediction accuracy. When the trained model is applied for in-sample predictions using the entire data, the AUC increases to 89.11%, indicating good internal validity. We also implement preprocessing operations to reduce highly correlated predictors and near-zero-variance features. Although the results do not significantly improve after preprocessing, the selection of important predictors benefits from this process, which we will discuss next.To evaluate the importance of variables in our predictions, we employ Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) alongside a two-step preprocessing method. As we discussed in the "Methods" section, permutation-based importance measures, such as Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), can be biased due to correlated predictors. To address this issue, we choose MDI, which provides a more robust measure of variable importance by considering the decrease in node impurity across all trees in the random forest.The two-step preprocessing involves first removing 126 variables with near-zero variance to prevent a few samples from having undue influence on the model. Second, we identify and reduce within-group correlations between predictors to further address potential bias in MDI and MDA. After setting the cut-off correlation coefficient at 0.85, we remove 679 additional variables, resulting in 375 regional predictors in our algorithms. The census file's hierarchical aggregation and gender partitions account for many of the removed predictors. We tested various cut-off points between 0.85 and 0.99 and found that more than 60% of the top predictors remain consistent, with predictive accuracy staying about the same, validating the selection of removed variables.Figure 4 displays the top 30 predictors, ranked by their selection frequency in 2000 runs (top plot) and by their average MDI across these runs (bottom plot). Both plots feature the same list of predictors, highlighting the consistency of the top variables and the effectiveness of the MDI measure in identifying the most important predictors for our model.Figure 4Variable importance measures over 2000 random forests. Note: The names of variable codes are given in Table 2.Full size imageVariable importance methods typically provide global measures, rather than local or directional ones. Directional local variable importance measures based on ceteris paribus profiles can be obtained through partial dependence profiles at each prediction point, such as for each major FSA. Several tools exist for instance-level explorations and understanding local-level profiles58. However, in this study, we employ a simple difference-in-means comparison for selected predictors, as shown in Table 2, for two reasons.Table 2 Differences-in-means comparisons for selected predictors.Full size tableFirst, our aim is not to uncover causal relationships, which would be better achieved with semi-parametric applications like multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). Second, extracting local variable importance is an active research area, and many of the tools developed for understanding local and directional effects in random forests rely on strong assumptions, such as the independence between predictors.Table 2 presents the key predictors associated with regional drivers of the viral spread. A more discussion of these findings is provided in the next section.DiscussionIn the "Results" section, we delved into the identification of "regional drivers" of viral spread through a dominant unit analysis. It might be assumed that the order of column norms would correlate with the level of infection density in each Forward Sortation Area (FSA), implying that areas with high infection density could serve as primary sources for regional spreading. However, our analysis revealed a low correlation (0.31) between the column norms selected by rigorous lasso and the infection densities in each dominant FSA. This finding suggests that regions with low infection density could still act as influential regional drivers, while areas with high-density hotspots may play a more submissive role in viral spread.The essential distinction in pinpointing regional drivers is that our dominant unit analysis accounts for the temporal dynamics of viral spread within its network structure, as opposed to infection densities, which only represent cumulative sums and cross-sectional differences.The existing body of research on characterizing spatiotemporal trends in the spread of viral pathogens is limited. Most of the literature focuses on the impact of influenza-like illnesses in one area on its neighboring regions59,60, utilizing personal contact data. To overcome data limitations, Qiu et al.61 proposed the concept of a spatiotemporal route to demonstrate potential transmission directions and the magnitudes of those effects. This concept is based on time-lagged associations among influenza surveillance data from different locations, using vector-autoregressive models (VAR). Wang et al.62 later employed this method to predict the spread of viral infections.While VAR models are effective in forecasting complex spatiotemporal networks, they struggle to reveal the underlying structure of these networks, particularly when it comes to identifying dominant units within panel data. Our machine learning-assisted approach shares some similarities with the work of Qiu et al.61, but there are key differences that set our method apart. Most notably, our approach aims to identify which units are dominant, whereas Qiu et al.61 view all non-zero connections as channels for spreading influenza, without considering their actual importance. In addition, Qiu et al.61 base their analysis on the spread of influenza being dependent on time, while our approach adopts a time-independent perspective. These distinctions allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of regional drivers in viral spread and develop more effective strategies to tackle outbreaks.In the "Results" section, we also presented findings related to the characteristics of driver regions. Table 2 sheds light on key factors that distinguish driver regions from others in terms of viral spread, suggesting a multifaceted interplay of social, economic, and demographic factors that contribute to regional transmission dynamics.Socioeconomic factors such as homeownership, mortgage status, longer working weeks, and higher employment income might signify increased mobility and social interactions among these populations. Individuals in driver regions may have more work-related obligations or social events that could lead to increased contact with others, contributing to the spread of the virus.Living conditions and urban settings, as indicated by higher median monthly rent and a higher percentage of people aged 15–65, may suggest denser residential areas with a larger economically active population. These conditions could increase the likelihood of close contact with others in shared spaces such as apartments, elevators, or public areas, thus promoting viral transmission.Transportation factors, such as the use of public transit and longer travel times to work, could expose individuals in driver regions to higher risks due to increased contact with others during their commute. This increased exposure, in turn, might contribute to a higher transmission rate in these regions.The demographic composition of driver regions, specifically the presence of people with Inuit, African, Caribbean, or Latin American origins, may indicate shared socio-economic conditions, occupational risk factors, or living arrangements that influence transmission patterns. For instance, some communities might have larger households, multi-generational living arrangements, or higher rates of essential worker occupations, which could increase the potential for viral spread.Public sector employment, military families, and people working in waste management industries might face specific job-related risk factors or living conditions that contribute to regional transmission dynamics. These groups may have unique work environments or living arrangements that increase their exposure to the virus, such as shared barracks, on-base housing, or frontline work conditions.In summary, the factors identified in Table 2 paint a complex picture of the regional drivers of influenza-like illness. Understanding these interrelated factors is crucial for developing targeted public health interventions that address the unique challenges faced by driver regions in containing the virus. Further research is needed to explore the interactions between these factors and elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving regional transmission dynamics.Concluding remarksStudies exploring outbreaks through the lens of social geography offer valuable tools for understanding the spatial and temporal determinants of disease spread. It is well-established that social, geographic, and economic factors influence the transmission rate of infectious diseases. This study builds upon prior research by examining how contextual factors contribute to the spatial distribution of viral spread in several innovative ways.The unique dataset generated by the local public response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nova Scotia resembles controlled clinical trials. We apply a novel method related to recent literature on granular time series to investigate the formation of spatial dependence in the network of regions. By analyzing the temporal dynamics in the data, we identify and rank each region's dominance in the spatial transmission network. This new method, when applied to epidemiological surveillance, reveals “dominant regional drivers” and their associated socio-spatial predictors.Our study identifies 18 dominant regional drivers among 112 regions and discovers significant space-specific characteristics associated with them. These regional drivers are characterized by their community-level vulnerability, such as demographic and economic factors. We suggest that predictive detection and spatial analysis be incorporated into population-based surveillance strategies to enhance early case detection and optimize the allocation of healthcare resources.Future research can build upon these findings by expanding the scope to other infectious diseases or evaluating the impact of various public health interventions on spatial distribution. Longitudinal analysis could be employed to assess temporal changes in dominant regional drivers and their associated socio-spatial predictors, helping us understand the evolving nature of transmission networks over time. Additionally, the integration of real-time mobility data, social media data, or other novel sources of information could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of disease spread and their interaction with socio-spatial factors. By exploring these areas in future research, we can continue to refine our understanding of the socio-spatial factors influencing the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately contributing to the development of more targeted and effective public health interventions.

While fitness and antigenic structure are both important aspects of virus success, they are distinct characteristics and do not always change in a complementary manner. The 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season saw the emergence of two H1N1 clades: A5a.1 and A5a.2. While several studies indicated that A5a.2 showed similar or even increased antigenic drift compared with A5a.1, the A5a.1 clade was still the predominant circulating clade that season. Clinical isolates of representative viruses from these clades were collected in Baltimore, Maryland during the 2019–2020 season and multiple assays were performed to compare both antigenic drift and viral fitness between clades. Neutralization assays performed on serum from healthcare workers pre- and post-vaccination during the 2019–2020 season show a comparable drop in neutralizing titers against both A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses compared with the vaccine strain, indicating that A5a.1 did not have antigenic advantages over A5a.2 that would explain its predominance in this population. Plaque assays were performed to investigate fitness differences, and the A5a.2 virus produced significantly smaller plaques compared with viruses from A5a.1 or the parental A5a clade. To assess viral replication, low MOI growth curves were performed on both MDCK-SIAT and primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell cultures. In both cell cultures, A5a.2 yielded significantly reduced viral titers at multiple timepoints post-infection compared with A5a.1 or A5a. Receptor binding was then investigated through glycan array experiments which showed a reduction in receptor binding diversity for A5a.2, with fewer glycans bound and a higher percentage of total binding attributable to the top three highest bound glycans. Together these data indicate that the A5a.2 clade had a reduction in viral fitness, including reductions in receptor binding, that may have contributed to the limited prevalence observed after emergence.

While the burden of disease can vary significantly from year to year, overall influenza is responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually1,2. There are several influenza virus strains and subtypes that vary in prevalence in different seasons. As these viruses circulate they accrue mutations, and some mutations contribute to antigenic drift and result in the need for regular updates to influenza vaccine formulations3,4. Mutations in the influenza virus can also result in changes to various aspects of viral fitness, including replication kinetics5,6, receptor binding7,8,9,10,11, and viral budding12. While antigenic structure and viral fitness are both important components of viral evolution, they are distinct phenomena; for example, a mutation mediating escape from preexisting immunity could simultaneously confer a detrimental effect on fitness. Studying how viruses balance these characteristics is crucial to improving our understanding of viral evolution.The 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season was the third H1N1-predominant season since the 2009 H1N1pdm viruses emerged13. At the start of the season the 6B.1A.5a (A5a) clade constituted the majority of circulating H1N1, but it quickly dropped in prevalence as the A5a.1 and A5a.2 subclades emerged and began to cocirculate14 (Fig. 1A). These clades differ by several amino acids on the viral hemagglutinin protein; A5a.1 contains D187A and Q189E while A5a.2 is defined by K130N, N156K, L161I, and V250A (Fig. 1B). The clade-defining mutations for both subclades include mutations in canonical antigenic sites15, suggesting that they may have contributed to antigenic drift. Before its appearance in the 2019–2020 season N156K had also emerged previously in regional circulation16,17, and had already been described as a potentially important mutation that changed antigenic structure in studies involving both ferret and human serum16,18. Both subclades also include mutations associated with the receptor binding site of hemagglutinin, including the 130 loop (K130N) and the 190 helix (D187A, Q189E). Changes to the receptor binding site can alter viral fitness by modifying the strength and diversity of receptor binding7,10. The N156K mutation, while not on the canonical receptor binding site, has also been associated with changes in receptor binding18.Figure 1Emergence of the 6B.1A.5a.1 (A5a.1) and 6B.1A.5a.2 (A5a.2) clades of H1N1 and their clade-defining mutations. (A) Frequencies of H1N1 clades from January 2017-June 2020, generated through the NextStrain pipeline14. (B) Side and top view of hemagglutinin trimers from A5a.1 and A5a.2 clades are displayed with antigenic sites shaded using PyMOL (PDB: 3LZG). Clade-defining amino acid mutations are shown in red (not shown are V250A in HA1 and E179D in HA2 for the A5a.2 clade).Full size imageThe H1N1 vaccine component for 2019–2020 season was A/Brisbane/2/2018 which belongs to clade 6B.1A.114,19, and a variety of studies have been performed to analyze the impact of the additional mutations on antigenic drift. Experiments using ferret serum post-infection with A5a or A5a.1 viruses showed a significant reduction in antibody recognition of the A5a.2 clade when compared with A5a or A5a.1, and ferret serum raised against A5a.2 viruses showed poor recognition of A5a.1 clade viruses20,21,22. Ferret antibodies have been noted to preferentially recognize antigenic site Sa and may therefore disproportionately respond to the A5a.2 mutations23; further antigenic characterization by the WHO using human serum post-vaccination with several prior vaccine strains showed a reduction in antibody recognition against both A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses compared with A5a20. Vaccine effectiveness studies for the 2019–2020 season, however, report a reduction in effectiveness against infection and hospitalization with A5a.2 viruses compared with A5a.1 and A5a24,25,26. Taken together, these data indicate that A5a.2 may have increased antigenic drift that allowed it to escape existing immunity.Despite the potential antigenic advantages of the A5a.2 clade, A5a.1 predominated globally over both A5a.2 and A5a after its emergence and constituted over 90% of total circulating H1N1 by 202114 (though it is noted that global circulation of influenza was greatly reduced during the 2020–2021 Northern Hemisphere influenza season due to the continuing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic). This suggests that factors of A5a.2 other than escape from preexisting immunity may have contributed to its lack of circulation. To investigate the phenotypic consequences of the clade-defining mutations of A5a.1 and A5a.2, representative viruses were isolated from influenza-positive patients in Baltimore, Maryland during the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Growth curves, plaque assays, glycan arrays, and neutralization assays were performed, and A5a.2 was shown to have reduced replication, plaque formation, and receptor binding diversity compared with both A5a.1 and A5a. These data indicate that A5a.2 suffered a reduction in fitness that may have prevented it from becoming the predominant H1N1 clade in the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere season.ResultsA5a.1 and A5a.2 clade H1N1 viruses cocirculated in the 2019–2020 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere, with clade A5a.1 predominating (Fig. 1A). A5a.1 and A5a.2 are distinguished by several distinct clade-defining mutations on the hemagglutinin protein (Fig. 1B). A5a.1 contains D187A and Q189E mutations which occupy the 190 helix of the receptor binding site and antigenic site Sb. The A5a.2 clade is defined by K130N, N156K, L161I, and V250A. K130N is located on the 130-loop of the receptor binding site, while N156K and L161I occupy antigenic site Sa (Fig. 1B). A5a.2 also contains E179D on the HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin. To characterize these clades, representative viruses were chosen from clades A5a.1, A5a.2, and the ancestral A5a clade. These viruses were collected from influenza-positive patients in Baltimore, Maryland during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. For A5a.2 the virus A/Baltimore/R0675/2019 was chosen. For A5a.1 the viruses chosen were A/Baltimore/R0686/2019 and A/Baltimore/R0688/2019, with A/Baltimore/R0688/2019 containing the T72N mutation on the neuraminidase protein which resulted in an additional putative glycosylation site. A/Baltimore/R0496/2018 was chosen to represent the A5a clade. Table 1 depicts the complete set of amino acid differences between these viruses, with A/Baltimore/R0496/2018 as a reference.Table 1 Amino acid differences between the 2019–2020 viruses chosen for characterization compared with the 2018–2019 A5a virus (A/Baltimore/R0496/2018).Full size tableVaccinations in the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere (NH) influenza season were shown to offer reduced protection against infection and hospitalization with A5a.2 compared with A5a.124,25,26. Studies using ferret serum indicated that the N156K mutation resulted in antigenic drift and reduced recognition by antibodies raised by infection with the 2019–2020 NH vaccine strain20,21,22, and experiments with human serum post-vaccination indicate a reduction in neutralizing titers against both A5a.1 and A5a.220. Experiments using human serum are an important component of antigenic characterization, as ferret antibodies have been shown to preferentially recognize antigenic site Sa compared with human antibodies23. To assess the antigenic consequences of clade-defining mutations on viral recognition by serum antibodies, neutralization assays were performed using serum from healthcare workers before and after receiving the 2019–2020 NH influenza vaccine (Fig. 2). Representative viruses were used from both the A5a.2 clade (A/Baltimore/R0675/2019) and the A5a.1 clade (A/Baltimore/R0688/2019). For pre- and post-vaccination timepoints, serum showed reduced neutralizing antibody titers against both circulating clades compared with the vaccine strain (A/Brisbane/02/2018) (Fig. 2A). No significant differences in neutralizing titers were seen between A5a.1 and A5a.2 at either timepoint. Fold change in neutralizing antibodies were similar between all three viruses, with a comparable percent of participants seroconverting post-vaccination (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the clade-defining mutations of A5a.1 and A5a.2 showed similar escape from pre- and post-vaccination serum in this population that has a high annual acceptance rate of influenza vaccines.Figure 2Comparison of neutralizing antibody titers in serum of healthcare workers pre- and post-vaccination. (A) Neutralizing titers of antibodies against the H1N1 vaccine strain (A/Brisbane/02/2018), A5a.2 (A/Baltimore/R0675/2019), and A5a.1 (A/Baltimore/R0688/2019). Neutralizing titers were significantly higher against the vaccine strain than the two circulating clades, and there were no significant differences between A5a.1 and A5a.2 pre- or post-vaccination. 1-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc, ****p < 0.0001 (B) Fold-change of neutralizing titers post-vaccination show a similar seroconversion rate between all three viruses. Bars represent geometric mean, intervals are geometric standard deviation. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc. N = 66.Full size imageTo assess differences in viral replication between these clades, growth curves and plaque assays were performed on the representative viruses from the A5a.1 and A5a.2 clades, as well as the ancestral A5a clade. Viral replication was assessed through low-multiplicity of infection (MOI) growth curves on MDCK-SIAT cells. These are MDCK cells stably transfected with human 2,6 sialyltransferase, resulting in an overexpression of the canonical human influenza receptor (2,6 sialic acid) and a reduction in 2,3 sialic acid expression27. These growth curves revealed a reduction in A5a.2 infectious virus titer at multiple timepoints compared with A5a and A5a.1 (Fig. 3A) and significantly lower total virus production as measured by area under the curve (Fig. 3C). Growth curves were also performed on human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, a primary cell culture model that is physiologically similar to the upper respiratory tract that seasonal influenza preferentially infect5,28,29,30,31,32,33. Growth curves on hNEC cultures reflected MDCK-SIAT growth curves, with A5a.2 producing significantly reduced infectious virus titers at multiple timepoints (Fig. 3B) and reduced total virus production (Fig. 3D). A5a and A5a.1 viruses both produced similar plaque sizes on Marin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, while A5a.2 formed significantly smaller plaques (Fig. 3E,F). Together these data indicate that the A5a.2 clade has reduced viral fitness compared with the cocirculating A5a.1 clade and its A5a precursor, shown through a reduction in plaque size and infectious virus production on multiple cell types.Figure 3Characterization of Viral Fitness. Growth curves on MDCK-SIAT cells (MOI 0.001) show a reduction in growth (A) and total virus production (C) of A5a.2 viruses compared to A5a and A5a.1. Growth curves on human nasal epithelial cells (MOI 0.01) show a similar phenotype (B, D).One-way (AUC) or Two-way (growth curves) ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test.

Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageBoth A5a.1 and A5a.2 contain clade-defining mutations on the receptor binding site (RBS) of the hemagglutinin protein. Receptor binding is a crucial component of viral fitness and a reduction in receptor binding diversity or avidity could result in the reduced plaque sizes and replication seen for A5a.2. To assess whether these mutations resulted in phenotypic changes, receptor binding was assessed using the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) glycan microarray (version 5.5) as previously described7,34,35. See Supplementary Table S1 for a complete list of glycans included in the final graphs. For all clades, viruses predominantly bound to glycans with alpha 2,6 linkages of the sialic acid with the penultimate sugar (Fig. 4), which is the preferential linkage recognized by human influenza viruses36,37. To investigate differences in receptor binding diversity, percent of total binding was calculated for each glycan that bound with at least 5% of the relative fluorescence units (RFUs) of the highest bound glycan (Table 2). Percent of total binding is frequently used in the analysis of virus/glycan interactions35,38,39,40,41,42 and is recommended for the interpretation of CFG microarray data42. Cutoffs range from 1%39 to 10%38, with 4% and 5% being used in similar analyses35,42. 5% was chosen here to exclude background fluorescence while still including lower-strength viruseceptor interactions which have been shown to contribute to virus entry43.Figure 4Consortium for functional glycomics (CFG version 5.5) glycan microarray profile of viral receptor binding of terminally sialylated glycans. Y axis depicts relative fluorescence units (RFUs), and X axis depicts individual glycans from the array. Unshaded regions contain sialylated glycans with linkages other than 2,3 or 2,6, and Neu5Gc glycans.Full size imageTable 2 Percent of total glycan binding.Full size tableThe three highest bound glycans constituted over 35% of total binding for the A5a.2 virus, while the top three glycans account for 21% or less of total binding for A5a.1 and A5a viruses. Additionally, A5a and A5a.1 viruses bound to 32 or more glycans with at least 5% of the RFUs of the highest bound glycan, while A5a.2 only bound 22 (Table 2). Taken together these data indicate that viruses from the A5a.2 clade have reduced receptor binding diversity compared with the ancestral A5a and co-circulating A5a.1 clades. Both A5a (Fig. 5) and A5a.1 (Fig. 6) also demonstrated clade-specific binding to glycans not bound by the other clades; A5a bound to several branched alpha 2,3 SA glycans as well as Neu5Gc glycans not expressed by human cells (Fig. 5), while A5a.1 bound to several single chain 2,6 SA glycans and one single chain 2,3 SA glycan (Fig. 6). These data confirm that mutations in the receptor binding site can result in viral clades with distinct receptor binding profiles, and suggest that differences in receptor binding may have contributed to the fitness differences observed for A5a.2.Figure 5Glycans bound only by A5a virus.Full size imageFigure 6Glycans bound only by A5a.1 viruses.Full size imageDiscussionThe accumulation of mutations in circulating seasonal influenza results in antigenic drift and the need for annual vaccinations, as well as changes to viral fitness. Mutations in individual influenza proteins have been shown to affect plaque size44, viral replication5,6,30,44, and receptor binding preferences and diversity7,8,9,10,11. Importantly, there is overlap between functional and antigenic regions of both the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins6,8,15,45, and individual mutations have the potential to alter both antigenic structure and fitness simultaneously6,46,47,48,49. Antigenic differences in circulating clades have been associated with changes to viral receptor binding profiles50, and egg-adaptation mutations that changed receptor preferences in a live attenuated influenza virus also contributed to antigenic drift and reduced replication in human cells44,51.The overlap between antigenic and functional regions may result in tradeoffs between novel mutations that improve one trait at the expense of the other. An example found in H3N2 is the emergence of a glycosylation site on the NA protein, which led to antigenic drift at the expense of viral replication and NA enzymatic activity6,52. This mutation increased in prevalence after its emergence, suggesting that the antigenic advantages may have offset any detriments to fitness30. Here we investigate a potential tradeoff between antigenic structure and fitness that led the A5a.1 clade of H1N1 to predominant in the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season despite the apparent antigenic advantages of the cocirculating A5a.2 clade. We show that A5a.2 had deficits in plaque size, replication, and receptor binding compared to A5a and A5a.1 that may have contributed to its limited prevalence in the 2019–2020 season.A5a.1 and A5a.2 are distinguished by several important mutations to the viral hemagglutinin segment. A5a.1 is defined by D187A and Q189E, while A5a.2 viruses have the mutations K130N, N156K, L161I, and V250A as well as the HA2 subunit mutation E179D. The N156K mutation of A5a.2 has emerged independently in earlier seasons and has been shown to cause antigenic drift in studies using both ferret and human serum16,18, and previous antigenic characterization of the 2019–2020 NH clades has shown that A5a.2 is drifted from both A5a.1 and the 2019–2020 NH vaccine strain in ferret serum and vaccine effectiveness studies20,21,22,24,25,26. Experiments with human serum show a similar degree of antigenic drift in both A5a.1 and A5a.2 compared with preceding clades20.To assess antigenic differences between the 2019–2020 NH H1N1 clades, neutralization assays were performed on representative A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses using serum from healthcare workers from the 2019–2020 NH influenza season. These experiments revealed a similar reduction in neutralization of both A5a.1 and A5a.2 viruses compared with the vaccine strain (Fig. 2), both pre- and post-vaccination. Fold-increase in neutralizing titers after vaccination were similar for all three viruses. It is important to note that healthcare workers represent a highly vaccinated population, with mandatory vaccination leading to over 90% vaccine coverage53. Consecutive yearly vaccination has been shown to increase pre-vaccination antibody titers54, and likely contributed to the high pre-vaccination neutralizing antibody levels observed here. High pre-vaccination antibody titers have previously been inversely correlated with seroconversion after vaccination55,56, and it is possible that the increased antigenic drift of A5a.2 reported elsewhere may have been masked in our study by high baseline antibody levels.While antigenic comparisons of these clades have revealed similar or increased antigenic drift in A5a.2, the predominance of A5a.1 in the 2019–2020 NH influenza season suggests a potential fitness advantage over A5a.2. Here we show that a representative A5a.2 virus produces significantly smaller plaques in MDCK cells compared with viruses from both A5a.1 and the ancestral A5a clade. Small viral plaque size can be caused by multiple factors57, and may be influenced by many aspects of the viral life cycle including replication, receptor binding, or cell-to-cell spread. To assess differences in viral replication, growth curves were performed in MDCK-SIAT and human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures. MDCK-SIAT cells are an immortalized cell line that overexpress alpha 2,6 sialic acids, the canonical human influenza receptor27, and hNEC cultures are a primary cell culture system that models the upper respiratory tract58. hNEC cultures are grown at an air–liquid interface and differentiate into multiple epithelial cell types including ciliated and mucus-producing cells28,58. While MDCK-SIAT cells are engineered to be easily infected with human influenza, hNEC cultures are considered to be more physiologically relevant and may reveal differences not seen in MDCK-SIAT growth curves6,29,30. Both growth curves were performed at 33 °C to reflect the temperature of the upper respiratory tract. In both MDCK-SIAT and hNEC growth curves A5a.2 consistently demonstrated a significant reduction in replication compared to A5a.1 or A5a (Fig. 3). This reduced replication could have contributed to the small plaque sizes of A5a.2.To further explore the potential mechanisms of reduced fitness in A5a.2, glycan arrays were performed on the representative viruses from the three clades. These experiments measure viral binding to a variety of polysaccharides, and can reveal differences in both receptor preferences and binding diversity. They can also provide insight into host specificity; the canonical influenza receptors are glycans with a sialic acid (SA) as their terminal sugar, and different SA linkages to the penultimate sugar are differentially preferred by avian and human influenza viruses. Human influenza preferentially binds to alpha 2,6 SA linkages while avian influenza recognizes alpha 2,3 SA36,37. Glycan arrays on the representative viruses confirm a preference for alpha 2,6 SA glycans for all viruses tested, but there was considerable difference in binding diversity between clades. A5a.1 and A5a viruses bound to over 45% more glycans than A5a.2 with at least 5% of the relative fluorescence units of the highest bound glycan (Table 2). Additionally, the top three bound glycans represent over 35% of total binding for A5a.2, while the top three only constituted 21% or less of total binding for A5a.1 and A5a viruses.Differences in receptor binding have previously been associated with reduced replication kinetics7 and virus propagation10, though this correlation does not appear in every context35,38,59,60. Diversity of receptor binding and low-affinity receptor interactions have also been shown to be important for viral entry into cells43, and it is possible that the reduction in binding diversity seen in the A5a.2 clade could impact its fitness through impaired cell binding and entry. Additionally, viruses from both A5a and A5a.1 clades each bound to unique glycans not bound by the other clades (Figs. 5 and 6). This confirms that different clades can have unique binding profiles that distinguish them from each other, and further demonstrates the reduced binding diversity of A5a.2 which had no uniquely bound glycans.Interestingly, as A5a.2 has continued to circulate it quickly gained a series of mutations on the hemagglutinin protein, including K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K, and K308R, and has subsequently become the predominant circulating clade of H1N114. Several of these mutations occupy both antigenic and receptor binding sites, suggesting that they may have served some compensatory function that allowed the virus to improve its fitness and/or antigenic structure and outcompete A5a.1. Further investigation will be needed to identify the impact of these more recent mutations on the viral phenotype. It is also important to note that this study characterized clinical isolates of viruses representing the various clades, and differences between these viruses are not limited to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein (Table 1). Additional research is needed to identify the role of individual clade-defining HA mutations on the overall reduction in fitness of A5a.2. These findings nevertheless highlight the deficiencies in receptor binding and viral fitness that may have contributed to the limited spread of the A5a.2 clade in the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.MethodsEthics statement and human subjectsSerologic samples for this study were obtained from healthcare workers (HCWs) recruited from the Johns Hopkins Centers for Influenza Research and Surveillance (JHCEIRS) during the annual Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) employee influenza vaccination campaign in the Fall of 2019. Pre- and post-vaccination (~ 28 day) human serum were collected from subjects, who provided written informed consent prior to participation. The JHU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this study, IRB00288258. Virus was isolated for this study from deidentified influenza A virus H1N1 positive samples, collected from patients who provided written informed consent during the 2019–2020 influenza season at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, under the JHU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved protocol, IRB00091667.Cell culturesMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (provided by Dr. Robert A. Lamb) and MDCK-SIAT cells (provided by Dr. Scott Hensley) were maintained in complete medium (CM) consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human nasal epithelial cells (PromoCell) were seeded on 24-well Corning transwell plates with PneumaCult Ex-Plus media on apical and basolateral sides. After cells reached confluence (approximately 10 days, determined by a trans-epithelial electrical resistance reading of > 300 ohms), media was switched to PneumaCult ALI media and the apical surface was left at an air–liquid interface (ALI). hNEC cultures were considered fully differentiated when mucus and beating cilia were visible, approximately three weeks after transition to ALI.Viral isolation and sequencingNasopharyngeal swabs or nasal wash from individuals who were influenza A positive during the 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere influenza season were used for virus isolation on primary cells. The apical side of hNEC wells were washed twice with 300ul of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 100 µl of sample was added to the cells and incubated for two hours. The sample was then aspirated and cells were washed twice with 300 µl of PBS. At three, five, and seven days post-infection 300 µl of hNEC infection media (DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA (Sigma), 100 units/ml pen/strep (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax) was added to the well and incubated for ten minutes. TCID50 was performed on collected media and stocks were made from the collected media when virus was detected at concentrations greater than 104 TCID50/mL.To generate viral stocks, T75 flasks (Corning) were seeded with MDCK-SIAT cells and grown to confluence in complete media. Viral isolates from the previous step were diluted to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 in infection media (hNEC infection media plus 5 µg/ml N-acetyl trypsin). Cells were washed twice with PBS plus 100 mg/L each of anhydrous calcium chloride and magnesium chloride hexahydrate (PBS +/+) and inoculum was added to the flasks and incubated at 33 °C, rocking every 15 min. Inoculum was then aspirated, and 13 mL of infection media was added to the flask. After flasks showed 75% cell death (~ 3 days post infection), media was collected and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Stocks were aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C.Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini extraction kit, and Illumina RNA Prep with Enrichment(L) Tagmentation with Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel v2 (20044311) was used for library preparation. Quality was checked using the Qubit and Agilent Bioanalyzer, and samples were sequenced using a MiSeq Illumina sequencer (v3 2X 300 bp). Consensus sequences were generated using the DRAGEN RNA Pathogen Detection pipeline using custom .bed files and FASTA files for IAV. Sequences are accessible through GISAID with the following IDs: EPI_ISL_17614868 for A/Baltimore/R0496/2018, EPI_ISL_17617226 for A/Baltimore/R0675/2019, EPI_ISL_17614713 for A/Baltimore/R0686/2019, and EPI_ISL_17617227 for A/Baltimore/R0688/2019.Tissue culture infections dose 50 (TCID50)96-well plates were seeded with MDCK-SIAT cells. After reaching confluence, plates were washed twice with 100 µl per well of PBS +/+ and 180 µl of infection media (DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA (Sigma), 100 units/ml pen/strep (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax, and 5 µg/ml N-acetyl trypsin) was added to each well. Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed on viruses and 20 µl of the dilution was added to its corresponding well in the cell plate. Each virus dilution was added to cell plates in sextuplicate, plates were incubated for six days at 33 °C before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for > 3 h and stained overnight with naphthol blue-black. 50% tissue culture infectious dose was calculated as previously described61,62.Plaque assayMDCK cells were grown in complete medium to confluence in 6-well plates. After reaching confluence, media was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS +/+. Ten-fold serial dilutions of viruses were made in infection media, and 250 µL of the virus dilutions were added to the wells. Plates were incubated for one hour at 33 °C and rocked every 15 min to ensure even distribution of inoculum. After one hour, the virus inoculum was removed and phenol-red free DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA (Sigma), 100 U/ml pen/strep (Life Technologies), 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco), 5 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco) 5 µg/ml N-acetyl trypsin (Sigma) and 1% agarose was added. Cells were incubated at 33 °C for two days and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After fixing, the agarose overlay was removed and cells were stained with naphthol-blue black. Plaque area was analyzed in ImageJ.Viral growth curvesFor MDCK-SIAT growth curves, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. After cell plates reached confluence, they were washed twice with PBS +/+ (described above). Virus inoculum was made by diluting virus stock to an MOI of 0.001 in infection media (described above). Inoculum was added to the cell wells and incubated at 33 °C for one hour with plates being rocked every 15 min. After one hour, inoculum was removed and plates were washed twice with PBS +/+ and 500 µl of infection media was added to each well. For each timepoint, infection media was collected from the wells and replaced with 500 µl of fresh infection media. Viral titer in collected media was determined by TCID50 (described above).hNEC growth curves were performed on fully differentiated hNECs grown at an air–liquid interface. Virus inoculum was made by diluting virus stocks to an MOI of 0.01 in hNEC infection media. Wells were washed three times with hNEC infection media and inoculum was added to the wells. Inoculum was incubated on the cells for two hours, after which it was removed and cells were washed three times with PBS and left at an air–liquid interface. For each timepoint, 100 µl of hNEC infection media was added to the wells and incubated at 33 °C for 10 min. Media was then collected and cells were left at ALI. Virus concentration in collected media was determined through TCID50.Partial virus purification and labeling with Alexa Fluor 488T150 flasks were seeded with MDCK-SIAT cells and grown to confluence in complete media. Virus stocks were diluted to 0.001 MOI in infection media. Cells were washed twice with PBS +/+ and inoculum was added to the flasks and incubated at 33 °C, rocking every 15 min. Inoculum was then aspirated, and 18 mL of infection media was added to the flasks. After cells showed 75% death (~ 3 days post infection), media was collected and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min to remove cell debris.5 mL of 20% sucrose in PBS was added to Ultra-Clear ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter), and the remaining volume of the tube was filled with the collected infection media from the previous step. Samples were centrifuged at 24,800 RPM for 1 h, after which the liquid was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of PBS +/+. TCID50 was performed on purified viruses to confirm activity and concentration.1 mg of Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen A20000) was resuspended in 1 mL of diH2O. 25 µl of Alexa Fluor solution was added to 200 µl of purified virus and 20 µl of 1 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.0), mixed by pipetting, and incubated in the dark at room temperature (23 °C) for 1 h. Solution was added to Slide-A-Lyzer™ 7 K MWCO MINI Dialysis Devices (Thermo 69560), devices were loaded onto dialysis floats (Thermo 69588) and dialyzed while stirring at 4 °C in 1L PBS. After 1 h, PBS was replaced with 1L of fresh pre-chilled PBS and the dialysis was continued overnight. The next morning, the PBS was again replaced and the dialysis was continued for another hour. Dialyzed labeled virus was collected and stored at − 80 °C, and TCID50 was performed to confirm virus activity and concentration. Titer of labeled viruses were: 2.32E+10 TCID50/mL (A/Baltimore/R0496/2018), 5.00E+09 TCID50/mL (A/Baltimore/R0675/2019), 2.32E+10 (A/Baltimore/R0686/2019), 7.34E+10 TCID50/mL (A/Baltimore/R0688/2019).Glycan arrayThe microarray chosen was version 5.5 of the CFG glycan microarray, which includes 562 glycans in replicates of 6. Glycan microarray slides were submerged in 100 ml of PBS wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.005% Tween-20) for five minutes to re-hydrate. Samples were diluted 1:100 and in PBS binding buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% bovine serum albumin), and 70 µl of diluted sample were loaded onto the slide. A cover slip was placed over the slide and incubated at room temperature for one hour in darkness, after which the cover slip was removed and the slide was washed four times in 100 ml of PBS wash buffer, then PBS, then deionized water. Slides were then dried before being read in a GenePix microarray scanner.For each set of six replicates, only the median four values were used in analysis. A graph of the raw data was visually analyzed to confirm selective binding of terminally sialylated glycans, after which data was filtered to only include these glycans for a total of 139 glycans (see supplementary Table S1) and organized by structure using the Glycan Array Dashboard (GLAD)63. Glycans were considered in final analysis if virus bound to them with at least 5% of the relative fluorescence units (RFUs) of the highest bound glycan; total binding was found by summing the RFUs of all of these glycans, and percent of total binding was found by dividing the RFUs of individual glycans by total binding. Structures of glycans uniquely bound by one clade were identified using GLAD.Serum neutralization assayPre- and post-vaccination human serum obtained through the Johns Hopkins Center for Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (JH-CEIRS) study (HHSN272201400007C) were used in this study. Lyophilized Receptor Destroying Enzyme II (RDE, Hardy Diagnostics) was dissolved into 20 mL of saline (0.9% NaCl in H2O) and a 1:3 ratio of serum and RDE was incubated at 37 °C overnight followed by RDE inactivation at 57 °C for 35 min. MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates. When cells reached confluence plates were washed twice with 100 µl per well of PBS +/+. Virus inoculum was prepared by diluting virus stock in infection media to a concentration of 1000 TCID50/ml. RDE-treated serum was serially diluted twofold in 96-well U bottom plates (Thermo) using infection media yielding 55 µl per dilution, and 55ul of virus inoculum was added to each dilution. The serum/virus mixture was incubated at room temperature for one hour, and then 50 µl of serum/virus mixture was transferred in duplicate onto the cell plates, yielding 25 TCID50 per well. After 24 h, the serum/virus mixture was removed and plates were washed once with PBS +/+ before adding 100 µl per well of infection media. Six days post-infection the plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for > 3 h and stained overnight with naphthol blue-black.Statistical analysesAll statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.1.0. Growth curves were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each growth curve replicate and AUC values were compared using one-way ANOVA for differences in total virus production. Plaque assays were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Serology was analyzed using either 2-way ANOVA or 1-way ANOVA, both with Tukey post-hoc test.

If confirmed, it would be the first time that avian influenza has affected cats in large numbers. Concerns were raised on Sunday when a veterinarian in western Poland reported the death of a cat which suffered from neurological and respiratory symptoms. Since then, dozens of suspected cases have been reported in different parts of the country. The General Veterinary Inspectorate confirmed on Friday that a number of samples from the Tri-City region in northern Poland had tested positive for “influenza.” The statement did not specify the exact type of influenza. Kasia Domanska-Blicharz, of the National Veterinary Research Institute, told local media that some of the samples had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. A specialist veterinary clinic, SpecVet, said it had also received confirmation of bird flu. Article continues below the player At least 70 suspected cases have been reported across Poland, though it’s still unclear how many are linked to influenza. In Gdańsk, which is part of the Tri-City region, veterinary officials reported at least 28 cases of unusual illnesses, including 25 deaths. “Currently, the Veterinary Inspection is at the stage of collecting as much information as possible that can be confirmed by scientific methods,” the agency said in Friday’s statement, adding that in-depth studies are underway to learn more about the disease. In December, a cat living near a duck farm in southern France was euthanized after becoming severely ill with H5N1 avian influenza. It was the first time that a cat had been infected with the new strain of H5N1, which emerged in late 2021 and has spread around the world. Since then, at least 6 cats in the U.S. have also died of H5N1. The global spread of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b – and the recent spread to a growing number of mammals – has raised concern about the possibility of a future variant which could lead to human-to-human transmission. So far, only a few human cases have been found after contact with infected birds. “The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,” Dr. Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on February 24. “WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.” Related Topics:bird flucatsfeaturedH5N1 bird fluPoland Advertisment15 Advertisment5 Latest Politics20 hours ago Trump names former ICE director Tom Homan as border czar Politics23 hours ago Former U.S. Rep.

Sargent, a program manager with DNR’s Wildlife Conservation Section, called the findings “excellent,” especially considering the toll that highly pathogenic avian influenza took nationwide on bald eagles, black vultures and many other bird species last year. × This page requires Javascript.

Influenza (Flu) 19 June 2023 By Afsaneh GrayAdvertisement Advertisement Copy link to page Download PDF The Advanced Service Flu Report says that 5,007,578 flu vaccinations were administered by community pharmacy in England during the 2022/2023 flu seasonShutterstock.comCommunity pharmacies administered 5,007,578 flu vaccinations in England during the 2022/2023 flu season, the first time the number has topped 5 million since the service was launched in 2015.The Advanced Service Flu Report, published by the NHS Business Services Authority, showed the number of vaccinations delivered between September 2022 and March 2023 under the National Flu Vaccination Service.The 5 million total represents a significant increase from the approximately 4.85 million vaccinations delivered in the 2021/2022 winter flu season, and continues an upward trend in administration numbers since the service was launched.However, the total number may increase because pharmacy submissions for reimbursement are accepted up to six months after the dispensing month. Alastair Buxton, director of NHS services at Community Pharmacy England, said: “This season’s flu vaccination figures are yet another example of the incredible contribution that our members and their teams make to protect the public and the NHS as part of a key public health programme.“Given the significant financial and workforce pressures that our members continue to face, this year-on-year growth is a fantastic achievement and a testament to their hard work and dedication.”Jasmine Shah, head of advice and support at the National Pharmacy Association, commented: “Having protected record numbers of people against flu in the previous year, pharmacies did brilliantly to go even further by breaking through the 5 million milestone.“This is a significant contribution to the overall NHS effort to keep people well and manage winter pressures.”“Millions of people now choose pharmacy for their jabs because of the convenient access and their positive experience in previous years,” she added.A letter from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) issuing guidance for the 2023/2024 flu vaccination programme, updated on 8 June 2023, said: “The delivery of the NHS flu immunisation programme over recent seasons has been both ambitious and challenging as we sought to offer protection to as many eligible people as possible, exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) target for those aged 65 years and above for a third season running.”While the guidance outlines the same eligibility criteria as 2022/2023, the DHSC’s letter said that an expansion to secondary school-aged children is being considered.Secondary school pupils have already been confirmed to be eligible for a free flu vaccine from 2023/2024 in Scotland and Wales.

Avian Influenza is often fatal in birds, however, the risk to public health remains very low. Usually, the disease mainly affects birds, but on rare occasions, it can affect mammals including humans. Anyone who comes across dead or sick birds in public places, should NOT touch or pick them up and should report them via the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77). Bird keepers who suspect bird flu in their poultry or other captive birds, must report it immediately by calling 03000 200 301. Colin Cox, Director of Public Health at Cumberland Council and Interim Director of Public Health at Westmorland and Furness Council, said: “Although the risk to the public is very low, it’s important people do not touch or pick up any sick or dead birds to avoid spreading the virus, which can affect humans in rare cases. “If you do find any dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds while out and about, please report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77 or online. “We would also urge bird keepers to be vigilant for any signs of disease and report any suspected cases to their nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency office.” For the latest updates, advice and guidance, especially if you keep birds, visit the government website. If you employ people who work with poultry or work with poultry yourself, you can also read Health and Safety Executive advice on protecting workers from avian influenza.

Influenza-like Illness (ILI) PSSS, EPI – WK 24, 2023 Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases compared to WK 23, 2023 ILI cases are as tabulated as below for comparison. For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 23 & 24 are also shown. Please refer Seasonal Influenzafor Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) - ILI Surveillance Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Tokelau, Palau, French Polynesia, Solomon Islands, Kiribati and New Caledonia. The increased ILI cases seen in Fiji and Samoa may be to the increased number of sites reporting for the week. The reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in CNMI, Wallis & Futuna, and Niue. The decreased ILI cases seen in Vanuatu may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week. No ILI cases were reported from Cook Islands, Pitcairn Islands and Niue for the week. No reports were available from FSM, Guam, RMI, and Tuvalu for the week. American Samoa and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Influenza In Palau, as of June 18, 2023, out of the 38 samples tested for respiratory pathogen surveillance, 24 samples tested positive for Influenza B and one tested positive for influenza A. The positivity rate for Influenza in WK24 was 66%, indicating a relatively high incidence of influenza during that period based on the 38 samples tested. Additionally, there was a 50 % increase in positivity rate compared to the previous week. Source: Palau Ministry of Health & Human Services Syndromic Surveillance June 19,2023. French Polynesia Ministry of Health has reported a low incidence of ILI and influenza cases. For W24, there were seven (7) newly confirmed influenza cases, two (2) of which required hospital admission. A total of 448 confirmed influenza cases have been reported for the year. Eight (8) deaths have been attributed to influenza for the season. A combination of influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/ Victoria lineage was seen with a predominance of influenza A.

The government is now dealing with a public health crisis as both Influenza and Covid-19 outbreaks arise among displaced residents seeking shelter from the storm. American Samoa: Between June 1st and 15th, 2023, 90 positive Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) tests were recorded at hospitals, including severe cases among infants. Some patients developed pneumonia and required assistance with breathing. The increase in cases is linked to enhanced testing and surveillance measures, and the high hospitalization rates have been an unexpected outcome. Due to a high number of children with RSV, all day-care centers in American Samoa have been closed. Source On 18 June 2023, New Zealand flu cases, primarily type B, have been increasing steadily since April in Auckland, starting earlier than usual. Young children aged 6 months to 12 years are most affected. Individuals with mild asthma or other medical conditions are at higher risk of serious complications. RSV-related hospitalizations are also on the rise in children aged 1 to 4 years, with severe cases seen in infants, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. Source.

The African region has reported a slight increase in deaths but a decrease in cases, while the other five WHO regions have reported decreases in both cases and deaths. Globally, a total of over 768 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported as of 18 June 2023. However, it is important to note that reported cases may not accurately reflect actual infection rates due to reduced testing and continued decreases in reporting worldwide. During this 28-day period, only 56% (133 out of 234) of countries and territories reported cases, a proportion that has been consistently declining since mid-2022. Please refer to weekly situation report for the latest updates and developments regarding the regional response.

French Polynesia rate of physician consultation as of 18 June 2023 for gastroenteritis remains stable at a low level of 2% for WK24 after peaking at 9% in WK40-2022. So far this year, 57 cases of salmonellosis were identified with 10 hospitalizations including 3 admissions to the intensive care unit. The data from 2023 reveals that 33% of the Salmonella strains, for which an antibiogram is available, exhibit atypical sensitivity profiles.

Risks captured in the assessment document are civil emergencies that could affect the United Kingdom in the next five years.An influenza pandemic was rated at a medium-high likelihood of "catastrophic impact".

He says that the risk assessment acknowledged that the influenza pandemic risk could vary significantly and a variety of planning was undertaken, "why was that same approach not applied to a non-influenza pandemic?" Wormald responds, citing that this is "one of the great questions". "How it was discussed within the department while I had been in it... was you had to have a basis for planning and influenza was the most likely, dangerous and identified risk. "The approach taken was essentially ready for flu, ready for anything."He added that a risk had to be specified and you would adapt the flu plan if a different kind of pandemic were to occur.

Hereâs a recap of whatâs happened this morning: Former Prime Minister David Cameron gave evidence. He was questioned about the extent of resilience planning during his time in office from 2010 to 2016 Both the British Medical Association and the Trade Unions Congress have said that Cameronâs years of austerity left the UK unprepared for a pandemic On his role in planning, Cameron says "the overall architecture" to deal with large-scale emergencies needed improvement, and that it was a âmistakeâ to focus too much on other kinds of pandemics Counsel for the Inquiry, Kate Blackwell KC, questioned Cameron over âinadequateâ health budgets, which he defended. He said it was essential for British finances Cameron also praised Rishi Sunak for taking the furlough decision when he did, saying it was something his government couldnât plan for until you know the type of pandemic you face Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, appeared this afternoon and extended sympathy for those affected by the pandemic He was questioned by Hugo Keith KC about ensuring ministers attended key planning meetings, notably Jeremy Hunt who he said did not go to every meeting We will bring continue to bring you coverage throughout the day.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingFocus on flu hit Covid PPE stockspublished at 13:57 British Summer Time 19 June 202313:57 BST 19 June 2023Hugh PymHealth Editor, reporting from the Covid InquiryOne of the key issues which arose in the early stages of the first Covid wave was the shortage of protective equipment (PPE) for NHS and social care staff. David Cameron left Downing Street three and a half years before coronavirus hit the UK. But he acknowledged in his evidence that earlier recommendations on building up PPE stocks were not followed through.He said he was never asked for funding to build up three months of supplies as had been done in South Asian countries. If requested he said he would have granted it. This is part of his argument that there was too much focus on planning for pandemic flu and ministers not quizzing the experts enough.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingA mistake to not look at different types of pandemic - Cameronpublished at 13:42 British Summer Time 19 June 202313:42 BST 19 June 2023Laura FosterHealth reporter at the inquiryDavid Cameron was in the witness box this morning for 1 hour and 27 minutes (with one short break).During that time he said that the UK was focused on an influenza pandemic and that it was a mistake to not look at different types of pandemic.In fact, by my count, he said this at least 7 times - clearly a point he wants the inquiry to be aware of.But he is not the only one to say this.Multiple witnesses that appeared last week said similarly.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingInquiry breaks for lunchpublished at 13:38 British Summer Time 19 June 202313:38 BST 19 June 2023Baroness Hallett has broken the inquiry for lunch.

In one record of minutes from 2016, there was no ministerial attendance. It says that board members agree ministerial engagement adds to the effectiveness of the board. It also says members "were concerned by the secretary of state's [Jeremy Hunt] continuing lack of engagement with the Board."Keith asks Wormald what steps he took to ensure that the Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, attended future meetings, however Wormald says he doesn't recall having a conversation about this. "I remember having conversations with the secretary of state in general" which he thought was the best way to deal with the issue.

All the legal powers, he says, are with the Secretary of State. These boards in question do not hold any decision making responsibilities. They are "legally, purely advisory boards."

Keith asks whether those legal obligations applied to all emergencies, or just health-related ones - pandemic emergencies, for example.Sir Chris Wormald responds: "The nature of emergencies means it's not always that clear cut."Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWATCH the Covid inquiry livepublished at 13:05 British Summer Time 19 June 202313:05 BST 19 June 2023A reminder - you can watch proceedings live by pressing the Play icon at the top of this page.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWormald reiterates sympathy for those affected by pandemicpublished at 13:00 British Summer Time 19 June 202313:00 BST 19 June 2023Sir Chris Wormald has been sworn in and is giving evidence.Counsel for the Inquiry, Hugo Smith KC is back questioning now after having to relinquish duties over David Cameron due to their personal relationship.

He said it was needed to get the public finances in order and without doing so there would have been less money for the NHS.âYour health system is only as strong as your economy â one pays for the other,â he tells the inquiry.And he also pointed out that while other public services were cut, the NHS was actually protected by his government.This is true. The NHS budget rose by an average of 1% to 2% after inflation during his premiership and the years following him stepping down. But this compared to an average of 4% during the rest of its history â so while the budget did rise it still represented a squeeze.And it is a major reason why waiting times have worsened and the UK has fewer staff and beds per head than many other western European countries.But what was not protected was other areas of health spending, such as training and public health.However, it is worth noting the Conservatives were not alone in advocating this approach â at both the 2010 and 2015 elections Labour did not promise significantly more for the NHS.Image source, .Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCameron sorry for loss of life in Covid pandemicpublished at 12:48 British Summer Time 19 June 202312:48 BST 19 June 2023Mitchell continued his questioning of David Cameron by asking whether "in retrospect, do you think that as prime minister, your government's failure to plan for the economic impacts on individuals and businesses played any role in the catastrophic loss of lives when the storm of Covd-19 arrived in the UK?"Cameron replied that he was "desperately sorry about the loss of life" and acknowledged the ways people continue to suffer. "I've tried to be as frank as I can and open as I can about the things my government did that helped put in place the right architecture for looking at these threats. "But I've also tried to be frank about the things that were missed and the thing I struggle with is why they were missed because [the government] was not asking questions about asymptomatic transmission."Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCameron finishes giving evidencepublished at 12:43 British Summer Time 19 June 202312:43 BST 19 June 2023David Cameron has now finished his evidence and the Covid-19 Inquiry has paused for a brief break.We're still analysing Cameron's evidence and will continue to tell you what was said.Next up, soon, is Sir Chris Wormald who is a permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).Stay with us and we'll bring you the latest.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingCredit due for Sunak over furlough scheme - Cameronpublished at 12:42 British Summer Time 19 June 202312:42 BST 19 June 2023Cameron praises Rishi Sunak for taking the furlough decision when he did, when the pandemic hit in March 2020."You need to have the capacity in the economy in order to be able to do it," he explains.Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingScottish Bereaved Families representative takes overpublished at 12:40 British Summer Time 19 June 202312:40 BST 19 June 2023Image source, UK Covid-19 InquiryClaire Mitchell KC from the Scottish Bereaved Families group is questioning Cameron.She begins by stating that Cameron knew during his time in office about the risks of a pandemic and understood one was 'inevitable'. Mitchell's first question to Cameron asks whether, when in government, did he make any plans for the effect economically on individuals in the UK? Cameron says there are two answers to that: "The biggest thing, was to get the British economy and the public finances in a state where they were capable of responding to the next crisis."And secondly: "In the national risk assessments, there's quite a lot of material about national business resilience planning. To that extent, there was a plan."However, Mitchell is not happy with Cameron's answer and asks him to focus on individuals. He replies: "Until you know exactly what pandemic you face, and whether you're going to need people at home... those decisions can be made very quickly... but you need to have the capacity in the economy to do it."Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingprevious pagePage 2 of 4123â¦4next pageHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

The system typically has residents go from schools in Tier 1, local gyms in Tier 2, and longer-term sheltering in Tier 3. However, Tier 2 shelters were not available due to substantial damage to a majority of municipal gyms. Thus, residents had to continue residing in the schools until a Tier 3 shelter in Tamuning could be established.The Tier 3 shelter was later able to be established through a coordination of government officials and nonprofit organizations, such as the American Red Cross and the Southern Baptist Disaster Recovery. The ARC is able to provide physical and mental nursing, along with spiritual and non-denominational care, according to Erick McCurdy, a volunteer from ARC’S Central California region.However, the Tier 3 shelters are not anything fancy.“There are no air conditioners here, and there are no separate rooms for privacy,” said McCurdy. “Once you walk in, it’s like just one big bedroom.”Senator Lujan has also aired his concerns due to the Tamuning and Astumbo shelters having a number of issues, from an Influenza B outbreak and non-timely removal of garbage and waste to now confirmed cases of COVID-19.“I and my staff personally went down to the shelter to see the situation for ourselves, and deemed it dire and disturbing,” said Lujan. “These conditions are unacceptable and we need to remedy the situation immediately.”In regards to the COVID-19 cases, Lujan stated that it is urgent to isolate the family due to elderly workers being present in the facility.

DPHSS needs to do something about it now!” Lujan concluded.Lujan has now made a request to the governor “to designate Tamuning Elementary School, Lyndon B. Johnson Elementary School, and Chief Brodie Elementary School, or any available hotels as additional shelters to house displaced island residents.”“I believe by utilizing the aforementioned schools or any available hotels as additional shelters and hiring NGOs to manage the shelters we can help alleviate the situation at the current shelters,” stated Lujan. “Adding these facilities will improve living conditions, accelerate recovery, and further progress can take place. Our people deserve nothing less.”Guam’s Department of Public Health and Social Services stated in response that all affected families remain in isolation at non-congregate facilities. Multiplex testing, which tests for COVID-19, Influenza and RSV, are available to shelter residents. The shelter residents can also receive face masks and hand sanitizers while utilizing hand washing stations.DPHSS is working with the American Red Cross for further surveillance and monitoring of shelter residents.Immediate relocationIn response to Lujan’s request, the Leon Guerrero-Tenorio administration stated that they have requested for the immediate relocation of the American Red Cross Tier III Shelter at the Guam Pak Warehouse in Tamuning.“We began the process of securing a new location with remaining inventory,” said the administration. “Sites previously identified as shelters, including village gymnasiums, are either under construction or left severely damaged by Typhoon Mawar. These challenges are compounded by limited commercial real estate available for such support.”The administration is now discussing long-term solutions with the Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority, the Office of Homelessness Assistance and Poverty Prevention, and the Department of Labor in order to assist vulnerable populations through stable housing.
