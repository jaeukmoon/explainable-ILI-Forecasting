- Seasonal influenza is responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths annually.
- The current method for managing influenza is vaccination using a standardized amount of the influenza virus' primary surface antigen, hemagglutinin (HA).
- The variability of HA due to antigenic drift and manufacturing processes can lead to variable vaccine efficacy.
- Alternative vaccine platforms, such as cell-based, recombinant protein, and mRNA vaccines, are being explored to improve vaccine efficacy.
- mRNA vaccines, with their rapid production capabilities, are appealing for influenza vaccination.
- A quadrivalent mRNA vaccine encoding HA from four seasonal influenza viruses was evaluated for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice.
- The vaccine induced robust antibody responses against each subtype and provided full protection against morbidity and mortality, even at low doses.
- A single administration of the quadrivalent mRNA vaccine was sufficient to prevent weight loss caused by influenza infection.
- These results suggest that the mRNA vaccine has promise for the prevention and mitigation of influenza.
