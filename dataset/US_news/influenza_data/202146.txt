Here we show, by monitoring frequencies of CD4 T cells specific to the conserved hemagglutinin epitope HA118-132 and titres of IgG against the corresponding recombinant hemagglutinin protein, that antigen-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses are closely linked to pre-existing immunity and vaccine history. Upon immunization, a strong early reaction is observed in all vaccine naïve participants and also in vaccine experienced individuals who have not received the respective seasonal vaccine in the previous year. This response is characterized by HA118-132 specific CD4 T cells with a follicular helper T cell phenotype and by ascending titers of hemagglutinin-specific antibodies from baseline to day 28 following vaccination. This trend was observed in only a proportion of those participants who received the seasonal vaccine the year preceding the study. Regardless of history, levels of pre-existing antibodies and CD127 expression on CD4 T cells at baseline were the strongest predictors of robust early response. Thus, both pre-existing immunity and vaccine history contribute to the response to seasonal influenza vaccines.

Seasonal vaccinations account for antigenic changes of the most abundant influenza strains and represent an important measure for prevention1. An effective immune response to the vaccine leads to the generation of neutralizing antibodies that are able to prevent viral entry2,3. However, great variations of the antibody titers elicited by the vaccine have been observed4,5,6 with particularly poor antibody induction and impaired affinity maturation occurring in individuals receiving repeat vaccinations4,7,8,9,10,11,12. Maturation of antibody responses is a T cell-dependent process and recent data strongly suggest that this is also the case in the context of recall responses13,14. Thus, defining the role of influenza-specific T cells in the different outcomes after repeat vaccinations is of major relevance. Among CD4 T helper cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are key players in the generation of antibody responses as they provide the fundamental signals to B cells in the germinal center (GC) reaction underlying affinity maturation. Tfh cells are characterized by expression of the CXC motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) and programmed death protein 1 (PD-1)15. Since GC-derived Tfh cells are difficult to assess in humans, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells are commonly used as surrogates as they share phenotypic, functional, and clonal characteristics with lymphoid tissue-derived GC-Tfh cells16,17,18,19,20,21. However, the definitions used to identify cTfh cells are heterogeneous22 and are mostly limited to the expression of CXCR5 (+/−PD-1) as well as CD38 and inducible T cell costimulatory (ICOS) to identify activated cTfh populations. The master transcription factor of Tfh cells, Bcl615 is not expressed on cTfh cells18,23 and the precise expression patterns of other transcription factors that have been associated with Tfh development, such as T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) and TOX, remain to be identified24,25. Furthermore, they have not been established as lineage-defining markers for antigen-specific cTfh cells in humans as they are not exclusively active in the Tfh program25,26. Previous studies analyzing bulk cTfh cells after influenza vaccination identified a peak of activation on day 7 characterized by CD38, ICOS, and CXCR3 expression27,28,29,30. Similar to observations on antibody titers after repeat vaccination, this was more strongly pronounced in individuals without self-reported influenza vaccination in the preceding years11. In other studies, activation-induced marker or cytokine expression after antigen stimulation confirmed the presence of antigen-specific CD4 T cells within this population23,31 and an increase of this population correlated with the amount27,29,31,32 and the avidity28 of the flu-specific antibodies, suggesting a mechanistic connection between cTfh responses and vaccine-elicited antibodies10,11,30. However, few studies have aligned the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II epitope sequences with the current vaccine strain or have phenotypically analyzed influenza-specific CD4 T cell responses at baseline and earlier than day 7 after vaccination27,33.Here we show by analyzing CD4 T cells specific for a highly conserved hemagglutinin (HA)-derived epitope of influenza A virus using tetramer technology that allows comprehensive and longitudinal characterization of circulating influenza-specific CD4 T cells that response patterns are closely associated with vaccination history. In addition, activation patterns of vaccine-induced, influenza-specific CD4 T cell responses correlate with vaccine-elicited antibody titers and baseline factors that might be able to predict the cellular and humoral response to the vaccine are observed.ResultsExpansion of influenza-specific CD4 T cells after vaccinationSeasonal influenza vaccines are adapted to include the sequence mutations of the influenza virus strains predicted to be most common. In order to longitudinally analyze circulating influenza-specific CD4 T cells responding to the vaccine (Fig. 1a), we focused on two HLA-DRB1*01:01–MHC class-II-restricted HA3-derived epitopes (HA118-132 VPDYASLRSLVASSG and HA306-318 PKYVKQNTLKLAT) in 12 individuals (Table 1). While the latter (HA306-318) has been employed in studies to analyze vaccine-elicited CD4 T cell responses23,34, it has not been included in the annual vaccine strains between 2016 and 2020, harboring sequence variations on two to three positions in recent years (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, HA118-132 was conserved in all annual vaccine strains in that time span. Using pMHCII-tetramer technology, we analyzed HA118-132- and HA306-318-specific CD4 T cells ex vivo in HLA-DRB1*01:01-positive individuals who received influenza vaccination in 2016/2017, 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and/or 2020/2021 (see also Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1). We could identify an increase in HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies as early as 4 days after vaccination (with few individuals already showing an increase on day 2), suggesting a direct effect of the vaccine on the expansion of this T cell subset (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 3a–c). In contrast, frequencies of HA306-318-specific CD4 T cells did not change, indicating that the sequence variations in the vaccine strain prevented the activation of this T cell specificity. (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2). The dynamics of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies showed strong heterogeneity between individuals. Therefore, we separated our cohort of vaccinees into three different groups according to their self-reported vaccination history: Blue = vaccinated in the previous year, turquoise = last vaccine received >1 year ago [range 2–10 years], red = vaccine-naive (Fig. 1e). As shown in Fig. 1f, vaccine-naive donors (red) and those with repeat vaccination within 2–10 years (turquoise) showed higher fold changes (FC) of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies compared to vaccinees with repeat vaccination within 1 year (blue), with some individuals almost maintaining baseline frequencies (e.g., #2-2019 and #5-2016). In addition, frequencies in vaccine-naive donors peaked earlier (around day 4) compared to the vaccine-experienced groups. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the expansion dynamics of influenza-specific CD4 T cells are heterogeneous among vaccinees but appear to be linked to the individual’s vaccination history.Fig. 1: Recognition of the HA118-132 epitope leads to expansion of pre-existing memory HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells following seasonal vaccination.a Design of the vaccination study. b Epitope amino acid sequences of the tetramers and within seasonal vaccines.

These phenotypic analyses revealed a memory phenotype on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells at baseline, characterized by high expression levels of CD127 in the absence of activation or proliferation. In line with our observations on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies, Ki67 peaked early after vaccination, which was associated with a decrease of CD127 expression (Fig. 2a, b). Both changes were most prominently observed in vaccine-naive donors (red) and to a lesser extent in those with repeat vaccination within 2–10 years (turquoise). Similarly, co-expression of ICOS and CD38 on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells as early as day 4 post vaccination was significantly higher in individuals receiving the first seasonal vaccine (red), compared to those with repeat vaccination within 2–10 years (turquoise) and 1 year (blue, Fig. 2c). ICOS and CD38 co-expression on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (on day 4) positively correlated with the FC of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies (from baseline to day 4, Fig. 2d), which was largely driven by the vaccine-naive donors. Among the recently vaccinated cohort (blue), the donors that had little to no change in HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequencies (e.g., #2-2019 and #5-2016, Fig. 1f) nevertheless upregulated ICOS and CD38, demonstrating that all donors mounted an HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell response by proliferation, activation, or both. We subsequently analyzed HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell responses in more detail, including markers that have previously been associated with activation in response to vaccination (CXCR3) and Tfh cell differentiation (CXCR5, PD-1). Results are shown as normalized mean fluorescence intensity and FC of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells frequencies at baseline on heatmaps (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). These data display marked, although heterogeneous, alterations from baseline to days 4 and 7 after vaccination for all plotted parameters, appearing to separate the entire cohort into a group with activation signals dominating on day 4 and a group with activation predominantly on day 7. In both groups, changes largely returned to baseline levels between day 14 and day 28 post vaccination (Fig. 2e).Fig. 2: HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells are highly activated and proliferate upon vaccination and the individual dynamics are associated with vaccination history.a–c Expression of CD127, Ki67, and ICOS+CD38++ on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells at the indicated time points.

Using an unbiased approach, however, the vaccine cohort separated into two groups (Fig. 3a). The group including individuals displaying a strong HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation at day 4 after vaccination was termed “early” (green), while the group including those patients with delayed or absent HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation upon vaccination was termed “late” (black) (Fig. 3a). Importantly, vaccination history was closely but not exclusively associated with “early” and “late” HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation. Indeed, all vaccine responses classified as “late” were observed in individuals who had received the seasonal vaccine in the previous year, whereas most “early” responses were observed in individuals who had received their first influenza vaccination or had not received a vaccination in the previous year (Fig. 3a). This observation is exemplified by individuals #12, #13, and #14 who received their first vaccination in 2019 and displayed an “early” activation pattern on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells and a “late” activation pattern following their second vaccination in 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Among all the markers that were analyzed, CD38 and ICOS expression 4 days after vaccination most strongly discriminated between the “early” and the “late” groups (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig 4b). In addition, definite classification of vaccine responses into an “early” and a “late” group was even independently possible by analyses of expression levels of either marker (Fig. 3b). Next, we visualized the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells at baseline and on days 4 and 7 after vaccination using dimension reduction with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analyses. These analyses revealed the presence of four distinct T cell clusters within the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell population (Fig. 3c). While cluster 1 represents cells with a resting memory phenotype (CD127+, TCF-1+), cluster 2 represents strongly activated, proliferating Tfh-like cells (CD38+, ICOS+, Ki67+, CXCR5+, PD-1+), cluster 3 represents strongly activated and proliferating cells with less Tfh cell characteristics (CD38+, ICOS+, Ki67+), and cluster 4 includes cells with a moderately activated, effector phenotype (CD127low, CD38low, T-bet high, see also corresponding heatmap). At baseline, HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells independent of the vaccination history are located in the memory cluster 1. On day 4, clusters 2 and 3 were populated with cells that predominantly were derived from individuals who had not received a vaccination in the previous year (red and turquoise) or who displayed an “early” activation phenotype (green), depending on the group stratification. In contrast, cells from recently vaccinated individuals (blue) and those that displayed a “late” activation phenotype (black) maintained their cluster 1 localization. On day 7, the effector cluster 4 was the most populated cluster, including cells from all groups. Thus, tSNE analyses reveal the presence of two distinct but transient clusters of highly activated and proliferative HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (clusters 2 and 3) that are largely specific and unique to cells derived from individuals with an “early” activation response. In addition, cells from individuals with a “late” response maintain their memory characteristics (cluster 1) or convert directly to the moderately activated, effector phenotype cluster 4 on day 7 without populating clusters 2 and 3. Collectively, these data demonstrate that vaccine-associated HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell responses can exhibit two distinct activation patterns.Fig. 3: Longitudinal analysis of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell responses shows two distinct activation signatures after seasonal influenza vaccination.a Heatmap of z scores calculated per marker based on MFI of marker expression levels on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells and frequency (FC) of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells from all analyzed responses on day 4 (n = 19) with unbiased clustering of the responses. b Cut-off value of CD38 and ICOS expression on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells day 4 (mean MFI + 3× standard deviation (SD) of the late responder group) for discrimination of early (green n = 9) and late responses (black n = 10). Representative dot plots show co-expression of ICOS+CD38++ on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells for an early and a late response. c t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) analysis with FlowSOM clustering was performed of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells based on polychromatic flow cytometric data (panel 2) including all responses (vaccination history: red n = 3, turquoise n = 1, blue n = 7, activation: green n = 6, black n = 5) at the indicated time points. The frequency of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells was analyzed within the clusters at the indicated time points (box plots). The heatmap summarizes the phenotypical characteristics of clusters 1–4. The color scaling of the tSNE plots below indicates the expression levels of the indicated makers.

This was particularly relevant as it has previously been suggested that secondary expansion of memory T cells in response to vaccination occurs independently of glycolysis40. Within all HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells, we observed the tendency of elevated 2-NBDG uptake after vaccination (Fig. 4a). More detailed analysis at the level of the differentially activated subpopulations of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 4b) revealed significantly elevated 2-NBDG uptake within ICOS+CD38++ cells compared to ICOS−CD38+ and double-negative HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5c) indicating a shift of their metabolic demands as activated, proliferating cells. In previous studies, ICOS and CD38 upregulation was associated with the presence of a cTfh cell phenotype on bulk CD4 T cells after influenza vaccination23,27 (Supplementary Fig. 5a). This observation could be confirmed on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Indeed, cells with a CXCR5+PD-1+ (cTfh) phenotype were most frequently detected within the ICOS+CD38++ subset (Fig. 4d). As expected, based on the cluster analysis in Fig. 3c, individuals who have not been vaccinated in the previous year displayed a significantly stronger emergence of HA118-132-specific cTfh cells compared to those who had recently been vaccinated (Fig. 4e). Next, we analyzed the expression of the transcription factor TOX. Members of the TOX family (especially TOX and TOX2) were recently identified as critical regulators of Tfh development in mice upstream of Bcl625. TOX expression was significantly higher in cTfh vs. non-cTfh HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells early after vaccination (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting that TOX might be involved in the emergence of cTfh cell responses within HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells upon vaccination. Taken together, the ICOS+CD38++ influenza-specific CD4 T cell population that shapes the “early” activation response after seasonal influenza vaccination is characterized by high metabolic demands and phenotypic and transcriptional markers of Tfh differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 5d).Fig. 4: Highly activated ICOS and CD38 co-expressing HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells with altered metabolic demands show a Tfh phenotype early after vaccination.a Glucose uptake of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells was determined using the fluorescent tracer 2-NBDG.

In order to confirm these results on the protein-specific level, we assessed antibody titers against the respective seasonal HA recombinant protein and the entire vaccine by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline and 28 days after vaccination. Since the HA protein from A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 was not available, the HA protein from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 with a 99% sequence homology was used to analyze samples from the 2018/2019 vaccine season. However, testing all samples against all three HA proteins revealed almost identical results with the exception of the 2019 samples that showed lower FC when tested against the HA protein from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 compared to the HA protein from A/Kansas/14/2017 (which corresponds to the 2019 vaccine strain and has a 98% homology to the HongKong strain) (Supplementary Fig. 6e) Most individuals displayed an increase in HA-specific antibodies from baseline to day 28 with few individuals from the recently vaccinated group showing stable or even declining titers (Fig. 5a). In contrast, IgG levels against the entire vaccine increased in all vaccinees (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). The FC of HA-specific antibodies from baseline to day 28 was significantly higher in individuals who had not been vaccinated in the previous year (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 6c). However, the presence of an “early” activation phenotype on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells was an even stronger predictor of an increase in HA-specific antibodies (Fig. 5b). HA-specific IgG levels on day 28 were similar in both groups (Fig. 5c). In line with the association between an “early” activation phenotype and strong IgG induction, the percentage of HA118-132-specific ICOS+CD38++ CD4 T cells at day 4 as well as the percentage of HA118-132-specific cTfh cells at day 4 correlated with the FC of HA-specific antibodies (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 6d), suggesting a direct link between early influenza-specific CD4 T cell activation and antibody induction. In contrast, the FC of the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequency at day 4 showed no correlation with the FC of HA- or vaccine-specific antibodies (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 6d), indicating that phenotypic changes more specifically associate with antibody induction than the FC of the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequency. These data implicate the induction of antibody responses to the seasonal influenza vaccination with the “early” virus-specific CD4 T cell activation dynamics.Fig. 5: HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation and Tfh phenotype on day 4 correlate with the increase of HA-specific IgG after vaccination.a HA-specific IgG plasma levels, quantified by ELISA, are shown at the indicated time points.

One symbol represents one response at the indicated time point.Full size imageBaseline parameters associated with HA-specific IgG inductionIn order to decipher which immunological parameters determine the activation and expansion of the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells, we first analyzed which baseline parameters are associated with an “early” activation phenotype. For this analysis, we included the influenza-specific CD4 T cell and the humoral compartment since both, T cell intrinsic mechanisms and binding of the vaccine antigens by pre-existing antibodies may influence the virus-specific CD4 T cell response. Among the different baseline parameters shown in Fig. 6a (BL parameters stratified for vaccine history are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8), pre-existing HA-specific IgG levels and the expression levels of CD127 on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells showed a significant difference between the groups. Next, we aimed to analyze how the central parameters at baseline, day 4, and day 28 are interconnected and performed unbiased clustering, which showed a separation by vaccination history as well as by early and late responders (Fig. 6b). These parameters were subsequently included in a correlation matrix in order to analyze whether the relevant baseline parameters correlate among themselves (framed in purple), with HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation and cTfh differentiation at day 4 (green) and HA-specific IgG induction at day 28 (yellow). Among baseline parameters, pre-existing HA-specific IgG levels showed a reverse correlation with the percentage of CD127 expressing HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells and a positive correlation with the percentage of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 7a). All three baseline parameters correlated significantly with the percentage of HA118-132-specific ICOS+CD38++ CD4 T cells and—with the exception of baseline CD127 expression—with a cTfh phenotype on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells on day 4 (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). None of the baseline parameters correlated with the FC in HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell frequency from baseline to day 4 (Fig. 6c). HA-specific IgG levels and the percentage of CD127 expression on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells at baseline significantly correlated with the vaccine-elicited HA-specific IgGs (displayed as FC from baseline to day 28) (Supplementary Fig. 7d). In contrast, the baseline frequency of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells did not correlate with the IgG FC (Fig. 6c). When analyzing IgG responses against the entire vaccine (not only HA proteins), the correlation matrix largely confirmed the above-described correlations (Supplementary Fig. 9). Corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed a predictive potential of baseline parameters not only for the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell response at day 4 (early vs. late) but also for high vs. low antibody induction (Supplementary Fig. 10). Collectively, these results suggest that pre-existing antibodies and the frequency of CD127 expression on T cells both targeting the same influenza protein are central determinants for the course of the response against successive seasonal influenza vaccination that is characterized by strong CD4 T cell activation and followed by an increase in antibody titers.Fig. 6: BL parameters that influence the dynamics of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation and HA-specific IgG induction after seasonal vaccination.a Analysis of BL parameters to discriminate early and late responses.

Since Tfh cells have been established as a separate CD4 T cell lineage that is specialized in providing help to B cells in the context of affinity maturation, several studies have investigated CD4 T cell responses following seasonal influenza vaccination with a special focus on cells with a Tfh phenotype (i.e. co-expression of PD-1 and CXCR5). Importantly, several studies have shown a direct relationship between the frequency of activated cTfh cells following vaccination and influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses10,11,30,41. However, while antibody responses are typically analyzed in an antigen-specific fashion, activation or expansion patterns of their T cell counterparts have mostly been measured on bulk populations10,11,27,28,29,30,41, hindering conclusions on protein-specific T cell–B cell interactions. Indeed, analyses of influenza-specific CD4 T cells after vaccination have been hampered by three aspects: (1) The rapid development of viral variants due to antigenic drift and antigenic shift, (2) HLA diversity in humans, and (3) the small frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 T cells. In order to overcome these hurdles, we (1) identified an HLA-DRB1*01:01–MHC class II-restricted HA-derived epitope (HA118-132) from an H3N2 strain that was conserved throughout the 2016/2017, 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and/ 2020/2021 seasons, (2) performed HLA typing in all participating individuals, and (3) used bead-based tetramer enrichment techniques to recover sufficient numbers of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells for direct ex vivo analyses. Importantly, and in contrast to studies analyzing bulk CD4 T cells or using activation-induced markers, this approach offers the possibility to longitudinally track HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells from the resting state at baseline throughout the vaccine-induced activation. In contrast to CD4 T cells targeting a mutated epitope that has been used in previous studies of vaccine-induced CD4 T cell activation (HA306-318), HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells showed strong signs of activation and expansion after vaccination, clearly demonstrating antigen availability as a prerequisite for vaccine-induced CD4 T cell activation (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). However, the observation of two distinct response patterns, an “early” activation and a “late/absent” activation, clearly demonstrates that antigen recognition alone does not determine the vaccine response. Indeed, it has previously been shown that repeat influenza vaccination reduces the antibody induction and impairs the affinity maturation of influenza-specific antibodies4,5,6,7,8,9. This observation has also been linked to the activation of bulk cTfh cells 7 days after vaccination that has been shown to be lower in those individuals who had received the vaccine in the previous years compared to those who did not10,11,27,28,29,30,41. However, it remained unclear whether this association can be recapitulated on an antigen-specific level and whether the analysis of influenza-specific T cells might provide additional insights regarding the dynamics of these interactions. One novel insight was the identification of two highly activated T cell clusters that were evident in a subset of vaccines on day 4 after vaccination and were characterized by strong ICOS and CD38 expression, with (cluster 2) or without (cluster 3) a cTfh signature (Fig. 3c). These clusters were transient and not present on day 7, a time point at which many studies have analyzed vaccine-elicited T cell responses. The presence of these clusters was largely restricted to patients with an “early” response, which was in turn associated with a strong induction of antibodies targeting the same protein. Similar to previous observations on the bulk level10,11, the individual vaccine history was closely associated with the presence of the “early” activation pattern and most vaccinees displaying strong CD4 T cell activation had not received a vaccine in the previous year (Fig. 3a). However, some individuals with repeat vaccination who displayed an “early” activation subsequently showed a strong increase in antibody responses, making the presence of an “early” activation signature on HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells a better predictor of an increase of HA-specific antibodies than the vaccine history (Fig. 5b).The antigen-specific approach also allowed us to analyze the composition of the HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell pool regarding follicular T helper lineage commitment and the defining transcription factors. Indeed, several transcription factors such as Bcl6 and TCF-1 are involved in the Tfh program. However, Bcl6 is not detectable in cTfh cells18,19,23 and TCF-1 expression is also involved in memory formation26 and heavily downregulated after activation and is therefore not suited to confirm Tfh lineage commitment in the immediate post-vaccination scenario. More recently, TOX and TOX2 have been shown to support the Tfh program upstream of Bcl6 in mice25. Whether TOX is also expressed in antigen-specific Tfh cells in humans has not been analyzed. The observation that TOX expression is induced after vaccination most strongly on cells with a cTfh phenotype suggests that TOX might be useful as a transcriptional surrogate of Tfh lineage commitment in cTfh cells (Fig. 4f).Collectively, our data clearly suggest that activation of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells and acquisition of Tfh characteristics are important prerequisites for the emergence of vaccine-elicited antibodies and that this is also connected to an individual’s vaccine history. However, it remains to be demonstrated which mechanisms prevent CD4 T cell activation in those who receive repeat vaccinations. One possible explanation could be a refractory state of T cells after repeat circles of re-activation, which would be supported by the expression patterns of CD127, the IL-7-receptor alpha-chain. CD127 expression identifies T cells with memory characteristics35,42 as signaling via CD127 promotes survival and maintenance of long-lived memory T cells43. In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for example, the ability of HCV-specific CD8 T cells to proliferate is closely associated with the expression of CD127. Indeed, HCV-specific CD8 T cells can be separated into memory-like cells with retained functional capacities that express high levels of CD127 expression and terminally exhausted CD8 T cells with lower CD127 expression44,45. Similarly, in our cohort, high CD127 expression at baseline was associated with strong activation 4 days after vaccination (Fig. 6a). Subsequently, CD127 was downregulated on proliferating cells46 and CD127-expressing cells again dominated the specific CD4 T cell population 28 days after vaccination when the antigen was no longer available47 (Fig. 2). Thus, low CD127 expression because of repeat antigenic stimulation might be one factor responsible for the different activation kinetics of HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells. It is worth noting in this context that HA118-132-specific CD4 T cells displayed an antigen-experienced memory phenotype in all individuals, regardless of the vaccination history, suggesting that all individuals had been exposed to an influenza strain carrying this HA peptide (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, the differences between early and late responses are not merely due to initial priming vs. secondary challenge. Another potential explanation for the different activation signatures could be the pre-existing antibody levels. Indeed, compared to individuals with a vaccine-naive history, those who had recently been vaccinated had significantly higher titers of pre-existing vaccine-specific IgGs at baseline (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). One possible explanation that has been brought forth to explain ineffective seasonal vaccination is the concept of the original antigenic sin, which describes the phenomenon that antibodies targeting epitopes of the first strain an individual has been exposed to are predominantly boosted after vaccination at the expenses of antibodies targeting novel epitopes48,49. However, this concept may not apply in our study focusing on T cells targeting a conserved epitope that are differentially activated in repeated vaccinations even within the same individuals (Supplementary Fig. 4). Alternatively, pre-existing antibodies have been suggested to mask relevant epitopes that could subsequently prevent the stimulation of specific B cells50,51. Thus, it is equally conceivable that such a mechanism might result in insufficient uptake of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and subsequently reduced presentation via MHC class II to influenza-specific CD4 T cells. Furthermore, IgG-opsonized antigens (immune complexes) influence antigen availability and processing by binding to Fcγ receptors on APCs and B cells. Thereby, the different route of antigen uptake is a key determinant for further antigen processing and presentation52,53,54. “Negative interference” of pre-existing antibodies with antigen availability uptake and presentation might also be involved in the context of the “antigenic distance hypothesis”8,55. Indeed, this hypothesis was developed based on the observation that, in certain contexts, repeat vaccinations suffer from limited efficacy and postulates that a small antigenic distance between two vaccine strains results in limited vaccine efficacy, especially when the season’s epidemic strain is antigenically more distant56. While the clinical relevance of this theory with respect to vaccine efficacy and translation into protective efficacy remains to be proven, the concept of “negative interference” could nevertheless explain the weak HA118-132-specific CD4 T cell activation and subsequent impaired antibody induction after repeat vaccination. In addition, the inverse correlation between pre-existing antibodies and the antibody induction may suggest that a certain target level of antibodies specific for a given antigen is centrally regulated11,30,57. This assumption would be supported by our observation that antibody levels were similar between groups at day 28 (Fig. 5c), suggesting that an immune-rheostat strives for a certain target level and prevents immune activation in response to the vaccine if the target level is already reached. In contrast to this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that individuals receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination after natural infection show stronger antibody responses than those with either natural infection or vaccination alone58,59,60,61. The sequence of natural infection followed by vaccination results in a state termed “hybrid immunity” and the higher antibody titers observed in these individuals has been attributed to the idea that the host perceives repeat antigenic exposure as an increased threat and subsequently strives for higher antibody titers62.Collectively, our data indicate that pre-existing vaccine-specific immunity and to a lesser degree an individual’s vaccination history determine the responsiveness to seasonal influenza vaccination on the levels of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells and that CD4 T cell activation is required for the emergence of corresponding antibodies. The failure of repeat vaccinations to induce CD4 T cell activation, despite the presence of their cognate antigen, should be considered in the design of novel vaccination strategies against seasonal viruses and requires additional research to identify the underlying mechanisms.MethodsDesignA total of 22 healthy donors, who were vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines in the time periods from 2016 until 2020, were enrolled in the study (Table 2 and Fig. 1b). Samples were obtained at BL (before vaccination), day 4, day 7, day 14, and day 28 after vaccination. In selected donors, additional samples were taken at day 2, day 10, and 28 days after the last sample on day 28 (follow-up 28) (Fig. 1a). Donor characteristics are included in the Table 1. The individual vaccination responses are grouped by the donors’ self-reported vaccination history. Antigen-specific CD4 T cell analysis was performed with samples from 12 DRB1*01:01-positive vaccinated individuals. HLA-typing was performed by next-generation sequencing using commercially available primers (GenDx, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Samples were run on a MiSeq system. NGSengine® Software (GenDx) was used for data analysis.EthicsThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg (474/14, 201/17) and written informed consent was obtained from all blood donors before enrollment in the study.Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for stainingETDA-anticoagulated venous blood samples were collected in Monovette tubes (Sarstedt, Nuembrecht, Germany). PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Pancoll (PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, PAN-Biotech). The cells were cryopreserved at −80 °C. Thawing of PBMCs was performed in complete medium (RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES; Fisher Scientific GmbH, Schwerte, Germany).Seasonal influenza vaccination and tetramer for T cell analysisTable 2 lists the seasonal vaccines in 2016–2020 with the associated influenza A strains of H3N2. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled MHC class II tetramers of HLA-DRB1* 01:01 Influenza (Flu)-derived epitope HA118-132 (aa-sequence: VPDYASLRSLVASSG) and epitope HA306-318 (aa-sequence: PKYVKQNTLKLAT) were obtained from MBL, Woburn, United States (Supplementary Table 1).Flow cytometryPBMCs were surface stained or fixed and permeabilized to stain intranuclear targets with specific antibodies (Supplementary Table 2 and see “Multiparametric flow cytometry for T cell analysis”) Cells were plated in 96-well-V-bottom plates and washed two times and resuspended in staining buffer (PBS + 1% fetal calf serum). Surface antibody mixtures were added followed by 40 min incubation at room temperature (RT). Fixable Viability dyeeFluor780 (eBioscience, Germany) was used for dead cell exclusion. Cells were then washed again and fixed in fixation buffer (PBS + 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde). For intranuclear staining, the FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience, Germany) was used after surface staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were resuspended in fixation buffers.Stained cells were analyzed with an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and multiparametric flow cytometric data were collected by the FACSDiva Software (Becton Dickinson). FlowJo 10.0.7 (LLC, BD Life Sciences, Ashland, OR, USA) was applied for the analysis of flow cytometric data. Gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.Magnetic bead-based enrichment of antigen-specific CD4 T cellsEnrichment of virus-specific CD4 T cells was adapted from the method as described previously63. In brief, 1–2 × 107 PBMCs of DRB1*01:01-positive donors were labeled with PE-coupled peptide-loaded HLA class II tetramers for 30 min. Tetramer specifications are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Subsequent enrichment was performed with anti-PE beads using MACS technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Enriched influenza-specific CD4 T cells were used for multiparametric flow cytometric analysis. Samples with less than five antigen-specific CD4 T cells (considered below limit of detection) were excluded from the final analysis. The frequency of influenza-specific CD4 T cells was calculated as follows: absolute number of influenza-specific CD4 T cells (enriched sample) divided by the absolute number of CD4 T cells (pre-enriched sample) × 200.Analysis of glucose uptakeFor monitoring glucose uptake, enriched influenza-specific CD4 T cells were incubated with 2-NBDG (100 µM) for 20 min at 37 °C in complete medium. After washing in complete medium, cells were surface stained as explained above.Multiparametric flow cytometry for T cell analysisThe following antibodies were used for multiparametric flow cytometry: anti-CD4-FITC (RPA-T4, 8037703, 1:50, Cat:#555346), anti-CCR7-BUV395 (3D12, 43026, 4:100, Cat:#563977), anti-CXCR5-APC (RF8B2, 558113, 1:50, Cat:#356908), anti-PD-1-BV786 (EH12.1, 1013122, 3:100, Cat:#563789), anti-CD134(OX40)-PE-Cy7 (ACT-35, 65008, 3:100, Cat:#563663), anti-CD38-BUV737 (HB7, 8339566, 1:200, Cat:#564686), anti-ICOS-BV711 (DX29, 7164540, 1:100, Cat:#563833), anti-CD127-BV421 (HIL-7R-M21, 9346341, 3:100, Cat:#562436), anti-CCR6-BV605 (11A9, 9065844, 3:100, Cat:#562724), anti-T-bet-PE-CF594 (O4-46,93533305, 3:100, Cat:#562467) (BD Biosciences), anti-CD4-AlexaFluor700 (RPA-T4, 300526, 1:200, Cat:#300526), anti-CXCR5-BV421 (J252D4, B252332, 1:100, Cat:#562747), anti-CXCR3-BV510 (G025H7, B293007, 3:100, Cat:#353726), anti-CD127-BV605 (A019D5, B320426, 3:100, Cat:#351334), anti-CD27-PE-Dazzle594 (M-T271, B291287, 1:400, Cat:#356422), anti-Ki67-PE-Cy7 (Ki67, B269861, 1:200, Cat:#350525) (BioLegend), anti-TCF-1-AlexaFluor488 (C63D9, 1:100, Cat:#6444) (Cell Signaling), anti-CD14-APC-eFluor780 (61D3, 1:100, Cat:#47-0149-42), anti-CD19-APC-eFluor780 (HIB19, 1:100, Cat:#47-0199), anti-TOX-eFluor660 (TRX10, 1:100, Cat:#50-6502) (eBioscience), anti-CD45RA-PerCP-Cy5.5 (HI100, 3:100, Cat:#45-0458-42), 2-NBDG (20 mM) (1:200, Cat:#N13195) (Invitrogen). For live/dead discrimination, a fixable Viability Dye (APC-eFluor780 1:200, Cat:#65-0865) (eBioscience) was used.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFor the quantification of vaccine-specific IgG levels and HA recombinant IgG levels, aliquots of plasma samples were thawed prior to ELISA procedure. To determine influenza-specific IgG levels, Nunc MaxiSorp Plates (VWR, Bruchsal, Germany) were coated with 50 µL/well of seasonal influenza vaccines (diluted 1:100) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing the plate with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween) twice, 200 µL of 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS were added as block buffer and incubated for 1 h, RT. After washing (4×), 50 µL of the 1:16000 diluted plasma sample were applied and incubated for 2 h, at RT. After 4 washing steps, 50 µL/well of a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Fcgamma F(ab‘)2 fragment (1:20,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Dianova, Germany) were applied for detection and incubated for 1 h, RT followed by washing (4×). In all, 50 µL/well of TMB substrate was applied and incubated for 3.5 min followed by a reaction stop with 50 µL/well of 1 M H3PO4. Plates were measured with a Spark reader (TECAN GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Concentrations were calculated using the SparkControl magellan software 2.2 (TECAN GmbH). To determine HA recombinant-specific IgG levels, Immulon 4 HBX plates (ThermoFisher, Massachusetts, USA) were coated with 50 µL/well of recombinant HA3 protein (2 µg/mL) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The recombinant HA proteins of the strains Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, A/Kanas/14/2017, and A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 were used. The HA protein of the strain A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2) from the vaccine in the season 2018/2019 was not available. Instead, HA of A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was used for analysis, which shows 99% amino acid sequence similarity to A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2). After washing the plate with wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween, TPBS) three times, 100 µL of TPBS containing 3% non-fat dry milk (AmericanBio, Canton, MA, USA) were added as block buffer and incubated for 1 h, RT. After washing (4×), 50 µL of the 1:300 diluted plasma sample (with 1%-milk TPBS) were applied and incubated for 2 h, at RT. After 3 washing steps, 100 µL/well of an anti-human IgG Fab-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, 1:3000 diluted with 1%-milk TPBS) were applied for detection and incubated for 1 h, RT followed by washing (3×). In all, 100 µL/well of SigmaFast O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate was applied and incubated at RT followed by a reaction stop with 50 µL/well of 3 M HCl. Plates were measured with a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) at 490 nm.Clustering and heatmapFlowSOM clustering was performed based on lineage and activation markers: CXCR5, PD-1, CXCR3, ICOS; CD38, CD127, Ki67, TOX; T-bet, TCF-1 (xdim = 2, ydim = 2, random seed 7176). Cluster frequencies were exported from the Omiq software. The cluster composition was then visualized using the GraphPad Prism software. Mean signal intensity of marker expression in FlowSOM clusters was determined and visualized with the Omiq software (Omiq, Inc., 2020).tSNE analysisPhenotypic analysis of CD4 T cell responses was performed longitudinally in early and late responders. All influenza-specific CD4 T cell responses were grouped according to their self-reported vaccination history (Fig. 1e). The samples were analyzed to visualize high-dimensional phenotypes on a two-dimensional map using tSNE, as previously described36,64. Briefly, live singlet non-naive influenza-specific CD4 T cells were included in the analysis. Gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11. Two-dimensional tSNE representation was calculated (random seed 5229, max iterations 1000, perplexity 30, and theta 0.5) using the single-cell expression information from 10 antibody costainings (CXCR5, PD-1, CXCR3, ICOS; CD38, CD127, Ki67, TOX; T-bet, TCF-1) and analyzed using the Omiq software (Omiq, Inc., 2020).Statistics and reproducibilityStatistical tests and graphical visualization were performed using the GraphPad 8 software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Due to the small sample size, non-parametric tests were used. Paired data were analyzed with two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Unpaired data were analyzed with two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-test. In case of multiple comparisons, Bonferroni correction was applied. Adjusted levels for statistical significance are stated in the figure legends. Correlation analyses were performed by two-tailed Spearman correlation. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant with the following significance levels: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. ROC analysis was performed with 95% confidence interval and Wilson/Brown method. For visualization of summarized data, heatmaps were generated using the GraphPad 8 software. Heatmap analysis with unbiased clustering was done with R Studio (https://www.r-project.org) using the ComplexHeatmap package65. Spider plots were generated with Microsoft Excel 2010. Human samples are very limited, so it is not possible to perform experiments repeatedly.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Search Inicio » News » The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) calls for increased surveillance of avian influenza as outbreaks in poultry and wild birds intensify Press Release The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) calls for increased surveillance of avian influenza as outbreaks in poultry and wild birds intensify Published on 19 November 2021 Share: The page link has been copied to your clipboard View more Various subtypes of high pathogenicity avian influenza have been reported by more than 40 countries over the last six months. During the high-risk period of this disease, October to April, countries need to implement higher surveillance of avian influenza, implement strict biosecurity measures and ensure a timely reporting of outbreaks to curb its spread. Paris, 19 November 2021 – Since 1 May 2021, outbreaks of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) have been confirmed in 41 countries from different regions in poultry and wild birds. Currently present in Africa, Asia and Europe, the disease is a threat to economic stability, food security and livelihoods. Commonly known as bird flu, avian influenza is a very contagious disease which affects several species of poultry, as well as pet birds and wild birds, and occasionally, humans. This complex disease is caused by viruses divided in multiple subtypes whose genetic characteristics rapidly evolve. Over recent years, numerous subtypes of the HPAI viruses have been circulating in diverse bird populations on a large geographical scale. In particular in 2021, an unprecedented genetic variability of subtypes has been reported in birds, thus creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape. H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 or H5N8 are the subtypes currently circulating in poultry and wild bird populations across the world. The seasonal pattern of avian influenza has been well demonstrated over the past decade, with most outbreaks occurring during the winter of the Northern hemisphere. Given the data reported by countries to the World Animal Health Information System (OIE-WAHIS), the seasonal dynamics can be better anticipated: outbreaks usually begin to increase in October, peak in February and continue through April. Nearly 16,000 cases of HPAI in domestic and wild birds have already been reported this October, signalling the increased risk of virus circulation. On rare occasions, the disease can also pose a risk to human health and thus far, some recent human cases have been associated with the subtype H5N6 currently in circulation. Avian influenza is therefore one of the priorities of the Tripartite Alliance (FAO, OIE and WHO) and needs to be tackled under a One Health approach. It is critical that countries notify outbreaks in a timely manner to the OIE, to ensure an accurate monitoring of the evolution and spread of this transboundary disease. HPAI cases identified in poultry and non-poultry species, including wildlife are subject to notification. Updated reporting obligations will come into effect from 1 January 2022 onwards. Countries will also be requested to report infections with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses identified in domestic and captive wild birds and that have proven natural transmission to humans associated with severe health impacts. OIE Reference Laboratories specialised in avian influenza can support national laboratories in the diagnostic of their samples, as needed by countries. Because of the disease impacts on the livelihoods of poultry farmers and on international trade, as well as the risks of transmission to humans, the animal health sector must implement strict biosecurity measures in farms, in commerce and in live bird markets to prevent it from spreading. For instance, isolating infected birds from healthy ones and cleaning and disinfecting poultry premises is highly recommended. Proper planning and the implementation of surveillance programmes in wild birds, as well as, avoiding direct or indirect contact between domestic and wild birds is equally critical in mitigating outbreaks in domestic poultry and preventing the introduction of the virus into flocks. Thus, the OIE urges countries to maintain their surveillance efforts and to continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species including wild birds.

(Wyss Institute at Harvard University)Using a tiny tissue chip that models the human lung airway, NCATS-funded translational scientists have replicated in a laboratory how influenza viruses evolve as they travel from one person to another. Their innovative tool could sharpen predictions about the rise of dangerous new virus strains, slow the rise of drug-resistant variants and lead to more effective vaccines and treatments.Viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 mutate rapidly, fueling drug-resistant variants and frustrating vaccine development. The ever-evolving flu virus presents a particular challenge for scientists trying to predict the predominant strains in an upcoming flu season and produce effective vaccines.In a study published in Microbiology Spectrum, researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University detailed how a lung airway-on-a-chip, or lung tissue chip, allowed them to accurately mimic the real-world evolutionary paths flu viruses take as they’re passed among people treated with antiviral drugs.A cross-disciplinary team of engineers, biologists, virologists, immunologists and other scientific experts worked together to develop and customize the technology behind the lung airway tissue chip, a tiny, bioengineered, three-dimensional model of the human lung airway. The chip features two channels — an air channel and a blood channel — separated by human lung tissue on a porous membrane. Each channel is about the width of the lead in a pencil. As in a real human lung, lung airway epithelial cells face the air channel, while pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells face the blood channel.The researchers infected the lung cells with airborne flu virus via the chip’s air channel, then treated the cells with antiviral drugs via the blood channel. To mimic human-to-human transmission, they then passed the virus from one tissue chip to another tissue chip, repeating the infection-and-treatment process.The Wyss Institute’s approach could offer a cutting-edge 3-D model to predict viral evolution, as well as human responses to therapies.Using an influenza A (H1N1) strain that is sensitive to two antiviral drugs — amantadine and oseltamivir — the researchers measured how many passages from chip to chip that it took for the virus to develop mutations that made it resistant to drug treatment. They also tracked the mutations that arose as the virus moved from one chip to another.Within eight rounds of chip-to-chip passage, amantadine exposure led to a pool of variants that left the drug able to inhibit less than 10% of viral replication. Oseltamivir resistance took longer to develop — 25 passages from chip to chip. In contrast, nafamostat, a protease inhibitor drug that alters cells’ reactions to viruses, rather than attacking viruses directly, induced no viral resistance, even after 30 passes from chip to chip.A closer look at the variants’ mutations highlighted the lung airway chip’s real-world predictive potential. A key mutation conferring amantadine resistance in the lung airway tissue chips is frequently detected in humans who have contracted amantadine-resistant flu viruses. And a key mutation in the tissue chip–induced oseltamivir-resistant flu strain is present in real-world, clinical cases of oseltamivir resistance. The lung tissue chip model also revealed potential mutations not yet seen clinically.“We were able to show that some antiviral drugs are better [than others] at preventing the emergence of drug resistance,” explained Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., founding director of the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, who led the work. “That knowledge could help clinicians prioritize which drugs they should give first, and even identify effective antiviral combination therapies.”The lung airway-on-a-chip’s predictive potential could extend far beyond influenza viruses. “Drug resistance could be studied with any sort of pathogen that evolves quickly,” Ingber noted. “You could also use these chips to develop diagnostics that detect infections sooner and widen a patient’s therapeutic window.”The lung airway-on-a-chip also may be an integral piece in solving larger disease-specific puzzles. Harvard researchers are developing organ chips that can be linked together to model diseases and immune system responses in conditions ranging from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to cystic fibrosis. For example, linking a lung airway-on-a-chip to an immune system lymphoid follicle tissue chip could help researchers predict the effectiveness of an immunization against infection by airborne pathogens. Research using such tissue chip combinations is backed by NCATS through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) ImmuneChip+ program, which supports the creation of tissue chips that replicate the interaction of human organ tissues and the immune system.“Tissue chips are a powerful translational science tool that can speed the transformation of basic drug discoveries into effective treatments,” said Danilo Tagle, Ph.D., director of NCATS’ Office of Special Initiatives. “The Wyss Institute’s approach could offer a cutting-edge 3-D model to predict viral evolution, as well as human responses to therapies. With tissue chips, we could prevent many drug failures, create safer drug profiles and predict which drugs will be more effective in different populations.” Last updated on March 4, 2024 9609 Medical Center Drive Rockville, MD 20850-9793 301-594-8966 ncatsinfo@nih.gov Connect with us For language access assistance, contact the NCATS Public Information Officer Subscribe to NCATS News If you would like to stay up to date with the latest information from us, please sign up for NCATS News.

Video Ad Feedback How should you time your flu and Covid-19 shots? Dr. Fauci explains 00:54 - Source: CNN CNN — An influenza pandemic like the pandemic of 1918 could be even worse than Covid-19 has been, and the world is not ready to deal with it, the National Academy of Medicine said in a series of reports released Wednesday. Work needs to begin now to start developing next-generation vaccines, and to build up capacity in low- and middle-income countries so they can make their own vaccines without relying on wealthy nations to make them available, the reports recommended. And governments need to figure out how to make sure companies have the incentives to work on these vaccines without knowing whether they’ll ever be used or needed. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Related article Flu shots uptake is now partisan. It didn't use to be Covid-19 has been terrible, the Academy, an independent body that advises the US federal government on matters of medicine and health, said in the first of the the reports. “Yet, from an epidemiological perspective, COVID-19 does not represent a ‘worst-case’ pandemic scenario, such as the 1918-19 influenza, which resulted in at least 50 million deaths worldwide,” the report reads. Flu kills anywhere between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year in a normal year, according to WHO. Covid-19 has killed 5.1 millon people globally. The next influenza pandemic could kill 33 million people, the Academy said. It’s hard to predict when a new flu pandemic might hit – but it’s certain one will come. “Influenza pandemics have occurred repeatedly, and experts worry that the risk for an influenza pandemic may be even higher during the COVID-19 era due to changes in global and regional conditions affecting humans, animals, and their contact patterns. While it is difficult to predict when it will occur, a major influenza pandemic is more a matter of ‘when’ than ‘if,’ ” it added.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Mario Tama/Getty Images Related article Between flu and Covid-19, winter 'could be complicated' One major recommendation: a global “moonshot” to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect people against current and future flu strains. Current flu vaccines must be reformulated regularly, tweaked every year, and do not protect against emerging new strains that might cause pandemics. And this needs to be done as a matter of global coordination. “We have too many gaps, and too much is dependent on underfunded, often informal arrangements,” one of the reports reads. “Against the scale of the threat, we are woefully underprotected. We urgently need to strengthen our collective defenses against pandemic influenza and must do so in a way that is sustainable.” One report recommends having 4 billion to 8 billion doses of influenza vaccine ready to go just in case. “Preparedness has to be an ongoing commitment — it can’t be year to year, or crisis to crisis,” Dr. Victor Dzau, president of the National Academy of Medicine, said in a statement. “COVID-19 has enabled the emergence of new capabilities, technologies, collaboration, and policies that could also be deployed before and during the next influenza pandemic. It’s critical to invest in science, strengthen health systems, and ensure trust in order to protect people from the health, social, and economic consequences of seasonal and pandemic influenza.” Shutterstock Related article The coming flu season may be severe. Here's why One report specifically recommends that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the Department of Defense and other agencies invest in research now on new and better flu vaccines. “This will allow selection of the candidates most fit for purpose to be brought to authorization and sufficient production and distribution to optimize the control of influenza across diverse settings and phases of pandemics and epidemics,” the report read. “The World Health Organization should advocate and coordinate with multilateral stakeholders (e.g., the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), governments, funding agencies, the vaccine industry, and philanthropic organizations to build global capacity for robust and internationally comparable preclinical, clinical, and immunological assessments of influenza vaccine candidates, including novel candidates that use innovative structures, targets, and delivery systems to potentially broaden or improve protection,” it added.

One of the reports notes that the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that face masks and physical distancing contributed to the dramatic reduction of influenza activity globally. “Face masks would be simple and cost-effective during the next influenza pandemic, and public health agencies should mandate their use, when justified by the severity and incidence of influenza,” the Academy said in a statement.

Coping strategies that can help / Staying Healthy Time to stock up on zinc? November 19, 2021 By Robert H. Shmerling, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing As if stubbornly high rates of COVID-19 aren't giving us enough to worry about, welcome to cold and flu season! Yes, colds and influenza, two well-known upper respiratory infections, will soon be on the rise. Last year we saw remarkably low rates of flu. Many experts don't think we'll be so lucky this year. Think zinc? A new analysis reviewing available research suggests that over-the-counter zinc supplements could be one way to make cold and flu season a bit easier. Of course, this isn't the first study to look into zinc as an antiviral remedy, including for COVID-19. But the results of past research have been mixed at best: some studies find modest benefit, others find no benefit, and the quality of the research has been low. Also, some people experience bothersome side effects from zinc, such as upset stomach, nausea, and in some cases, loss of the sense of smell. What did the study say? Published in November 2021 in BMJ Open, the study looks at zinc for preventing or treating colds and flulike illness. The researchers reviewed more than 1,300 previous studies and narrowed the analysis down to 28 well-designed trials, which included more than 5,000 study subjects. Here's what they found: For preventing colds and flu-like illness: Compared with placebo, zinc supplements or nasal spray zinc are associated with fewer upper respiratory infections. The estimated effect was modest: about one infection was prevented for every 20 people using zinc. The strength of the evidence for these findings is considered low. A few studies suggest preventive effects were largest for reducing severe symptoms, such as fever and flulike illness. It's worth noting that the studies didn't confirm whether participants had flu infections. Small studies of intentional exposure to cold virus found that zinc did not prevent colds. For treating colds and flulike illness: Compared with placebo, those who took zinc had symptoms go away about two days sooner. The study estimated that of 100 people with upper respiratory infections, an extra 19 people would have completely recovered by day seven due to zinc treatment. The strength of the evidence for these findings is considered low. Some measures of symptom severity were lower for those treated with zinc (versus placebo): on day three of the infection, those taking zinc had milder symptoms. Further, there was an 87% lower risk of severe symptoms among those taking zinc. However, the daily average symptom severity was similar between those taking zinc and those taking placebo. The data quality and certainty of these findings were low to moderate. What else to consider before stocking up on zinc While these findings suggest promise in the ability of zinc to prevent or temper cold and flulike illness, here are other points to consider: Side effects. Side effects occurred more often in those taking zinc (versus placebo), including nausea and mouth or nose irritation. Fortunately, none were serious. But they might be bothersome enough for some people to stop using zinc. Cost. Zinc supplements are generally inexpensive. A daily dose of zinc lozenges for a month may cost less than $2/month (though I also found certain brands for sale online for as much as $75/month). Zinc deficiency. Study subjects either had normal zinc levels or were otherwise considered unlikely to be zinc deficient. There's a big difference between taking a zinc supplement to prevent or treat respiratory infections and taking it because your body lacks enough of the mineral. Zinc deficiency is more likely among people with poor nutrition or digestive conditions that interfere with mineral absorption; they require supplementation to avoid serious complications such as impaired immune function and poor wound healing. Different doses or types. Additional research is needed to determine the best way to take zinc. COVID-19. None of the studies in this analysis assessed the impact of zinc supplements on SARS-CoV-2, so these conclusions do not apply to COVID-19. You know the drill Perhaps this new analysis will convince you to take zinc this winter. Or perhaps you're still skeptical. Either way, don't forget tried and true preventive measures and treatments during cold and flu season, including these: Get a flu shot Wash your hands frequently Avoid contact, maintain physical distance, and wear a mask around people who are sick Get plenty of sleep Choose a healthy diet. If you do get sick: Stay home if possible Wear a mask if you can't avoid contact with others Drink plenty of fluids Take over-the-counter cold and flu remedies to reduce symptoms Contact your doctor if you have symptoms of the flu; early treatment can shorten the duration of the illness. In addition, other conditions (especially COVID-19) should be ruled out. Many of the measures recommended for cold and flu season overlap with those recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19. The bottom line Colds and flulike illnesses afflict millions every winter. You might feel as though it's inevitable you'll be among them. But you may be able to spare yourself the misery by following some simple, safe, and common-sense measures. As evidence mounts in its favor, perhaps these measures should include zinc. As for me, I remain steadfastly on the fence. But it wouldn't take much — perhaps one more large, well-designed, randomized controlled trial — to push me onto the zinc bandwagon.

A new study shows that there might be a way to protect against influenza infection without needing to stir up antibody response. Scientists from Stanford University investigated the effectiveness of an oral tablet flu vaccine called VXA-A1.1 by Vaxart, which uses cellular correlates of protection. Results from the Phase II human influenza challenge trial showed that those who were given VXA-A1.1 were better at providing protection against viral shedding compared to the injected inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). The 141 participants were divided into three groups who received either VXA-A1.1, an injected quadrivalent IIV, or a placebo and were challenged with the H1N1 flu virus 90 to 120 days post-vaccination. The researchers used mass cytometry to assess over 40 different immune cell parameters in collected blood samples. Profiling was conducted on the day before the vaccine was administered and then seven days after. Those who received VXA-A1.1 were found with plasmablasts and hemagglutinin (HA+)-specific cells that contributed to protection from viral shedding after 90 days. This was not seen in those who got IIV or a placebo. On day 8, those who were given the oral drug demonstrated T cell expressing markers that suggested enhanced mucosal tissue homing. “The data show that cellular responses are potentially more relevant for protection for an oral vaccine than circulating antibody responses,” said Dr. David McIlwain, a senior research scientist from the Stanford School of Medicine and the study’s lead author, in a statement. This is the first study to indicate that VXA-A1.1 may be viable against the influenza vaccine, providing a ray of hope to those looking for less invasive preventive solutions. Influenza remains a leading cause of death in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 36,000 people have died from the flu over the last decade. The highest numbers were recorded from 2017 to 2018 (at 61,000). From 2019 to 2020, around 22,000 flu-related deaths were logged in the U.S. alone. Worldwide, flu deaths range from 300,000 to 600,000 per year. Vaxart is a clinical-stage biotechnology firm that focuses on developing oral vaccine solutions against a number of viruses, including norovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal flu, and the human papillomavirus (HPV). In September, the company announced a new Manufacturing and Quality Advisory Board comprised of high-profile scientists with vast drug development backgrounds as part of plans to advance the late-stage development and commercialization of its growing vaccine portfolio. In August, it formed a Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board to act as adviser to Vaxart as it develops new technology. Details of the VXA-A1.1 study are published in Cell Host and Microbe.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently investigating an outbreak of influenza at the University of Michigan, where at least 528 students have tested positive for the flu since Oct. 6. The University of Florida, Florida State University, Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., and the University of Rhode Island are also seeing steep upward trends in campus flu cases this month. Nationwide, the positivity rate for flu is low, at 0.3 percent, but that skyrockets to 37 percent at the University of Michigan. The positivity rate at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, where Florida State University is, is around 30 percent, according to the hospital’s medical director of emergency services, Dr. Alex Ho. Still, beyond those college campuses, statewide flu cases in both Michigan and Florida remain low.Alicia Budd, an epidemiologist in CDC’s Influenza Division, said that it’s unsurprising for early-season flu outbreaks to start on college campuses, given their social nature. The difference this year, she said, is that “we didn’t see any flu activity to speak of since March 2020.”Spread of the flu ground to virtual halt when the Covid-19 pandemic took off, as mitigation measures like lockdowns, masking and social distancing went into place. Those not only stop the spread of Covid, but of other respiratory viruses like influenza. Flu season in the United States typically starts in October but doesn’t peak until December to February, Budd said. And though cases are rising, “the national activity is still lower than we saw at this time of year in 2019,” she added. “Worldwide flu activity is still low, though it is slowly but consistently increasing,” Budd said. “We’re going into this time of year in the Northern Hemisphere where it’s colder and people are inside more and where we have traditionally seen our respiratory activity increase. You combine this with the change from where we were a year ago at this time, where worldwide there was a much more stringent application of Covid measures like travel restrictions and masking, and now that’s being lifted to various degrees.”The overall positivity rate for last year’s flu season was 0.15 percent, compared to almost 17 percent the year before, CDC data show. The hospitalization rate was also much lower, at 0.8 per 100,000 cases, compared to 66.2 per 100,000 the season before. A bad strain, plus low vaccination ratesSo far this year, 90 percent of flu cases are the H3N2 strain, according to the CDC. That’s a strain that could point to a bad flu season ahead, Ho said. “The majority of the time flu infection is going to be uncomplicated — you’re not going to feel well,” Ho said. “But what we’ve seen is, during years when H3N2 is circulating, we’ve had higher rates of hospitalization and death.”The last time H3N2 was the dominant strain was the 2017-18 flu season, when the U.S. saw 710,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 52,000 flu-related deaths, the worst since the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. The 2017-18 flu season also began in early November and was one of the longest flu seasons in recent years. Ho also noted that the H3N2 tends to mutate faster than other strains of influenza. This year’s flu shot does cover a version of H3N2, but “there is a chance that it could change enough for the vaccine to become less effective,” he said. “We just don’t know yet.”That doesn’t mean people should skip their flu shots. At the University of Michigan, 77 percent of cases so far have been in unvaccinated students, a factor that Ho said is contributing to the outbreak. While many people are getting vaccinated against Covid this year, fewer people are getting their flu shots, he said. Still, there’s a chance the dominant strain will change.“While the predominant strain we’re seeing is H3N2 right now, it may not be for the entire season,” Budd said. “The flu does unusual things all the time and we’ve seen situations where early season outbreaks are not indicative of the strain that prevails for the season.”Right now, the flu outbreaks seem to be contained to just a few college campuses, making it still too early to tell how this year’s flu season will go. “It’s an unknown right now how this will play out,” said Dr. Neha Vyas, a family medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic. “Over the next several months, now that people are traveling for the holidays and mixing more, this is going to be the big test.” Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Kaitlin SullivanKaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.

For pathogens with multiple serologically distinct strains, there is a need to describe composite exposure to an antigenically variable group of pathogens. In this study, we assay 24,402 general-population serum samples, collected in Vietnam between 2009 to 2015, for antibodies to eleven human influenza A strains. We report that a principal components decomposition of antibody titer data gives the first principal component as an appropriate surrogate for seroprevalence; this results in annual attack rate estimates of 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% – 27.1%) for subtype H3 and 16.0% (95% CI: 14.7% – 17.3%) for subtype H1. The remaining principal components separate the strains by serological similarity and associate birth cohorts with their particular influenza histories. Our work shows that dimensionality reduction can be used on human antibody profiles to construct an age-seroprevalence relationship for antigenically variable pathogens.

There are two basic serological approaches for assessing the relationship between age and seroprevalence. Using long-term field studies, one can measure age-specific annual attack rates of a pathogen and infer what the resulting stable age–seroprevalence relationship should be based on the population’s demographic parameters. Alternatively, using a single population cross-section, an age–seroprevalence curve can be inferred directly from the individuals’ serological status, classified on a binary, discrete, or continuous scale. With both of these approaches, it is necessary to assume that exposure to the pathogen is constant in either time or age1,2.Multi-strain pathogens, however, present a challenge for the inference of age–seroprevalence relationships as infection with one strain typically triggers antibodies that cross-react against other strains. Strain-specific antibodies, like those binding to the host cell receptor binding domain of the influenza A virus particle, wane over time3,4,5, potentially leading to underestimates of exposure when the estimates are based on assays that measure recent strain-specific antibodies. As a result, none of the single-strain age–seroprevalence curves presents an accurate history of pathogen circulation in a given population. For human influenza A virus, the existence of cross-reactions among different influenza strains or variants is well understood, as within-subtype cross-reactions among different strains are carefully characterized whenever a new strain emerges. An individual infected with an influenza strain in the year 2000 will have an antibody response that partially binds to or partially neutralizes (depending on the serological assay) influenza viruses circulating in 1995 or 2005. The strength of the cross-reaction wanes with increasing temporal distance between the strains, and it is known that antibodies to strains isolated closer together in time will cross-react more strongly (with some exceptions during longer periods of lineage co-circulation) than antibodies to strains isolated further apart in time6,7,8,9. A second important feature of influenza epidemiology and evolution that makes it challenging to understand age–seroprevalence relationships is that individuals of different ages will have been exposed to a different set of influenza strains. Older individuals will have been exposed to more strains than younger individuals, and some of these strains will have gone extinct before some of the younger individuals were born. Again, using a single influenza strain to generate an age–seroprevalence curve is not a solution to this problem, as only certain age bands of individuals will have been exposed to any particular strain. Indeed, age–seroprevalence relationships reported for influenza virus typically yield insight into the age-specific and time-specific patterns of infection of different strains and subtypes, but they do not have a monotonically increasing, saturating shape and cannot be used to estimate annual influenza seroincidence10,11,12,13,14.The rationale for constructing a general (i.e., not strain-specific) age–seroprevalence curve for influenza A virus is to infer long-run average attack rates, rather than the season-specific attack rates typically measured in cohort studies13,14,15,16 and placebo arms in vaccine trials17,18,19,20,21,22. Serological studies performing inference on attack rates may also be limited by measurement errors23, an inability to distinguish vaccinees from recently infected individuals, and an inability to distinguish individuals infected within the past year from those infected more than a year ago. Currently, the best methods for computing long-term attack rates of seasonal influenza are from large multi-strain serological analyses with inference on antibody responses, boosting, and waning24,25, or exceptional data sets that present >10 years of surveillance26,27.Finally, in this study, we focus on influenza age–seroprevalence relationship in the tropics, as seasonal influenza attack rates are generally not known for tropical countries. One reason for the lack of measurement is an inability to identify a tropical influenza season28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 if one exists. Our study location is central and southern Vietnam. As annual influenza vaccine coverage in Vietnam is below 0.8% for our study period36, the age–seroprevalence relationships presented here are the naturally accumulated age–antibody profiles in a population continually exposed to influenza virus with nearly no influenza vaccination.ResultsPrincipal component structure of antibody profilesA principal component decomposition was conducted on 11 influenza antibody titers measured in 24,402 general population serum samples collected from 10 provinces in central and southern Vietnam (Fig. 1). This resulted in the first principal component (PC1) explaining 60.4% of the variance in the titer data and the second principal component (PC2) explaining an additional 16.5% of the variance. Figure 2A shows the 11 unit vectors ei corresponding to the 11 antigens in the assay projected onto PC1–PC2 space (all loadings shown in Supplementary Fig. 6). When the unit vectors ei in the original recentered 11-dimensional titer space are mapped to the basis vectors vi of the transformed PC space, the first coordinate (first principal component) of the vi is always positive, with a maximum 1.2-fold difference in magnitude among the 11 antigens, a consequence of a larger variance and range in H3 titers than in H1 titers. This also indicates that the first principal component is a positive-weighted sum of titers to all antigens, suggesting that it can be used as a general measure of exposure and immunogenicity across all strains. We interpret PC1 as an indicator of composite antibody titer or seroprevalence in this analysis and note that as a continuous indicator it is more aptly viewed as a relative probability of exposure (or recent exposure) rather than a binary indicator of having been exposed or not. Although any positive-weighted sum of titer values can be assigned the meaning of “composite titer” or “total titer response” in a multi-strain epidemiological analysis, the derivation of PC1 in a principal component analysis (PCA) accounts for the fact that some antigens generate higher antibody titers than others, either because this is a property of the assay or because the viruses were truly more immunogenic in natural infections. The second coordinates (second principal component) of the basis vectors vi are positive exactly when ei corresponds to an H1N1 subtype and negative otherwise, indicating that the second principal component can be used to distinguish relative exposure to subtypes H1N1 and H3N2.Fig. 1: Serum collection sites at provincial hospitals in southern Vietnam that participated in this study.Number of samples collected in each province is shown.Full size imageFig. 2: Principal component loadings and age/birth year relationships.Principal component (PC) loadings for the first four principal components (A–C) show the PC coefficients of all 11 influenza antigens. Only two consecutive components are shown in each panel. D–F show the relationship between three first components and age (for PC1) or birth year (for PC2 and PC3). Small gray dots represent individuals, each with 11 titer measurements. The larger blue dots show the component mean for each 1-year age band or birth-year band. The red line is a spline regression curve of all 24,402 data points (LOESS curve, spanning factor = 0.5), and 80% prediction intervals (shown in green) were calculated using locally inferred error terms. The vertical lines show the time of introduction of new subtypes into the population. Note that titer scores were recentered around their means for this principal component decomposition and visualization, which is why the principal components (PC1, PC2, etc.) can be both positive and negative.Full size imageA serological age progression of the Vietnamese general population is shown in Fig. 3 on the first two principal component axes. The graphs are broken up into 1-year age bands through age 12 years and broader age categories thereafter, shown as density plots with darker colors indicating a higher density of individuals in a particular region of PC1–PC2 space. The PC1 axis corresponds to general exposure to influenza virus; note that PC1 values can be negative because all titer values are recentered around zero (i.e., they can be negative) during principal component decomposition. The PC2 axis shows relative exposure to H1N1 strains (positive values) or H3N2 strains (negative values). The left-most points in the principal component space correspond to naive individuals (no H3 or H1 infection history) and the right-most points correspond to individuals that have maximum titers for all strains. The most striking feature of Fig. 3 is the consistent change observed in individuals in the early age classes, which shows influenza antibody acquisition in PC1–PC2 space for individuals aged 6 months to 12 years, even though this last age group may have lived through the circulation of three different H1 strains and five different H3 strains. In the early years of infection, individuals with H1 exposure only or H3 exposure only can be identified on the left edges of the diamond shape that makes up PC1–PC2 space (shown as a scatterplot in Supplementary Fig. 11).Fig. 3: Density plots of individuals in principal component space, broken down by age group (shown in upper right of each panel).Density is computed on a 256 × 256 grid spanning the minimum and maximum values of principal components one (PC1) and two (PC2). Color is scaled in each panel from zero (“Min,” white) to the maximum number of individuals that appear in a pixel in that panel (“Max,” black). Individuals move from the far left to the center and right of the PC1–PC2 space during the first 10 years of life, as a result of exposure to subtype H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses. The lower-left and upper-left boundaries of the diamond shape in PC1–PC2 space correspond to individuals who have only been exposed to one H1N1 strain (upper left) or those who have only been exposed to one H3N2 strain (lower left). Number of individuals (across all ages) shown here is n = 24,402.Full size imageThe first principal component allows for a generalized way to describe current average antibody level to influenza A virus, without having to specify a particular strain or subtype (Fig. 2D). The largest change in PC1 can be seen in the first 10 years of life as children acquire their first influenza infection and generate a serological response. The value of PC1 appears to decline after age 10 (possibly an effect of original antigenic sin (OAS)37,38,39,40) and again for older individuals (>50 years), which may be a consequence of weaker immune/antibody responses in older individuals41,42. Differentiation in PC2 reveals some of the history of influenza pandemics in the twentieth century (Fig. 2E). Individuals born before 1957 (n = 4054) have the strongest titer responses to subtype H1 influenza, as do individuals born in 2009 or later (n = 1580), after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus emerged. Individuals born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s generally have antibody titers that are more specific to H3N2 viruses (Fig. 2E), as these individuals were children when H3N2 subtypes were more prevalent. The higher H3N2 responses in this group probably reflect both (i) the generally higher antibody titers associated with H3N2 infections and (ii) OAS resulting from H3N2 infection in early childhood. Individuals born in the 1950s and 1960s are the most interesting with respect to order of subtype exposure as some would have experienced their early influenza exposures during the 1957–1967 gap when only H2N2 subtype viruses were circulating globally. None of the principal components distinguish this birth cohort particularly well; with no expected signal of OAS, these individuals’ serological profiles likely represent a combined history of H1, H2, and H3 influenza infections.The third principal component (PC3) breaks the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes into further subgroups (Fig. 2B, C), which is also reflected in the age-related breakdown showing a strong contribution of H3 in the signal for those born between 1965 and 2009 (Fig. 2F), and the reverse during earlier and later time periods. For H3N2, the main qualitative feature of this structure is that responses to the 1968 H3N2 virus are unique—an expected outcome as these would only be seen strongly in individuals infected from 1968 to the early 1970s and should be independent from the occurrence of infection during the years 2003–2011. Subtype H3N2 viruses from 2007 to 2011 cluster together antigenically, and H3N2 viruses from 2003 and 2005 cluster together in a separate group. The third principal component also divides H1N1 viruses into two groups: one group that is antigenically similar to the 1918 Spanish influenza virus (H1-1918, H1-2009, and H1-1977) and a second group that represents the inter-pandemic circulation of H1N1 viruses in the 1990s and 2000s (Fig. 2B). The H1-1977 virus is the obvious outlier in the first group, and the fourth principal component distinguishes it from the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 strains (Fig. 2C).In general, the principal components neatly sort individuals into birth cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 8), something that is not achieved by looking at antibody titers in isolation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Figure 4 shows histograms of maximum antibody titer by birth year (Fig. 4A), largest magnitude positive principal component by birth year (Fig. 4B), and largest magnitude negative principal component by birth year (Fig. 4C). PC1 is excluded from these analyses as it only corresponds to exposure without discriminating among antigens. If maximum magnitude is in PC2, this shows that an individual’s antibody profile is dominated either by H1N1 exposures (if the component is positive and has largest absolute value, as in Fig. 4B) or H3N2 exposures (if the component is negative and has largest absolute value, as in Fig. 4C). As expected, individuals born after 2009 are likely to have an antibody profile dominated by a large and positive PC2, and individuals born between 1968 and 2009 are likely to have an antibody profile dominated by a large and negative PC2. Antibody profiles of individuals born in the 1980s and 1990s are dominated by a positive PC3, which corresponds to antibody specificity to H1-1999 and H1-2007. Individuals born after 2009 will also have a large and positive PC4 and a large and negative PC5; these correspond to exposure to H1-2009 and to H3-2009/H3-2011, respectively. Dominant antigen groupings are also readily visible in Fig. 4A, but these interpretations are susceptible to (i) the misreading of cross-reactions, e.g., individuals born after 2009 showing reactions to H1-1918, and (ii) confusing high antigen reactivity with infection history (e.g., individuals born in the 1970s and 1980s being dominated by an antibody response to H3-2003).Fig. 4: Histograms showing how individuals are sorted by titer or principal component.Histograms showing how individuals are sorted by their A maximum antibody titer, B maximum positive principal component (excluding PC1), and C maximum negative principal component (excluding PC1). In each panel, each of the n = 24,402 individuals appears exactly once depending on their highest titer (A) or the maximum magnitude of their principal components (B, C). For example, most individuals born after 2009 have their maximum antibody titer to the 2011 H3N2 strain, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, or the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus. These same individuals have either principal component 2 or 4 as their largest magnitude component (among positive components). The vertical lines show the time of introduction of new subtypes into the population: H1N1 (orange), H3N2 (red), and H2N2 (green).Full size imageAnnual attack ratesThe clearest signal of infection history in our data comes in the form of PC1 correlating to the presence or absence of past influenza infection, allowing us to treat PC1 (a positive-weighted sum of antibody titers) as a proxy for seroprevalence. In general, for a titer vector (τ1, τ2, …, τn) of n co-circulating and non-cross-reacting pathogens, the first principal component will be proportional to the total number of pathogen exposures by age a in a graph of PC1 against age. For a titer vector (τ1, τ2, …, τn) of n pathogens with high cross-reactivity, PC1 will be proportional to the probability of having been exposed to at least one of the n pathogens. These are the two boundary situations, but for intermediate cross-reactivity there is no easily analogous interpretation, suggesting that the cross-reactivity parameter sigma σ may play an outsized role in our ability to use multi-strain serological approaches for population-level inference of past pathogen exposure. In our data, the average cross-reactivity among neighboring H3 strains (strains that are 2 years apart) can be described by a standard Pearson correlation of σ = 0.88, which shows that within a subtype neighboring strains can be viewed as highly cross-reacting.To assess the accuracy of using PC1 as a proxy for seroprevalence, we built an individual-based simulation of influenza infection, antibody acquisition, antibody waning, and back boosting43 (Supplementary Methods). Comparing simulated attack rates to median PCA-inferred attack rates shows that the median inferred attack rates are within 5% of their simulated values (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3); however, the stochastic nature of the simulation and the large variance in simulation outcomes does not allow us to conclude that our PCA-based estimator is unbiased. Crucially, there is no serologically measured long-term attack rate for influenza in Vietnam against which to validate our approach.Separating the titer data by subtype to avoid having to account for low or intermediate cross-reactions between subtypes, we carry out two separate PCAs for H1 and H3 and infer the attack rates for each subtype separately (Supplementary Fig. 9). Optimizing the likelihood in Eq. (1), maximum-likelihood estimates for the annual attack rates in Vietnam are ARH1 = 16.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.7–17.3%) and ARH3 = 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1–27.1%). The location-specific annual attack rates (Fig. 5) did not vary much from these estimates except for the attack rate of H1N1 in Hue, which was estimated at 21.6% (95% CI: 18.4–26.1%). There were no reports of Hue experiencing a larger pandemic wave30 (or subsequent H1N1 epidemics) than other locations in Vietnam. However, variation in reporting patterns and asymptomatic/sub-clinical infection may occur44, thus we cannot exclude the possibility that Hue experienced a higher rate of H1N1 infections than Khanh Hoa or Ho Chi Minh City.Fig. 5: Age–seroprevalence curves shown by location and by subtype.The four rows correspond to location, with the top row showing the age–seroprevalence relationship across Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, and Khanh Hoa combined (n = 16,220). The two columns show age–seroprevalence separately for subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 performed with separate PCAs. One gray dot is an individual. Red line shows the maximum-likelihood estimate of a saturating curve (Eq. 1) of the first principal component (PC1) as a function of age; gray bands show 95% confidence intervals. AR attack rate, CI confidence interval.Full size imageDiscussionAn important challenge in serological analyses of antigenically variable pathogen families is the construction of a surrogate measure for seroprevalence that takes antibody cross-reactions and differential immunogenicity into account. The approach we propose here is dimensionality reduction across strains. By taking the first principal component of a data set of n individuals whose antibodies have been measured to m different antigens, we reduce an m-dimensional data set to a single dimension (PC1), which we use as a proxy for seroprevalence. With sufficient and representative age sampling in the younger age classes, the first principal component of such a data set should be a positive-weighted sum of an individual’s antibody titers, with the weights adjusting for the higher titers or immunogenicities of some antigens when compared to others. The main challenge with this approach is validation of PC1 as a quantity that is in fact proportional to cumulative probability of exposure. In principle, this could be done with a cohort study run across enough influenza seasons to allow a long-term average attack rates to be measured. In practice, cohort studies like this are not common, and the task would be impossible for a data set of the size we present here. Despite this lack of direct validation with a known attack rate in the same locations and age groups, we can show that the long-term exposure patterns inferred using a PCA approach are (i) consistent with known descriptions of influenza epidemiology and influenza attack rates15,24,25,26,45,46,47 and (ii) able to be validated with a simulation approach.The estimates presented in this paper show that the average annual attack rate of influenza in Vietnam ranges from 13.4 to 21.6% for H1N1 and from 25.0 to 27.5% for H3N2. These ranges are consistent in their relative magnitudes, with H3N2 having a higher annual attack rate than H1N113, and in the implied age of first infection (ages 3–6 years) observed in cross-sectional data analyzed with traditional serology48. A second point of consistency is that peak PC1 value (i.e., peak weighted antibody titer) in the Vietnamese data occurs for individuals around age 10 years, approximately the age group predicted to have highest antibody titers resulting from OAS40. Our analysis was not designed to detect the effects of OAS, and the appearance of OAS in the PCA lends further credence to PC1 as an appropriate measure of composite titer or seroprevalence for influenza A virus.Despite the concordance with field data, further progress is needed on the theoretical justification and in silico validation of using PC1 as a marker of seroprevalence. The key theoretical question revolves around the interpretation of PC1 as it relates to the immune profile of an individual. Certainly, the neighbor-to-neighbor inter-strain cross-reactivity parameter σ is influential in this interpretation as it affects whether an antibody profile represents a small number of past infections (high σ) or a large number of past infections (low σ). The next analytical step in this principal component approach will likely require creating a σ-adjusted PC1 so that it more accurately differentiates between the presence and the number of past infections. An in silico validation approach could be used to test whether PC1 or a related construct is unbiased as an estimator of seroprevalence, but this simulation approach would itself need to be validated against field data. Specifically, the age distribution of influenza cases (symptomatic) is well known but the age distribution of infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic combined) is reported much less frequently. In addition, in a simulation, one needs to know how an antibody profile affects a person’s likelihood of becoming an influenza infection, but clinical studies most commonly measure the effect of an antibody titer on becoming an influenza case. This measure may have to be estimated independently for children and adults, as it is serological measurements in children that directly inform attack rate estimates. Individual-based simulation development would need to focus on accurate representations of titer profiles, protection from infection, and an accounting of all influenza infections across age groups.As with any surrogate for seroprevalence, PC1 is limited in that it only provides distinguishing information for the younger age groups (here <10 years). Within these younger age groups, it is known that infection history and exposure do vary by age49,50,51,52,53, but differences in single-year age bands are not always easy to estimate with a cross-sectional design (Fig. S12) unless large sample sizes are available. In our analysis, the teenage and adult age groups have similar values of PC1, indicating that most individuals aged >10 years are likely to have been exposed to influenza virus. In fact, the bottom six panels of Fig. 3 show that individuals’ antibody profiles do not change much after an individual is likely to have been exposed to both H3N2 and H1N1 viruses; certain age groups will have high titers to viruses they were exposed to in childhood, but these exposure profiles are not qualitatively distinguishable from each other using PC1 alone. The utility of performing a PCA analysis on this general population serological data set from central and southern Vietnam lies in its location (tropical) and vaccination history (nearly none); reconstructing the natural age–seroprevalence relationship allows us to measure influenza A attack rates in a part of the world where influenza persists year-round and does not cause regular or predictable epidemics28,29,30,54.Moving beyond the first principal component, the remaining components give us an indication of serological/antigenic relatedness among strains (Fig. 2A–C). Although this relatedness is straightforward to characterize with sequencing and phylogenetic methods, a serological relatedness signal (more labor-intensive in its construction6,8) is more appropriately founded on the virus’s phenotype rather than its genotype. As expected, these serological relatedness signals show that the 2003 and 2005 H3N2 strains cluster together; that the 2007, 2009, and 2011 H3N2 variants are related; and that the 1968 H3N2 is serologically distinct from H3N2 strains circulating after 2003. For the H1N1 subtypes, the 1999 H1N1 and 2007 H1N1 (both 1977 lineage) cluster with each other, while there are no obvious serological relationships among the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, the 1977 Russian flu, and the 1918 Spanish flu (these viruses cluster with each other in the first three principal components and are separated by the fourth). For the population, the primary utility of the higher principal components is the sorting of serological responses by birth cohort, which has already been found to influence vaccine efficacy55,56,57, subsequent symptomatic infection57,58,59, back boosting60, and hospitalization and mortality58. An additional application of higher principal components may be in the construction of individual-level antibody profiles that could be used to assess susceptibility to influenza virus infection, as in Yang et al.61.The promise of large-scale serology is that certain traditional epidemiological variables—attack rate, age-specific susceptibility, cross-reactivity—will be able to be measured with higher precision. As large-scale multi-antigen serological approaches like this one become more common, it will become important to include field study components that allow for validation of results obtained from cross-sectional data alone. The present approach taken for influenza virus should be expanded to other well-characterized multi-strain pathogens such as dengue62,63, norovirus64,65,66, and pneumococcus67,68 to share lessons on which inferential methods and study designs are most appropriate for the precise and robust estimation of a broad range of epidemiological quantities.MethodsDataSerum samples used for this analysis come from a serum bank established in 2009 in southern Vietnam and maintained for the purposes of measuring exposure and seroincidence to a range of pathogens36,69,70,71,72,73,74. Every 2 months or every 4 months (depending on the site), 200 residual serum samples are collected from the hematology or biochemistry departments of ten major public hospitals: the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Hue Central Hospital in the city of Hue, Khanh Hoa General Hospital in Nha Trang, Dak Lak Provincial Hospital in Buon Ma Thuot city, Soc Trang General Hospital, Dong Thap General Hospital, Kien Giang General Hospital, Binh Dinh General Hospital, Quang Ngai General Hospital, An Giang General Hospital (Fig. 1). Approximately 7800 samples are collected each year and the samples are believed to represent the hospital-going population or general population in their respective provinces. For further details on sample collection, see Nhat et al.36. A total of 35,688 serum samples collected between 2009 and 2015 were selected for this analysis. The sample collection was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford. All residual serum samples were collected anonymously from hospital laboratories with no identifiers included that could link the sample back to the original patient; there was no patient enrollment or consent procedure.Samples were tested for IgG antibodies to the HA1 region of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein for 11 different human influenza A viruses by a protein microarray72,75,76, 5 strains of the H1 subtype and 6 strains of the H3 subtype (Table 1). Subtype H1 viruses included were the 1918 pandemic “Spanish Flu” virus (A/South Carolina/1/1918), the 1977 “Russian Flu” virus that was re-introduced into the population after a 20-year absence (A/USSR/92/1977), two antigenic variants of the 1977 lineage both of which were vaccine strains (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 and A/Brisbane/59/2007), and the 2009 “swine flu” pandemic virus (A/California/6/2009). Subtype H3 viruses included were the 1968 pandemic “Hong Kong” flu variant that re-introduced H3 circulation into human populations (A/Aichi/2/1968) and the five most recent H3N2 variants available at the time the study was designed: A/Wyoming/3/2003, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, A/Brisbane/10/2007, A/Victoria/210/2009, and A/Victoria/361/2011 (non-egg-adapted), three of which were vaccine strains.Table 1 HA1 antigens of 11 different human influenza strains used for the study.Full size tableSamples from individuals <6 months of age were excluded from the analysis to avoid assigning maternal antibody profiles to infants. The data set uses decimal ages based on information reported at the hospital; e.g., a 12-year-old is coded as 12.5 and a 6-week-old is coded as 0.12. After excluding individuals <6 months and samples that did not have computable titers for all 11 antigens (Nhat et al.36, supplement, section 1.1), 11,286 samples were excluded for a total of 24,402 samples to be used in this analysis. Sample collection times are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.ClusteringClustering of serological profiles was performed with a PCA (Matlab, R2019b, Mathworks, USA). PCA was performed on a 24,402 × 11 log-titer matrix with the Matlab function pca, which derives the principal component basis vectors through singular value decomposition. Titer values are all measured on the same scale, thus rescaling titer values was unnecessary. The first principal component was interpreted as a surrogate of seroprevalence (see “Results” section). To determine whether the magnitudes of the principal components corresponded to infection history, we sorted individuals by their largest magnitude (i.e., absolute value) principal component, looking at positive and negative components separately.Likelihood inferenceTo estimate attack rates, we performed separate PCAs for three different locations (Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, Khanh Hoa) and the two influenza subtypes H3N2 and H1N1. Taking the first principal component (PC1) as a surrogate for weighted exposure to H3N2 or H1N1, we fit the PC1 value as a function of age to estimate the annual location-specific attack rates of subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 using the relationship$${{{{{{\rm{PC}}}}}}}1\left(a\right)=H-K{e}^{-\lambda a}$$ (1) where H, K, and λ are fitted parameters, with an individual’s PC1 value counting as one data point. The H and K parameters are necessary to infer the minimum and saturating maximum of the PC1 curve as PC1 does not span the range zero to one as seroprevalence does. Optimization was done with a Nelder–Mead routine. The annual attack rate can be computed as follows$${{{{{\rm{AR}}}}}}=1-{e}^{-\lambda }$$ (2) and 95% CIs were obtained through likelihood profiling. All analyses were conducted in Matlab. Attack rate analysis focused on three sites that had a sufficient number of samples from children aged <5 years: Ho Chi Minh City (n = 1301 samples from children <5 years), Khanh Hoa (n = 358), and Hue (n = 383).ValidationTo validate that PC1 is an appropriate surrogate for seroprevalence, an individual-based epidemic simulation was developed in C++ (Supplementary Methods). The simulation mimics the non-seasonal patterns of influenza A/H3N2 cases in Vietnam over a 10-year period30,77 and uses influenza susceptibility data, antibody response data, and antibody waning data (measured with the same protein microarray) from a concurrently run clinical study run in Ho Chi Minh City from 2013 to 201578,79. Simulations of 500,000 individuals are run with fixed attack rates ranging from 5 to 30%, and 6700 samples are taken at the exact sampling times (from 2010 to 2015) as in the serum collections for Ho Chi Minh City. A PCA is done on each simulated data set, and attack rate inference using Eq. (1) is done on the age and PC1 vectors.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

But with schools and businesses reopened, travel resuming and far less masking, flu could make a comeback. (Sept. 30)APInfluenza is sweeping the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus, with 528 cases diagnosed at the University Health Service since Oct. 6. The outbreak is so sudden and large — 313 cases were identified the week of Nov. 8 alone and 37% of flu tests that week were positive — that it has drawn the attention of federal health leaders.A team of investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be on campus this week, trying to learn more about the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of this year's flu vaccine. More: Beaumont doctor: 'Metro Detroit is again becoming a hotspot' for COVID-19More: Get a COVID vaccine booster, doctors say, as delta spread ratchets up in MichiganAmong those who've contracted flu at U-M this fall, 77% didn't get a flu vaccine. The cases were identified as influenza A (H3N2), said Lindsey Mortenson, UHS medical director and acting executive director."While we often start to see some flu activity now, the size of this outbreak is unusual," said Juan Luis Marquez, medical director at the Washtenaw County Health Department. "We're grateful for the additional support of the CDC and our ongoing partnership with the university as we look more closely at the situation."More: Michigan's new top doc on pandemic response: 'None of this should be political'More: Michigan COVID-19 survivor says vision of the Blessed Solanus Casey saved his lifeThe work will be led by the local health department, and will include the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the university and a team from the CDC. When a public health authority requests assistance from the CDC for an urgent public health problem, such as disease outbreaks, unexplained illnesses and natural or human-caused disasters, an Epi-Aid team is tapped to provide short-term assistance.In Ann Arbor, the team will evaluate flu vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness and risk factors for spread by collecting samples from patients at University Health Service, providing data analysis, and conducting questionnaires.Health leaders are concerned about the timing of the increase in cases in Ann Arbor, as many students plan to travel soon for Thanksgiving break. They are calling on as many people as possible to get flu vaccines."We strongly recommend anyone not yet vaccinated against seasonal flu to do so," Marquez said. "And anyone at higher risk of severe flu complications should talk to their doctor about prescription antiviral medications at the first sign of flu symptoms." Fewer Michiganders have taken flu vaccines this year compared with the same time in 2020. As of Nov. 6, the state health department reported 2.01 million flu shots have been administered so far statewide, covering about 20% of the population. Comparatively, 3.14 million doses had been given as of Nov. 6, 2020, covering about 31% of the population.Washtenaw County has a higher flu vaccination rate this year than the state overall. There, about 31% of residents have gotten flu vaccines this season, according to state data.People who get flu vaccines help to protect those around them, including people who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like infants and young children, older people and those with certain chronic health conditions.Last year, there was little to no flu activity. This year, health officials are concerned about the possibility of a twin-demic as both coronavirus and flu could surge, driving a massive wave of sickness. The same tools that work to slow the spread of COVID-19 also work against flu:Wear a mask in indoor public spaces and in outdoor crowded placesGet vaccinatedStay home when sickWash your hands oftenCover cough and sneezesFlu vaccines are widely available at doctor's offices and drugstores. In addition, the Washtenaw County Health Department offers flu vaccination at the same time as COVID-19 vaccination.A Kroger Health Vaccine Clinic also will offer 600 shots 9 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Tuesday at 1310 North University Court Building.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Jermaine Ayers) VIEW ORIGINAL WHEELER ARMY AIRFIELD, Hawaii — It's time to get your influenza shot. Flu season runs from October through May, typically peaking from December-February. Similar to last year, this year’s flu season poses a unique risk as COVID-19 outbreaks continue around the world. It is possible to catch the flu and COVID-19 simultaneously. The CDC recommended everyone get a flu shot by the end of October, but getting the vaccine can still offer protection even if you get it later in the fall or early winter. All Soldiers are required to get an annual flu shot. For all dependents, shots are available at military medical treatment facilities and at military installations. Flu Shot Availability Flu shots are currently available nationwide commercially and at military treatment facilities without shortages. The 25th Infantry Division is scheduling mass vaccination events for its Soldiers. All other Soldiers can get their flu vaccine as a walk-in at Conroy Bowl (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-10 a.m.), the Troop Immunization Clinic at Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-3:30 p.m.), or with an appointment at Tripler Army Medical Center’s Family Medicine and Internal Medicine clinics. All other Tricare beneficiaries can get a flu vaccine from the clinic they’re enrolled at or from a retail network pharmacy. Tricare beneficiaries can call 1-888-683-2778 to schedule an appointment at their medical treatment facility. There are additional walk-in opportunities available Wednesdays, 8 a.m.-5 p.m., at the Schofield Barracks Main Exchange, and Fridays from 8 a.m.-4 p.m. at Family Immunizations at Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic. Both are for non-active duty beneficiaries six months or older. COVID-19 Makes Getting Flu Shots Doubly Important This year, getting vaccinated against the flu is doubly important because of COVID-19 and the dominance of the highly contagious Delta variant. Flu vaccines do not prevent COVID-19, but they will reduce the burden of flu illnesses and hospitalizations on the health care system and conserve scarce medical resources for the care of people with COVID-19. Getting the flu vaccine not only lowers your risk of getting sick, but also lessens the chance of having a severe case. Additionally, the flu vaccine lowers the chance of spreading the virus to other people, especially those who may not be able to get the vaccine due to age or compromised immune systems or allergies to the vaccine. Vaccinate Children and At-Risk Populations as Soon as Possible "One major item to consider is that on the spectrum of common childhood illness, flu is more dangerous than the cold," said Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Christopher Ellison, deputy director of operations, Defense Health Agency Immunization Healthcare Division. "Kids under five and particularly those less than two years old are at a higher risk of having flu-related complications like pneumonia or dehydration that could require hospitalization or worse. Flu vaccine is the best way to prevent this," Ellison said. According to the CDC, children can get vaccinated as soon as vaccine becomes available. Some children need two doses. For those children, the CDC recommends to get the first dose as soon as a vaccine is available because the second needs to be given at least 4 weeks after the first. Some other people who are at higher risk of infection include those who are 65 and older, those with asthma, heart disease, diabetes, suppressed immune systems, as well as other medical conditions. According to the CDC, those people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, whether or not they have symptoms, should wait until they have met the criteria to discontinue isolation before getting a flu shot.

Investigators tested six different combinations of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in more than 600 adults between April and June 2021. Participants were given the second dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech’s or AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shots or a placebo, together with an age-appropriate flu vaccine. Older adults received adjuvanted, trivalent FluAd. (In the United States, adjuvanted FluAd is now recommended in its quadrivalent form for seniors.) There were no safety concerns raised and side effects were typical of vaccination, Rajeka Lazarus, Ph.D., of University Hospitals Bristol, and colleagues reported. What’s more, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine plus adjuvanted, trivalent FluAd was one of four combinations that spurred robust antibody responses, they added. This combination is similar to one likely to be given to seniors in the United States. The trial results should be applicable in many settings, Lazarus and colleagues said. Participants reflected the population most likely to receive both influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. The trial is the first to test simultaneous administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer’s) with any other type of vaccine, according to the researchers. One of the trial’s limitations was that flu shots were paired with the second dose in the series of COVID-19 vaccinations, and not a third, booster dose, the researchers noted. Many older people across Britain and the United States — including most U.S. nursing home residents — received their two COVID-19 vaccine doses early in the vaccine rollout and are most likely to get their influenza vaccine together with a booster shot. The trial also did not test live, attenuated or high-dose influenza vaccines. In the United States, the Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent shot is the only other influenza vaccine along with adjuvanted quadrivalent FluAd recommended for seniors by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Full findings were published in the Lancet.

In addition, private laboratories have reported an increase in influenza case detections and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, has received reports of clusters of influenza cases in schools and workplaces. Influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B are seasonal influenza virus strains that are common in human populations. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as “swine flu”, has been one of the circulating seasonal influenza strains following its emergence in 2009. The term “swine flu” should not be used as it causes unnecessary panic. The clinical course of infection with this influenza strain and clinical management is similar to that of other influenza strains. As of week 44 of 2021 (week ending 7 November 2021), the total number of influenza cases detected by the syndromic sentinel surveillance programmes conducted by the NICD has increased from 68 in week 34 to 226. The increase in case numbers has been identified in all five (5) provinces where surveillance is conducted. To date, the most commonly detected subtype and lineage is influenza B Victoria (87/226, 38.5%) followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (53/226, 23.5%) and influenza A (H3N2) (24/226, 10.6%) (Figure 1). Even though the detection rates for influenza in our surveillance programme exceed previous seasonal thresholds, absolute numbers remain relatively low compared to previous years, possibly as a result of reduced health-seeking behaviour following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. “Although the majority of people with influenza will present with mild illness, influenza may cause severe illness, which may require hospitalisation or cause death, especially in individuals who are at risk of getting severe influenza complications,” comments Dr Sibongile Walaza, Medical Epidemiologist at the Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM) at the NICD. Groups at an increased risk of severe complications of influenza include, pregnant women; HIV-infected individuals; those with chronic illnesses or conditions like diabetes, lung disease, tuberculosis, heart disease, renal disease and obesity; the elderly (65 years and older) and children under the age of two years. These groups should be encouraged to seek medical help early. “The increase in influenza in the summer, which is not the typical time for the influenza season, is likely the result of relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19, combined with an immunity gap due to influenza not circulating for two years (2020 and 2021) in South Africa (as a result of these interventions),” adds Prof Cheryl Cohen, Head of the CRDM. She stresses that the influenza vaccine remains the primary means for preventing seasonal influenza infection and should ideally be administered before the influenza season from March to April. Currently, because of recent reductions in transmission, influenza may not circulate in the traditional seasonal period. It is never too late to vaccinate during periods when influenza is circulating, especially for individuals with underlying conditions which put them at increased risk of severe influenza illness or complications. To prevent contracting or spreading flu avoid close contact with sick people, stay home when you are sick, cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, wear your mask, clean your hands regularly, avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose and clean and disinfect common places. Clinicians are encouraged to consider influenza as part of a differential diagnosis when managing patients presenting with respiratory illness.

SAVE & ACCEPTFlu returns while COVID-19 persists; DHS urges vaccines for both • Wisconsin Examiner HOME NEWS Politics & Government Work & the Economy Education Environment Civil Rights & Immigration Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Politics & Government Work & the Economy Education Environment Civil Rights & Immigration Decision 2024 5:23 Brief COVID-19Health Care Briefs Flu returns while COVID-19 persists; DHS urges vaccines for both By: Erik Gunn - November 15, 2021 5:23 am Photo by Thirdman | Pexels After a one-year break thanks largely to public health measures, the flu is making a comeback in Wisconsin even as COVID-19 remains at large. The best defense against both remains vaccination, said Tom Haupt, influenza surveillance coordinator and respiratory disease epidemiologist for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) at a media briefing on Friday. Through the second week of November, Wisconsin has recorded 29 confirmed cases of influenza, Haupt said. That is still well below the 109 cases recorded in the state for the same period in 2019, but it is a bump up from this time in 2020, when there were seven cases. “And it is on the rise,” Haupt said. For the 2020-21 flu season, DHS recorded 100 cases statewide and 21 people hospitalized. The flu season normally peaks in late January to early February. “Last year there was really no flu season at all,” Haupt said. In the pre-pandemic 2019-2020 flu season, the state recorded 36,000 cases, with 4,500 people hospitalized, “which was a normal year.” Nationally health officials have seen a flu spike especially on college and university campuses. Haupt said that hasn’t shown up in Wisconsin yet, and to avoid that, he urged college students in the state to get a flu shot. Even as flu is increasing this year, COVID-19 infections remain high, according to DHS data, and what looked recently like a downward trend in the novel coronavirus has reversed. The weekly regional data report from DHS once again shows eight counties where the spread of disease is “critically high” as of Nov. 10 after having fallen to half that number in late October. The average number of new daily cases over a seven-day period has risen to 2,649 as of Nov. 11, according to DHS. The seven-day average for deaths stands at 14 per day. Just over 55% of Wisconsin residents are fully vaccinated, meaning that they have had either two Pfizer or Moderna shots or one Johnson & Johnson shot, and just over 58% have begun the vaccination process, the most recent numbers posted by DHS show. With the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continuing to circulate widely along with the flu and other respiratory viruses, Haupt emphasized the importance of staying home from work or school when one is sick regardless of the illness to avoid spreading it. Symptoms for COVID-19, the flu and other respiratory viruses “are very, very similar,” he said, and can’t be used to make a specific diagnosis. “That’s why … if people are getting sick and they have to seek medical care, we’re really encouraging people to get tested not only for COVID but for the other viruses, especially influenza.” Distinguishing which virus is responsible is also important because, unlike COVID-19, doctors can prescribe an anti-viral medication for the flu, he said. That can tamp down the infection and keep symptoms milder and shorter-lasting. “But the key is vaccination for both,” Haupt said. About 26% of Wisconsin residents have gotten a flu vaccine so far this year, roughly 1.5 million people. That’s behind last year, when 34% had gotten a flu shot by mid-November, Haupt said, and also slightly behind 2019-2020, when 28% were vaccinated by this time. Public health officials aren’t sure why this year’s flu vaccines are lagging. Asked if the ongoing politicized controversy over COVID-19 shots could be tainting the public image of other vaccines, Haupt said that was “one possible theory.” Another is that people are assuming because of such low flu rates last year that the vaccine isn’t necessary this year, either, he said. For that reason, public health agencies are working to emphasize the importance of both vaccines. “Hospitals are still at very high capacity” due to COVID-19, Haupt said. “Some are full.” Children are now among the most commonly hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and vaccinations for children ages 5 to 11 have only recently become available. If influenza spikes among people who are not vaccinated for the flu, “it would be a devastating year,” he said. “That’s why it’s so important that you get vaccinated for yourself and to protect those people around you.” Along with vaccination, the same measures to prevent COVID-19 — masking and physical distancing — also can help prevent a flu outbreak, Haupt said. “We really are very concerned about the situation with the pediatric population,” Haupt said. “Anybody who has a child under 5 years old … the people around them have to take a breath, take a little bit of responsibility for themselves, to get vaccinated, and make sure that the people around those unvaccinated children actually get the vaccine both for COVID and for influenza.” Haupt said that people who need a COVID-19 vaccine — whether a first, second or booster shot — and a flu vaccine along with their health care providers can decide whether they want to get both at the same time, but that DHS does not expect the two vaccines to interact badly with each other. Regardless, “we are really encouraging that [unvaccinated people] get involved as soon as they possibly can.” As the holidays bring people together through the end of the year, Haupt warned against complacency. Vaccines for COVID-19 and for the flu will protect many people from infection, and in the event someone does catch the illness, will keep symptoms mild for most, he said. But the risk remains, especially for medically vulnerable people, whether they are younger, older or have weaker immune systems.

SUBSCRIBE XFlu returns while COVID-19 persists; DHS urges vaccines for both by Erik Gunn, Wisconsin Examiner November 15, 2021 Flu returns while COVID-19 persists; DHS urges vaccines for both by Erik Gunn, Wisconsin Examiner November 15, 2021 After a one-year break thanks largely to public health measures, the flu is making a comeback in Wisconsin even as COVID-19 remains at large. The best defense against both remains vaccination, said Tom Haupt, influenza surveillance coordinator and respiratory disease epidemiologist for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) at a media briefing on Friday. Through the second week of November, Wisconsin has recorded 29 confirmed cases of influenza, Haupt said. That is still well below the 109 cases recorded in the state for the same period in 2019, but it is a bump up from this time in 2020, when there were seven cases. “And it is on the rise,” Haupt said. For the 2020-21 flu season, DHS recorded 100 cases statewide and 21 people hospitalized. The flu season normally peaks in late January to early February. “Last year there was really no flu season at all,” Haupt said. In the pre-pandemic 2019-2020 flu season, the state recorded 36,000 cases, with 4,500 people hospitalized, “which was a normal year.” Nationally health officials have seen a flu spike especially on college and university campuses. Haupt said that hasn’t shown up in Wisconsin yet, and to avoid that, he urged college students in the state to get a flu shot. Even as flu is increasing this year, COVID-19 infections remain high, according to DHS data, and what looked recently like a downward trend in the novel coronavirus has reversed. The weekly regional data report from DHS once again shows eight counties where the spread of disease is “critically high” as of Nov. 10 after having fallen to half that number in late October. The average number of new daily cases over a seven-day period has risen to 2,649 as of Nov. 11, according to DHS. The seven-day average for deaths stands at 14 per day. Just over 55% of Wisconsin residents are fully vaccinated, meaning that they have had either two Pfizer or Moderna shots or one Johnson & Johnson shot, and just over 58% have begun the vaccination process, the most recent numbers posted by DHS show. With the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 continuing to circulate widely along with the flu and other respiratory viruses, Haupt emphasized the importance of staying home from work or school when one is sick regardless of the illness to avoid spreading it. Symptoms for COVID-19, the flu and other respiratory viruses “are very, very similar,” he said, and can’t be used to make a specific diagnosis. “That’s why … if people are getting sick and they have to seek medical care, we’re really encouraging people to get tested not only for COVID but for the other viruses, especially influenza.” Distinguishing which virus is responsible is also important because, unlike COVID-19, doctors can prescribe an anti-viral medication for the flu, he said. That can tamp down the infection and keep symptoms milder and shorter-lasting. “But the key is vaccination for both,” Haupt said. About 26% of Wisconsin residents have gotten a flu vaccine so far this year, roughly 1.5 million people. That’s behind last year, when 34% had gotten a flu shot by mid-November, Haupt said, and also slightly behind 2019-2020, when 28% were vaccinated by this time. Public health officials aren’t sure why this year’s flu vaccines are lagging. Asked if the ongoing politicized controversy over COVID-19 shots could be tainting the public image of other vaccines, Haupt said that was “one possible theory.” Another is that people are assuming because of such low flu rates last year that the vaccine isn’t necessary this year, either, he said. For that reason, public health agencies are working to emphasize the importance of both vaccines. “Hospitals are still at very high capacity” due to COVID-19, Haupt said. “Some are full.” Children are now among the most commonly hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and vaccinations for children ages 5 to 11 have only recently become available. If influenza spikes among people who are not vaccinated for the flu, “it would be a devastating year,” he said. “That’s why it’s so important that you get vaccinated for yourself and to protect those people around you.” Along with vaccination, the same measures to prevent COVID-19 — masking and physical distancing — also can help prevent a flu outbreak, Haupt said. “We really are very concerned about the situation with the pediatric population,” Haupt said. “Anybody who has a child under 5 years old … the people around them have to take a breath, take a little bit of responsibility for themselves, to get vaccinated, and make sure that the people around those unvaccinated children actually get the vaccine both for COVID and for influenza.” Haupt said that people who need a COVID-19 vaccine — whether a first, second or booster shot — and a flu vaccine along with their health care providers can decide whether they want to get both at the same time, but that DHS does not expect the two vaccines to interact badly with each other. Regardless, “we are really encouraging that [unvaccinated people] get involved as soon as they possibly can.” As the holidays bring people together through the end of the year, Haupt warned against complacency. Vaccines for COVID-19 and for the flu will protect many people from infection, and in the event someone does catch the illness, will keep symptoms mild for most, he said. But the risk remains, especially for medically vulnerable people, whether they are younger, older or have weaker immune systems. As people plan travel and gatherings, he urged people to keep in mind “that there’s more than one virus going around — and we are dealing with two very severe ones at this particular point: COVID-19 and the influenza virus.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Specifically, uncovering the relationship between epidemic onset and various risk indicators such as socioeconomic, mobility and climate factors can reveal locations and travel patterns that play critical roles in furthering an outbreak. We study the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza outbreaks in Sweden’s municipalities between 2009 and 2015 and use the Generalized Inverse Infection Method (GIIM) to assess the most significant contributing risk factors. GIIM represents an epidemic spreading process on a network: nodes correspond to geographical objects, links indicate travel routes, and transmission probabilities assigned to the links guide the infection process. Our results reinforce existing observations that the influenza outbreaks considered in this study were driven by the country’s largest population centers, while meteorological factors also contributed significantly. Travel and other socioeconomic indicators have a negligible effect. We also demonstrate that by training our model on the 2009 outbreak, we can predict the epidemic onsets in the following five seasons with high accuracy.

It spread quickly to other continents and struck Europe with a spring and summer wave, affecting several countries. The rate of transmission subsided as the summer progressed but accelerated again during the autumn season, this time in all European countries. The spread followed a west to east progression, a typical pattern for seasonal influenza1.The first cases in Sweden appeared late in April, and local transmission followed mainly in the major cities. In late September and early October, a nationwide outbreak started, peaking in November. From mid-May, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control required mandatory reporting of individual cases, which later changed to hospitalized patients supplemented by laboratory notification of positive samples2. WHO declared the end of the pandemic on 10 August 2010. However, the mandatory reporting of the H1N1 pandemic strain continued in Sweden during the following five seasons, providing a detailed and thorough collection of epidemic data on a fine spatial resolution.The spatial component of many infectious diseases is crucial for the understanding of epidemic transmission. Recent years have seen a surge in mathematical modeling to describe the geographic transmission of infectious diseases3,4,5,6,7. Specifically, with the increasing availability of geo-tagged epidemiological data, the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic influenza has been studied using spatially explicit models. For example, studies in the US have revealed how important human mobility patterns are for explaining influenza epidemic transmission8,9,10,11. A previous geographic study of the pandemic spread over Sweden indicated a progression from the north to the south during 200912. Morris et al.13 investigated the relationship between the spatio-temporal spreading of seasonal influenza and demographic, geographic and climatic factors. However, their study focused on Norway and only conducted a joint analysis of the other Nordic countries on the county level.Meteorological factors associated with the rate of influenza transmission among individuals include precipitation, humidity, temperature, and sun radiation12,14,15,16. However, uncertainties in the data remain, and meteorological drivers may play more significant roles in some geographic regions than others. The role of population size and density in cities is also known to affect the dynamics of influenza transmission and the weight of environmental factors8,16. Apart from the importance of schoolchildren for influenza transmission17, socioeconomic factors important for influenza spread remain sparsely studied18.In this paper, we seek to uncover the critical socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors behind H1N1 outbreaks in Sweden, covering six years between 2009 and 2015, focusing on the start of the epidemic phase. We aim to identify the relationship between the timing of this event and the above factors available for each of the 290 municipalities of Sweden. We also explore the predictive capabilities of our approach by using the 2009 pandemic to train our model and measuring its performance on data from the following years. We analyze Sweden at a much higher resolution compared with previous studies13 and extend the potential list of risk factors.We analyze disease spreading dynamics with the Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM)19,20,23, a network-based optimization method. In this model, each municipality is a node, and the edges between nodes represent possible disease spreading paths. The primary output of this model is the set of estimated transmission probabilities between the nodes (geographical areas) of the model. These probabilities can be formalized as a function of known attributes: properties of the nodes (municipalities) and edges (pairs of municipalities) of the network. We estimate the parameters of this function with the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization Method21. GIIM can be used with any monotonic infection model, including members of the SEIR family20,22. Since our goal is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, we select the SI infection model22 to represent spreading dynamics. The SI model has been used in literature when modeling the first occurrence of a disease and spreading dynamics during the early phase of an outbreak23,24. The epidemic onset falls into the latter category.We use GIIM to estimate the transmission risk between geographical areas, the importation and exportation risks for all municipalities, and to establish the relationship between the properties of the outbreak and several socioeconomic, travel and meteorological indicators. In addition, we can use the risk factors, their assigned weights, and the attribute function to simulate an outbreak during any given time period, allowing us to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in future seasons. We demonstrate this by training our model on data from the 2009 pandemic and predicting the timing of the onset in later seasons with good accuracy.DataOur analysis covers Sweden on the geographical level of its 290 municipalities. Almost all the data sources are domestic and are available either on the municipality level (only the cities of Stockholm and Göteborg comprise more than one municipality) or the DeSo (demographic statistical areas)25 level, a subdivision of the municipality level. The only exception is the weather-station based meteorological data, which we have converted from specific geographic coordinates to the municipality level. Because Sweden covers a large geographical area with significant variance in features, climate, and population, the selected indicators may vary significantly.Maps and geographical dataWe constructed the maps of Sweden and its municipalities (Figs. 1A, 2 and 5A) from open-source shapefiles obtained from25 using the QGIS software26 version 3.2.Travel dataTravel patterns in the Swedish population have been recorded since the mid-1990s by interviewing representative selections of several thousand 6–84-year-old inhabitants. As part of this study, we obtained complete questionnaire data for the years 2011–201627. The data contains posts on individuals’ daily commuting habits with partial and whole trips and the geographic origin and target at the DeSo level. Since DeSos are subdivisions of municipalities, we converted them to the municipality level.Since this study considers the years from 2009 to 2015, we have used the 2011–2016 period to define the travel patterns for all parts of the analysis, including the years 2009 and 2010. We assume travel patterns did not change significantly between the years 2009 and 2011. Furthermore, while the sample size of the survey is adequate to calculate general statistics, it is too sparse to construct a travel network with temporal dynamics, even on a yearly level. Instead, we constructed an aggregated static network containing all feasible routes of infection. To partially compensate for the survey’s inadequacies, we made sure that the travel network represents all air and rail travel routes and connects all neighboring municipalities.Figure 1(A) The travel network of Sweden. Municipalities on (B–D) are highlighted. (B) Population normalized H1N1 incidence in epidemic weeks 37 to 50 in the municipalities listed on the right side. (C) The average mean temperature from week 37 to 50 in the municipalities listed on the right side (shown in celsius). (D) The average absolute humidity from week 37 to 50 in the municipalities listed on the right side.Full size imageIn order to include a variable representing travel frequency between the municipalities, we implemented the radiation model of Simini et al.28. This model uses the population size of areas and the distance between them to estimate the population movement between these areas.Epidemiological dataOur data set consists of all laboratory-verified cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 between May 2009 and December 2015, extracted from the SmiNet register of notifiable diseases, held by the Public Health Agency of Sweden. While the number of flu cases is regularly under-reported, the SmiNet database contains 16000 records, a reasonably large sample compared to other notifiable diseases. Due to confidentiality reasons, cases are anonymized, and addresses are aggregated at the DeSo level together with the date of diagnosis, age, and gender. To make sure the addresses represent the habitation at the time of diagnosis, Statistics Sweden (SCB) cross-referenced the register with a historical address register before anonymization. We obtained ethical approval for the data acquisition.Consequently, the epidemiological data contains the number of daily reported cases at the DeSo level, which we converted to the municipality level. Since the available data covers an extended period from 2009 to 2015, we partitioned the case counts into six separate outbreaks corresponding to the 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 flu seasons. The size and timing of the outbreaks show considerable differences. The 09/10 swine flu pandemic covered a significant part of 2009 and lasted into the first weeks of 2010. In contrast, the 11/12 season saw almost no flu cases. Figure 1B shows the number of new cases in 2009 from week 37 to 50 in a few selected municipalities.Socioeconomic dataOne of our main goals is to establish a relationship between socioeconomic factors and epidemic spreading. Since this study only considers Sweden, high-quality data is readily available from Statistics Sweden29, the organization responsible for coordinating the official statistics. Based on available statistics and previous studies16,17,18,23, we selected: 1. The median household income as an economic indicator. 2. The average number of children younger than 18 years per household to indicate family size. 3. The fraction of people receiving social aid to represent poverty in a municipality. 4. Population size and population density as the number of people per sq. km of land area. All the above statistics are available at the municipality level. Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of indicators 1, 2, 3 and the population sizes of the municipalities of Sweden.Both population density and population size have been used before to model epidemic spreading16. In a geographical setting, population density is preferred due to its independence from inequalities in the size of geographical areas. In contrast, using population size can be misleading if differences are more than minimal. However, the fine geographical resolution of the municipalities of Sweden and the lack of huge population centers (except Stockholm and Göteborg) allow us to use population size as a variable. We experimented with both density and size in our study. We found that density only has a small contribution to the timing of the epidemic events, while population size is a significant factor. Therefore, we chose to include population size.Figure 2(A) Geographical distribution of population size of the municipalities of Sweden. (B) Geographical distribution of the average number of children per household in the municipalities of Sweden. (C) Geographical distribution of median household income in the municipalities of Sweden. (D) Geographical distribution of the fraction of people receiving social aid in the municipalities of Sweden. Municipalities shown on Fig. 1 are highlighted.Full size imageMeteorological dataEven though the exact mechanisms are unknown, the relationship between environmental temperature and humidity and seasonal influenza is well established in the literature14,15,16,30. As such, it is one of the key factors used in this study. Due to Sweden’s geographical position and the Gulf Stream effect, the country’s climate ranges from an oceanic climate in the far south to a subarctic climate in the far north, while central Sweden has a humid continental climate.We obtained detailed meteorological data from the European Climate Assessment Dataset31. This database contains daily meteorological station observations covering Europe. Of the elements available in the database, we included mean temperature and relative humidity converted to absolute humidity as factors in this study. We show the averaged mean temperatures and absolute humidity of a few select municipalities on Fig. 1C,D.MethodThe GIIM method uses a network to represent the geographical areas involved in the outbreak. The nodes of the network are the geographical areas themselves, while the links represent possible routes of infection. In the GIIM model, attributes (or weights) can be assigned to both the nodes and the edges of the network; these are important parts of the model and usually represent factors or determinants potentially related to disease spreading. The last and most important input of the model is a set of reference observations from an actual outbreak, which take the form of a time series of values on the same geographical resolution as the nodes of the network.Figure 3Flowchart of the GIIM model.Full size imageThe goal of GIIM is to identify the transmission risks on the links of the network defined as a function of known attributes, and return the parameters of this function. The parameters are estimated with an iterative refinement approach. Starting from an initially random set of parameters, the method constructs a simulated outbreak and calculates a set of observations. These simulated observations are then compared to the reference observations and an error value is computed. Depending on the size of the error, the method either stops and returns set of edge infection probabilities, or it updates the set of parameters using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. In latter case, the process is repeated until the error between the simulated and reference observations is minimal. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of the method.The GIIM method has been successfully applied to real-world problems32, including the modeling of the geographical spread and transmission of Zika in the Americas23. GIIM brings a novel approach to epidemic modeling because instead of merely simulating an outbreak, the method estimates an infection process’s parameters and properties using observations from an actual outbreak.InputsThe GIIM method requires three inputs: an underlying network structure, attributes assigned to the nodes and edges of the network, and a set of observations on a real-life transmission process. The underlying network structure in this study represents the municipalities of Sweden. We denote graph G as G(V, E), where \(V_G\) is a set containing all the vertices of the graph, while \(E_G\) contains all the edges of the graph. We denote the edges of G as \(e_{uv} \in E_G\) with u as the origin and v as the destination of the edge, where u and v are nodes of the network and edge \(e_{uv}\) links node u to v. The nodes of the network represent the 290 municipalities of Sweden, and we define the edges of the network based on the travel survey introduced in the data section. We created a directed edge between two municipalities A and B if at least one individual traveled from A to B. To ensure that we represented all feasible travel paths in the network, we connected all neighboring municipalities. In this way, the edges indicate significant recorded travel between the pair of municipalities they connect. We denote this network \(G_S\) and illustrate it in Fig. 1A.AttributesWe represent the previously defined socioeconomic, travel, and meteorological factors as attributes assigned to the edges. All attributes are real values normalized between zero and one. The following attributes are assigned to each edge \(e_{uv}\): 1. \(F_{uv}\) the estimated amount of travel between municipalities u and v according to the radiation model. 2. \(C^{t}_u\) the incidence of new flu cases reported at the origin municipality u in week t. 3. \(T^{t}_v\) the mean temperature measured in the destination municipality v in week t. 4. \(H^{t}_v\) the absolute humidity measured in the destination municipality v in week t. 5. \(P_v\) the population size of the destination municipality v. 6. \(I_v\) the median income per household in the destination municipality v. 7. \(S_v\) the fraction of people receiving social aid in the destination municipality v. 8. \(K_v\) the average number of children under 18 years of age per household in the destination municipality v. Attributes marked with a time index t are dynamic. As such, their values change in time depending on the week of the outbreak. We build our model based on the 2009 flu pandemic. Therefore, all dynamic attributes refer to the 2009/2010 season unless noted otherwise. We only use data from the 2010–2015 period in the last part of our analysis, when we test our model’s predictive ability.Attribute functionTo reconstruct the observed outbreak using the network and its attributes, GIIM repeatedly runs a simulated infection process. The infection process requires transmission probabilities (also called edge infection probabilities) \(w^{t}_{uv} \in [0,1], e_{uv} \in E_{G_S}\) assigned to the edges of the network. The flexibility of the GIIM model allows us to define these values as a function of known attributes. In this paper, we define the functions with the attributes listed above.$$\begin{aligned} w^{t}_{uv} = A + \alpha F_{uv} + \beta C^{t}_u + \gamma T^{t}_v + \delta H^{t}_v + \zeta P_v + \eta I_v + \theta S_v + \kappa K_v \end{aligned}$$ (1) The variables in Eq. (1) cover the attributes listed previously, while A denotes a constant. The optimization algorithm of GIIM estimates the coefficients of these functions. Note, that some of the attributes received a zero or close to zero weight during the optimization process. We left out these attributes from the final model. See the results section for a discussion of the final set of attributes and their coefficients.Reference outbreakThe GIIM method seeks to estimate the parameters of an actual outbreak. Information about this outbreak comes in the form of reference observations. While observations can take different forms20, here we define the reference observations as a set of binary column vectors, where each row corresponds to a municipality, i.e. a node in the network, while each vector represents a given time period. The goal in this paper is to estimate the timing of the epidemic onset, therefore each value in these binary vectors indicates if the onset has already happened in the corresponding municipality in the corresponding time period. A value of 1 indicates that the epidemic onset already happened, while a 0 indicates that it has not happened yet. The week of the onset has a value of 1. We identified the week in which the epidemic onset happened in each municipality manually, by marking the week when the number of confirmed cases doubled compared to the previous week.An example of a set of reference observations can be seen as follows.Each row corresponds to a municipality, t indicates a time period and there are \(t_e\) time periods in total. The epidemic onset happened at \(t = 2\) in municipality 2 and 3 and sometime later in municipality 1. Municipality 4 avoided the outbreak.We model the spreading of influenza on a weekly basis, therefore each time period (and each binary vector) references a specific epidemic week. However, the timing of the epidemic seasons varies depending on the year. Table 1 lists the weeks in each season when there was a significant number of flu cases. We used these weeks to construct the reference observations. The 2009–2010 season had flu cases throughout the year, but we focus on the fall of 2009, where the largest portion of the outbreak took place.Table 1 The start and end week of each epidemic season.Full size tableInfection modelAs part of its optimization process, GIIM relies on the repeated evaluation of a simulated infection process. GIIM’s flexibility allows it to be used with any infection model where the number of non-susceptible individuals is monotonically increasing20, but it was designed to work with models from the network-based SEIR model family. The SEIR compartmental model family was originally proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 192733, and has been widely used in the field of epidemic modeling ever since22,34. Members of the model family were adapted to networks first by Kleinberg et al.37, and later by multiple authors, e.g., to model global spreading of diseases3, to model the spreading of chikungunya on Reunion Island35, forecasting influenza in European countries36 or to model the establishment of Zika virus in the Americas during the pandemic23 in conjunction with GIIM.In this study, we adopt the SI compartmental infection model defined for networks20,37, which was successfully used to model the first occurrence of Zika23 and the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic24. Part of the more general SEIR infection model family, the SI model only has two states: susceptible (S) and infected (I), representing infectious nodes, which continuously try to infect their healthy neighbors, and susceptible nodes prone to infection. Each node of the network has a state during the process, which may change over time. We assign edge infection probabilities \(w_{uv}^t \in [0,1]\) to all edges of the network. The t time index indicates that these probabilities may change their values depending on the discrete time scale of the process. However, \(w_{uv}^t\) is strictly an input of the model and does not depend on the spreading process in any way. The infection process is iterative and takes place in a finite number of discrete time steps. In each iteration, a node may change its state depending on the state of its neighbors and the edge infection probabilities assigned to the edges connecting it to them. Nodes may change their states from susceptible to infected, but infected nodes stay infected until the end of the process. The total number of discrete time steps the process takes is limited to the number of weeks with reported new flu cases.As in Ref.20,23, we define the SI infection model using a graph G(V, E) with edge infection probabilities \(w^t_{uv}\) assigned to all of its edges and the initial set of infected nodes \(A_0\). The rest of the nodes are in the susceptible state at the beginning of the process. Let \(A_t \subseteq V_G\) be the set of infected nodes in iteration t. In each iteration t each infected node \(u \in A_t\) tries to infect all its susceptible neighbors \(v \in V_G \setminus A_t\) depending on the edge infection probability \(w^t_{uv}\) of the edge connecting them. If the attempt is successful, v joins the set of infected nodes in the following iteration. If more than one node is trying to infect v in the same iteration, the attempts are made independently of each other in an arbitrary order within the same iteration. The process terminates naturally if all nodes reachable from the initially infected nodes with nonzero edge infection probabilities adopt the infected state, or when there are no more reported new flu cases.The above process defines a single instance of an outbreak. Instead of binary values, GIIM requires for each node the likelihood of being in an infectious state for all time steps. To estimate the likelihood of infection for each node at each time step, we run the SI model k times and compute for each time step the fraction of instances where the nodes were infected. This approach is similar to the ones used in38,39. Following the observations in39 and our previous experiences in23, we set \(k = 5000\). This setting provides good accuracy while reducing the overall runtime of the simulations. When we refer to the infection model’s output, we refer to the estimated likelihood values as opposed to the binary outputs of a single instance.The GIIM methodThe GIIM method20 defines the problem of estimating edge infection probabilities as an optimization task. Its inputs include a network, several attributes on the nodes and the edges of the network, and a set of reference observations of an actual outbreak. GIIM provides an estimation of the observed outbreak by simulating one. Apart from the result of the simulation (which may be more detailed than the original), its output provides an assignment of edge infection probabilities and the relative importance of the attributes according to Eq. (1).To define GIIM’s inputs, let \(\vec {o}_t\) denote a vector containing observations on an infection process. Let \(\vec {o}_t\) assign a value to all \(v \in V_{G}\). Let \(t \in T\) denote a discrete time stamp indicating the week in which the observation was taken, and T be the set of all time stamps. Let O denote the set of all observations \(\vec {o}_t \in O\) for all \(t \in T\). Let \({{\mathscr {I}}}\) denote the SI infection model introduced in the previous subsection, and \(W_G: E_G \mapsto [0,1]\) be the initially unknown assignment of edge weights to the edges of the graph. Finally, let Inf be a procedure, which makes observations on infection process \({{\mathscr {I}}}\) at sample times T, taking place on graph G with assigned edge weights \(w_{uv} \in W, e_{uv} \in E(G)\). We denote Inf as \(O = Inf(G, W, {{\mathscr {I}}}, T)\).Generalized inverse infection modelGiven an weighted graph G, infection model \({{\mathscr {I}}}\), the set of sample times T, and reference observations \(O = Inf(G, W, {{\mathscr {I}}}, T)\), we seek the edge infection probability assignment \(W'\) such that the difference between O and \(O' = Inf(G, W', {{\mathscr {I}}}, T)\) is minimal.In this study, the set of reference observations O contains binary vectors indicating the timing of the epidemic onset, while the observations \(O'\) generated by running the infection model \({{\mathscr {I}}}\) are real-valued. To compute the difference between O and \(O'\), we employ ROC evaluation. We pairwise compare vectors \(\vec {o}_t \in O\) and \(\vec {o'}_t \in O'\) for all \(t \in T\), calculating the AUC value for each pair and averaging over all pairs. The GIIM method uses an iterative refinement algorithm to solve the optimization task above. Starting from an initially random edge weight assignment, GIIM simulates an outbreak and compares the output with reference observations. Then it updates the edge weight assignments and repeats the process. The search algorithm uses the Fully Informed Particle Swarm Optimization method21, a multi-agent iterative optimization algorithm, which was previously shown to perform well with GIIM20,23. Algorithm 1 and Fig. 3 summarizes the GIIM algorithm.Estimating individual edges is difficult due to the size of most networks. To avoid this problem, GIIM defines the edge weights as a function of known attributes on the nodes or edges. This way, the goal of the optimization task is to find the coefficients of this function. GIIM also makes it possible to define dynamic attributes or edge weights, indicating that their value changes in time. In practice, this means that the edge weight or attribute is a function of t, a discrete time stamp corresponding to the actual iteration of the infection model. The general form of the edge function can be written as \(w_{uv}^t = g(f_1(a_1^t(e_{uv}), \vec {c_1}),\) \(f_2(a_2^t(e_{uv}), \vec {c_2}), \dots , f_{\ell }(a_{\ell }^t(e_{uv}), \vec {c_{\ell }}), \vec {c_g})\) for all \(e_{uv} \in E_{G_A}\), where \(a_i^t(e_{uv})\) represents the i-th attribute on edge \(e_{uv} \in E_{G}\) at iteration t of the infection process, \(\ell\) denotes the number of available attributes, \(f_1, \dots , f_{\ell }\) and g are functions and \(\vec {c_1}, \dots , \vec {c_{\ell }, \vec {c_g}}\) are coefficients of functions \(f_1, \dots , f_{\ell }, g\). This formulation is easy to implement and allows us to assign different functions to different attributes, while the role of function g is to aggregate and normalize the results of the individual attribute functions to ensure they fall between 0 and 1. The value \(w_{uv}^t\) denotes the edge weights and C the set of all coefficient vectors. Using the function-based alternative greatly simplifies the optimization task, reducing the number of values we have to estimate from \(|W|=|E_G|\) to |C|. However, its main advantage is that instead of providing a single individual value for each edge, it allows us to explore the relationship between the factors potentially related to the outbreak and the outbreak itself.Equation (1) defines the edge functions used in this study. We trim the weighted sums above 1 and below 0 by taking \(w_{uv}^t = MAX(0, MIN(1, \sum _{i = 1}^{\ell } f(a_i^t(e_{uv}), c_i) + c_g)))\). To reduce the solution space of the PSO method and to make the results of individual test runs comparable, we bound all parameters between \(-0.5\) and 0.5, except A, which we bound between \(-1\) and 1.Ethics approval and consent to participateAll data were anonymized to be not retraceable to individuals by the Public Health Agency of Sweden before being accessed by the research team. Approval was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee in Umeå on 2015-10-20.Results and discussionWe start our analysis by studying the spreading of H1N1 in the autumn of 2009 between weeks 37 and 50, corresponding to a period from mid-September to mid-December. We model the outbreak on a weekly basis and set up the input files of GIIM as described in the Inputs section. To partially account for the summer wave of infections in 2009, we select the municipalities of Stockholm, Malmo and Gothenburg as infected in the starting week of the analysis because these municipalities contained the most infected individuals during the summer wave. We use the attribute function defined in Eq. (1) with the socioeconomic, travel and meteorological factors introduced in the Inputs section. To compensate for the model’s stochastic nature, we ran the algorithm 20 times with the same set of inputs and computed the mean and variance of the results.Risk factorsTo evaluate the relative contributions of the travel, socioeconomic, and meteorological factors on the timing of the epidemic onset in the municipalities of Sweden, we experimented with multiple combinations and functions. While we started our analysis with the function shown in Eq. (1), several of our input attributes received a coefficient close to zero. These were travel frequency (\(F_{uv}\)), household income (\(I_v\)) and social aid (\(S_v\)). We excluded these variables from the final model in Eq. (2). Figure 4 shows the mean of the coefficients assigned to the remaining risk factors, while Table 2 shows the mean, the minimum, the maximum and the standard deviation of these factors.$$\begin{aligned} w^{t}_{uv} = 0.001 + 0.2317 C^{t}_u - 0.0594 T^{t}_v - 0.2106 H^{t}_v + 0.4712 P_v + 0.0357 K_v \end{aligned}$$ (2) Table 2 The mean, the minimum, the maximum and the standard deviation of coefficient assigned to the risk factors by GIIM.Full size tableFigure 4Coefficients assigned to the risk factors by GIIM.Full size imageThe weights in Eq. (2) represent each risk factor’s relative contribution to the transmission risk between the municipalities. The standard deviation of the coefficients across test runs is small except for absolute humidity. More importantly, the relative importance of the risk factors remains robust. The most significant factor in the timing of the epidemic onset is the population size of the municipalities, indicating that the disease reaches large population centers first and then spreads to the countryside. This result is in line with observations in the US and UK, where both population size and the more commonly used population density were already established as important contributors to this phenomenon8. Our results indicate that the importance of large population centers is far greater than identified in13, possibly because of the higher spatial resolution of our model in Sweden.Another significant risk factor is the incidence of H1N1 cases in the municipalities on the origin of the links. This coefficient is closely tied to the network-based structure of our model, which is similar to agent-based approaches6,7 and underlines the spatial structure of the spreading process, which we discuss in the next subsection.The contribution of the amount of travel between municipalities was close to zero in our initial model, thus the parameter was omitted from Eq. (2). This result is in line with the observations in13. The exact role of this indicator is debated in the literature. Some studies identify it as a minor factor5,16,23, while others emphasize its effect in local or global transmission7,8. One possible explanation for its lack of importance here, is that our study only considers a relatively small geographical area, a single country having a well developed transportation infrastructure. Our results are also in line with the conclusions in12,23, which states that the presence of a few infected travelers is enough to spread the disease to different regions.Meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity are known to play a critical role in the appearance of influenza12,16. According to our model, a decrease in absolute humidity is one of the main driving factors in H1N1 spreading, while a drop in temperature provides a smaller contribution. This result confirms the findings of Skog et al.12, but contradicts the findings of Morris et al.13, which identified no such relationship. We provide two explanations for this: First, our model offers a much higher spatial resolution for Sweden than the model in13. Second, the high-resolution results of Morris et al. apply to Norway, which has a different climate closer to the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Current with the Scandinavian Mountains separating the two countries.Perhaps due to the relative homogeneity of a single country, we found that the effect of the socioeconomic variables on the transmission risk between municipalities to be minimal. The average number of school-age children per household, which is a well-known risk factor17, showed the most significant influence. The influence of both income and social aid is close to zero in our model. However, median income and social aid at the municipality level might not be sufficiently sensitive indicators to measure the inequalities in Swedish society.We conclude that the three variables that influence the timing of the epidemic onset the most are population size, the number of cases in neighboring municipalities and a decrease in the absolute humidity of the environment. This result is in line with the spreading mechanism of agent-based simulations where the outbreak travels from region to region after infecting a certain amount of people locally, favoring population centers6,7. Temperature also has a small negative effect, while school-aged children have a small positive effect.Exportation, importation and route level riskThe edge infection or transmission probabilities between the municipalities of Sweden are among the outputs of GIIM. It is possible to define a node-based import and export risk weight by aggregating the edge-based risk values on the in- and out-edges of each node. This value is also known as node strength. These values are not probabilities but risk indicators of importing or exporting the disease from or to a municipality. They represent a relative weight that allows us to rank the municipalities. Figure 5 shows exportation, importation and route level risk for a few select municipalities, while Fig. 5A shows their location in Sweden.Figure 5B illustrates the time-dependent exportation risk values for some of the highest risk municipalities in onset estimation. Large population centers appear at the top of the list. While Göteborg and Stockholm remain at the top, Malmö only stays in the top 20 exporters during the initial weeks, with its relevance decreasing even more later in the outbreak. Other larger cities include Linköping, Jönköping and Uppsala, although their relevance fades in time except for Uppsala. Several of the larger cities of northern Sweden, such as Skellefteå, Umeå, and Gävle, are top exporters until mid-November, partially confirming the observations in12.Figure 5C illustrates the time-dependent importation risk values for some high-risk municipalities in onset estimation. This ranking is more static than the export ranking, with large population centers remaining high risk until the end of the outbreak. These cities include Linköping, Jönköping, Norrköping, Uppsala, Örebro and Västerås, together with a few northern municipalities such as Umeå, Gävle and Sundsvall. In contrast to the export risk ranking, Stockholm county and Västra Götaland are not top-import municipalities. However, our model only considers domestic travel patterns in Sweden, therefore the risk of importation from international travellers is not included in our analysis. This fact may explain the seemingly low risk of importation in Stockholm.Due to a large number of edges in the graph, it is difficult to highlight the individual links most important to the outbreak. Figure 5D shows some of these links. For example, early in the outbreak, links connecting to Uppsala appear most prominently among links to Umeå, Linköping, Örebro and Västerås. This pattern remains until the end of the outbreak. Starting from mid-October, links connecting the municipalities of Northern Sweden appear at the top of the edge-based risk ranking and stay there for several weeks until mid-November. At the end of our observation period, links connecting larger population centers in South and Central Sweden dominate the top of the ranking.Figure 5(A) Municipalities on (B–D) are highlighted on the map. (B) Exportation risk values of selected municipalities. (C) Importation risk values of selected municipalities. (D) Transmission probabilities of selected links.Full size imageOur observations on the timing of the epidemic onset of H1N1 in the fall of 2009 follow a loose geographical pattern. Following the smaller summer wave of infections, the disease stays in the largest cities. From September, it begins slowly spreading to the other larger population centers of South and Central Sweden and a few cities in Northern Sweden. A massive burst of the outbreak happens in mid-October, reaching the countryside in South and Central Sweden and moving north along the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, infecting the larger population centers on its way. After peaking in most of the country in early and mid-November, the outbreak first ends in the north and finally in the largest cities where it began.Model accuracyWe evaluated the accuracy of our model by independently computing the ROC AUC value for each week of the estimation process. The averaged AUC value for all 14 weeks of the observation period was 0.875, indicating a good fit. Figure 6 shows individual AUC values for all weeks. The estimation is easy during the first weeks due to the small number of positive examples. In most municipalities, the fall H1N1 outbreak started and peaked in weeks 42–45. In these weeks, the accuracy of the estimation process drops to around 0.82, indicating some uncertainty in the exact timing of the onset, stabilizing around 0.85 in the second half of the observation period.Figure 6Model accuracy (ROC AUC) for all weeks of the observation period.Full size imageModel predictabilityTo demonstrate the robustness of our approach, we use the attribute function with estimated coefficients from the 2009 outbreak in conjunction with the infection model to predict the timing of the epidemic onset in the influenza outbreaks in epidemic seasons 10/11, 12/13, 13/14, 14/15. We omitted season 11/12 from our analysis due to the small number of H1N1 cases in that season. We updated our dynamic input attributes to match the actual temperature and humidity values in the periods. We also defined the infection sources for each of the target seasons and estimation types by selecting the three municipalities with the earliest appearance of the disease.To test the accuracy of our predictions, we set up the reference observations for our four target seasons in the same way as for the 09/10 season (for observation periods of these seasons, see Table 1). After running the infection model for each season, we compared their output with the corresponding reference observations by computing the ROC AUC metric.Figure 7Predictive accuracy for epidemic seasons 10/11, 12/13, 13/14, 14/15.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 7, the average AUC values for all successive seasons stay close or even exceed the accuracy we have seen in the 2009 pandemic. The individual AUC values present a similar picture, although the trends inside epidemic seasons differ somewhat from those in Fig. 6, with accuracy slowly decreasing as the outbreak progresses but stabilizing well above 0.8. The predictive accuracy is higher in the 13/14 and 14/15 seasons than in the first two. While the weakening immunity granted to the population by the 09/10 pandemic may explain this trend, our results do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm this hypothesis.ConclusionsAccording to our findings, the spreading of H1N1 in Sweden was mainly driven by large population centers, the presence and size of outbreaks in neighboring municipalities and the meteorological factors humidity and temperature. Confirming observations in13,23, the amount of travelers is not an important factor. This result may be due to the relatively small geographical scope of the study and the well-developed infrastructure of the country. Supporting existing results on the effect of meteorological factors in influenza spreading12,16, absolute humidity plays a critical role in our model, while mean temperature contributes less. The only other socioeconomic indicator that contributes noticeably to our model is the number of children per household, confirming the observations in17. The effect of the rest of the socioeconomic factors, income and social aid, is close to zero. However, the spatial resolution of our model might be too low to identify their contribution.Compared to other studies discussing the role of socioeconomic, climate and travel indicators in influenza spreading in the Nordic countries, we confirm most of the observations of Skog et al.12 and some of Morris et al.13. Due to the radically different methodology used in these studies, a more direct comparison is not within the scope of this paper. We also extended these previous works by examining the effect of a larger set of indicators and providing an analysis of the most critical travel routes involved in the spreading of influenza.While our model is constructed based on the 2009 pandemic, we can make accurate predictions on the timing of the selected epidemic events in the following seasons. Therefore, our model can be used as a real-time decision support tool advising on resource allocation and surveillance. Furthermore, while our study only considers H1N1 spreading, it can be adapted to model other influenza strains or respiratory infections with a similar transmission mechanism.

Recent polls show a 25 percentage-point gap between Republicans and Democrats who've gotten or will get a flu shot. This is remarkably similar to the approximately 30 percentage-point partisan gap on COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was little to no partisan gap on influenza vaccine uptake.

Advertisement Recent polls show Republicans are now much less likely to get a flu shot than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating that the politicization of the coronavirus vaccines is bleeding over into the flu immunization.In the years prior to the global pandemic, Republicans and Democrats were similarly likely to get an annual influenza shot, CNN recently pointed out. In a February 2020 AP-NORC poll, 58% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans said they'd gotten a flu shot in the past year.This year, between 65 and 68% of Democrats say they have gotten or will almost certainly get a flu shot, while between 40 and 44% of Republicans said they have or will get vaccinated against the flu, recent polls show. A UC San Diego study published last spring found that Republicans had become less likely to say they'd get a flu shot during the pandemic. This gap is reflective of the approximately 30 percentage-point gap between Democrats and Republicans who've received a COVID-19 jab. While between 90 and 95% of Democrats 18 and older have gotten a coronavirus vaccine, just about 65% of adult Republicans have done the same. Advertisement The coronavirus vaccines, vaccine mandates, and other public health efforts related to the pandemic, including mask-wearing and lockdowns, have been heavily politicized over the last nearly two years. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to oppose these mitigation efforts. Many Republican lawmakers and politicians have aggressively opposed COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements, a position some experts fear will aggravate hesitancy and opposition to other vaccines as well. This partisan gap in vaccine uptake is one reason why there's a significantly higher COVID-19 death rate in counties that voted for former President Donald Trump and those that President Joe Biden won in 2020. Those who've received a COVID-19 vaccine are much more likely to have gotten or say they will get a flu shot than those who've failed to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Related stories This comes as public health officials have ramped up their efforts to promote the influenza vaccine. Last year, medical experts warned of a "twindemic" of both rising COVID-19 cases and a flu epidemic that could overwhelm hospitals already stretched to the brink with coronavirus patients, prior to the release of the COVID-19 vaccines. The 2020-2021 flu season was ultimately very mild, likely because many Americans stayed home, distanced from others, and wore masks to protect against the coronavirus. But with many COVID-19 mitigation efforts loosened this year, it's likely cases of the flu will be higher.Some private entities have also stepped up their efforts to fight the flu as the season. Some universities have mandated that students and staff get the flu shot this year. Advertisement The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone in the US six months and older get a flu shot. Medical experts warn that contracting the flu could make people more vulnerable to COVID-19 and that catching both viruses simultaneously could dramatically increase the risk of severe illness or death. "The Covid-19 pandemic is not over, and the risk of both flu and Covid-19 circulating could put additional strain on hospitals and frontline health care professionals," CDC head Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in October.

Tibbetts Photography By Amy Ware, Andrew Davis Tucker, Jason Thrasher (Illustration by Daniel Rouhani/ExonScientific) In the latter months of 2019, a novel coronavirus probably leaped from a yet-unknown animal in central China into a human. Some speculate that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. But evidence suggests that it’s far more likely that the virus was a natural “zoonotic” leap from animal to human. The resulting COVID-19 pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans, including more than 23,000 Georgians, and mutated into dangerous new variants. For decades, UGA researchers have been examining the phenomenon of zoonotic spillover—the complex conditions that allow opportunistic animal diseases to infect us. Some spillovers, such as the common cold, cause mild effects. But others can be deadly: plague, rabies, AIDS/HIV and Ebola. Each year, a zoonotic disease—an influenza A virus strain—kills about 1,400 Georgians on average and hospitalizes many more. “The University of Georgia is one of the leading research institutions in the world tackling zoonotic spillover,” said Justin Bahl, comparative geneticist and associate professor in the College of Public Health and College of Veterinary Medicine at UGA. “We are studying the human and environmental systems in which these zoonotic infections arise and identifying possible solutions.” Spillover pathogens (viruses, infectious bacteria, parasites and other agents) account for about 75% of emerging infectious diseases that today affect humans. Zoonoses are transmitted when people handle sick animals or their waste, consume diseased animals’ tissues or fluids, or get bitten by infected animals or insects. Many spillover pathogens originate in animals that live among us as pests, pets or livestock. Cattle gave us measles. Rat fleas hosted the plague, and dogs host rabies. From domesticated swine or poultry, we catch influenza A virus strains, which originated in migratory waterfowl. A growing number of emerging zoonotic diseases jump into us from wild animals. Viral infections can survive for a long time in wildlife hosts, multiplying slowly and harmlessly. But when humans invade or degrade once-remote habitats, wildlife diseases get the chance to cross the species border to people. Wildlife, livestock operations and human populations increasingly share densely crowded geographies—and share infectious diseases that jump among different species. “The University of Georgia is one of the leading research institutions in tvhe world tackling zoonotic spillover,” said Justin Bahl, an associate professor in the UGA colleges of Public Health and Veterinary Medicine who studies viral dynamics and the evolutionary relationships among viruses and their hosts. Bahl says UGA’s strengths are due to the range of disciplines it brings to bear on this phenomenon. (Photo by Jason Thrasher) UGA scientists are tracking sources and trajectories of zoonotic pathogens to understand where and how they cross species boundaries and cause outbreaks. The goal is to prevent spillover outbreaks before they can happen or turn into epidemics or pandemics. When people think of infectious disease research, they might imagine lab technicians in protective “space suits” or physicians caring for sick patients in clinical trials—and those types of work are crucial. But other research methods and disciplines are also required to tackle zoonotic disease spillovers. UGA is well equipped to investigate these types of spillovers because it has broad multidisciplinary expertise and collaboration, according to Bahl. “We have people like me—a comparative geneticist—studying evolutionary processes of infections. UGA epidemiologists are working to understand infectious disease transmission and virulence in human populations. We have experts who sample the environment to understand which infections are circulating out there. UGA veterinarians and other scientists are working with producers to understand the physiology of domesticated chickens and pigs to reduce opportunities for infections. We have scientists who study the social, economic and public health systems and their contributions to zoonotic spillover,” he said. “We are studying the evolution, epidemiology and physiology of infectious diseases and interacting human and ecological systems—and we are applying this knowledge to find solutions. The research we are doing can have wide-ranging impacts and long-term consequences for human health. We don’t have to accept the status quo.” Someday, scientists could learn enough about spillovers to predict new zoonotic outbreaks and forecast their spread. Infectious disease forecasting might become as common as weather reports are today. Imagine timely, localized alerts for COVID-19 or other infections available on a smartphone, identifying hotspots and updating frequently. “Seventy years ago, weather forecasting was in its infancy, and that’s comparable to where we are right now with infectious disease forecasting,” said John Drake, ecologist and Distinguished Research Professor in the Odum School of Ecology and College of Veterinary Medicine. “We have a long way to go, but the costs of infectious diseases to human lives and the economy are so great that we will make incremental progress toward that goal.” “Natural systems have equilibriums that maintain the sizes of animal populations. Once humans start changing the dynamics of natural systems, that’s when you can start to have wildlife disease outbreaks and zoonotic diseases and people can get sick.” – Sonia Hernandez, professor in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the College of Veterinary Medicine Photo by Amy Ware Wildlife-human connection When humans lived in small hunter-gatherer bands, an animal pathogen spilling into people might quickly burn through available hosts and fade away. When humans settled down on farms and villages, we lived with domesticated animals that passed some of their afflictions to us. As agriculture and commerce intensified, market towns expanded along roadways and waterways. Spillover infections multiplied and spread to other communities. Empire building, wars and trade expanded into new territories, spreading infectious diseases. Today, logging, farming, mining, and road and settlement construction all bring wild creatures and people into closer contact. Many households in the tropics and subtropics rely on game, or “bush meat,” for animal protein and cash income. Live or slaughtered wild animals are sold in urban “wet markets” where pathogens can move into humans. “We are changing habitat structures, dynamics and availability of habitat for animals, and those changes come with consequences,” said Sonia Hernandez, professor in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources and the College of Veterinary Medicine. Hernandez studies how pathogens affect wildlife populations and ecosystems. “We should not fear wildlife because they may have diseases,” she said. “Instead, we should respect wildlife and be more careful with how we affect their habitat dynamics.” Some spillovers occur when people eliminate or degrade wildlife habitat while providing abundant food for a reduced population of surviving but stressed animals. American white ibis, an aquatic waterfowl, has lost wetland habitat across South Florida and the Everglades to urban development, relying more and more on stormwater ponds to roost. The birds congregate in urban parks, competing for food handouts. Human foods disrupt the birds’ gut microbiome and unbalance their immune systems, increasing their vulnerability to intestinal diseases such as Salmonella, UGA researchers found. Scientists once thought that Salmonella was exclusively a foodborne disease. But UGA researchers have found that humans and wildlife pick up Salmonella from the environment and share it, possibly passing it back and forth. Georgia has the highest rate of human Salmonella cases in the Southeast. Zoonotic spillover occurs when a pathogen—such as a bacterium, virus or parasite—jumps from one animal species to another, including humans. For nearly two years, humans have been dealing with the latest high-profile example of spillover as the COVID-19 pandemic has raged worldwide, but other examples of zoonotic diseases include the bubonic plague, various types of flu, salmonella and HIV/AIDS, to name only a few. Zoonotic pathogens can travel both to and from host species, meaning that even successful containment of a pathogen in people does not necessarily prevent that bug from infecting (and biding its time in) a non-human species. (Illustration by Daniel Rouhani/ExonScientific) To learn how these zoonotic spillovers occur, Hernandez assembled a multidisciplinary team of UGA researchers, including animal physiologists, disease ecologists, landscape ecologists, microbiologists and disease modelers. The team explores trends in the birds’ habitat use, movement patterns, diet, gut health, immunity and rates of Salmonella infection. Geography places an important role in understanding this human-bird disease connection. Urbanized white ibis are more likely to carry Salmonella infections than those in natural areas. The research team identified certain Salmonella subtypes in urban ponds where white ibis congregate. Those same subtypes showed up in humans in places where numbers of clinical cases were high. The birds might catch Salmonella infections indirectly from human activity—that is, from ponds contaminated by stormwater runoff, leaking septic tanks and other sources of untreated human sewage. White ibis might return the infections to humans via the birds’ feces. “When people feed the birds in parks, the ibis become habituated to that food,” said Hernandez. “The birds climb on benches and picnic tables and defecate, and people might be exposed to Salmonella by touching these surfaces, but we don’t know where humans get these cases of environmental Salmonellosis.” Wild aquatic birds are similarly attracted to wild bird feeders, spreading Salmonella to backyard chickens and infecting people who handle them. Conserving habitats could lessen physiological stresses that lead to infection outbreaks in wildlife populations and zoonotic spillovers. “Natural systems have equilibriums that maintain the sizes of animal populations,” said Hernandez. “Once humans start changing the dynamics of natural systems, that’s when you can start to have wildlife disease outbreaks and zoonotic diseases and people can get sick.” Biodiversity, then, establishes healthier conditions for wildlife—and people. “Wildlife conservation and human health are tightly interlinked,” said Richard Hall, assistant professor in the Odum School of Ecology. “If we can maintain natural foraging and movement behaviors, and preserve and restore natural habitats, we can reduce risk of elevated disease transmission within wildlife populations, with the bonus of reducing spillover risk into people.” A professor in the College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences, Susana Ferreira looks at the economic side of spillover, including the economic incentives that lead to human encroachment upon wildlife habitats. She is part of a five-year study investigating the origins and impacts of spillover events. “This kind of interdisciplinary research is important,” she said, “because it better incorporates people’s actions and interactions and socioeconomic drivers into models of spillover risk and disease transmission.” (Photo by Jason Thrasher) Food, habitats and pathogens The world’s human population has doubled since the early 1970s, becoming more urbanized and often more prosperous. As the global middle class has expanded, households have additional discretionary income to supplement their diets with meat and meat products. In Southeast Asia, many households raise backyard poultry in open-air operations. Chickens, ducks and geese are susceptible to influenzas that originate in wild migratory waterfowl, which carry these infections benignly in their guts. After long migrations, hungry waterfowl flock to sites with abundant food and release virus-laden feces. “When you feed chickens, you can attract large numbers of wild migratory birds to those food resources,” said Hernandez. “You are artificially aggregating wild animals at densities that normally you don’t see in natural systems. And when you have large concentrations of both domestic animals and wild animals that don’t naturally come together, you can facilitate disease transmissions.” A household operation in Southeast Asia might contain a variety of birds, said Bahl. “They might trap and pen migratory birds, breed wild birds in captivity and also raise classically domesticated animals such as chickens and ducks, allowing them to exchange their genetic materials and spreading highly infectious variants.” Some viruses, such as influenzas, are so successful partly because of their incredibly rapid evolutionary cycles. “When these viruses get into animals such as domestic birds, they can go through many replication cycles in a short period, burning through that population very quickly,” said Bahl. “They’re among the fastest-evolving viruses that we know, and within that large pool of viruses, you can get new variants.” Influenza viruses often leap from wild birds to an intermediate host such as domesticated poultry or pig. Eventually, the virus can mutate into a new viral concoction that allows it to leap into a human host and replicate. But a zoonotic virus can also reverse direction, Bahl noted, spilling back into its previous host. Some influenza variants that jump from wild birds to pigs or poultry spill back into wild birds. “Variants that do return to wild birds may be different enough from the original avian virus that they can out-compete the ancestral viral population” and become more infectious or virulent, said Bahl. Aquatic migratory birds can carry evolutionarily super-charged variants across pathways between Asia, Europe and North America where virus variants can spread. European nations and the United States have been expanding pig and poultry farms and meat processing centers into massive operations. Influenza viruses from humans, birds and pigs can mix and mutate into more infectious or virulent variants that can spread back to other species, including us. UGA’s Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, led by Distinguished Research Professor John Drake, is devoted to studying infectious disease from a holistic perspective. “Ecology allows us to identify and quantify common risk factors for zoonotic spillovers, so we can make decisions about managing those risks,” Drake said. Earlier this year Drake and his colleagues launched the Global Infectious Disease Intelligence Consortium to share information widely among both researchers and decision-makers in economic sectors affected by emerging diseases. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker) How might scientists predict zoonotic outbreaks? Public health measures and medical interventions have been spectacularly successful in fighting infectious diseases over the past century, lengthening human life spans with improved sanitation, hygiene, treatments and vaccines. Now, researchers are developing innovative, multidisciplinary research strategies to fight new challenges of infectious diseases. UGA researchers are integrating social sciences into spillover models to understand how economic incentives can affect the emergence of infections. Poverty can drive people into the wildlife trade or other ventures that allow zoonotic pathogens to emerge. “We need to study how economic incentives affect decisions to get into a contact zone with wildlife, including why people engage in wildlife trade and wildlife habitat conversions,” said Susana Ferreira, professor in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. “This kind of interdisciplinary research is important because it better incorporates people’s actions and interactions and socioeconomic drivers into models of spillover risk and disease transmission.” Ferreira works with a research team led by Patrick Stephens of the UGA Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID), which received a $2.4 million, five-year grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study this very phenomenon. The researchers will investigate and model the origins and impacts of zoonotic spillovers, focusing on Ebola and related filoviruses. This research is one of many projects by the CEID’s multi-disciplinary Spillover Working Group, which studies drivers and geographies of emerging infectious diseases. Ferreira’s team will track communities and regions where armed conflict is forcing people from their homes into wild areas to find food and shelter, raising opportunities for zoonotic disease outbreaks. “Armed conflict can result from economic competition for resources,” said Ferreira. “It can displace people to the forest frontier to look for sources of protein, increasing the consumption of bush meat that could harbor potential zoonotic diseases. Armed conflict can destroy the medical infrastructure that helps us detect and treat zoonotic spillover cases and prevents those cases from spreading into epidemics.” Ecology is an effective way of thinking about the many complex systems that drive zoonotic spillovers. “Ecology takes a holistic approach to understand a system,” said Drake, CEID director. “Rift valley fever, Ebola virus and avian influenza have different hosts. But these diseases all result from animal population dynamics, behavior and habitat. Zoonoses result from interactions between people and animals in the environment or on the farm. These interactions have a geographical aspect, spatially distributed in fields, forests and ecosystems. “Ecology allows us to identify and quantify common risk factors for zoonotic spillovers, so we can make decisions about managing those risks.” In March, Drake and his colleagues at CEID launched the Global Infectious Disease Intelligence Consortium in March 2021. They want to create partnerships that allow closer collaboration and communication between academic scientists and people in other sectors of the economy who could benefit from the information researchers have about emerging diseases, according to Drake. “It has been eye-opening to us during the COVID-19 pandemic that relatively large companies lack the kind of information they need about managing epidemics or understanding characteristic patterns of epidemics. We want to work with those organizations to anticipate, identify and rapidly respond to emerging disease threats as we do now with meteorological threats,” he said. “Although we cannot predict a tornado’s path, we understand the weather conditions under which tornadoes arise. We have built life-saving information tornado warning systems around this knowledge,” Drake said. “Someday we will be able to identify and understand conditions that enable infectious diseases to emerge and make similarly life-saving predictions.” Related Posts Infectious Disease | October 13, 2015 The next outbreak Infectious Disease | September 30, 2021 What causes disease outbreaks?

Back to Healio A best practice alert when a child checked in for surgery led to an approximately 3,500% increase in the number of patients vaccinated against influenza at Children’s Hospital Colorado, according to a press release. The CDC estimates that 58.2% of U.S. children received the influenza vaccine during the 2020-2021 season, a decrease of about 4.1 percentage points from the 2019-2020 season. Reference: Morrissey T, et al. A-2032. Presented at: The ANESTHESIOLOGY annual meeting; Oct. 8-12, 2021; (hybrid meeting). Tyler Morrissey, MD, an assistant professor of pediatric anesthesiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, and colleagues initiated the best practice alert in October 2020. The alert appeared on an intake nurse’s screen when a pediatric patient checked in for a procedure involving elective general anesthesia. Tyler Morrissey “If the patient did not have documented influenza vaccination for the season, this nurse would then determine, using a series of questions, if the patient was eligible for the vaccine and would obtain parental consent,” Morrissey told Healio Primary Care. “A standing order for the vaccine was dispensed and placed on the patient’s physical chart to be given under anesthesia.” During the 2020-2021 influenza season, before the best practice alert was implemented, only 30 perioperative vaccines were administered to patients during a 6-week period, according to the press release. Twenty-five weeks into the intervention period, 1,063 vaccines were administered. No vaccine-related complications were reported. “Surprisingly, patients and families had very few concerns about receiving the vaccine under anesthesia,” Morrissey said. “Our project demonstrated that, if offered, families would jump at the chance to have their child vaccinated under anesthesia.” He added in a press release that the data show “that having a standardized process for getting children vaccinated for flu while under anesthesia during surgery provides a ‘teachable moment’ and opportunity to educate families on the importance of flu vaccination and may be a model for other childhood vaccinations while under anesthesia, including the COVID-19 vaccine.” References: CDC. 2020-21 Flu Season Summary FAQ. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm.

Explainer: What Is Seasonal Flu? Health officials recommend getting vaccinated against seasonal influenza, but do you know why? For one thing, the flu is always changing. By Eric Monticello 18 Nov 2021 Story Topics Flu Unlike the common cold, influenza can be serious and even deadly. Only vaccines can tackle the respiratory illness, which kills 290,000 or more people globally every year, according to estimates from the World Health Organization. Compared to a cold, the flu packs a punch with more intense symptoms. Rather than a mild gradual illness, the flu comes on suddenly and can cause complications such as pneumonia and bacterial infections. Because flu viruses are constantly changing, the flu is a moving target, said Dr. Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist at the University of Chicago in an article for BBC. “What's hard about influenza is that it's always evolving into something new that we've never ever seen before,” she said. The CDC explains that through a process called antigenic drift, influenza viruses mutate (change) the more they’re spread around. The flu spreads through air droplets that circulate when people cough, sneeze or talk. The mutations create new strains and get passed around more in winter - also known as flu season. Why winter? Cold air and low temperatures helps influenza thrive and spread more easily, explained Peter Palese, flu researcher and chairman of the microbiology department at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, in an article for the New York Times. Good hygiene and handwashing can help, but humankind’s best strategy against the flu is an annual flu vaccine. “Immunization is so important to combating influenza, as it is the only proven way to raise your immune defense against the virus,” said Beverly Taylor, Head of Influenza Scientific Affairs at global influenza vaccines provider, Seqirus. “This is why there is a year-round global effort to track and identify the circulating influenza strains, so we are able to develop the vaccines that protect the public against them.” Related share Terms of Use Cookie Policy Global Privacy Policy Accessibility Statement Sitemap Terms of Use Cookie Policy Global Privacy Policy Accessibility Statement Sitemap CSL, All Rights Reserved © 2024 Search CSL CSL (CSL Behring's Parent Company) CSL Behring Worldwide Americas Argentina Brazil Canada Chile Colombia Mexico Asia Pacific Australia China Japan Korea Singapore Taiwan Middle East Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates (MEA) Europe Austria Belgium and Luxembourg Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Italy Netherlands Norway Poland Slovakia Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey United Kingdom CSL Plasma (CSL Behring Subsidiary) CSL Plasma US CSL Plasma Germany CSL Plasma HungarySpanish Flu (1918–1920) Impact on US Suicide Rates by Race: Potential Future Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic | Psychiatrist.com Advertisement Register for Free Sign In My account Orders Downloads Address Payment methods Account details SUBSCRIBE About About Psychiatrist.com About JCP About PCC About CME Institute SEARCH MY ACCOUNT Register for Free Sign In My account Orders Downloads Address Payment methods Account details SUBSCRIBE About About Psychiatrist.com About JCP About PCC About CME Institute SEARCH Error: Search field were incomplete.

Due to combined health and economic effects, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase US suicide rates.1 Previous epidemics may have increased suicide rates in some countries, such as Hong Kong (severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic) and Taiwan (influenza pandemic: 1918–1920).2,3 However, Pirkis et al4 analyzed the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global suicide rates, finding that suicide rates in 21 countries (16 high income and 5 upper-middle income) have either been stable or reduced. Within the United States, this study4 specifically found that California, Illinois, and Texas (4 counties) had reduced suicide rates, while Louisiana and New Jersey had stable suicide rates. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) recently released provisional US mortality data for 2020, which estimated a 17.7% increase in overall mortality, but a 5.6% decline in US suicide rates compared to 2019 (reduced from 47,511 to 44,834 suicides).5 As context, Durkheim historically identified that major crises are often associated with a reduction in suicides, because great upheavals in society, like great popular wars, sharpen collective feelings, stimulate the party spirit and the national one and by concentrating activities towards a single end, achieve at least for a time, a greater integration of society.6(p208) Despite these encouraging findings, there are early signs that the pandemic may disproportionately impact suicide rates among Black and other vulnerable populations in the United States, since they are more affected by the health and socioeconomic effects of COVID-19.7 There were significant racial differences in suicide mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic between Black and White populations in Maryland. Overall suicide mortality in Maryland declined by 16% between January 1 and July 7, 2020, compared to the equivalent 2017–2019 time frame, due to reduced suicide mortality for White residents by 24%, while Black residents experienced a 6% increase.7 To further understand the historic impact of pandemics on US suicide rates among the Black population, we have descriptively analyzed the effects of the Spanish flu pandemic by racial group as classified in the existing data. The Spanish flu pandemic killed 1%–2.7% of the world’s population and reduced US life expectancy by 13%, with 0.51% of the US population dying due to the disease.8,9 This analysis extends upon our previous research, which identified that overall US suicide rates actually reduced during the Spanish flu pandemic (1918–1920) compared with both the pre-pandemic (1909–1917) and post-pandemic periods (1921–1929).10 Despite experiencing much increased Spanish flu–related mortality11 and being more socioeconomically disadvantaged, declines in suicide rates were greater among the non-White (mostly Black) population than the White population (51% versus 23%) between 1918 and 1920 compared to the pre-pandemic period (1910–1917).12 US crude suicide rates reduced by 26% during the Spanish flu pandemic (1918–1920) compared to the pre-pandemic period (1910–1917) and increased by 10% in the post-pandemic period (1921–1928) compared to the pandemic period (Table 1 and Table 2).12 World War I occurred from 1914 to 1918, and the decline in US suicide rates from 1916 might have been related to greater social cohesion as the US prepared to enter the war (1917), with these low rates being extended by the social effects of the Spanish flu. Post-pandemic (1921–1928) US crude suicide rates increased for the White population by 10% and decreased by 2% for the non-White population (see Table 1 and Table 2).12 Despite their long history of significant social, political, and economic disadvantage related to discrimination and segregation, Blacks have consistently experienced less than half the suicide rate of the more advantaged White population since 1916.13,14 This discrepancy in suicide rates over the century since the Spanish flu has been described as the Black-White suicide paradox, because significant socioeconomic disadvantage and marginalization within a country usually predicts a higher suicide rate.13 Potential explanations for reduced Black suicide rates possibly relate to cultural protective factors, including a strong religious belief system, a collective social orientation, strong family and kinship bonds, communalism, affective expressiveness, present time orientation, and high levels of overall resilience.14 Durkheim would also have identified many of these sociocultural factors as protective of suicide, based on his theory of social integration being a crucial factor in reducing suicide rates.6 Durkheim found that Catholics had lower suicide rates compared with Protestants, which he hypothesized as being due to higher levels of social integration among Catholics.6 Perhaps when disasters occur such as the Spanish flu pandemic, Black communities with existing higher levels of social integration are more likely to “pull together,” resulting in increased suicide rate mitigation compared to relatively less socially integrated White populations. Furthermore, there may have been additional secular sociocultural changes in Black communities during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the concurrent Black Lives Matter movement. However, it remains possible that Black suicide rates may have been consistently underestimated due to higher rates of misclassification.13 Non-White population suicide rates may have been undercounted, particularly during the period of the Spanish flu pandemic, but results within the same racial group reveal internally consistent trends in suicide rates. Conclusion The Spanish flu period is an important historical data reference point for understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on US suicide rates. Suicide rates declined in both the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the Spanish flu pandemic. Based on Durkheim’s sociological theory of suicide,6 the pulling-together effect during a crisis may have been observed in the Spanish flu–related reductions in overall US suicide mortality. These suicide rate reductions were more prominent in the Black population and were largely maintained during the century after the post-pandemic period. While the early findings in Maryland are concerning, the social cohesiveness of Black communities might provide some protection against the markedly higher suicide rates that would otherwise be expected during the COVID-19 pandemic due to disadvantage and high mortality rates. The relatively low and stable suicide rates among the Black population over the century after the Spanish flu further suggest that Black communities might be resilient in the face of a possible post–COVID-19 economic recession. Given data quality concerns during the Spanish flu pandemic, these findings should be cautiously interpreted. Nevertheless, consistently low Black suicide rates and Black-White differences in suicide rates over the past century support the validity of the findings from the end of the pandemic. While Black communities might be more socially resilient, contemporaneous research is required to analyze the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on US suicide rates among vulnerable populations including by race/ethnicity, as disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by COVID-19–related health and economic impacts. Such research will help to guide effectively targeted policy decisions in relation to US suicide mitigation strategies. Research on social cohesion and welfare support measures is also needed to better understand their impacts on pandemic-induced suicide risk for vulnerable US communities. Received: August 2, 2021.

Second, Dr Andrade should have warned readers that Bacloville’s results are most questionable, lacking robustness. Although he cited us,3 he overlooked the evidence we provided indicating that the Bacloville article4 was published without acknowledging major changes to the initial protocol, affecting the primary outcome. Coincidentally (although as skeptics, we do not believe in coincidence), the initial statistical team was changed when data were sold to the French pharmaceutical company applying for the marketing authorization in France.

People Editorial Guidelines Published on November 16, 2021 05:17PM EST University of Michigan. Photo: Alika Jenner/Getty A massive flu outbreak at the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus has led to at least 528 cases in the last five weeks, drawing the attention of the Centers for Disease Control. The outbreak began in early October and ramped up in the last week — 313 of the 528 cases were found during the week of Nov. 8 with 37% of tests came back positive, an increase of 10% from the week prior, the school reported. In response to the sudden increase in cases, the Centers for Disease Control is sending a team of investigators to Michigan's campus this week to understand how the virus spread at the school and to study the effectiveness of this year's flu vaccine. The vast majority of people who tested positive for the flu at Michigan, 77%, did not get a flu shot this year. The school's health director, Lindsey Mortenson, said that the flu cases have been identified as influenza A (H3N2). Flu Season and the Delta Variant Are About to Meet — Here's How to Protect Yourself Washtenaw County health officials have been surprised by the size of the outbreak, they said Monday. "While we often start to see some flu activity now, the size of this outbreak is unusual," said Juan Luis Marquez, medical director at the Washtenaw County Health Department, in a statement on the school's website. "We're grateful for the additional support of the CDC and our ongoing partnership with the university as we look more closely at the situation." RELATED VIDEO: Here's What You Need to Know If You Get the Flu Marquez said that the Ann Arbor community is not necessarily at risk, but that getting the flu vaccine is vital, particularly with the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. "We strongly recommend anyone not yet vaccinated against seasonal flu to do so," he said. "And anyone at higher risk of severe flu complications should talk to their doctor about prescription antiviral medications at the first sign of flu symptoms." And health officials are concerned about what this outbreak could forewarn for flu activity across the U.S. as the season picks up. While last year's flu season was almost non-existent, it could pick up this year and cause a "twindemic" with COVID-19 still spreading. The best protections against the flu and COVID-19 are similar — getting vaccinated, washing hands frequently, avoiding large crowds and wearing a mask indoors. And it's not too late to get the flu shot, which "keeps their immune response boosted, so that when a flu season does finally come, they'll have some baseline immunity," Dr. Jennifer Lighter, an epidemiologist and pediatrician at NYU Langone, told PEOPLE.

(Provided by Kagoshima Prefecture) Japan has confirmed the highly pathogenic bird flu subtype H5N8 was detected at a poultry farm in the third outbreak of avian influenza in the country this winter, the agriculture ministry said on Tuesday. The outbreak was discovered on Monday at a farm with about 11,000 egg-laying chickens in Izumi City in Kagoshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, the ministry said in a statement on its website. It comes as several outbreaks of severe bird flu in Europe and Asia have been reported to the World Organization for Animal Health in recent days, in a sign the virus is spreading quickly again. "The NA subtype of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was identified and it was confirmed to be H5N8 subtype," the ministry said. The increase in the number of people around the world getting infected from bird flu this year is becoming a source of concern for epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization, compared with only five last year, it said, with six dead and many of the others critically ill. In February, Russia registered the first case of the H5N8 strain being passed to humans from birds and reported the matter to the WHO. There was no sign at the time of transmission between humans. Japan temporarily suspended exports of chicken meat and eggs from all regions earlier this month after reporting the first outbreak, though the ministry has said the consumption of those items, if infected, pose no risk to humans. Last winter, Japan had its worst season of winter flu on farms yet, with almost 10 million chickens culled and more than a third of the country’s prefectures affected. Japan has an egg-laying flock of around 181 million hens and a broiler population of 140 million, according to the ministry of agriculture. Anti-viral treatments can be effective against the bird flu but there is no vaccine for humans, according to the website of Britain’s National Health Service.

Researchers found that people who got their shingles vaccine and flu shot together were 5% less likely to return to get a flu shot in a subsequent year. They believe this could be because people were misinterpreting side effects of the shingles shot as being caused by the flu jab (file photo) The shingles vaccine, also called the zoster vaccine (pictured), is a two-dose jab for people over the age of 50. The doses are taken two to six months apartResearchers gathered data from the 2018 and 2019 flu season for the study, avoiding the pandemic period, where very few Americans received their yearly influenza jab.The team, who published their findings Friday in JAMA Network Open, gathered data from nearly 90,000 local residents who received both the flu and shingles, or zoster, vaccines in 2018. People aged 50 years or older are recommended to receive the two-dose shingles vaccine, with each shot coming two to six months apart.The side effects of the shot can be wide-ranging, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports it could affect someone's ability to perform routine tasks for two to three days.'Most people got a sore arm with mild or moderate pain after getting [the shot], and some also had redness and swelling where they got the shot. Some people felt tired, had muscle pain, a headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, or nausea,' the CDC writes. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next CDC advisory committee unanimously recommends booster shots... Nearly 10% of children aged five to 11 have received the... Share this article Share Many people who receive their shingles vaccine will receive their flu shot at the same time because doctors recommend it to them in an effort to save time and to increase vaccine coverage.Of the study population, more than 27,000 received both shots concurrently while 62,000 received both shots, but on separate occasions.A year later, the shingles shot regimen would have been completed, but people would be expected to come back in for their flu shot again.Researchers found that 91 percent of people who received their flu shot separately from the shingles vaccine in 2018 did return next flu season.However, those who received their shots together the next year were less likely to return with only 87 percent of recipients getting their flu shot in 2019.Researchers believe the potentially-intense side effects of the shingles vaccine may have turned some people off from the flu shot as well. Shingles is a condition that affects people who previously had chickenpox. It causes a person to break into a rash. It is rarely deadly. Pictured: A rash cause by shingles'One possible explanation is that some patients could have misattributed systemic side effects caused by the zoster vaccine to the influenza vaccine,' researchers wrote.'It may be preferable to administer these [two] vaccines separately or enhance patient counseling about expected vaccine side effects.'Another potential explanation is that people only received their flu shot because they were offered it when they went to get the shingles vaccine, and did not care for the routine vaccine anymore once they had already received the shingles shot.Shingles is a virus that can effect people who had chickenpox in their youth.While the exact cause of the condition is not known, the virus will reactivate in a person's body and cause them to break out into a rash.Risk of death from shingles is very low, but it can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems.

Sign Up NEWS November 19, 2021 What Nurses Should Know About Flu Season 2021 Written by: Kathleen Gaines MSN, RN, BA, CBC As the country continues to battle COVID-19, another deadly respiratory illness is starting to emerge. Influenza. Much forgotten last year because of the ongoing pandemic, kids remaining home from school, most still working from home, and the world more or less remaining shut down - flu season has officially begun and the American Nurses Association (ANA) does not want it to be forgotten. In September, the ANA in collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur, the global vaccines division of Sanofi, and actress Jennifer Grey launched the Flu Shot Fridays national flu vaccination campaign. According to the press release, the campaign was designed to encourage everyone six months and older focusing specifically on adults 50 years of age and older as well as people living with chronic health conditions to get their annual flu vaccine. “The flu vaccine is one of our best defenses to prevent transmission of influenza this fall,” said ANA President Ernest J. Grant, Ph.D., RN, FAAN. “Getting the flu vaccine is especially critical for people with compromised immune systems, as the flu can lead to hospitalization and even death.

Sign Up 2021-2022 Available Flu Vaccines There are numerous flu vaccines available to the general public, all of which are covered by private and public insurance. Those without insurance can often get a low-cost or even no-cost flu vaccine at major pharmacies. The availability of specific types will vary based on location and population needs. The CDC recommends that all individuals over 6 months of age receive their annual flu vaccine by the end of October. The four most common flu shots this year are: Standard dose flu shots. An inactivated influenza vaccine is given via intramuscular injection. High-dose shots for people 65 years and older. Shots made with flu virus grown in cell culture. No eggs are involved in the production of this vaccine. Live attenuated influenza vaccine. A vaccine made with an attenuated live virus that is given by a nasal spray vaccine. The CDC has a complete breakdown of all the flu vaccinations available in the United States for the 2021-2022 flu season. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the quadrivalent formula for the egg-based influenza vaccine contains the following: an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Washington/02/2019- like virus (B/Victoria lineage); a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage). According to the FDA, the quadrivalent formula for the cell or recombinant based influenza vaccine contains the following: an A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Washington/02/2019- like virus (B/Victoria lineage); a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage). According to the FDA, the trivalent influenza vaccine contains the following: A(H1N1) pdm09, A(H3N2) B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria lineage) There are very few contraindications for the standard dose flu vaccine but it is important to speak to your doctor if you have any questions. The live attenuated nasal spray vaccine is contraindicated in the following populations according to the CDC: Adults age 50 or older Children 2 years through 17 years of age who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications. Children 2 years through 4 years who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months. Children younger than 2 People who are immunocompromised (ex. Cancer patients or individuals living with HIV/AIDS) People who care for severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment People who have taken influenza antiviral drugs within the previous 48 hours such as Tamiflu. Pregnant women The high-dose flu vaccine is specifically designed for people 65 years and older as it is intended to give older individuals a better immune response which will give better protection against the flu. The vaccine contains four times the antigen of a standard dose flu vaccine. It’s important to note that the flu vaccine will NOT prevent COVID-19 or decrease the symptoms associated with COVID-19. Additionally, getting the flu vaccine will not cause COVID-19 or increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. Initially, it was recommended that individuals that receive the COVID vaccine don’t receive the flu vaccine on the same day; however, new studies published by the CDC state that the COVID vaccine may be administered without regard to the timing of other vaccines. Flu Shot Fridays Flu Shot Friday’s is a PSA, digital and social media posts along with media interviews by Grey as well as ANA President Grant. The campaign is hoping the added star power of Grey, most notably known for her roles in Dirty Dancing and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, will encourage the public to get their flu vaccine, especially those at increased risk. “Everyone remembers the kid who was made into some sort of hero for skipping school, but why? I mean, taking ‘me time’ is great, but there are ways to make it a bit more meaningful,” Grey says in the opening of the TV spot. “So what are you waiting for? Don’t risk sick days stuck in bed with the flu. Get your flu shot and take some time for yourself,” she adds later. The website has excellent, easy to read and understand information about the flu shot and flu season while highlighting the importance of becoming vaccinated. Key information relayed include: According to a 10-year study of 1,227 adults aged 40+ found that a first heart attack is approximately 10 times more likely following a flu infection. The 10-year study also examined 762 adults aged 40+ and showed an approximately 8 times increase in the likelihood of a first stroke following a flu infection. An estimated 77% of flu-related hospitalizations in 2018 and 2019 were for adults 50+. Even when well-managed, people with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational) are at an increased risk of serious flu-related complications, which can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death. The flu can worsen symptoms for people living with lung diseases, such as COPD, asthma, or cystic fibrosis, and may lead to pneumonia. Flu Shot Fridays website also has an easy-to-use flu vaccine locator. Individuals can simply click on the link, input their zip code and how far they are willing to travel as well as the type of flu shot desired, and a list of options will populate. It is even possible to make an appointment online directly from the linked website!

The response is being led locally by Lancashire County Council, Fylde Borough Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Animal and Plant Health Agency and the UKHSA (UK Health Security Agency). A 3km and 10km Temporary Control Zone has been declared around the premises. Temporary road signs will make people aware as they arrive and leave the zone. The control zone restricts access to locations where birds are kept and puts restrictions on the movement of birds. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, Director of Public Health and Wellbeing for Lancashire County Council, said: “I want to reassure residents that the risk to public health from avian flu is very low. “However, it is important that people do not pick up any sick or dead birds to avoid spreading the virus, which can affect humans in rare cases. “If you do find any dead swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds while out and about, please report them to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. “I would also urge bird keepers to be vigilant for any signs of disease and report any suspected cases to their nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency office.” People in direct contact with the premises have been contacted and offered appropriate preventative treatment. Avian Influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public’s health is very low. However, anyone who is concerned should call NHS 111 or speak to their GP.

We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease and any birds at risk of infection will now be humanely culled. “UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that the risk to public health is low and the Food Standards Agency has said that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. “We have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across Great Britain, so whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, it’s vital that all bird keepers take action to introduce higher biosecurity standards on their farm or small holdings.” You can find the area covered by the zone on the Defra website.
