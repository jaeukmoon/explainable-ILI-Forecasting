podcast Home Infectious disease topics Influenza in humans Influenza in humans Influenza, also known as flu, is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It occurs globally and affects an estimated 5-10% of adults and 20-30% of children annually. Influenza viruses are categorised into types A, B, C, and D, with types A and B being the most significant in terms of human disease. Influenza C is less common and typically causes milder respiratory infections than influenza A and B, while influenza D is known to exclusively infect animals (mainly cattle) so far. Seasonal influenza refers to the flu viruses that circulate annually, mainly during the winter months. There are two subtypes of influenza A viruses that are currently circulating among humans during the annual influenza epidemics (A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09) and two influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata); B/Yamagata-lineage viruses however have not been detected since 2020. Seasonal influenza is a vaccine-preventable disease. Zoonotic influenza viruses - such as avian (bird) flu and swine (pig) flu - are those that originate in animals and can, on occasion, cross over to infect humans. These instances are rare but can lead to severe disease and have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus gains the ability to spread easily from person to person. Transmission, symptoms and severity Influenza viruses spread primarily through droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can pass the mouths or noses of people who are nearby and possibly be inhaled into the airways. A person might also get the flu by touching a surface or object with the flu virus on it and then touching the mouth, the nose, or possibly the eyes. Influenza symptoms can vary, ranging from none to mild, moderate, or severe. Common symptoms include a high temperature, cough, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, muscle pain, headaches, and general fatigue. Severe outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalisation or death, especially in high-risk groups like the elderly, very young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic health conditions. Types of influenza Seasonal influenza Seasonal influenza is a preventable infectious disease with mostly respiratory symptoms. It is caused by influenza virus and is easily transmitted, predominantly via the droplet and contact routes and by indirect spread from respiratory secretions on hands etc. Read more Avian influenza Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low. Read more Pandemic influenza A pandemic is the rapid spread of a new human influenza around the world. Influenza pandemics happen when a new strain of a flu virus appears which can infect humans, to which most people have no immunity and which can transmit efficiently from human to human. Read more Swine influenza in humans Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly cause outbreaks of influenza in pigs. Influenza viruses that commonly circulate in swine are called “swine influenza viruses” or “swine flu viruses.” Like human influenza viruses, there are different subtypes and strains of swine influenza viruses.

Search Search Home News PAHO and countries of the Americas seek to establish an intersectoral commission to prevent and control avian influenza PAHO and countries of the Americas seek to establish an intersectoral commission to prevent and control avian influenza Copied to clipboard 14 Mar 2024 PAHO/Magno Marconi Pereira Credit Río de Janeiro, Brazil, 14 March 2024 (PAHO) – In order to strengthen surveillance, prevention and control of avian influenza in both animals and humans, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) convened its 35 member states in Brazil this week to establish a regional commission to combat the disease. The meeting took place at a time when the world is experiencing high levels of transmission of the virus among birds and mammals, which poses a potential risk to public health.Participants agreed on the need to create an intersectoral commission to strengthen detection, prevention and response to zoonotic influenza. "It is essential to promote this commission under the “One Health” approach to comprehensively address zoonoses," said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, Director of PAHO's Department of Prevention, Control and Elimination of Communicable Diseases.The Inter-sectoral Commission for the Prevention and Control of Avian Influenza in the Americas will enable public, animal and environmental health sectors to exchange updated information on surveillance, epidemiological risk and evolution of circulating viruses. The commission is also expected to promote strategies at the national, sub-regional and regional levels and strengthen coordination.PAHO’s Health Emergency Department and the Pan American Center for Foot and Mouth Disease and Veterinary Public Health (PANAFTOSA) led the March 12-14 meeting to discuss the Commission's objectives, structure and operation."One Health" is an approach that fosters intersectoral collaboration to prevent zoonotic and vector-borne diseases by mobilizing diverse stakeholders such as veterinarians, physicians, epidemiologists and community leaders.It is estimated that 75% of emerging human infectious diseases originate in animals. Since 2020, a variant of avian influenza virus subtype A(H5N1) has caused deaths in wild birds and poultry in multiple countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and, in 2022, spread to Central and South America.In January 2023, the first case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) was reported in Latin America, and since then, several countries in the region have confirmed cases in both birds and humans. So far, human cases of avian influenza have been sporadic, and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been identified."It is crucial that countries continue to strengthen early detection and containment of any event or outbreak at the human-animal interface," Dr. Ciro Ugarte, Director of PAHO's Department of Health Emergencies, said. "The various sectors involved must collaborate on both surveillance and response.” Credit: PAHO/Magno Marconi Pereira The new Commission will comprise specialists in the areas of seasonal influenza, zoonosis, pandemics, epidemiology and laboratory from ministries of health in the Americas. It will also include veterinary officials, representatives of the environmental sector, and collaborating centers, with PAHO acting as secretariat.According to Ottorino Cosivi, Director of PANAFTOSA, the Commission "will act as a catalyst for regional work to address avian influenza." Cosivi highlighted the effectiveness of other regional mechanisms coordinated by PAHO, such as REDIPRA, which facilitates intersectoral collaboration in the fight against rabies in the Americas and has contributed significantly towards the elimination of this disease in the region. Credit: PAHO/Ana Peralta Also participating in the meeting this week were representatives of several organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), the International Regional Organization for Plant and Animal Health (OIRSA), the Caribbean Animal Health Network (CaribVET), the Executive Secretariat of the Council of Ministers of Health of Central America and the Dominican Republic (SE-COMISCA), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and WHO collaborating centers for human and animal influenza.

Search Inicio » News » Wildlife under threat as avian influenza reaches Antarctica Statements Wildlife under threat as avian influenza reaches Antarctica Published on 13 March 2024 Share: The page link has been copied to your clipboard View more The ongoing spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has now reached an unprecedented milestone with reports of its recent detection on Antarctica’s mainland. Originally surfacing in Europe in 2021, the virus has traversed continents, reaching North America in the same year and South America by 2022. Most recently, it has extended its reach to Antarctic islands in 2023. However, the gravity of the situation intensifies as it infiltrates the northern tip of Antarctica’s mainland, as reported through the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). The discovery came through the identification of the virus in a South Polar skua collected by Argentinian scientists near Argentina’s Antarctic research base, Primavera. Skuas, large seabirds breeding in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic zones, pose a concerning vector as they migrate farther north when not breeding. Once considered primarily a threat to poultry, HPAI has ushered in a “new normal” whereby HPAI is moving from wild birds to wild mammals with impacts beyond anything previously seen. Estimates vary, but at the latest count, there have been 485 species from over 25 avian orders affected and 37 new mammal species infected since 2021. Only Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand remain free of the disease, but the situation is changing rapidly.HPAI outbreaks have resulted in marked declines in wildlife populations, including marine mammals in South America. Despite the challenges, there are strategies to better protect wildlife in the short and long term. These include preventing further spillover events to and from poultry through improved biosecurity, implementing improved surveillance systems to both inform virus epidemiology and benefit wildlife, and responding to outbreaks in wildlife using a coordinated, interagency-multisectoral approach. For example, WOAH’s Working Group on Wildlife has produced new guidelines on the emergency vaccination of wild birds of high conservation importance against HPAI and the management of HPAI in marine mammals. The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis. WOAH encourages Members to quickly and thoroughly respond to outbreaks of HPAI in wildlife, emphasising the incorporation of wildlife health into animal health surveillance, reporting, preparedness, and response systems. These efforts require not merely viewing wildlife as a potential risk to production animal and human health, but as beings warranting protection in their own right. WOAH underscores the importance of robust interagency coordination and inclusion of diverse expertise to ensure transparency, equity and mutual benefit of decisions.

Acute viral infections in early life are a major source of such adversity and have been associated with a broad spectrum of later-life effects outside the immune system or “off-target”. These include an altered hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and metabolic reactions. Here, we used a murine post-natal day 14 (PND 14) Influenza A (H1N1) infection model and applied a semi-holistic approach including phenotypic measurements, gene expression arrays and diffusion neuroimaging techniques to investigate HPA axis dysregulation, energy metabolism and brain connectivity. By PND 56 the H1N1 infection had been resolved, and there was no residual gene expression signature of immune cell infiltration into the liver, adrenal gland or brain tissues examined nor of immune-related signalling. A resolved early-life H1N1 infection had sex-specific effects. We observed retarded growth of males and altered pre-stress (baseline) blood glucose and corticosterone levels at PND42 after the infection was resolved. Cerebral MRI scans identified reduced connectivity in the cortex, midbrain and cerebellum that were accompanied by tissue-specific gene expression signatures. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that these were tissue-specific changes with few common pathways. Early-life infection independently affected each of the systems and this was independent of HPA axis or immune perturbations.

While there are no clearly defined age boundaries for this early life period, the “first 1000 days of life” (from conception to about 2 years of age) are commonly thought to encompass this period of vulnerability1. Although initially covering the direct effects of the early life period, this developmental origins of health and disease theory has been refined and it is thought that such exposure renders the individual more vulnerable to the deleterious stimuli and ultimately contribute to the onset of chronic non-communicable pathologies, such as diabetes, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases, as well as mental disorders2,3,4. This is the “three-hit model” where the largely unchangeable genome is the “first hit”, the early life exposure is the “second hit”, and then the disease risk is crystallized when a third environmental hit is encountered later in life.ELA comes in many forms, such as the exposure to environmental toxins, the lifestyle and social implications of a low socio-economic status (SES), the stressful environment of a dysfunctional household or the deeply embedded trauma of childhood abuse5. While several health outcomes in children (e.g. fetal growth restrictions, preterm birth, or fetal alcohol syndrome) are clearly re-traceable to specific, identifiable, adverse conditions or risk behaviors during pregnancy6,7,8, assessing the impact of diverse postnatal environmental and social exposures is far more diverse and harder to dissect as the adversity experienced is rarely due to a single event, but rather the sum of many diverse individual elements. This is particularly true for the most studied human model of postnatal adversity: the institutionalization-adoption paradigm9. Here, the adversity includes separation from the mother combined with the decreased care and human bonding, exposure to an increased microbial, infectious or antigenic load as well as possible malnourishment10,11,12. In this paradigm, these stimuli coalesce and are implicated in improper development of the HPA axis13,14, impaired brain maturation15,16, and an accelerated ageing of the immune system17,18,19,20,21.Early-life infections (ELI) are an essential element of the overall ELA burden. ELI poses both an immediate risk from the infection itself, as well as long term consequences including altered development 22,23, increased risk of childhood asthma or allergies24,25 developement of type 1 diabetes26, as well as inducing changes in cytokine production and stress reactivity lifelong27. The relatively high permeability of the blood–brain barrier in early life means that high peripheral cytokine levels (e.g. interleukin 1β [IL-1β], IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor α [TNFα]) can cross the barrier and potentially cause long-term memory impairments. Increased exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection together with the higher overall risk of childhood infections due to the institutionalisation21,28 has been associated with accelerated immune ageing and immunosenescence20,21,29. One important observation was that the age of first infection is a crucial factor in the later life immune competence30 and may affect all other consequences of ELI as well.As ELA and ELI are major risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of many stress-related disorders2,3,4, it was long assumed that both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis stress systems were central to the underlying mechanism31,32. Indeed, there is a large body of evidence connecting physical stress (e.g. malnutrition, infection) with a series of outcomes including HPA axis dysregulation, impaired immune activation and brain development33,34,35,36. However, data from our EpiPath cohort suggests that peripheral tissues are independently programmed by the early life environment and the long-term changes observed do not depend on an altered HPA axis21,28,37,38. This suggests that the mechanism linking ELA to the overall phenotype is somewhat more complicated than a simple dependence upon an altered HPA axis. Re-examining all the available literature led us to propose the “stem cell hypothesis of ELA pathogenesis”, where we suggested that ELA affects tissue-resident stem/progenitor cells in each tissue independently, and these then go on to differentiate into functionally impaired cells in lifelong39. The direct consequence of this is that we now think that ELA may have direct effects on many tissues, and the changes seen in HPA axis are one such outcome, rather than the supposed central controlling mechanism.Here we have taken ELI, one element of the multipartite human ELA exposure. Using a murine ELI model we investigated the long-term impact of a such an infection later in life in tissues outside the immune systems that are known to be affected by ELA. We investigated the role of ELI on all aspects of the ELA phenotype including the development of the HPA axis function, hepatic glucose production, as well as brain connectivity and tissue-specific gene expression profiles.ResultsThe litters of 24 pregnant dams were randomly divided into two groups (12 each) and exposed to ELI treatment of either influenza-A-virus (IAV) dissolved in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS as control (Fig. 1A). We registered a slight litter-size effect for animals assigned to the control group (mean litter size 5.17 ± 2.82 SD) vs. the IAV treatment group (mean litter size 6.92 ± 1.83 SD). However, since litters were randomly assigned to a treatment before birth, this appears to be a coincidence. In total, we had a population of 153 mice exposed to ELI (control: n = 64, 32 females; IAV: n = 89, 46 females), of which 9 animals (4 females) did not survive the PND14 IAV infection.Figure 1(A) Study outline: pups, born in-house, were subjected to early life infection (H1N1 or PBS) on post-natal day 14 (PND14). On PND42 all animals were subjected to an acute stress test in the form of restrained stress. Given ample time to recover from the stress test, mice were handled and mock-inoculated on PND56, approximately five days before being sacrificed on PND60/61.

C) Body weight development over time between different PND14 treatments for males and D) females. Boxplots display the distribution of data with the median and the inter quartile range (IQR), where individual animals are represented as points. Treatments are represented in colors (control = green; IAV = orange). P-values (*p > 0.05; **p > 0.01; ***p > 0.001; ****p > 0.0001) represent comparisons between treatments for each individual day.Full size imageEarly life H1N1 infection phenotypeBody weights were measured between PND14-PND28 and PND56-PND60 ± 1. As expected, body weight significantly increased in both groups (control and IAV infected mice) over time, regardless of sex (ANCOVA, Bonferroni corrected; PND14-PND60; p < 0.001 for control mice and p < 0.001 for IAV infected mice). Throughout the experiment, the controls always weighed more than the IAV-infected mice. Post-hoc analysis also showed a significant effect of sex on body weight starting around PND18-PND19. We performed a two-way ANCOVA examining the effects of sex and PND14 treatment on body weight over time. Regardless of time, both sex (F(1, 1823) = 303.8, p < 0.001) and PND14 treatment (F(1, 1823) = 223.0, p < 0.001) were statistically significant factors determining body weight. There was also a significant interaction between PND14 treatment and sex (F(1, 1823) = 22.1, p < 0.001), indicating that sex had a direct impact on PND14 treatment. Consequently, we used Estimated Marginal Means over the complete experimental period (PND14-60) for pairwise comparisons for both sex and PND14 treatment and applied a Bonferroni correction. We observed that the PND14 treatment affected the males (p < 0.001) much more strongly than the females (p < 0.001 ) (Fig. 1B). Based on these results, sexes were separately treated in all subsequent analyses.Examining each time point independently, there was a trend that, prior to infection, pups in the PND14 IAV treatment group were lighter than those in the control group (8.79g ± 1.07 SD vs 9.27g ± 0.99SD; p > 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-Test ), which becomes significant at PND18 (p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). This initial difference at PND15-18 was most probably due to the differences in litter size rather than to a direct result of treatment, with a tendency towards fewer, bigger, pups in the control group. The weight difference reached a peak at PND22 (IAV vs control; p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test), which period corresponds to 7–8 days after infection where IAV-sickness symptoms are the most acute (data not shown). While the IAV-infected females recovered their body weight by PND56-60 (p > 0.05; Mann–Whitney U-test), the males remained lighter than the controls (Fig. 1C,D; p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test).By PND60, all visible signs of IAV infection (abdominal breathing, hunched posture or decreased mobility) were resolved. IAV clearance from the lungs was confirmed by qPCR (Supplementary Data 1). There was no detectable viral amplification at PND60 within 40 PCR cycles in the PND14 IAV-infected animals. Cytokine levels were measured in blood and bronco alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We did not find detectable levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6 or IL-10 in the blood of randomly-tested animals (n = 10) confirming the resolution of the infection. Since IAV is a respiratory virus, we also measured IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ levels in the BALF of randomly-selected animals (n = 28). Very low levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured in IAV infected animals whereas INF-γ was not detected in any of our samples. Although levels of TNF-α were overall low, they were higher in the IAV-infected mice (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.005, n = 28: IAV median = 3.22 pg/mL; control median = 0 pg/mL; Fig. 2A). Levels of IL-6 in the IA-infected (median = 0.46 pg/mL) animals were similar to those in the control mice (median = 0.27 pg/mL; Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.333, n = 28; Fig. 2B). Furthermore, there was no significant sex difference for IL-6 (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.332, n = 28) or TNF-α (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 1.00, n = 28) in BALF.Figure 2Cytokine levels at PND60. We measured IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, in the blood and IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The only detectable cytokines were TNF-α and IL-6 (Fig. 2A and B respectively) Overall cytokine levels were very low (< 16 pg/mL, however differences were significant for TNF-α between IAV and control. We found no sex-specificity in cytokine levels. Boxplots display the distribution of data with the median and the inter quartile range (IQR), where individual animals are represented as points. Treatments are represented in colors (control = grey; IAV = unfilled). All animals only received PBS at PND56. Animals receiving IAV at PND56 were used as controls to ensure that assays worked and non-detection of BALF cytokines was not due to experimental error.Full size imageAcute stress glucose and corticosterone responseThe restraint-stress-induced glucose and corticosterone release was assessed on PND42. As we had already observed a sex-specific effect for body weight, we used a two-way ANOVA to evaluate the effect of sex on treatment, confirming that sex has the biggest effect on glucose levels (p < 0.001) and an interaction effect with treatment (sex*PND14 treatment; p < 0.001). Consequently, we analyzed female and male glucose levels separately. We observed a clear effect of treatment on glucose levels prior to stress onset in the females (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.01; n = 53; Fig. 3A) between the control group (median = 118, IQR = 113–129.5, n = 31) and the IAV-infected mice (median = 136.5, IQR = 124.5–138.8, n = 22) with approximately 15% higher levels in median glucose. Interestingly, in males, we found pre-stress glucose levels to be slightly lower in the IAV-infected mice (median = 149, IQR = 137–155, n = 25) compared to the controls (median = 154, IQR = 144–160, n = 29); however, this was not significant (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.081; n = 54; Fig. 3A). Restraint stress induced a rise in blood glucose levels in all groups (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; all p < 0.001; Fig. 3B). The increase in glucose was calculated as delta (post—pre-stress) and visualized with contrasting results for both sexes. In females, the control group (median = 46.0, IQR = 35.5–63, n = 31) showed a greater rise (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05; n = 53; Fig. 3B) than the IAV-infected mice (median = 33.5, IQR = 6.75–30.77, n = 22), whereas for males the results were inverse. The IAV-infected males (median = 46.0, IQR = 39–62, n = 25) had a higher rise (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05; n = 54; Fig. 3B) than the control group (median = 37, IQR = 26–50, n = 29).Figure 3Changes in blood glucose and corticosterone in response to acute stress performed at PND42. (A) Pre-stress levels of blood glucose (mg/dL) for females and males on PND42, separated by PND14 treatment group. (B) Rise in glucose during stress test (pre- to post-restraint).

All boxplots display the distribution of data with the median and the inter quartile range (IQR). Whiskers show the minimum and maximum as 1.5*IQR. Individual animals are visualized by shapes.Full size imageCORT was measured in the plasma collected at the beginning and end of the PND42 restraint stress for a randomly-selected subset of 7–11 animals per treatment and sex. In males, the pre-stress (baseline) levels of CORT were significantly higher in the control group (median = 52.2, IQR = 46.5–69.3, n = 7, Fig. 3C) than in the IAV-infected males (median = 24.8, IQR = 17.6–39.0, n = 11) prior to stress (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.001, test stat = 4.23; n = 18; Fig. 3B). This trend was not visible in females (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.8, n = 18; control: median = 42.61, IQR = 25.9–93, n = 9; IAV: median = 37.68, IQR = 30.4–49.4, n = 9; Fig. 3C). As expected, corticosterone levels rose significantly during the restraint stress (Wilcoxon signed rank test; all p < 0.05; Fig. 3D), with an overall stronger effect in females. However, there was no notable difference in the stress-induced rise in CORT levels (T1-T0) when comparing between the PND14 treatment groups in females (Fig. 3D). In males, we observed the expected stress-induced increase in CORT levels (Mann–Whitney U test; p = 0.069, n = 18; Fig. 3D) for both PND14 treatment groups, with a larger rise in CORT levels for mice infected with IAV at PND14 (median = 455, IQR = 390–554, n = 11) than in the control group (median = 345, IQR = 297–398, n = 7).Brain MRIGiven the overwhelming literature on ELA in connection to structural changes in the brain, as well as behavioral and mental health outcomes40,41,42, we integrated neuroimaging data into our semi-holistic model. At PND19, we carried out FSE3D and SE-DTI to obtain high-resolution anatomy images and maps of diffusion of water molecules within the brain. We randomly picked 13 female animals from four litters (control = 6; H1N1 n = 7). Imaging was carried out ex vivo and using the mouse brain atlas (3D Brain Atlas, Invicro's VivoQuant™), 14 sub-regions were identified and mapped (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 2). Total volume (in voxels), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were assessed.Figure 4MRI schematic representation. A small group of mice at PND19 were sacrificed by decapitation and their entire heads were placed in tubes containing a cold solution of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 8 mM Gadolium (Dotarem 0.5 mmol/ml, Guerbet). The tubes were then left at 4 °C for 6–12 weeks for the contrast agent to fully diffuse and stabilize in tissue prior to ex-vivo imaging. We carried out FSE3D and SE-DTI to obtain high-resolution anatomy images and maps of diffusion of water molecules within the brain. Boxplots of measurements and representative slice with ADC/FA overlay, focusing on the Hypothalamus region (above). Volume axes indicate dimensions in log10(voxels); ADCs are mapped in units of 10–5 mm2/s; FA units reach from 0 to 1.Full size imageThere were no significant differences in the volume of the different regions between treatments, in contrast to the significant differences in body weight measured at PND19. Furthermore, we did not detect significant differences in the ADC, the relative measure of the diffusion of water, between the treatments groups either. Interestingly, the FA values were overall lower in the IAV-infected mice, possibly reflecting a reduced connectivity within different brain regions for this group. These changes proved to be significant in the hypothalamus (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05; Supplementary Data 2) and midbrain (Mann–Whitney U test; p < 0.05; Fig. 5), and also quite notable in the cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus (Mann–Whitney U test; all p ≥ 0.1; Fig. 5 and Supplemetary Data 2).Figure 5Brain MRI results; data were obtained from PND19. Boxplots of morphology and diffusion-related measurements. Volume axes indicate dimensions in log10(voxels); ADCs are mapped in units of 10–5 mm2/s; FA units reach from 0 to 1.Full size imageGlobal gene expression analysisGiven the plethora of long-term non-immune effects of early-life infection, we compared gene expression in females between early-life treatments (control n = 5, IAV infected n = 5) in five different tissues. Liver and adrenal gland were chosen for their role in the altered glucose and corticosterone response to the restraint stressor which we applied, and the sub-cortical region, cerebellum and brainstem were chosen for the differences in FA. To ensure that these differences in gene expression were not due to immune cell infiltration into the selected tissues, we applied consICA method. Our deconvolution of the data set into 20 independent components resulted in only tissue-specific processes (e.g. xenobiotic metabolic process for liver, p.adj. = 7 × 10−25; regulation of synaptic plasticity for the cerebellum, p.adj. = 3 × 10–8) and did not detect any immune or immune-related signal (Supplementary Data 3). This suggests an absence of significant effects of the treatment on immune response, or residual differences in infiltrating immune cells in the considered organs.To accurately report gene expression without using p-value cut-offs, we calculated an expression-specific score (using a combination of p.adj and log2 fold-change; see methods) and compared the top 20 scoring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for every organ (3 displayed in Fig. 6A). Using this approach, we could not find any DEGs shared between different organs (Fig. 6B), so we then compared all genes with an expression specific score ≥ 0.5 for every organ in a Venn-Diagram. We found almost no DEGs shared between tissues, except 2 DEGs (Nol3, G530012D18Rik) shared between brainstem and liver, and 5 DEGs (Gm10717, Gm10721, Gm10715, Gm11168, Gm17535) shared between liver and sub-cortical region (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, all of the 5 DEGs shared between the liver and sub-cortical region belong to a gene tree family of repetitive elements clustered on chromosome 9 (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Differential expression analysis at PND60. (A) Heatmaps plotted for the top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatments for the adrenal gland, liver and subcortical region. Data represent the mean value of five independent animals. (B) Venn Diagram of DEG shared between different organs. (C) Genes clustered on chromosome 9, viewed in UCSC Genome Browser. (D) KEGG pathways activated in the tested tissues: left (red-blue) heatmap shows the normalized enrichment score (NES), with red representing values higher in H1N1 compared to Saline; right (green-yellow) heatmap highlights significance of the enrichment (−log10(p.adj.)).Full size imageGiven the paucity of DEGs seen at PND60 (Fig. 6D), we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to test for significantly-enriched pathways and whether those are shared between tissues. Concentrating on the KEGG pathway databases, we found several pathways significantly impacted by early-life treatment and several of those were shared between tissues. The three most affected pathways were drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 (p.adj. = 1.06 × 10–7 for sub-cortical region and p.adj. = 1.41 × 10–5 for brainstem), complement and coagulation cascades (p.adj. = 1.06 × 10–7 for sub-cortical region and p.adj. = 1.41 × 10–5 for brainstem) and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome 450 (p.adj. = 1.06 × 10–7 for sub-cortical region and p.adj. = 7.01 × 10–5 for brainstem). However, we found only one highly significant pathway for the cerebellum (Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, p.adj. = 5.26 × 10–9), which was not shared with any other tissue and is therefore not part of the heatmap (Fig. 6D).DiscussionEarly life infections have been associated with a broad spectrum of later life effects, often associated with altered stress, endocrine or immune reactions. In this study, using a semi-holistic approach we were able to show long-term sexually dimorphic effects on multiple “non-immune” or “off-target” systems. A resolved early-life viral infection subsequently retarded the growth of males, increased baseline (pre-stress) blood glucose levels in females and lowered them in males, and reduced baseline corticosterone levels, although stress-induced changes remained unaffected. These changes were accompanied by significantly decreased in connectivity in the cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus, regions associated with the stress response, and specific gene expression signatures throughout the different tissues examined. This series of highly tissue-specific gene expression signatures that do not share common pathways provides clear confirmation of our previous human observational data, confirming that the ELA has independently affected each of the systems.The first system we studied was the brain. ELA, in the form of psychosocial stress, has long been associated with aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns and eventually disease43, with recent studies identifying changes in behavior, emotion and attention, and reward-learning that were thought to be induced by changes in connectivity44,45,46. Here, we were able to show a significant reduction of connectivity in various parts of the brain, measured by fractional anisotropy after an ELI. We then used the MR imaging to select brain regions for gene expression profiling. Our microarray data identified two pathways in the brain: Nrf2, and cytochrome P450. The nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway regulates the cellular antioxidant defense47 in response to viral-replication induced oxidative stress while replicating48,49,50, and its’ long-term downregulation has been associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases51,52. The downregulated Cytochrome P450 pathway enzymes are mainly active in liver metabolism, they have also been shown to be involved in brain micro-metabolism53,54. Interestingly, several cytochrome enzymes (e.g. Cyp2d6, Cyp1a2, Cyp19, Cyp46) are downregulated Parkinson’s disease [Reviewed in55] and inflammation of central nervous system tissues53. As we detected a similar downregulation of this pathway and reduced connectivity in movement-associated brain regions after our early-life respiratory infection, it is interesting to draw parallels with the similar movement disturbances and both Nrf and Cyp450 pathways seen in disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease52,56,57. Leading into the second system of interest, the hypothalamus, a key player of the HPA-axis, was also affected by viral infection both in our data and in previous reports36,58. As our model is a respiratory infection, this suggests a bi-directionality of the HPA-immune axis, with a peripheral IAV infection signaling to the brain59,60,61.The HPA axis and adrenal steroid hormones such as GCs are essential regulators of the immune response suppressing inflammation. While lower adult GC levels and a blunted CORT response to stress have repeatedly been associated with early life stress28,62, a short term increase of GCs is tightly associated with viral infections and inflammation63. We hypothesized that hypercortisolemia would have a similar long-term effect early when induced by an early-life infection. We did not observe a decreased CORT stress response later in life, and baseline CORT levels were either equal or lower in ELI mice compared to control. However, an excess of GC leads to immunosuppression, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, hypertension and depression64 that concords with the general ELA phenotype37,65. This agrees with our findings of baseline higher blood glucose levels and higher activity of steroidogenesis pathways in the liver and adrenal gland in females after ELI. While acute IAV infection has already been associated with a dysregulation in the host glucose metabolism66,67,68,69, recent studies have identified a direct link between IAV infection and the insulin signaling pathway70, and the differentiation of white and brown adipocytes71, leading to long-term changes in energy metabolism. Similar to Ayari et al., we also found that several pathways associated with energy metabolism and oxidative stress were altered, several weeks after infection. Furthermore, we saw an increase in the activity of the insulin signaling pathway, as well as decreased PPAR signaling, both involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, and neuro-inflammation72,73,74. We have recently shown that there is ample evidence that ELA can result in perturbed energy metabolism and hypothesized that it can fundamentally alter gluconeogenesis and therefore increase the risk of developing metabolic disorders75. As such, we were particularly interested in the stress-induced glucose rise. This is a secondary readout from the stress-system that may either be under control of the HPA axis hormones, or under under vagal control75,76,77,78,79. This has been one previous report that neurons within the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve are able to actively decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis, as well as modulate the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, and glucose production77. However, we were not able to identify any changes in these brain regions in our MRI connectivity data and expression data was not collected here.Our study has several limitations. We chose a mouse-adapted influenza virus because it is cleared primarily by the innate immune system. At PND14 the mouse adaptive immune system, required for clearing the majority of viruses is not fully developed. As such, we can probably extrapolate our results to the naïve human immune system in the early post-natal period, however, extrapolation to other viral infections such as CMV generally occurring later in life will be difficult. Similarly, our simplified infection model of ELA has only one element of the multipartite human ELA exposure and does not represent the full extent of the human clinical situation80,81,82. Nevertheless, simplifying the exposure to a viral infection that was cleared by the innate immune system allowed us to clearly show that many tissues were transcriptionally programmed independently. Furthermore, we were able to clearly state that there was no residual signature of immune infiltration or signalling after the infection was cleared. This agrees with undetectable levels of IL-2, -6, -10 and IFNγ in the BALF, although residual very low levels of TNFα around the lower limit of detection were observed. The results from this simplified early-life exposure model are in line with our recent “stem cell” hypothesis39. The challenge is now to combine this ELI with other elements of the three-hit DOHaD model, incorporating for example, genetic and later-life factors, together with the isolation of the stem cells in the tissues that we have shown here to be transcriptionally programmed. Importantly, stem cells have been identified in all the transcriptionally programmed tissues here, providing a sound basis for future studies39.In summary, this is one of the very few studies investigating the long-term effects of ELA using a non-psychosocial stimulus. At the same time, we used a semi-holistic approach, “following” the phenotypic and metabolic changes seen throughout different tissues applying state-of-the-art techniques. Early life IAV infection leads to a distinguishable phenotype (lighter in weight, higher in blood glucose), reduced brain connectivity in areas responsible for memory, motor function and hormonal control, as well as a dysregulation of gene pathways responsible for steroid and energy metabolism shared between different tissues (liver, adrenal gland and brain) . Additionally, we have demonstrated a clear sex difference in pathology and phenotype that mirrors outcomes seen in human cohorts. The observed sexual dimorphism will hopefully fuel further investigation into this field and inspire future ELA research to include both sexes into their studies.Materials and methodsHusbandry conditions and breeding of miceBALB/cJRj mice were initially obtained from Janvier Labs (Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and subsequently bred in-house. All animals were maintained in ventilated cages (Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) with standard rodent diet (SDS Diets, Witham, UK) and drinking water ad libitum. Enrichment was offered in the form of sterile cardboard tunnels, mouse houses (Tecniplast) and paper nesting material. For the experimental breeding, in-house bred mice (F0, age 10–20 weeks) were randomly allocated into breeding trios/pairs to form experimental groups. One week before delivery, the pregnant dams were placed in individually-ventilated ISOcages (Tecniplast) and given additional nesting material and cardboard tunnels. The number of pups (F1) was determined on post-natal day 2/3 and litter size was reduced to a maximum of 8 pups/litter when necessary. The pups were ear-marked on PND12. We exposed 24 litters of pups (12 litters for each condition H1N1 or PBS) to our early-life treatment (post-natal day 14; PND14) of either influenza-A-virus (IAV) dissolved in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or only PBS as control (Fig. 1A). At PND56 animals were re-exposed to PBS except for a small group (Supplementary Data 1) that were re-exposed to IAV to serve as positive controls for IAV infection at sacrifice. All experimental procedures were performed following the approval of the Animal Welfare Structure of the Luxembourg Institute of Health (#DII-2017–15), in accordance with European Union directive 2010/63/EU as well as local guidelines, and reported according to the ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org).Virus expansion, TCID50 and LD50 determinationFor all infections, we used the H1N1 influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (obtained from Pr. C.P Muller; WHO Collaborative Centre Luxembourg). Virus stocks were expanded on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and the half tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells as described previously83. After 72h, the cytopathic effect per-well was determined by two observers; TCID50 and focus forming units (FFU) were calculated using a method provided by Dr. Marco Binder described in84. Virus aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and only thawed once.For the determination of the half lethal dose (LD50), 7–10-week-old mice were lightly anaesthetized by inhaling Isoflurane (1mL/mL; cp-pharma, Burgdorf, Germany) and 50 µL of virus suspension (103 – 105 FFU/mL in PBS) was given by intranasal way. The animals were scored daily for weight and signs of infection over 16 days as described by Koch and colleagues with minor modifications85 (Supplementary Data 4 and 5) and were euthanized if necessary. LD50 was calculated as 10377 FFU/mL, and 1038 FFU/mL respectively from the morbidity and mortality scores, using the methods of Reed & Muench and Ramakrishnan respectively86,87. The mean value 6 × 103 FFU/mL was subsequently used in all experiments.PND14 infection and PND56 challengeAt PND14 juvenile F1 mice were administered PBS (Control group; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) or influenza A virus (IAV group). For intranasal (i.n.) inoculation, the mice were lightly anaesthetized by inhaling Isoflurane (cp-pharma), and 25 µL virus suspension (1500 FFU IAV in PBS) or PBS were administered through droplets into the nose of the animals which were subsequently scored and weighed daily for 14 days. After weaning, the mice were kept in same-sex and same-treatment cages to avoid cross-contamination. On PND56 animals underwent a hetero- or homotypical challenge with either PBS or IAV and subsequently scored until sacrifice (Supplementary Data 4). The animals were sacrificed on PND60/61 by cervical dislocation. Immeadiatly after sacrifice, whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture as well as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by inserting a flexible tube through a cut in the trachea and washing the lungs with 700μL PBS. Following this complete brains, thymus, lungs, adrenal glands, and the distal tip of the left lobe of the liver were harvested and stored at –80°C before analysis.Restraint stressOn PND42 (± 1), we performed a restraint stress test by placing the animals in a transparent tube (according to the size of the animal: Ø2.86cm; BioSeb, Vitrolles, France or Ø2.48cm; G&P Kunsstofftechnik, Kassel, Germany) for 60 min. Blood (approx. 50µL) was collected (in EDTA treated capillary tubes; Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) by incision of a lateral tail vein, immediately after placing and approximately 1 min before releasing the animal from the restrainer. Plasma was subsequently separated by one-step centrifugation (2000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Glucose measurements were performed immediately using a standard blood glucose meter (Accu-Check Aviva; Roche, Basel, Switzerland).Corticosterone competitive ELISA.Plasma corticosterone levels were measured using Corticosterone High Sensitivity EIA kit (Immunodiagnosticsystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were diluted in assay diluent, either 50-fold (baseline samples pre-stress) or 100-fold (one hour of restraint).Viral qPCR detectionFor each mouse, one complete lung lobe was homogenized with a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen) and total RNA was extracted using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Qiagen One Step kit was used for reverse transcription and H1N1 qPCR detection was performed as previously described88. As a positive control, we used PND56 IAV infected animals sacrificed at PND60 without early-life treatment.Magnetic resonance imagingA small group of mice were anesthetized at PND19 using 4% isofluorane in air and sacrificed by decapitation. The entire heads were placed in tubes containing a cold solution of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 8 mM Gadolium (Dotarem 0.5 mmol/ml, Guerbet). The tubes were then left at 4°C for 6–12 weeks for the contrast agent to fully diffuse and stabilize in tissue prior to ex-vivo imaging.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed on a 3T preclinical horizontal bore scanner (MR Solutions, Guilford, UK), equipped with a quadrature volume coil designed for rodent head imaging, with a 17 cm horizontal bore. On analysis day, the heads were placed in a custom-made 3D holder filled with fluorinert (3M, MN, USA) and anatomical and structural MRI sequences were acquired. Three dimensional Fast Spin Echo (FSE3D) anatomical series were used to calculate the volumes of brain sub-regions. Spin Echo Diffusion Tensor Imaging (SE-DTI) was used to calculate the diffusions parameters as described below. The details of each sequence have been reported in the Supplementary Data 6. The 3D Brain Atlas (Invicro's VivoQuant™) provided 14 sub-regions and the analysis of the changes in brain volume or in the diffusion parameters was performed with Matlab 2020b (MathWorks, MA, USA). The atlas provided 14 sub-regions and the analysis was completed for all sub-regions.Gene expressionThe complete brains were taken from the skull within 10 min after sacrifice, snap-frozen in -80°C cold isopentane (VWR, #24872.260) and stored at – 80 °C until dissection. For brain dissection, the whole brains were free-hand cut by a trained operator at approximately – 25 °C and cerebellum, brain stem (medulla + pons), and the sub-cortical region (comprised of hippocampus, amygdala and parts of the cerebral cortex grey matter) were extracted and subsequently homogenized using a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen) and complete RNA was extracted using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions for fatty tissues.The whole thymus, both adrenal glands and a piece of the distal tip of left liver lope were cut out within 20 min after sacrifice and stored in RNA later solution (invitrogen) at -80°C until they were homogenized using a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen) and complete RNA was extracted using Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.RNA expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix Mouse Clariom S® microarray using 3´IVT Pico Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 10 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, from both poly-A tails at random, to capture coding and non-coding forms of RNA. Complementary RNA (cRNA) amplification was achieved using low-cycle PCR followed by linear amplification using T7 in-vitro transcription. The cRNA was then converted into biotinylated double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) hybridization targets for unbiased coverage of the transcriptome. Ds-cDNA (3 μg) was injected into the array cartridge and hybridized for 16 h at 45°C at 60 rpm. The arrays were subsequently washed, stained (GeneChip™ Fluidic Station 450) and scanned (GeneChip™ Scanner 3000).Data analysisUnless otherwise stated, statistical tests were done in R (4.0.2) using R Studio interface. Overall, we used the following packages to load, clean, filter, manipulate, and visualize data: tidyverse (v1.3.1), ggpubr (v0.7.0), broom (v0.7.6), ggstatsplot (v0.7.1).Mice phenotypeWe used a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to evaluate the effect of grouping variables (sex and PND14 treatment) on our outcome variable (body weight), after adjusting for the covariate (time), using the rstatix (v0.7.0) package. For post-hoc analysis, pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means (emmeans) with Bonferroni correction were performed for all significant variables of the ANCOVA. The data was filtered by sex, and pairwise Mann–Whitney U/Wilcoxon tests were used on body weight for individual time points (post-natal days) and visualized using the ggpubr package.Diffusion MRINordicICE (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) was used to analyze diffusion related images. ADC maps (scaling of units: 10–5 mm2/s) were computed using the equation \(S={S}_{0}{e}^{(-b*ADC)}\), where ‘S’ and ‘S0’ indicate the diffusion signals recorded in the presence and absence of diffusion (b = 0) respectively. The direction of diffusion within a 3D voxel is reflected by the FA maps and characterised by eigenvalues (λ) in multiple directions. The equation used to calculate FA maps is: \(FA= \sqrt{\frac{{({\uplambda }_{1}-{\uplambda }_{2})}^{2}+{({\uplambda }_{2}-{\uplambda }_{2})}^{2}+{({\uplambda }_{1}-{\uplambda }_{3})}^{2}}{2({\lambda }_{1}^{2}+{\lambda }_{2}^{2}+{\lambda }_{3}^{2})}}\). The FA values can vary between 1 and 0. Matlab was used to calculate volumes and quantify diffusion parameters in the different brain regions after registration of the MR images to a mouse brain atlas. Central tendency reported for the regions of interest (ROIs) are median values. FA and ADC median values were exported into R Studio and Mann–Whitney U/Wilcoxon tests were performed for each brain region.MicroarraysCEL files were processed (normalized and summarized) using ThermoFisher Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC, v.4.0.1.36) by SST-RMA method that corrects bias related to GC-content. Probesets were then summarized to gene level. Further analysis was performed by R/Bioconductor (v.4.0.0). In short, in order to improve sensitivity, we focused on expressed genes, using a soft threshold as described in89 (genes showing log2 expression > 8 in at least one sample were preserved for further statistical analysis), resulting in 14787 genes. Differential expression analysis was performed using limma package (v.3.44.3)90. A global linear two-factor model was built for the entire dataset, followed by analysis of contrasts. Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR adjustment was applied to p-values for multiple hypotheses correction. In order to report a limited number of differentially expressed genes, the following score was calculated as a combination of adjusted p-value and a log2 fold-change measure, similar to91:score = –log10(p.adj.)·|log2FC|. The top 20 genes were presented on row-scaled heatmaps (package pheatmap, v.1.0.12).Taking into account that each sample represented an ensemble of cell types, we performed deconvolution using a consensus independent component analysis (consICA) method92. This data-driven method characterizes the activity of biological processes and gives estimation of cell types.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed by clusterProfiler package (v.3.16.1)93 using gene sets defined be msigdbr package (v.7.2.1) within collections (WIKIPATHWAY, KEGG Pathway94). For significantly enriched gene sets, we reported p.adj. showing statistical significance, and a normalized enrichment score (NES) representing the direction of change. As a non-parametric approach to data analysis, we considered samples in compared groups and calculated AUC values for the genes using caTools package (v.1.18.1). The top candidate genes were then reported. Data availability All data and analytical code from this study are available upon reasonable request to J.D.T. ReferencesBarker, D. J. & Osmond, C.

In mid-September 2023 the first case of H5N1 Avian Influenza was detected in the Galápagos. This strain has already caused the death of thousands of birds on the South American mainland, including boobies, pelicans, frigate birds, penguins and albatross. It has also affected mammals such as otter, dolphins and sea lions. The extent of the infection within the Galápagos is currently not well understood but the virus has the potential to spread rapidly, devastating seabird and mammal populations. The continuing effects of El Niño may also exacerbate the impact of the virus as species face increased stress from temperature, weather pattern and shifts in food availability. © Rashid Cruz, CDF In order to fully understand the extent of the virus, and to inform the introduction of appropriate management interventions to contain its spread, the RRF has provided US$ 40,000 to the Charles Darwin Foundation to carry out surveys of key breeding colonies of Galápagos penguin, albatross and flightless cormorant to assess the health of seabird populations and collect samples for laboratory identification of Avian Influenza. Findings will then be shared with the Galápagos National Park Directorate, to inform management interventions, such as potential tourist restrictions and appropriate quarantine measures for specific areas. UNESCO thanks Fondation Franz Weber, Arcadia, Fondation Iris and the Government of Norway for their support to the Rapid Response Facility (RRF). With a target to decide on applications in just 8 working days, the RRF provides rapid support to natural World Heritage sites at times of crisis making it the world’s fastest conservation mechanism. © Rashid Cruz, CDF About the Galápagos Islands Situated in the Pacific Ocean some 1,000 km from the South American continent, the Galápagos Islands have been called a unique ‘living museum and showcase of evolution’. Located at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos are a ‘melting pot’ of marine species, and provide a vital habitat for seabird populations, including flightless cormorants, albatross and frigate birds.

In its respiratory virus snapshot of all three diseases, the CDC said illness levels remain elevated in many parts of the country. Sixteen jurisdictions are reporting high or very high activity, down from 22 the previous week. RSV indicators are declining in all parts of the country, with levels now below the epidemic threshold in 6 of 10 regions. Flu hot spots in Central, Midwestern states Flu activity ebbs a bit in the first weeks of January, but has been on the rebound since February, mainly driven by rises in regional activity. States in the Central and Midwest regions are currently reporting the highest activity. The percentage of respiratory tests that were positive for flu last week at clinical labs rose to 15.4%, and labs are seeing roughly equal proportions of the 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 strains of influenza A and influenza B, the CDC said in its latest weekly FluView update. Other indicators showed declines, including outpatient visits for flulike illness, which are at 3.7% and above the national baseline. Flu hospitalizations also declined last week, continuing a downward trend since January. Seniors make up the highest proportion of flu hospitalizations, though levels are elevated for all age-groups. Meanwhile, emergency department visits for flu are highest in children. Overall deaths were up slightly, and the CDC reported 13 more pediatric flu deaths, raising the season's total to 116. The deaths occurred from late December through early March. Nine deaths were due to influenza A, three from influenza A, and one from a coinfection involving 2009 H1N1 and influenza B. The CDC also reported 2 more pediatric flu deaths from the 2022-23 season, putting that total at 184. COVID wastewater detections at moderate level In COVID data updates today, the CDC reported declines in both of its severity markers. Hospitalizations declined 13.5% from the previous week, and deaths dropped 4.8% over the same period. Among early indicators, national test positivity declined 1.5% compared to a week ago and is at 5.2% nationally. Emergency department visits dropped 24.8% and are still highest in children younger than 12 months old and in seniors. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detections, considered another early marker, remain at the moderate level. Levels are still highest in the South, but, even there, levels are dropping steadily. In variant proportion updates, JN.1 remained dominant, with its offshoot JN.1.13 rising to 9.5% from 4.6% the previous week.

Credit: NIAID Key points: The “dark side” of the influenza neuraminidase (NA) protein head makes it vulnerable. Researchers isolated human antibodies targeted against the NA dark side from two people who had recovered from influenza type A subtype H3N2 and found that the antibodies inhibited propagation of several influenza viruses. The unique antibody targets provide new opportunities for vaccine development and other therapeutic strategies. Researchers have identified antibodies that target a hidden region of the influenza virus. Their discovery, outlined in Immunity, sheds light on the unexplored “dark side” of the neuraminidase (NA) protein head and suggests a new target for vaccination against influenza. Each season, scientists must update the influenza vaccine to provide protection against the many strains and subtypes of the rapidly evolving virus. To improve vaccines and protect against a broad range of viruses, researchers need to identify new targets on the virus’s surface protein in conserved regions. The underside of the influenza NA protein head contains a highly conserved region—called the “dark side”—with targets that make it vulnerable to antibody binding and inhibition. In this study, researchers isolated human antibodies targeted against the NA dark side from two people who had recovered from influenza type A subtype H3N2. They found that the antibodies inhibited propagation of viruses from subtype H2N2 and H3N2 viruses from humans, swine, and birds. Researchers also injected mice with a lethal H3N2 virus subtype and treated them with the antibodies either 1 day before or two days after infection. In both cases, the antibody showed the potential to treat and prevent influenza in a mouse model. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, the team analyzed the antibody structure and determined that each antibody targeted different, nonoverlapping regions of the NA dark side. This finding indicates that the dark side region has multiple areas that could be useful targets to explore for vaccine development and other therapeutic strategies. The research team hopes that these unique, untapped NA dark side targets could influence the next generation of broadly protective vaccines against influenza. However, in the near future antibodies targeting the dark side could be combined with existing antivirals and antibody interventions to improve patient outcomes.

Ready to head back to the gym after being felled by Covid, RSV or influenza? You’ll want to wait at least five to seven days after recovering before packing your gym bag. You shouldn't rush your return from a viral infection. thianchai sitthikongsak/Moment RF/Getty Images Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. CNN — You’re finally sticking to your New Year’s resolution to exercise regularly when you become sidelined by Covid-19. Or maybe you’re a seasoned fitness buff training for a marathon, then have to hit pause due to a nasty bout with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza. No matter the scenario, the big question is how to safely reboot your fitness regimen once you have recovered. If you had a simple head cold or 24-hour stomach flu bug, there is not too much to be concerned about. But Covid, RSV and influenza are more serious maladies that require a thoughtful approach to resuming exercise. That’s because the three are viral infections, which tend to cause whole-body inflammation, said Dr. R.J. Turner, a primary care and sports medicine physician with UTHealth Houston. “What that inflammation can do is irritate your heart and lungs, which ultimately can affect your breathing and the way your heart beats,” Turner said. “It takes time for your body to completely recover from a viral infection.” It can take even longer than average to be ready to hit the gym if you’re an older adult or have underlying health concerns, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. And if you already had heart or lung issues, that requires even more caution. Another factor to consider is how long you’ve been ill and inactive. “You start to lose strength in your muscles after five to seven days of inactivity,” said Marisella Villano, a certified personal trainer and owner of Marvil Fit in Hampton Bays, New York. Indeed, your muscles can begin to atrophy within eight hours of surgery. And being bedridden for less than two weeks can result in a 5% to 10% reduction in muscle mass in your quadriceps, according to a 2013 study published in The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology. Planning your return No matter which virus you had, wait at least five to seven days after recovering before packing your gym bag. You also should be able to do all of your daily activities without excessive fatigue. “Your body, heart and lungs need to recover,” Turner said. “You don’t want to push it too early and then have complications.” If you had Covid accompanied by heart- or lung-related symptoms such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, the American College of Cardiology recommends seeing your physician before resuming exercise. And if Covid caused you to develop myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, the ACC guidelines say to abstain from exercising for three to six months.

Turner recommended calculating your maximum heart rate and keeping it below 70% to start, which is considered light exercise. To determine your maximum heart rate, first subtract your age from 220, then calculate 70% of that. For example, a 40-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 180 beats per minute (220 minus 40). Since 70% of 180 is 126, a 40-year-old’s heart rate should initially stay below 126 beats per minute. You can use a heart-rate monitor or fitness watch to track your heart rate. Villano recommended walking at an easy pace for the first 10 days post-recovery before progressing to more moderate exercise. “But don’t go back to 100% of what you were doing before you became ill,” she said. “Decrease your loads by at least 10% or 15%.” At her fitness studio, some of Villano’s clients tried to jump right back into their workouts after a bout with Covid, despite her warning against it. The result was always the same: The overly eager go-getters fatigued earlier than previously, as their heart rates accelerated at lower workloads than before their illness. Some got lightheaded. “I have to talk them off the ledge and tell them their gains are cumulative,” she said. “Decreasing your workload doesn’t mean you will lose all of your gains.” Monitor how you’re feeling As you’re slowly working back to your normal fitness routine, pay attention to how you’re feeling. Yes, you’ll likely feel some fatigue as you get back into shape. But if you feel like your heart is racing or beating irregularly, or if you have any chest pain, stop immediately and see your physician. “The biggest thing to be concerned about are heart attacks and developing heart arrhythmias,” Turner said. Being well-hydrated and consuming nutritious foods are also crucial, Turner said, both while you’re ill and when you’re returning to activity. That’s because your body needs energy to fight off the infection while you’re sick and later to fuel your workouts. Future Research Inc.

COVID-19 and influenza can be particularly dangerous for older adults, causing high rates of hospitalization and mortality. In the U.S., hospitalized veterans aged 65 and older face a 30-day mortality risk of 6.4% for COVID-19 and 3.7% for influenza—significantly higher than younger populations. Recent research highlights the efficacy of vaccines in preventing these diseases or lessening their severity, with vaccination efforts averting thousands of flu-related and millions of COVID-19-related hospitalizations nationwide. In this context, a new study conducted by Daniel Harris, senior research scientist, and Vincent Mor, professor of health services policy and practice and the Florence Pierce Grant University Professor at Brown University, explores the adoption and variability of simultaneous COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. Supported by an IMPACT grant from the National Institute on Aging, their research expands on previous findings regarding the benefits of coadministered vaccines, examining whether these vaccinations are being adopted broadly and if any specific groups are being overlooked. We had the very unique opportunity to study COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in millions of Medicare beneficiaries over time. Daniel Harris, Ph.D. Senior Research Scientist The paper, “COVID-19 and influenza vaccine co-administration among older U.S. adults,” analyzed a national sample of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries to assess the timing and location of vaccine administration and to explore the demographic, social and health factors that may influence the likelihood of an individual receiving concurrent vaccines. “We had the very unique opportunity to study COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in millions of Medicare beneficiaries over time,” Harris said. “I was personally surprised by the lower rate of vaccine coadministration in the U.S. and quite concerned by clear disparities in vaccine access among Black, Native American and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries.” Despite initial reluctance in certain regions due to concerns about safety and efficacy, the majority of public health authorities now endorse the coadministration of COVID-19 and flu vaccines, supported by positive results from clinical trials. “There are several logistical, clinical, and public health benefits to the coadministration of vaccines,” the authors write. “Vaccine coadministration results in fewer health care visits and is more cost effective. Pairing vaccines also reduces the time to receive protection against co-circulating viruses, as opposed to waiting for multiple visits (where attrition may also occur).” Receiving COVID-19 and flu shots together, they go on to say, “is a natural public health strategy to improve convenience and uptake.” By the Numbers The study acknowledges an encouraging increase in the number of older adults getting COVID-19 and flu vaccines simultaneously. However, it also reveals variation in vaccination rates influenced by geography, health status, and race and ethnicity. The coadministration of COVID-19 and flu vaccines increased over two flu seasons—from 11.1% in 2021 to 36.5% in 2022—but varied across different regions. People in rural areas and those with Alzheimer’s and related dementias were more likely to get concurrent vaccinations. In contrast, patients with cancer or immune disorders were less likely to receive both vaccinations during the same visit; they were, however, more likely to receive a flu vaccine than other patient groups, but received their shots on different days. The study also highlights the differences in flu vaccination rates among people of different races, ethnicities and living areas, confirming what previous research has also shown. For instance, during one study period, only about 10% of vaccinated white people hadn’t gotten the flu shot, compared to around 21% of Black people, 16% of Hispanic people, and 17% of Native Americans. The researchers note that while Native Americans were less likely to get a flu shot compared to white people, they were more likely to get it at the same time as another vaccine, possibly because they often live in more rural areas or because of tailored public health messages encouraging simultaneous vaccinations. “ COVID-19, and other vaccine-preventable illnesses like flu, aren’t going away anytime soon. Our study documents gaps and opportunities to expand vaccination coverage in the US. ” Daniel Harris, Ph.D. Senior Research Scientist When looking only at people who did get a flu shot during a second study period, Black and Hispanic people were slightly more likely to have both vaccines administered at the same time than white people. This suggests that the variations in getting concurrent vaccinations are more about access, rather than differences in willingness to receive multiple vaccines at once. “Vaccines played a major role in blunting and subsequently ending the global, COVID-19 public health emergency,” Harris said. “But COVID-19, and other vaccine-preventable illnesses like flu, aren’t going away anytime soon. Our study documents gaps and opportunities to expand vaccination coverage in the US.” The researchers emphasize the importance of promoting the simultaneous administration of these vaccines, particularly during flu season, as a strategy to enhance vaccination rates and ensure broader protection against these diseases. Building on their prior work, which confirms the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older adults, they advocate for future research to investigate the reasons behind variations in uptake and to develop strategies to guarantee equitable access to these vaccines.

Here's how that will affect influenza vaccines in the future.Natalie Rahhal·ReporterMarch 16, 2024 at 7:59 AM·5 min read603Link CopiedFlu shots will be different this fall. Here's why. (Getty Creative)This fall’s flu shot will be designed to protect you from just three strains of the influenza virus, instead of the usual four, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That’s because an entire branch of the influenza family tree has died out, and experts say that's likely due, at least in part, to the COVID pandemic and the precautions many people were taking. Here’s what to know about the now “extinct” Yamagata influenza B virus, what happened to it and how its disappearance will affect next year’s flu vaccines.What happened to the Yamagata strain of flu?In the years leading up to the pandemic, Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Michigan and member of the FDA's vaccine committee, tells Yahoo Life that scientists got a clue that Yamagata might be on the decline because “it wasn’t diversifying the way that B Victoria did," which is another lineage of influenza B. "Victoria was doing all the weird, wonderful things that flu viruses do," says Monto, "but that wasn’t happening with B Yamagata."Then the COVID pandemic hit, and scientists stopped seeing Yamagata in samples taken from patients with flu altogether. “None at all — extinction,” says Monto.It’s impossible to say for sure what caused the death of the Yamagata strain, according to Monto and Dr. Pedro Piedra, a professor of molecular virology, microbiology and pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. But they and most virologists consider the various methods to slow the spread of COVID, like masking and social distancing, a major factor.One reason that might have led to the extinction of Yamagata is that influenza B almost exclusively infects humans, Piedra tells Yahoo Life, while influenza infects animals. “For viruses to stay alive, they need a host,” he explains. “So imagine for influenza B Yamagata, all of a sudden the ability to transmit is not possible, because the host is now protecting themselves through non-pharmacological interventions,” such as avoiding close contact with other people to slow the spread of COVID.The Victoria B strain was more prevalent than Yamagata before the pandemic and managed to hang on, but “the year prior to the pandemic, there was less Yamagata circulating, so that when it took a hit, that hit was more dramatic,” Piedra explains. Influenza A, meanwhile, had plenty of animal hosts to sustain it while humans hid out.Why this mattersEach year, scientists have to guess which subtypes of influenza viruses they think will be most actively circulating in order to formulate the most protective vaccine possible. That’s a serious challenge because viruses are constantly recombining and mutating.There are four broad types of influenza: A, B, C and D. But types C and D rarely appear and generally cause only mild illnesses. For this reason, the CDC and the World Health Organization don’t consider them to be public health threats.Strains of influenza A and B, on the other hand, circle the globe seasonally. More than 130 subtypes of influenza A have been discovered in nature, according to the CDC, while influenza B has been divided into just two groups, known as lineages: B Victoria and B Yamagata. But vaccine makers can’t yet include more than four types of the flu virus in a given vaccine due to technological limitations. Since 2014, therefore, the vaccine has been made to protect against two strains of influenza A — H1N1 and H3N2 — and two strains of influenza B, Victoria and Yamagata.But with the disappearance of Yamagata, the U.S. and much of the world will use a shot based on just three strains of flu — or a trivalent vaccine — instead of a quadrivalent vaccine, which is designed to protect against four strains.Making a vaccine based on fewer flu strains could improve vaccine-making capacity globally, research suggests. “It gives you a little more leeway,” Piedra says.It means that making the vaccine won’t take quite as long, so scientists may have a little longer to pick the flu strains the vaccine is designed to block — a decision that typically happens in May. Or, as Piedra explains: “You will have the vaccine a little earlier, to be sure that everyone who wants to be is vaccinated. If the vaccine comes in late, it’s much harder to vaccinate everyone and have broad coverage.”How trivalent flu vaccines be as protective?Yes, say both Monto and Piedra. There’s no evidence that Yamagata B is still around, so the vaccine will be tailored to the strains that are circulating. “As a matter of principle, you don’t want to vaccinate people with something that you don’t need,” says Monto.It’s also worth noting that it's not impossible for the B Yamagata strain to reemerge, says Piedra. But he adds that there’s no reason to vaccinate against it now and no immediate cause for concern that it will come back. Also, according to Monto, there's a good reason to leave it out of the vaccine recipe. In the U.S., flu shots contain an inactivated — virology-speak for “dead” — bit of virus that’s incapable of causing infection. But the nasal spray form uses what’s called a live attenuated influenza vaccine, meaning it contains weakened, live viruses.This version of the virus is generally too weak to cause illness, but "the concern there was about not wanting to bring back something that was gone” by including B Yamagata in these vaccines, Monto says. So come the fall, the flu shot and nasal spray will protect against three subtypes instead.

Prev Next In today’s Health Alert, influenza continues to circulate at high levels in Michigan. Given that it's late in the flu season, some may be wondering whether it's still worthwhile to get the flu shot. By: Dr. Partha Nandi Posted and last updated In today’s Health Alert, influenza continues to circulate at high levels in Michigan. Given that it's late in the flu season, some may be wondering whether it's still worthwhile to get the flu shot. I get asked that all the time by my patients, and here's my answer. If there's any flu activity happening, it's definitely not too late to get the flu shot. Here in Michigan, we have not yet plateaued. Cases are still climbing and the CDC’s flu activity map shows our state as “Very High” for influenza. Looking at Michigan’s weekly influenza report, just over 8,800 outpatient visits in the week ending March 2 were due to influenza-like illness. Most of the flu results reported were H1N1, a type of influenza A virus.While you may think it’s a bit late in the flu season to get the shot, there can be significant flu activity well into the month of May. The annual flu shot is your best defense against this virus. Estimates for this season show 41% to 44% effectiveness against hospitalization for adults and 52% to 61% for children.According to the CDC, roughly 44.9% of adults and 50% of children were vaccinated for the flu this season. Here in Michigan, about 25% of adults and 19% of kids got the vaccine. That’s pretty low. The reluctance to get vaccinated could be due to COVID-19 vaccine fatigue. But also, many people think, “I’m healthy, so I don’t need a flu vaccine.” Because the flu has been around so long, people just accept it as part of life. But unfortunately, the flu can cause serious illness and death, even in healthy people.The CDC estimates we’ve had 310,000 hospitalizations and about 20,000 people have died. 103 were pediatric deaths, including one here in Michigan. Sadly, almost 90% of the children who died were not fully vaccinated. It’s recommended that everyone six months and older get a yearly flu shot. Kids under the age of 8 get two doses if they’ve not had the shot before. I get one every year and so do my kids. And that’s because the flu vaccine can lessen the severity of your illness and it’s very effective at preventing severe illness.So once again, I highly recommend getting vaccinated against the flu if you have not yet done so.

The Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home Test by Pfizer is a single-use at-home test that provides results collected from nasal swab samples in about 30 minutes. The test is available for purchase without the need for a prescription and can be fully administered at home. It utilizes nasal swab samples that individuals who are 14 years of age or older can collect themselves, or that can be collected by an adult for individuals who are 2 years of age or older, the FDA says.In symptomatic individuals, the Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home Test accurately detected 99.3% of negative and 90% of positive Influenza A samples, 100% of negative and 88.3% of positive COVID-19 samples and 99.9% of negative Influenza B samples, the FDA states. Due to a current lack of Influenza B cases for clinical studies, the test’s effectiveness for detecting Influenza B was confirmed using artificial samples. The EUA mandates Lucira gather more samples to evaluate the test’s real-world efficacy in detecting Influenza B. The test is available for purchase on Amazon and at Walgreens.

Nonetheless, public hesitancy towards vaccination often stems from concerns about potential side effects, which can vary from person to person. As of now, there are no automated systems available to proactively warn against potential side effects or gauge their severity following vaccination. We have developed machine learning (ML) models designed to predict and detect the severity of post-vaccination side effects. Our study involved 2111 participants who had received at least one dose of either a COVID-19 or influenza vaccine. Each participant was equipped with a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and was required to complete a daily self-reported questionnaire regarding local and systemic reactions through a dedicated mobile application. Our XGBoost models yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.69 and 0.74 in predicting and detecting moderate to severe side effects, respectively. These predictions were primarily based on variables such as vaccine type (influenza vs. COVID-19), the individual's history of side effects from previous vaccines, and specific data collected from the smartwatches prior to vaccine administration, including resting heart rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability. In conclusion, our findings suggest that wearable devices can provide an objective and continuous method for predicting and monitoring moderate to severe vaccine side effects. This technology has the potential to improve clinical trials by automating the classification of vaccine severity.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a considerable impact on health and the economy worldwide1,2,3. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 1 billion cases of seasonal influenza occur each year, of which approximately 3–5 million are severe cases resulting in up to 650,000 deaths4. An important tool in the fight against infectious diseases is vaccines5. Vaccines aid in the prevention of disease from irremediable conditions by stimulating the body’s adaptive immunity6.Although vaccination is important to lower viral spread, some individuals are hesitant to follow the recommended vaccination advice7,8. An important reason for vaccine hesitancy is concern about vaccine safety, efficacy, and side effects9,10. COVID-19 vaccines, for example, have been shown to cause numerous adverse side effects ranging from local side effects, such as headache and fever11,12 to rare systemic and severe outcomes, such as thrombotic events and myocarditis11,12,13. Anticipating and predicting the adverse side effects of vaccines could help better plan work and leisure schedules a few days after vaccination and increase the vaccination acceptance rate14.Raising confidence in vaccines requires closing the knowledge gap on vaccine safety. The need to rectify this situation is highlighted by the work of the Global Vaccine Data Network. This large vaccine safety project includes scientists from over 20 countries who gather the data needed to investigate rare complications that are linked to COVID-19 vaccines to improve the prediction and treatment of, and potentially prevent, these side effects15. While severe events after vaccination likely lead to a medical consultation, which would be noted in the patient’s medical records, milder reactions are generally underreported. To address this issue and provide a comprehensive response to the milder side effects following vaccinations, continuous and detailed detection and surveillance of the side effects following vaccination is needed.Recent studies have shown a clear association between individual medical and personal characteristics and adverse side effects following COVID-19 vaccinations12,16. One study found that sociodemographic variables are potential predictors of differential influenza vaccine outcomes17. Besides sociodemographic and self-reported information, an additional source of information on vaccine side effects is data from wearable devices, such as smartwatches. The recent popularity and widespread availability of smartwatch devices enable the collection of huge amounts of data on physiological measures such as an individual’s heart rate, resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), oxygen saturation, and physical activity18. Recent studies have used physiological information obtained from wearable devices to prospectively and retrospectively predict and detect COVID-19 infection19,20,21,22,23, as well as to examine the duration and variation of recovery among COVID-19–positive vs COVID-19–negative individuals24. Other studies using wearables found considerable and short-term changes in heart rate and HRV following vaccination13,25,26,27,28. However, the identification of vaccine-associated side effects using smartwatch measurements has yet to be established.This study aims to predict and detect the severity of post-vaccination side effects following BNT162b2 COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccination. We designed ML models that utilized sociodemographic, self-reported questionnaires, and smartwatch data as layers of information. Our prediction model can serve as a tool for individuals in anticipating their side effect severity following vaccination, and hence generate a personalized side effects profile, which could potentially increase the vaccination acceptance rate. Likewise, our detection model can potentially allow the classification of vaccine side effect severity in clinical trials in an automated manner.ResultsCohort characteristics2111 participants received at least one dose of COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine; 1932 participants received at least 1 dose of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine between 14 December 2021 and 29 September 2022, and 856 participants received at least 1 dose of seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 seasons. Of the 2111 participants, 1072 (50.78%) were women and 1038 (49.17%) were men. Their age ranged from 19 to 87 years, with a median age of 52 years (Table 1). A total of 1643 (77.83%) participants had a body mass index < 30 kg/m2, and 868 (41.11%) had more than one underlying medical condition (Table 1).Table 1 Information on cohort participants after COVID-19 and influenza vaccination stratified by the presence of self-reported reaction.Full size tableOf the participants who received at least one dose of COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine and were classified as having “Moderate to severe reaction”, participants > 55 years of age reported fewer reactions than did participants 18–55 years of age, 8.16% vs. 14.72%, odds ratio [OR] 1.94 [95% CI 1.56–2.40, p < 0.0001] (Fig. S1A). Females reported greater rates of “Moderate to severe reaction” than males, 13.07% vs. 9.52, OR 1.42 [95% CI 1.15–1.76, p < 0.001] (Fig. S1B). Participants who had an underlying medical condition reported fewer rates of ”Moderate to severe reaction”, 9.23% vs. 13.17%, OR 1.49 [95% CI 1.20–1.85, p < 0.001] compared with participants who did not have an underlying medical condition (Fig. S1C).Descriptive self-reporting patternsWe classified post-vaccination side effects following COVID-19 and influenza vaccines into “No reaction”, “Mild reaction” and “Moderate to severe reaction” groups, and examined the proportion of participants with “No reaction”, “Mild reaction” and “Moderate to severe reaction” groups following COVID-19 and influenza vaccines for participants who received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and participants who received at least 1 dose of seasonal influenza vaccine. The fraction of participants who received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and were classified as having “No reaction” was smaller than the fraction of participants who received at least one dose of the influenza vaccine and reported “No reaction”. Specifically, 64.38% (95% CI 56.46–71.92%) of the participants did not report any new symptoms after receiving the first COVID-19 dose, 62.20% (95% CI 55.53–68.64%) after the second COVID-19 dose, and 58.02% (95% CI 55.97–60.06%) after the COVID-19 boosters doses compared with 79.47% (95% CI 76.89–81.93%) after the influenza vaccines (Fig. 1A). Additionally, the proportion of participants who experienced “Mild” or “Moderate to severe” reactions was higher following COVID-19 vaccination compared to the influenza vaccination.Figure 1Self-reported reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine compared with the influenza vaccine.

The most common individual reactions out of all the self-reported reactions for the COVID-19 vaccine were “Weakness” (23.7% of vaccinated individuals), “Headache” (19.1%), “Muscle pain” (18.9%), “Fever” (9.5%), and “Chills” (8.1%) (Fig. 1B). The most common individual reactions out of all the self-reported reactions for the influenza vaccine were “Weakness” (8.6%), “Headache” (6.1%), “Other” (4.4%), “Cold” (4.3%), and “Muscle pain” (4.0%). Notably, the proportion of all individual post-vaccination self-reported side effects was higher for the COVID-19 vaccine than for the influenza vaccine (Fig. 1C) as well as the proportion of simultaneously occurring sets of side effects.Descriptive heart measure from smartwatchesIn addition to the self-reported data collected from the questionnaires, we analyzed objective and continuous physiologic measurements collected by the smartwatches. We examined the average of the first 72 h post-vaccination for the mean differences between pre-and post-vaccination in hourly heart rate, HRV-based stress, and the first 3 days post-vaccination for the mean differences in daily resting heart rate data for participants who received at least one dose of COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine (Fig. 2). Participants who reported side effects associated with “Moderate to severe reaction”, except for “Dyspnea”, showed a large increase in the mean difference in heart rate, (Fig. 2A), HRV-based stress levels (Fig. 2B), and daily resting heart rate (Fig. 2C) compared to their baseline levels. These changes were also observed for participants who reported side effects associated with “Mild reaction”, but were considerably lower. Participants who reported “No systematic reaction” had a slight increase in mean heart rate, HRV-based stress, and daily resting heart rate, compared with baseline levels. By the sixth day post-vaccination, heart rate, HRV-based stress, and resting heart rate levels returned to baseline. The differences in physiological measures captured by the smartwatches reflect their ability to detect the severity of self-reported reactions.Figure 2Change in objective and continuous physiologic measurements collected by the smartwatch following COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine as a function of self-reported side effects.

Data information: error bars represent 95% CIs. For each panel, the sample size represents the number of participants for which we had sufficient data points to conduct the analysis, using the criteria presented in the “Materials and methods” section.Full size imageMachine learning modelFollowing the analysis of the self-reported questionnaires, sociodemographic (age, gender, and background diseases) data, and smartwatch data, we created machine learning models to predict and detect the participant-reported side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations (“No- or Mild-reaction” or “Moderate to severe reaction”). The prediction model utilized sociodemographic, questionnaire, and smartwatch information, but only before vaccine administration, and the detection model additionally utilized the smartwatch measures 72 h post-vaccination information. Four machine learning methods were evaluated for the prediction and detection problems, which are listed with their hyperparameters and performance report (Table S1). Our models included all 2111 patients who received COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine, corresponding to 2585 COVID-19 and 984 influenza vaccine doses. Of the 3569 vaccine doses, 405 (11.34%) reported having “Moderate to severe reaction”.XGBoost and RF showed the best performance (Table S1). Notably, the XGBoost model was selected for further analysis. A predictive XGBoost model that combines sociodemographic, questionnaire, and smartwatch layers of information together had a moderate classification ability between “No- or Mild-reaction” and “Moderate to severe reaction”, with an AUROC score of 0.69 ± 0.05 (Fig. 3). A detection XGBoost model that combines that information with the smartwatch measures 72 h post-vaccination had significantly better (p < 0.01) classification ability in participant-reported side effect severity, with an AUROC score of 0.74 ± 0.03 (Fig. 3). This improvement demonstrates the sensitivity of smartwatches to detect the severity of individuals’ side effects from vaccination.Figure 3Predictive models’ performance. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) for a prediction model that utilizes data before vaccination (i.e., sociodemographic, questionnaire, and smartwatch data) (green line), and of a detection model that also utilizes smartwatch data 72 h following vaccination (blue line). Mean values and standard errors for sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP) are reported, considering the point on the ROC with the highest average value of sensitivity and specificity (Youden index).Full size imageModel feature importanceSince the various models used automatic feature selection, delving into the models enabled the assessment of the predictor variable’s importance. The feature importance in the detection model of participant-reported side effects following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations is shown in Fig. 4. We observed that the highest contribution to the classification ability between “No- or Mild-reaction” and “Moderate to severe reaction” was the vaccine type. This can be attributed to the high percentage of side effects following the COVID-19 vaccine compared to the influenza vaccine. Sociodemographic data had the least contribution to the detection model. Smartwatch data following vaccination, as well as smartwatch data collected in previous doses, had a significant contribution to the classification ability between “No- or Mild-reaction” and “Moderate to severe reaction” in the detection model: for example, an increase in stress duration following vaccination was a classification predictor for the severity of post-vaccination side effects. Likewise, the presence of some side effects (“Muscle pain” and “Weakness”) or the absence of them (“Health”) following a specific dose increased the classification ability after subsequent doses.Figure 4Model feature importance. Contribution of each feature to the detection of the participant-reported side effects following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations, stratified by sociodemographic, questionnaire, and smartwatch data.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we developed machine-learning-based approaches to predict and detect the severity of post-vaccination side effects following BNT162b2 COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccines by utilizing specific data collected from the smartwatches, including resting heart rate, heart rate, and HRV-based stress, combined with sociodemographic data and data from self-reported questionnaires. We found that participants who received at least one dose of COVID-19 and/or influenza vaccine, < 55 years of age, female sex, and participants without an underlying medical condition had greater self-reported local and systemic reactions. This result is consistent with recent studies16,27. The proportion of participants who experienced “Moderate to severe reaction” was higher following the COVID-19 vaccination than for the influenza vaccination, for which participants reported mostly “No reaction”. Indeed, it has been shown that COVID-19 vaccination is more closely associated with systematic side effects such as chills, fever, confusion, weakness, and muscle pain, while the influenza vaccine is associated with local injection site side effects29.We found that the elevation in heart rate, HRV-based stress, and resting heart rate measures post-vaccination correlated with the severity of the side effects. Participants reporting “Moderate to severe reaction” had a significant increase in those measures, compared to participants reporting “Mild reaction”. Importantly, even among participants who did not report side effects after vaccination, the smartwatch detected a significant physiological response compared to the baseline period in the first 72 h after vaccination. Furthermore, an ML approach that uses sociodemographic, self-reported questionnaire, and smartwatch data to predict participant-reported side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations (“No- or Mild-reaction” or “Moderate to severe reaction”) had an AUROC of 0.69. A detection model that combines that information with smartwatch measures 72 h post-vaccination had a significantly better performance with an AUROC of 0.74. These results demonstrate the greater sensitivity of wearable devices in detecting side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations. In addition, our results underscore the need for integrated ML models that utilize data from wearables to classify the severity of reactions following vaccines in clinical trials.Our study has several limitations. First, the participants were slightly older than the Israeli population, so our analyses and ML models might not be generalizable to the entire Israeli or global population. However, the side effects types, frequency, and duration we observed for the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were similar to those observed in the BNT162b2 mRNA and inactivated influenza vaccines clinical trials30,31. Second, all participants received the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 between 14 December 2021 and 29 September 2022 and seasonal influenza vaccines for the 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 seasons. However, studies have shown that different COVID-19 vaccines have similar profiles31,32. Likewise, although the influenza vaccine usually changes each year due to the frequent appearance of new strains, the extent and the types of local and systemic reactions are similar. Therefore, we believe that applying our analyses and ML models to other COVID-19 and influenza vaccine types is likely to yield similar results. Third, we assume that participants’ behaviors would be the same throughout the pre-and post-vaccination periods. However, factors that are not associated with vaccination (e.g., caffeine or alcohol consumption) could influence physiological measures in the analysis of the mean difference between the two time periods. Fourth, the smartwatches used in this study are not medical-grade devices, nor are they representative of all wearable devices. Nevertheless, recent studies show that previous versions of such devices have high accuracy for physiological measurements33,34. Fifth, participants were not able to report the levels of symptom severity in the questionnaire, and therefore, smartwatch objective physiological measurements could be significantly different between individuals, which may affect the performance of our ML models. Lastly, in our analysis, we focused on a constrained dataset encompassing only the week prior to vaccination and the 72 h following each vaccination event for each participant. We derived a limited set of non-sequential predictive variables and employed off-the-shelf, non-sequential machine learning models, which are not optimized for processing temporal data. We recognize that the model's predictive capabilities could potentially be enhanced by incorporating longer time series data. This could include daily questionnaires capturing symptoms not directly related to vaccines, as well as extended data gathered from smartwatches. Additionally, the use of sequential machine learning models, as demonstrated in a previous study35, might further improve the accuracy and relevance of our predictions.In conclusion, our ML models that combine sociodemographic, self-reported questionnaires, and smartwatch data can predict and detect participant-reported side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations. The ability to predict or detect the participant-reported side effect severity can be improved by including more input and output data. Importantly, this approach can be applied to other vaccines and drugs. The sensitivity of wearable devices allows better detection ability of the side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccination, and will potentially improve clinical trials by enabling the classification of vaccine severity as well as earlier identification of abnormal reactions in an automated manner.Materials and methodsStudy design and participantsWe studied a cohort of 2111 participants (> 18 years of age) who were recruited between 14 December 2021 and 29 September 2022 to the PerMed prospective observational study from all across Israel27,36. Of the 2,111 participants, 1932 participants reported receipt of > 1 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 856 participants reported receipt of > 1 doses of the influenza vaccine. Specifically, of the 1932 participants receiving COVID-19 vaccination, during the study, 146 received their first dose, 209 their second dose, 1545 their third dose, and 685 their fourth dose. Of the 856 participants who received influenza vaccination, 791 received the seasonal dose for 2021–2022, 188 received the seasonal dose for 2022–2023, and 125 received both seasonal doses. Participant recruitment was conducted via advertisements on social media and word-of-mouth. Each participant signed an informed consent form after receiving a comprehensive explanation of the study from a professional survey company. The participants were equipped with a Garmin® Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and installed two apps on their smartphones: a dedicated mobile application (PerMed App), that collected daily self-reported questionnaires37, and an application that passively recorded the smartwatch data. Further information regarding data collection architecture and the PerMed dashboard is provided in our previous works13,25,27 and the Supplementary Material (Appendix B).Participant recruitment and engagementWe hired a professional survey company to recruit participants as well as to keep them engaged throughout the PerMed study. The survey company was responsible for guaranteeing that the participants met the study’s requirements, in particular, that they agreed to wear the smartwatch and fill in the daily questionnaires at least three times a week. We implemented several measures to minimize attrition and churn of participants and consequently improve the quality, continuity, and reliability of the collected data. First, participants who did not fill out the daily questionnaire by 7 p.m. received a notification in their mobile app to fill out the questionnaire. Second, a dedicated dashboard that allowed the survey company to identify participants who continually neglected to complete the daily questionnaires at least three times a week or did not wear their smartwatch for a long duration of time was developed. These participants were contacted by the survey company (either by text messages or phone calls) and were encouraged to better adhere to the study protocol. Third, to strengthen participants’ engagement, a weekly personalized summary report was generated for each participant and was available inside the PerMed application. Similarly, a monthly newsletter with recent findings from the study and useful tips regarding the smartwatch’s capabilities was sent to the participants. At the end of the study, participants will receive all personal insights that were obtained and can keep the smartwatch as a gift.PerMed mobile applicationAfter joining the PerMed study, participants filled out the enrollment questionnaire, and information on participants’ sex, age, and underlying medical conditions, was collected. The list of underlying medical conditions consisted of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, immune suppression, cancer, renal failure, and body mass index (BMI) > 30 (BMI is defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). Participants filled out a daily questionnaire through the PerMed mobile application27,36. The questionnaire allowed participants to report their signs and symptoms from a closed list of local and systemic reactions previously observed in BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 or influenza vaccines31,38, with an option to add other symptoms as free text. A detailed description of the questionnaire is provided in the Supplementary Material (Appendix A pp 6–8).SmartwatchParticipants were equipped with Garmin® Vivosmart 4 smart fitness trackers. Among many physiological measurements, the smartwatch provides continuous measures of heart rate, stress, and daily resting heart rate capabilities39. Since the HRV measure is not accessible through Garmin’s application programming interface, we used Garmin’s stress level measure instead, which is computed based on the HRV measure40. HRV-based stress is a measure between 1 to 100 computed by Garmin and is categorized into four tiers: rest (1–25), low (26–50), medium (51–75), and high (76–100)41. Specifically, the Garmin device uses heart rate data to determine the interval between each heartbeat. The variable length of time between each heartbeat is regulated by the body’s autonomic nervous system. Less variability between beats correlates with higher stress levels, whereas an increase in variability indicates less stress41,42,43. When we examined data collected in our study, we identified a heart rate sample approximately every 15 s, a stress sample every 180 s, and a daily sampling of resting heart rate.Data preprocessingWe performed several preprocessing steps on the daily questionnaire data and smartwatch physiological measures before analyzing the data. For the daily questionnaires, if participants filled in the daily questionnaire more than once on a given day we considered only the last entry reported. For the HRV-based stress and heart rate measures collected by the smartwatches, we computed the mean value for each hour of data. Then, to impute missing values, we performed a linear interpolation. Finally, data was smoothed by calculating the moving average value using a 5-h sliding window.Data analysis and inclusion criteriaFor each participant, we defined the 7 days before vaccination as a baseline period. For the analysis which involves self-reported questionnaires and for the machine learning model, we included only participants who filled out at least one questionnaire during the baseline period and at least one questionnaire during the 7 days following vaccination. Those questionnaires are required to determine whether symptoms reported by the participants should be considered side effects. We defined a reaction as a post-vaccination side effect if it had not been reported during the baseline period. For the questionnaire data, we calculated the percentage and corresponding 95% CI of participants who reported new systemic reactions in the 7 days following vaccination. We used a Beta distribution to calculate the 95% CI.For the analysis involving smartwatch measurements, we included participants who had at least one overlapping period of data (i.e., the same day of the week and same hour during the day for the heart rate and HRV-based stress measures, and the same day of the week for the daily resting heart rate) during their baseline and post-vaccination periods. The overlapping periods are required for computing the change in measurement values between the baseline and post-vaccination periods. To calculate the changes in continuous Garmin smartwatch measurements (heart rate and HRV-based stress measures) over the 0–7 days post-vaccination, with those of the baseline period, we calculated for each participant the difference between the measurement of each hour during the seven days post-vaccination and that of the corresponding hour’s in the baseline period (keeping the same day of the week and the same hour during the day). For the daily resting heart rate, we calculated the differences in the same manner (keeping the same day of the week). A Randomized control trial31, and prior studies analyzing physiological measures via smartwatches and self-reported questionnaires13, demonstrate a significant decrease in local and systemic reactions within 72 h post-vaccination. Consequently, our classification problem focused on determining whether a moderate to severe reaction occurred within this 72 h post-inoculation period.Based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we stratified the participant-reported post-vaccination side effects by the severity of the reactions they reported in the questionnaire in the post-vaccination period by the appearance of symptoms, as follows: 1. “No reaction” 2. “Mild reaction”: abdominal pain, back or neck pain, feeling cold, muscle pain, weakness, headache, dizziness, vomiting, sore throat, diarrhea, cough, leg pain, ear pain, loss of taste and smell, swelling of the lymph nodes. 3. “Moderate to severe reaction”: fast heartbeat, hypertension, chest pain, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever, confusion, and chills. Participants were classified into one of the three categories, based on the most severe symptom that was reported in their post-vaccination period.Machine learning modelWe stratified participants by the severity of their reactions. Participants who did not report a reaction, or had a “Mild reaction” following vaccination were classified in the “No- or Mild-reaction” group, and the remaining participants were classified in the “Moderate to severe reaction” group. We developed ML models to predict and detect the participant-reported side effect severity following COVID-19 or influenza vaccinations. The prediction model utilized sociodemographics, side effects from previous doses collected from questionnaires, and smartwatch information, but only before the vaccine, while the detection model also utilized the smartwatch measures 72 h post-vaccination information.The entire data set has been randomly divided into 5 separate non-overlapping test sets. For each test set, a model is trained using all the remaining data, ensuring an equal percentage of positive cases between train and test sets to take into account imbalanced positive and negative classes.Several machine learning techniques were evaluated for both models: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).The XGBoost package was used for training Gradient Boosted Decision Trees44, while the Scikit-learn machine learning library was used to implement the other models45.Performances of the testing samples from each model are reported by mean AUROC, sensitivity (SE), and specificity (SP). SE and SP are defined as the fraction of positive and negative individuals correctly classified, respectively. These values are based on the point in the ROC that optimized the Youden index46,47. For each classifier, we applied a grid search within our stratified cross-validation framework and optimized our model selection using the mean AUROC.The interpretable nature of the decision tree model allows for the evaluation of feature importance estimates48. The XGBoost in-model feature importance was used to demonstrate each predictor variable’s effect on the detection of the participant-reported side effect severity.For evaluation of the differences in terms of AUROC, a bootstrap test (n = 1000) for the difference was used. We repeatedly sampled the dataset with replacement in a stratified manner. We trained the prediction and detection models for each bootstrap sample and computed AUROC on the unique data points that were not selected in the current bootstrap sample. Each model is trained and tested with its subset features and the best hyperparameters. For each bootstrap sample, we computed the AUROC difference between the prediction and detection models and generated a distribution of bootstrapped differences. Finally, we calculated the p-value which is the proportion of bootstrapped differences that is less than or equal to 0.Ethical approvalBefore participating in the study, all subjects were advised, both orally and in writing, as to the nature of the study and gave written informed consent to the study protocol, which was approved by the Tel Aviv University Institutional Review Board (0002522-1).

The Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) has confirmed that two dead skuas found near the Argentinian Primavera station on the Antarctic Peninsula tested positive to the virus in late February. Dr Louise Emmerson visited penguin colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula over summer to collect data and check for Avian Influenza. Photo: Louise Emmerson There were always fears Avian Influenza would reach Antarctica this season but seabird ecologist Dr Louise Emmerson said it was a shock nonetheless. “It has had a devastating effect in nearby South America,” she said. “Tens of millions of birds have died globally and there is evidence that it also had a dramatic impact on southern elephant seals and fur seals. “Some individuals within populations seem to be coming through it OK but there have been some weird and unexpected outcomes for some species. The northern gannet, for example, usually has blue eyes but when they recover from Avian Influenza, their eyes are black and we are not sure why.” What’s more, Dr Emmerson said no-one knew what the impact of that adaptation would be. “Could the black-eyed gannets have a breeding disadvantage? And did their blue eyes help with their foraging? There’s so much we don’t know about how species will respond and we need more research to resolve this.” Cruise ships adopt new biosecurity measures Dr Emmerson spent some of the summer monitoring bird colonies for the virus from a cruise ship on the Antarctic Peninsula with a colleague from Oxford University in the UK. Dr Emmerson and her colleague, Dr Tom Hart, would join the expedition team on a zodiac and head out on a scouting trip to a penguin colony. They would visually scout for signs of the disease and go ashore first, to conduct drone surveys of the penguin colonies and check the site was clear for passengers. At the time, there were no signs of the mass deaths or neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease, but biosecurity measures on cruise ships had been ramped up in response to the risk. “Before passengers came down to get on a small boat to visit a penguin colony they’d take their hiking boots and poles and their backpacks and camera bags – anything they were going to take into the field, and they’d disinfect them. “The cruise ship provided rubber boots for everyone to walk in, and an outer layer with a hood and walking poles for people to use so we could make sure everything was clean. “Then when we got back, everyone would scrub their boots and poles and make sure everything that had touched the ground was disinfected. “This year, we didn’t allow people to sit on the ground or put their packs on the ground. But the passengers were great about it, they took the risk to the wildlife and themselves very seriously.” Dr Emmerson’s monitoring work included visiting this gentoo penguin colony on the Antarctic Peninsula. Photo: Dr Louise Emmerson “The species we were always most worried about was skuas” Some colonies along the Peninsula had been closed to visitors while suspect deaths were investigated but none were confirmed as Avian Influenza. However by then, the virus was confirmed on South Georgia and the Falkland Islands. “The species we were always most worried about was skuas because they’re scavengers and they undertake considerable winter migrations. For example, the skuas from East Antarctica fly all the way up to Japan, Korea and China so the chance of them being exposed to the disease was always greater. Penguins that breed in Antarctica don’t go very far north in winter so if they get it, it will be from other wildlife, including the northerly migrating seabirds, or humans.” Dr Emmerson and Dr Tom Hart on their way to a penguin colony. Photo: Camille Seaman Camera network vital for monitoring As part of the summer monitoring project, Dr Emmerson and Dr Hart also maintained and downloaded data from Dr Hart’s camera network, set up along the Antarctic Peninsula to monitor nesting sites. The network is based on an idea pioneered in Hobart by Australian Antarctic Division engineers in the early 2000s. The AAD’s network has about 44 cameras set up at key locations along the East Antarctic coastline, taking ten photos a day of about 30 to 40 nests per camera. Species monitored include surface nesters like Adelie penguins, cape petrels, fulmars, southern giant petrels and emperor penguins. “The cameras are on tripods and they’re very robust,” Dr Emmerson said. “We can use the images to monitor when the birds arrive and leave, the timing of chick creche and their breeding success. “The photos are stored on a camera card, so we still need to physically go and retrieve it, but that’s because we went for the simplest model possible. If it was downloading to a satellite there would be a requirement for more battery life and there would be issues and financial costs with bandwidth in transferring the images. “The cameras only focus on a small part of the population so we still need to get there physically to attach foraging trackers and collect samples. It doesn’t replace our field work but it does complement it and allows us to expand the spatial coverage of our monitoring.” Dr Hart’s network includes about 100 cameras placed along the Antarctic Peninsula and unlike the AAD’s, relies on artificial intelligence to process the images. Networks like these are now critical to track the incursion of Avian Influenza and planning is underway to check some of the more remote parts of the AAD network near Davis research station before the end of the research season. The AAD will also revisit its bird flu management protocols. “We need to make sure all our expeditioners know what their responsibilities are and where the disinfectant is and what to do if there are signs of the virus,” Dr Emmerson said. “We can’t stop it spreading through the natural migratory process, but we can stop ourselves moving it around and that’s what we need to focus on.” A network of cameras monitors bird populations in East Antarctica.

Kittisak Kaewchalun / iStock The review, conducted by researchers with Pfizer and Belgian research company P95, looked at observational and interventional studies published from 2000 through 2022 on the vaccine efficacy (VE) and overall effect of the PCV7, PCV9, PCV10, or PCV13 vaccines against viral RTIs. Given the synergistic interactions between viral and bacterial pathogens and the hypothesis that the effectiveness of PCVs against all-cause pneumonia might be linked to reduction of viral-associated pneumonia episodes, the researchers wanted to evaluate the evidence on the effects PCV against virus-related RTIs in children and adults. Of the 16 studies that were included in the final analysis, 13 described the effects of PCVs against viral RTIs in children and 3 included data on adults. In children, data from 4 studies showed VE against influenza ranged from 41% to 86%, except for the 2010-2011 flu season, and a randomized controlled trial showed PCV9 displayed efficacy against any viral RTI, human seasonal coronavirus, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus. In adults, PCV13 VE ranged from 4% to 25% against viral lower RTI, 32% to 35% against COVID-19 outcomes, 24% to 51% against human seasonal coronavirus, and 13% to 36% against influenza A lower RTI. No protection was found against adenovirus or rhinovirus in children or adults. Broader public health benefits The study authors say the simplest explanation is that PCVs are preventing pneumococcal-viral coinfections. But they also suggest that the vaccines, by influencing pneumococcal carriage in the upper airway, may modify host susceptibility to viral lower RTIs. They say further research is needed to confirm the findings and to further explore the clinical benefits and broader public health impacts of PCVs at a population level. They concluded, "If results from studies conducted to date are corroborated, PCV protection against RTIs beyond those due to pneumococci might better capture the full spectrum of public health benefits of PCVs, thereby informing vaccine policymaking and economic evaluations." Study finds racial, ethnic disparities in broad-spectrum antibiotics in kids News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship PeopleImages / iStock A single-center study of children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections found that children in certain racial and ethnic groups were more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics than White children, researchers reported late last week in the Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. For the retrospective cohort study, researchers from the University of Washington, Seattle Children's Research Institute, and Seattle Children's Hospital analyzed all patients aged 18 years and younger hospitalized with respiratory illnesses at Seattle Children's Hospital from October 2020 to April 2023. While studies conducted in pediatric emergency department settings have identified racial disparities in antibiotic prescribing, prescribing disparities in pediatric inpatient settings have not been well documented. The primary outcome of the study was any antibiotic use and any use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Of the 1,779 patients included in the analysis, roughly half received at least one dose of a systemic antibiotic, with no statistically significant difference in antibiotic receipt by racial or ethnic group. But in an adjusted analysis that excluded children with conditions that generally warrant antibiotics, Asian children were nearly five times as likely (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35 to 17.9) to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics when compared with non-Hispanic White children. When the analysis was further adjusted to remove intensive care unit admission and insurance, Asian children (aOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.94 to 2.85) remained more likely than non-Hispanic White children to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with Hispanic (aOR, 1.97; 95% 1.24 to 3.13), non-Hispanic Black (aOR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.16 to 5.36), and unknown/other (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.13) children. No reason for disparities in prescribing The authors say the findings are surprising, since studies conducted in ambulatory settings have generally found that Black and Hispanic children are less likely to receive antibiotics for viral respiratory tract infections and bronchitis than White children. Furthermore, there's no biological or medical reason for differences across racial and ethnic groups. "Further research is needed to identify the factors driving these disparities and to develop strategies that ensure equitable and effective antibiotic utilization practices by pediatric providers," they wrote. Estimated risk of mpox hospitalization 4% in UK epidemic, with higher risk in women News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Mpox NIAID In a study of UK mpox patients in 2022, the risk of hospitalization was 4% overall, with a much higher risk in women than in men that could be due to increased disease severity or lower illness detection in women, the researchers said. The investigators, from the UK Health Security Agency in London, published the results yesterday in Nature Communications. In the 2022 epidemic, mpox was first detected in the United Kingdom on May 7, followed by rapid transmission around the world. In July, the World Health Organization declared the primarily sexually transmitted infection, which spread mainly among men who have sex with men, a public health emergency of international concern. 'Considerable' uncertainty about risk in women A total of 3,375 UK residents tested positive for mpox from June to September, with an estimated 74.7% case capture. The estimated modeled risk of hospitalization was 4.1%, while the overall sample case hospitalization risk was 5.1%. The average time from infection to hospitalization was 14.9 days, and the average length of hospital stay was 7.1 days. For women, the estimated sample case hospitalization risk was 17.9%, compared with 5.0% for men. "However, there is considerable uncertainty due to the small number of female cases in the clinical and surveillance data," the study authors wrote. The team called for ongoing public health surveillance to limit the healthcare burden in affected countries. Quick takes: Next-gen coronavirus vaccines, H9N2 avian flu case in China, fatal plague in New Mexico News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Plague An international research consortium that specializes in human-challenge studies has announced the launch of a $57 million project to test inhaled and nasal vaccines with a goal of stopping infection from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced yesterday. The project is led by Imperial College London and is cofounded by the European Union's Horizon Union Programme and CEPI. China has reported another human infection involving H9N2 avian flu, the first of 2024, according to a weekly avian flu update from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection. The patient is a 6-year-old boy from Anhui province whose symptoms began on January 3. The report did not say how the child contracted the virus. H9N2 infections are typically mild and reported in children. The virus is known to circulate in poultry in some Asian countries. The New Mexico Department of Health last week reported a fatal plague case, which involves a man from Lincoln County who had been hospitalized. The infection is the state's first since 2021, and the man's death is the first plague-related fatality since 2020. Rodents can harbor the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis. The disease can spread to humans through bites from infected fleas or from direct contact with animals, including rodents, wildlife, and pets.

Update, March 2024 – Penguins on the sub-Antarctic Islands of South Georgia have tested positive for Avian flu. This is the first time the virus has been detected in gentoo and king penguin populations on the islands. Several individual penguins have tested positive for High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI), including five king penguins from Will point, on the north east coast of the islands, and five gentoo penguins from nearby Bird Island. South Georgia is a haven for wildlife and research programmes are in place to study the penguins, seals and seabirds that live there. HPAI was first detected in brown skuas at Bird Island, South Georgia in October 2023. In early 2024, cases were confirmed in populations of elephant seals and fur seals. Antarctic terns and wandering albatross later tested positive. However, effects of infection appear to remain highly localised. Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) coming ashore at Bird Island. The team at British Antarctic Survey (BAS), at Cambridge and on the islands at both King Edward Point and Bird Island, are working closely in collaboration with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI), who govern the territory. Recent samples were collected from the islands and were tested at the International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratories in Weybridge, UK. There are two British research stations on South Georgia: King Edward Point and Bird Island. As a result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, fieldwork involving close contact with impacted species has been suspended. BAS staff continue to follow strict GSGSSI biosecurity measures adopted this season of enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment when moving between sites with high densities of wildlife, as well as remaining vigilant for signs of disease. Dr Norman Ratcliffe is a bird ecologist at BAS and has worked on penguins and seabirds on South Georgia. He says: “The highly pathogenic form of bird flu has been present on South Georgia since October and we are surprised penguins have only just become infected, given their high nesting densities and proximity to other species that have been affected. The mortality this has caused for gentoo penguins has been localised and brief but we will continue to monitor the spread and impacts of the disease. Macaroni Penguins will remain vulnerable as they gather in large concentrations to moult but subsequently will disperse to sea where transmission will be low. Gentoo and king penguins, however, continue to form communal roosts or to breed, respectively, throughout the winter and so may remain at risk.” Elements of the wider science programme at King Edward Point and Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, grey-headed albatross, northern and southern giant petrels, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins. King penguins amongst elephant seals at St Andrews Bay in South Georgia South Georgia has some of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. BAS and GSGSSI are working closely with DEFRA’s Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA) to monitor and control the spread of the disease and to understand the impact on the region’s wildlife. Professor Ash Banyard, APHA’s Head of influenza and avian virology said: “South Georgia is home to some of our most unique and special wildlife and is of great importance to international biodiversity, so it is sad to witness the effects of avian influenza on these populations. However, these cases remain fairly isolated, and we are not seeing a rapid spread through penguin colonies. “As a world leading International Reference Laboratory, our Weybridge site will continue to work with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands and the British Antarctic Survey to monitor the impact of the wildlife on South Georgia, and the potential spread to other areas.” Although detections of H5N1 in mammalian species continue genetic sequence data analysed to date has indicated that there is no increased risk to human health and the risk of human infection with H5N1 remains very low.

Altering current flu vaccines is not as simple as 'ticking a box' Credit: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg Juliet Morrison, assistant professor in the microbiology and plant pathology department at the University of California, Riverside, said she was “excited to hear the news that the Yamagata virus was no longer a threat to public health.”“This is a win for all humans because we now have one less influenza virus to fight off,” she said.That the strain disappeared during an extended period of health restrictions “also provides strong evidence that public safety measures like masking and isolation work well to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses,” Prof Morrison added.However, its disappearance creates a headache for vaccine manufacturers.The current generation of flu jabs are quadrivalent – they target all four influenza viruses – and are updated every six months depending on what sub-strains are in circulation.Vaccine-makers proffer recommendations for the northern and southern hemispheres each spring and autumn, based on the influenza trends recorded during their respective winters.But with B/Yamagata now eliminated, there is no longer a need for quadrivalent vaccines. Manufacturers must instead develop trivalent versions to target the three remaining influenza viruses.Yet altering vaccines is not so simple as “a tick of the box,” said Prof Subbarao, who sits on the WHO expert panel responsible for recommending biannual changes to the flu jab.In order to roll out trivalent vaccines for both hemispheres, “the immediate challenge for manufacturers is to establish licences,” she added, as the new jabs will need fresh regulatory approval.As of now, with the autumn rollout still a long way off in the northern hemisphere, “we have a window of opportunity” to reduce the quadrivalent vaccine to a trivalent iteration, said Prof Subbarao.“[But] the big challenge with influenza viruses is that we make decisions six months ahead of what goes into the vaccine, and the virus continues to evolve,” she said. By the time notable patterns have been observed, recommendations made and vaccines have been changed accordingly, things might have shifted again.“We don’t ever seem to get it quite right,” she conceded.‘We have to improve our vaccines’There is also the risk that the B/Yamagata one day makes a resurgence. History shows it’s a possibility.During the Nineties, the Victoria B strain of influenza appeared only periodically during testing, but became prevalent again in Asia-Pacific at various points over the following decade.Following the WHO ruling that B/Yamagata is “no longer warranted,” the US last week announced that it would update its vaccine in time for its winter rollout, which usually occurs in the autumn months ahead of the sudden drop in temperatures.There were concerns that the shift from quadrivalent to trivalent could not be made in time – though this has moved faster than expected, perhaps due to American manufacturers already having trivalent vaccine approvals.Other countries may struggle to be as nimble.There will also be a knock-on effect for vaccines in development, too. Moderna and Pfizer have quadrivalent mRNA vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials that contain B/Yamagata, while a Novavax jab that’s currently being trialled also targets the strain.“We have to improve our influenza vaccines, absolutely no doubt about it,” said Prof Subbarao.If the mRNA vaccines currently being developed do work for flu, “we will be able to push back the vaccine strain selection decision a little later,” said Prof Subbarao, as they are able to be tweaked later on in the development process.“We are always wishing for four more weeks, so that might help,” added Prof Subbarao.Still, “the goal that everybody has in mind is having a universal influenza vaccine, where you don’t have to change it every year: something that elicits broadly cross-reactive immunity.”“We’re not there yet,” she added. “There’s a lot of exciting science, but we’re not there yet.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Flu was on a downward trend but we’ve seen a resurgence of flu. And in general, we are seeing an increase in seasonal respiratory problems, some bad asthma, some babies with bronchiolitis, or coughing and congestion in the small airways. We’re not seeing RSV, but we’re seeing viruses cause that same type of illness.”Dr. Mohamed Siddique -- Director of Internal Medicine at DMC Sinai-Grace Hospital“Right now we’re not seeing any major illness problem. COVID has plateaued. Even the flu cases: in the month of February, we had a significant increase in influenza, but that has decreased because of the weather and we are at the tail end of the flu season. Also, we’re seeing the common medical conditions of heart failure, COPD and uncontrolled diabetes. Unfortunately, some of those patients are coming back in after losing insurance due to job loss or other situations, after not taking their medicines or taking care of themselves for a while. Often their symptoms are worse, so we work with them to improve their health.”Dr. Zafar Shamoon -- Emergency Center Chief, Corewell Health Dearborn Hospital“We are on high alert for any potential measles cases. We are still seeing patients struggling with gastrointestinal viruses and also, children with injuries related to outdoor play. Good time to encourage parents to have their children wear helmets.”Oakland County – Spring allergies, asthma and COPD flare-ups, COVID, influenzaDr. Steve McGraw -- Director of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Southfield and Novi“I’m still seeing the usual springtime illnesses including asthma and COPD flare ups. Patients continue to come in with COVID-19; but, the numbers are much better than a month ago. I’m seeing a similar drop in frequency in cases of patients with Influenza. This is just a reminder to the community, as kids are riding bikes please make sure to slow down around school routes and neighborhood streets. Also, if you’re 65 or older, consider getting the new Covid booster available at most pharmacies for the new variants.”Dr. Justin Skrzynski -- Internal medicine physician, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak“Cases of respiratory viruses like influenza and COVID are thankfully dropping off, and hopefully, the warmer weather helps keep people out of the hospital. Taking some walks outside is one of the best and most accessible ways to get moving and shake off the winter!”Washtenaw County – Spring allergies, asthma flare-ups, respiratory viruses, influenzaWashtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Upper respiratory viruses, pneumonia, spring allergies, asthma flare-upsDr. Spencer Johnson -- ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“We are currently seeing viral upper respiratory infections and pneumonia at pretty steady doses, along with exacerbation of chronic conditions.

Of those, 2,399 were positive for Covid-19, 995 positive for influenza and 1,718 negative for both.A year after their PCR test, participants were asked about ongoing symptoms and impairment using a questionnaire delivered by SMS link. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Overall, 16% reported ongoing symptoms a year later, and 3.6% reported moderate-to-severe impairment in their daily activities.The results of the study, which Gerrard will present next month at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Barcelona, found no evidence that those who had Covid-19 were more likely to have functional limitations a year on compared with those who did not have Covid-19 (3.0% v 4.1%).The 3% of the study participants who had ongoing impairments after Covid-19 infection was similar to the 3.4% with ongoing impairments after influenza.The study also looked at specific symptoms in the patients who had moderate to severe impairment, and found in both patients who were Covid positive and negative, the same percentage (94%) reported one or more of the commonly reported symptoms of long Covid: fatigue, post exertional symptom exacerbation, brain fog and changes to taste and smell.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They wrongly imply there is something unique and exceptional about longer-term symptoms associated with this virus. This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.”In a press conference on Friday, Gerrard said: “I want to make it clear that the symptoms that some patients described after having Covid-19 are real, and we believe they are real. What we are saying is that the incidence of these symptoms is no greater in Covid-19 than it is with other respiratory viruses, and that to use this term ‘long Covid’ is misleading and I believe harmful.”The researchers acknowledged the findings are associations and do not represent prevalence, and acknowledged limitations in that participants who attended hospital or had pre-existing illness were not identifiable. They also said because 90% of people in Queensland were vaccinated when Omicron emerged, the lower severity of long Covid could be due to vaccination and the variant.Prof Philip Britton, a paediatric infectious diseases physician from the University of Sydney and a member of the Long Covid Australia Collaboration, welcomed the study given the lack of published research from Australia in this area.However, Britton said the conclusion that it was time to stop using terms such as long Covid was “overstated and potentially unhelpful. Long Covid has been a global phenomenon, recognised by WHO.”Prof Jeremy Nicholson, the director of the Australian National Phenome Centre at Murdoch University, said the question of whether long Covid is unique “cannot be simply answered in this work”.“The study is observational, based on reported symptoms with no physiological or detailed functional follow-up data. Without laboratory pathophysiological assessment of individual patients, it is impossible to say that this is indistinguishable from flu-related or any other post-viral syndrome,” Nicholson said. The headline of this article was amended on 16 March 2024 to clarify that it was the Queensland chief health officer’s conclusion that the use of the term ‘long Covid’ should stop, rather than it being a finding contained in the study.Explore more on these topicsLong CovidHealthCoronavirusInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The child contracted the H1N1 strain of influenza A, the department said Friday.Influenza-related deaths have been on the rise nationally. So far there have been 103 deaths this season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 182 for the 2022-23 season, 49 during the 2021-22 season, and just one during the 2020-21 season.Sponsor The state is seeing a surge in cases according to a report by state. There were 8,873 patient visits to the hospital due to an influenza-like illness out of 147,388 outpatient visits during the week of March 2.

What it means in MichiganMeth makes a comeback in Michigan, even as drug fight focuses on opioidsOnly 25% of Michigan residents have been vaccinated against the flu for the 2023-24 flu season, the state reported. It says the goal is to have 4 million Michiganders vaccinated by the end of the flu season and the most recent data suggests about 2.8 million doses have been administered. “Each year influenza claims the lives of dozens of children across the United States,” said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive. “This is why MDHHS continues to strongly recommend that everyone six months of age and older get a seasonal flu vaccine. It’s the best way to protect yourself and your family from getting sick and reduce illness severity if someone does get the flu.”When people go in to get the COVID-19 vaccine they can also be vaccinated against the flu.Individuals who contract the flu can get early treatment with an antiviral which can prevent the infection from becoming severe, the state says.Residents can contact their healthcare providers or local health departments to get more information about where to get vaccinated. “Ideally when we vaccinate our children we vaccinate them at the beginning of the season which traditionally is August or September of each year,” said Kira Sieplinga, a pediatric hospitalist for Corewell Health, during a press conference on Monday. “However, the vaccine is still available and still effective, and so we would encourage you all to get your children vaccinated. Some children may need two doses of the vaccine within the same season."

Why Do Some Vaccines Work Better Than Others? March 11, 2024 Share This If someone is vaccinated against the measles virus, they likely won’t get measles. If someone is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, there’s still a good chance they’ll get COVID-19—maybe multiple times. Not all vaccines "work" the same. Source: Asian Development Bank/Flickr. A quick glance at the above example and one might think the measles vaccine “works,” and the COVID-19 vaccine doesn’t—with “works” implying complete prevention of disease. But what does it mean for a vaccine to be effective? That depends on the virus. And how much it's spreading. And the type of vaccine. And the immune response stimulated by the vaccine. In short, it’s complicated. What is clear is that it’s less about whether vaccines are good or bad (note: they are, in principle, very good), and more about defining what we should expect of them. I Got Vaccinated—So Why Am I Sick? Vaccines help the body recognize pathogens as foreign entities and quickly mount an attack against them. Often, people think this means vaccines are designed to prevent infection, or facilitate elimination of a pathogen before it colonizes its host (known as “sterilizing immunity”). This has led to the misconception—fueled in part by unclear messaging on the part of scientists and media—that if someone gets sick with a pathogen they were vaccinated against, the vaccine failed. While sterilizing immunity would be an ideal outcome, it is not currently attainable. Instead, vaccines are largely geared toward preventing disease (i.e., the outcome of infection), which can also help minimize the spread of the virus. With that in mind, some vaccines do an excellent job of preventing disease, though no vaccine can so 100% of the time. Many vaccines simply prevent severe disease—they may not, and were never meant to, stop sickness altogether. They can, however, keep a disease from being much worse than it might be without vaccination. A vaccine can also curb hospitalizations, which is not only good for the vaccinated person, but also eases burdens on health care systems. Moreover, vaccines are safer than immunity gained through natural infections, which can lead to chronic conditions (e.g., long COVID, long flu, etc.) The type of protection a vaccine affords, and thus what to expect of it, is determined by scientists, based on clinical trials, and by analyzing how the vaccine performs “in the real world.” It is rooted in a slew of interacting factors related to the virus, the type of vaccine, when and how often it is administered and more. To understand how these factors influence vaccine responses, let’s look at a few examples. COVID-19 Vaccines: Prevent Severe Disease The Virus SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a single-stranded RNA virus. These viruses are notoriously sloppy replicators. They are prone to developing random mutations as they replicate in a population, meaning SARS-CoV-2 mutations happen pretty regularly, and their severity depends on where in the genome they occur. Some of those mutations become “fixed” if they help the pathogen evade immunity and transmit between hosts. For SARS-CoV-2, mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to infect host cells and COVID-19 vaccines are designed to target, can lead to variants that circumvent vaccine-induced immunity. The Vaccine Most COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines. These vaccines are given as an intramuscular injection and contain the genetic code (mRNA) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Host cells use this code to produce copies of the viral protein, which immune cells memorize and will respond to if they are exposed to the viral protein in the future. Ultimately, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines trigger a robust antibody response that wanes significantly over several months. Depiction of mRNA vaccine-induced antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Source: American Society for Microbiology. Administration New vaccine formulations that target dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants are regularly released, with the vaccination schedule reflecting this. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), everyone should receive at least 1 dose of the most updated COVID-19 vaccine (based on the XBB.1.5 variant), with variations based on previous vaccination status, age and more. Expectation When the COVID-19 vaccines first came out, clinical trials suggested they were incredibly effective at preventing illness. However, those expectations were revised as the vaccines were widely deployed (the first time this was done with mRNA vaccines), and the virus continued to mutate. Further research has shown that vaccines are most effective in the first 6 months following vaccination, with a 2023 meta-analysis suggesting that 6 months after primary vaccination COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are less than 20% effective. Today, the vaccines’ primary purpose—and something they do better long-term—is to protect against severe COVID-19 that can lead to hospitalization and death. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines: Protect Against Cancer The Virus Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small DNA virus. Most HPV types are transmitted sexually, and some cause cancer, namely cervical cancer. Notably, vaccine-induced immunity against HPV is relatively stable. This is, in part, because host DNA polymerase, which the virus uses for replication, does not tolerate errors the way RNA polymerase (used by ssRNA viruses) does. As a result, random mutations rarely become fixed. The Vaccine HPV vaccines are composed of virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs consist of capsid proteins from 2, 4 or 9 different HPV types that cause cancer, depending on the vaccine. The proteins self-assemble into particles that mimic the size and shape of a virus but are not infectious or replicative. This structural similarity to “real” virus means that VLPs induce a durable and long-lasting immune response, with high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the vaccine HPV types. Administration HPV vaccination begins in early adolescence; the goal is to protect people against the virus prior to exposure. The vaccine is administered via intramuscular injection. People receive 2-3 doses, depending on the age they received their first dose. This is to ensure robust immune response, as younger age (9-12 years old) is associated with a higher antibody response to the vaccines. Booster doses are not needed. Expectation The HPV vaccines pack a punch—according to the CDC, they can prevent more than 90% of cancers caused by HPV. The vaccines also minimize infections by the 2 most prevalent, high-risk HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18). This could be because the beginning of the HPV life cycle is slow to start, requiring few neutralizing antibodies to combat the virus. While people can expect high protection against HPV vaccine types, infections are still possible. Taking other preventive steps (e.g., regular cervical cancer screenings) is important. Flu Vaccines: Take Disease from "Wild to Mild" The Virus Influenza A virus. Source: NIAID/Flickr. Like SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, which causes flu, is an ssRNA virus. As it spreads, the surface proteins it uses to infect cells (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) acquire random mutations. Flu vaccines target 1 or more of these surface proteins; when new variants arise, they may or may not match what the vaccine trained immune cells to recognize. Some influenza viruses that cause sickness (e.g., H3N2) undergo genetic changes more frequently than others (e.g., H1N1), which can further impact vaccine effectiveness. The Vaccine There are different types of flu vaccines, all of which are similarly effective. Some vaccines contain influenza viruses that have been chemically disrupted (inactivated), so they cannot replicate. Others, known as subunit vaccines, contain only purified virus antigen (proteins that elicit an immune response). Because the latter types only contain part of the virus, they may not trigger as strong of an immune response as a whole virus. There are vaccine formulations that contain higher amounts of antigen or an adjuvant (a compound that enhances an immune response) to address this. Administration Given the shiftiness of the flu virus, and waning immunity, it is recommended that everyone 6 months of age and older get 1 flu vaccine every year before flu season begins (i.e., by the end of October), with some exceptions. Expectation When developing flu vaccines, scientists survey the influenza variants circulating in the human population and select the 4 they think will be dominant come flu season. Sometimes their educated guesses are better than others, meaning someone may get flu 1 year but not the next. If there is a good match between the flu vaccine and spreading influenza viruses, vaccines are about 40-60% effective at preventing flu. However, should a vaccinated person get the flu, the illness will likely be less severe than if they weren’t vaccinated—i.e., the disease goes from “wild to mild.” Measles (MMR) Vaccine: Nearly 100% Effective at Staving Off Disease The Virus Measles virus is a highly contagious respiratory virus currently spreading across the U.S., the U.K. and other countries around the world. Compared to some other viruses, measles has a notable attribute: it is unlikely to evade vaccine-induced immunity. It’s not that measles doesn’t mutate—like other ssRNA viruses, it does. Rather, the surface proteins needed for measles to infect cells (and used by immune cells to detect the pathogen) do not tolerate mutations—that is, mutations render the proteins ineffective, which is detrimental to the virus’ ability to infect host cells. Infectious virus therefore remains recognizable to the host immune system. The Vaccine Measles virus. Source: NIAID/Flickr. The measles vaccine (i.e., the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine) is a live-attenuated vaccine. In contrast to mRNA or subunit vaccines, it contains whole, live measles virus that has been weakened and doesn’t replicate well inside the host. During vaccination, just enough of the virus is given to stimulate an immune response. Because vaccination closely mimics natural infection, live-attenuated vaccines are extremely good at inducing robust, long-lasting immunity. Administration The MMR vaccine is generally administered (once again by intramuscular injection) via a 2-dose regimen during childhood, starting at 12-15 months of age. Adults who do not have evidence of immunity can also get vaccinated. Unlike other types of vaccines, booster doses are not usually necessary—immunity is considered to be lifelong. Expectation The stability of the measles virus, coupled with the vaccine type, make for a stellar combination. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles for life (though breakthrough infections can happen in very rare cases). When measles outbreaks occur, cases are largely concentrated in unvaccinated populations. Ultimately, what it means to be “protected” by a vaccine is shaped by how much a virus mutates (and where in the genome those mutations occur), how closely a vaccine mimics natural infection (and thus triggers robust, long-lasting immunity), vaccine formulation and how frequently it is administered. The Significance of Viral Spread But there is 1 thing that holds true across all vaccines: how much a virus is spreading also impacts how “well” the vaccine works. This is somewhat intuitive. If a virus is running rampant in a population, more people are likely to get sick. Vaccines may help, but the magnitude of circulation, and how immune-evasive the virus may be, simply creates more opportunities for infection. The prevalence of a virus can change over time. Influenza, for example, has seasonal peaks and valleys. This doesn’t mean the influenza virus isn’t around outside of flu season. What it does mean is that even with vaccines, the virus is spreading so much more during the colder months that more people will inevitably fall ill. The same idea applies for diseases with high vaccine-induced protection, like measles. In the setting of an outbreak, even if only a small number of vaccinated individuals become infected with measles (about 3 in 100 people who received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine develop measles if exposed to the virus), this can account for a large number of cases. Depending on the virus, the more hosts a virus infects, the more opportunities for immune-evasive variants to arise and spread. This also helps dictate how well existing vaccines can train the immune system to deal with the virus. The Host Matters Too Scientists study how effective a vaccine is on the scale of populations and communities, but on the scale of individuals, results can vary. Indeed, there are numerous factors that shape how a person responds to vaccines, including age, genetics, the gut microbiota, stress, exercise frequency, sleep patterns and more. Having certain comorbidities (e.g., those affecting the kidney, heart and lungs) can also make a difference. It’s worth noting that immunity naturally decreases over time, which is among the reasons why older populations are more vulnerable to disease. Coupled with other factors (virus type and spread, vaccine formulation and more), this can happen more quickly for some vaccines than others. Numerous host-intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence how someone responds to a vaccine. Source: Zimmermann P. and Curtis N./Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 2019. How to Think About Vaccines It would be great if every vaccine prevented a person from getting sick. The reality, and something most people already know first-hand, is that most vaccines don’t work that way. But that doesn’t mean they don’t work at all. The bottom line: all vaccines are protective. The key is understanding—and, on the part of scientists, communicating—what protection means in the context of each vaccine, and shaping expectations accordingly.

But its use raises many ethical and scientific issuesBy Carol Cardona & Michelle Kromm Alexey Rezvykh/Alamy Stock PhotoRecently, a group of scientists announced a breakthrough approach to combat Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird flu or avian flu), a severe illness of birds that has killed millions of chickens worldwide since it emerged in 1996 and continues to devastate bird populations. This disease has quickly become a potential threat to human health and has affected both food prices and availability.Their approach uses a gene-editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9. In general, this method changes defined segments of an animal’s genetic code to functionally alter what that code does. In this case, CRISPR was used to alter chickens’ genetic code to make chickens more resistant to avian flu. While this was a fascinating use of the technology, any time scientific innovation affects the food we eat, it becomes a sensitive issue. On top of philosophical concerns regarding the use of CRISPR within our food supply, we think there are too many unpredictable outcomes related to combating avian influenza with CRISPR-modified chickens to expect this technology will be a solution to this destructive disease.While CRISPR has created almost infinite opportunities to address some of the health-related challenges facing society, including recent therapies for sickle cell disease in humans, it’s not likely to be successful in controlling avian influenza. All avian influenza viruses originate in waterfowl, such as ducks, which serve as a constant source of potentially new viruses to infect poultry populations. Avian flu viruses also readily change—or mutate—their genetic material, allowing the viruses to quickly adapt to different hosts beyond poultry. This ability to quickly evolve also rapidly changes the way the virus spreads, making it challenging to control and the impact of any intervention difficult to foresee.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

In 2014 and 2015, a strain of avian flu virus that was new to North America made its way to the West Coast from Eurasia and caused dramatic and widespread disease outbreaks in poultry before disappearing in the summer of 2015. In 2022, a related strain made its way to the East Coast of North America causing an even wider spread and more devastating outbreak.The 2022 virus has developed a different survival strategy by persisting in waterfowl populations for longer periods and over different life stages. And although our current control approaches—such as destruction of infected and nearby poultry, increased testing in areas surrounding infected farms, and restrictions on the movements of animals and their products—are imperfect, the magnitude of these outbreaks would not have changed if there had been CRISPR-modified chickens on farms because the outbreaks were and are likely to still be driven by virus introductions from wild ducks.This combination of genetic variability and the wide variety of birds and mammals that can be infected with avian flu will make it very difficult to predict the outcome of using CRISPR to increase the resistance of chickens to infection with avian flu. There is a real chance for unintended or unpredictable consequences. For example, as soon as the virus has trouble infecting CRISPR-modified chickens, it will change and adapt. While most changes won’t help the virus survive, there might be one among the billions of changes that will. Such a mutation could lead to a more deadly outbreak of avian flu in chickens, which could be catastrophic for this segment of our food supply. And it’s possible that one of the billions of changes that make it easier for the virus to survive in CRISPR-modified chickens could also make it more likely to be able to infect mammals including humans.So, even though we understand a lot about influenza viruses, there’s even more we don’t understand.Finally, in addition to all the virological implications of using CRISPR to alter chickens’ susceptibility to avian flu we need to consider how people might perceive this technology within the food supply. The companies that grow poultry are not only experts in animal husbandry and welfare but also in marketing and product differentiation, and sometimes use language that creates consumer confusion and misperception. For instance, in the U.S., it is illegal to feed hormones to poultry or pigs, yet companies label their products as being “no hormones added” in an attempt to suggest that other companies might be doing so. We can envision one company advertising their “influenza-resistant” chickens as more environmentally sustainable to sway consumers, while another company might respond by warning consumers of the dangers of genetic engineering to create the perception that their non–genetically engineered chickens are “safer” for human consumption. Such marketing techniques are already in use around other genetically modified (or, as they’re now labeled, “bioengineered”) agricultural products, such as corn, canola, soybeans and sugar beets.That being said, scientific innovation plays a crucial role in addressing the grand challenges of climate change, food safety and carbon footprint reduction across all types of food production. We should use CRISPR to improve the environmental and economic sustainability of production, but any company or research group using genetic engineering techniques to modify the food we eat needs to be clear about the effects of these innovations to ensure public trust. We cannot create an opportunity for failure, or we will not have another chance.Avian flu outbreaks threaten animal health, human health and food security, and we need to develop better prevention strategies and promote accepted strategies such as vaccination to keep this aspect of our food supply stable. But using CRISPR to alter chickens to be more resistant to avian flu is not the way to go.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Carol Cardona is an influenza scientist who holds the B.S.

Of more immediate concern is evidence the disease, once largely confined to bird species, appears to be spreading between mammals. This strain has already killed a handful of dolphins in Chile and Peru, some 50,000 seals and sea lions along the coasts, and at least half a million birds regionwide. To confirm mammal-to-mammal transmission, scientists would likely need to test infections in live animals. "It's almost certainly happened," said Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. "It's pretty hard to explain some of these large infections and die off without having mammal-to-mammal spread." The strain has shown up in dozens of bird species, including some migrating species, which can spread it beyond the region, scientists told Reuters. As climate change escalates, animals will be forced to move into new territories, mixing with one another in new ways and possibly boosting opportunities for the virus to further mutate. "It's a matter of time before you will detect the first South American strain in North America," said Alonzo Alfaro-Nunez, a viral ecologist at University of Copenhagen. Human risk The growing concern has prompted the 35 countries in the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to convene regional health experts and officials at a meeting this week in Rio de Janeiro. The group plans to launch the world's first regional commission to oversee avian influenza monitoring and response efforts, a PAHO official told Reuters. This has not been previously reported. Since the virus was first detected in Colombia in October 2022, there have been two known cases in humans on the continent, one each in Ecuador and Chile. Both came from exposure to infected birds. While those patients survived, H5N1 bird flu is deadly to humans in roughly 60% of cases worldwide. The World Health Organization is unlikely to raise the risk level for humans from the current "low" without evidence of human-to-human transmission or mutations adapted to human receptors, experts said. Drugmakers, including GSK GSK.L and Moderna MRNA.O, have said they are developing bird flu vaccines for humans, and have the capacity to produce hundreds of million so doses within months utilizing production lines used for seasonal flu vaccines. "We're seeing (the virus) doing little evolutionary steps that are on the long-term moving towards a potential human infection," said Ralph Vanstreels, a University of California, Davis researcher studying South American variants of H5N1. Every year, Argentina's Peninsula Valdes on the windswept Atlantic coast teems with densely packed elephant seals rearing pups. Last November, Vanstreels came across a grim scene: hundreds of dead and rotting pups on the beach. Researchers estimate 17,400 pups died, nearly all born to the colony that year. For each of those pups to have been infected by birds is highly unlikely, scientists said. Pups usually have contact only with their mothers, leading scientists to suspect this is how it spread. Vanstreels is part of a group of scientists working to trace the virus' genetic mutations in South America. In a draft paper posted on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, they analyzed samples from sea lions, seals and birds from up the coast from Peninsula Valdes. Comparing the genomes from these samples with those collected in North America in 2022 and Asia earlier, the team identified nine new mutations. The same mutations were found in samples collected in 2022 and 2023 in Chile and Peru, which were also hit by mass mortality of sea lions and birds. "This is the first time this virus is so adapted to wildlife," Vanstreels said. "Clearly something happened in Peru and in northern Chile where they acquired these new mutations." In the draft paper, researchers noted that the same mutations were present in one of the continent's two human cases, a 53-year-old man who lived one block from the seashore where seabirds congregated. Researchers said that case "highlights the potential threat posed by these viruses to public health." Regional response With health officials and experts meeting in Rio this week, Latin American countries will be pressed to boost disease surveillance in the wild. The region's patchy data and limited resources has left scientists struggling to understand how the disease is spreading in the wild, with the number of cases likely much higher than reported. Some cases are not being sampled or lab-tested, scientists said. Bolivia, for example, did not register a case in the wild last year, though the disease has been detected in surrounding countries, said Manuel Jose Sanchez Vazquez, epidemiology coordinator for PAHO's veterinary health center. Managing the disease response can also be complex, Sanchez noted. Threats to humans are dealt with by public health officials, while threats to poultry or livestock fall to agriculture or veterinary authorities. In wild animals, the purview typically falls to environmental officials. The new regional commission, expected to be announced on Thursday, would aim to set standard protocols for monitoring, handling and reporting cases among various government agencies. It could also help in pooling laboratory resources, Sanchez said. "We are worried and we are vigilant," Sanchez said. "The more adaptation of the virus to mammals, the more likely it is that transmission to humans could happen."

(Photo: Michael Wenger) Initial results from an international expedition along the West Antarctic Peninsula reveal that Adélie penguins are unaffected carriers of avian flu. Adélie penguins carrying the HPAI H5N1 virus, i.e. highly pathogenic avian influenza, have been detected in Antarctica, but they are symptom-free carriers. A partial blow to Antarctic wildlife. BioRxiv (pronounced bioarchive), will publish a peer-reviewed article next week, but information is already circulating between universities and the media. Since the virus first appeared in skuas, Chile and international scientific bodies have been coordinating their efforts to monitor the unprecedented spread of the epidemic around the Antarctic continent. This austral summer, two scientific expeditions sailed along the Antarctic peninsula. The first aboard the ice-breaking expedition cruise vessel named after the famous French explorer commander, the second aboard Janequeo of the Chilean Armada. In total, thirteen sites were monitored, three by the cruise vessel and the Institut océanographique, Fondation Albert Ier, Prince de Monaco, ten by the Chileans from the Millennium Institute Biodiversity of Antarctic and Subantarctic Ecosystems (BASE). Out of 115 samples taken, eight Adélie penguins and one Antarctic shag tested positive in PCR tests carried out by the Catholic University of Chile. No emperor are positive. A positive case of avian influenza has been detected for the first time in Antarctic cormorants (Leucocarbo bransfieldensis). (Photo: Michael Wenger) The cormorant and some Adélie penguins originate from Red Rock Ridge, a place at the coast of Graham Land in the west-central part of the peninsula. The remaining Adélie carriers live in the northern part of the peninsula, on Danger Island. Before disembarking in the Zodiacs, each team made sure that “there were no signs of mass mortality”, recalls Céline Le Bohec, French penguin researcher from CNRS and Centre Scientifique de Monaco on the first expedition. Dressed in sterile overalls, masks and gloves, the researchers focused their attention on symptom-free individuals, which were in a condition to successfully complete their reproductive cycle. Two Chilean Antarctic research institutions, INACH and Instituto Milenio BASE, are monitoring the spread of the virus.(Photo: INACH) They equipped several penguins with GPS and are still tracking them. “I can tell they’re doing well,” she continues. “The virus is present, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting them. On the one hand, this is reassuring, as it doesn’t threaten their survival, but on the other hand it’s worrying because they could be used as Trojan horses.” Adélies are found all around the continent. The virus could spread rapidly and infect other, more sensitive animals. Complete sequencing of the virus RNA is currently underway for each case. It will enable scientists to establish a map of variants, and understand the evolution of HPAI H5N1 during its expansion between South America and Antarctica.

These groups face heightened risks, especially since influenza can trigger severe complications, including heart attacks. Moreover, there is significant overlap among these high-risk groups. For instance, influenza can trigger an individualâs first heart attack. Among adults over 40 years old, published data recorded a tenfold increase in first heart attack rates among patients who had contracted influenza. Meanwhile, many of my older patients are accompanied by their adult children, who have a sincere desire to keep their parents safe from harm, especially those who are frail and in poor health. This often involves asking them to limit their activities to prevent illness or injury. Despite their best intentions, however, staying safe should not come at the expense of living a full life. In your golden years, being surrounded by loved ones and engaging in activities that bring you joy, whether it is line dancing, travelling or celebrating special moments with friends, truly enriches your life. After decades of hard work and raising a family, embracing this vibrant phase as a retiree, mentor, parent, grandparent and cherished friend is what quality of life is all about. I deeply believe in the importance of older adults staying active and enjoying a fulfilling life, free from the burdens of illness. One vital yet often overlooked aspect of health protection is the annual influenza vaccination. This vaccine is not just a precaution, it is a key safeguard against the many risks and complications that can arise from influenza, helping to ensure you can continue to embrace lifeâs joyful moments. As we age, our immune systems naturally weaken, making us more susceptible to infectious diseases like influenza. Research indicates that a staggering 90% of influenza-related deaths occur in individuals aged 65 and older. The risk of dying from influenza is five times greater for those with heart disease and 20 times higher for individuals with heart and pulmonary conditions. Even for those who recover, the consequences can be severe, often leading to loss of function or disability. The combination of ageing, chronic health issues and influenza places older adults at a higher risk of serious illnesses, complications and extended hospital stays. It has also been noted that more major cardiovascular events occur following influenza outbreaks. Thankfully, there is also comprehensive research that highlights the protective benefits of influenza vaccines, which can help to reduce the risk of death by 48% among older persons. A recent study also found a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality among those who received the influenza vaccination within 72 hours of a coronary procedure or hospitalisation. As we approach the season of year-end travels and festive gatherings, let us be mindful that the influenza virus is easily passed from person to person, especially among the same household and in crowded conditions, which increase potential exposure and spread of the virus. With Malaysia now officially an ageing nation, with 2.5 million (7.4%) individuals aged 65 and older, we urgently need greater awareness on the elevated risk faced by older persons, so that we can make influenza vaccinations a priority for this vulnerable group. I encourage all older adults to value your health and recognise its importance. A single influenza infection can have serious and irreversible consequences. Prioritise your well-being by getting your influenza vaccine. It is a vital step to help you stay healthy and fully enjoy all the wonderful moments life has to offer.

Long COVID may be no different to other post-viral syndromes, according to Australian research which found that people who tested positive for COVID-19 a year ago were no more likely to report moderate-to-severe functional limitations than people who had influenza. The lead author, who is Queensland's Chief Health Officer, says long COVID may have appeared to be a distinct and severe illness because of high volumes of COVID-19 cases during the pandemic. He also suggests it is time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’ as it wrongly implies there is something unique and exceptional about longer-term symptoms associated with this virus. Journal/conference: European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Organisation/s: Queensland Government Funder: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Media release From: European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Long COVID ‘indistinguishable’ from other post-viral syndromes a year after infection · Authors say it is time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’ as they wrongly imply there is something unique and exceptional about longer term symptoms associated with the virus· Comparison with influenza and other respiratory illnesses in Australian state of Queensland during Omicron wave finds no evidence of worse post-viral symptoms or functional impairment a year after infection.· Rather, long COVID may have appeared to be a distinct and severe illness because of high numbers of COVID-19 cases during the pandemic.**Note: the release below is a special early release from the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID 2024, Barcelona, Spain, 27-30 April). Please credit the congress if you use this story**Long COVID appears to manifest as a post-viral syndrome indistinguishable from seasonal influenza and other respiratory illnesses, with no evidence of increased moderate-to-severe functional limitations a year after infection, according to new research being presented at this year’s European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID 2024) in Barcelona, Spain (27-30 April).The study by Queensland Health researchers suggests that in the highly vaccinated population of Queensland exposed to the Omicron variant [1], long COVID’s impact on the health system is likely to stem from the sheer number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 within a short period of time, rather than the severity of long COVID symptoms or functional impairment.The findings add to previous research by the same authors and published in BMJ Public Health which found no difference in ongoing symptoms and functional impairment when COVID-19 was compared with influenza,12 weeks post infection [2].Rates of long COVID in Australia are low due to high vaccination rates upon easing of COVID restrictions and the population's subsequent exposure to the Omicron variant. Symptoms reported with the illness include fatigue, brain fog, cough, shortness of breath, change to smell and taste, dizziness, and rapid or irregular heartbeat.To understand more about the impact of long COVID on the Australian state of Queensland, researchers surveyed 5,112 symptomatic individuals aged 18 years and older, comprising those with PCR-confirmed infection for COVID-19 (2,399 adults) and those who were PCR negative for COVID-19 (2,713 adults: 995 influenza positive and 1,718 PCR negative for both but symptomatic with a respiratory illness) between 29 May and 25 June 2022. Laboratory reporting for COVID-19 and influenza is mandated upon PCR test request under Queensland’s public health legislation, with the results recorded in the Queensland Department of Health’s Notifiable Conditions System.A year after their PCR test, in May and June 2023, participants were asked about ongoing symptoms and the degree of functional impairment using a questionnaire delivered by SMS link.Overall, 16% (834/5,112) of all respondents reported ongoing symptoms a year later, and 3.6% (184) reported moderate-to-severe functional impairment in their activities of daily life.After controlling for influential factors including age, sex, and First Nation status, the analysis found no evidence that COVID-19 positive adults were more likely to have moderate-to-severe functional limitations a year after their diagnosis than symptomatic adults who were negative for COVID-19 (3.0% vs 4.1%).Moreover, results were similar when compared with the 995 symptomatic adults who had influenza (3.0% vs 3.4%).Interestingly, the analysis also found that those who were more likely to report moderate-to-severe functional impairment were those aged 50 years or older, and those who had symptoms of dizziness, muscle pain, shortness of breath, post-exertional malaise, and fatigue.“In health systems with highly vaccinated populations, long COVID may have appeared to be a distinct and severe illness because of high volumes of COVID-19 cases during the pandemic. However, we found that the rates of ongoing symptoms and functional impairment are indistinguishable from other post-viral illnesses”, says Dr John Gerrard, Queensland’s Chief Health Officer. “These findings underscore the importance of comparing post-COVID-19 outcomes with those following other respiratory infections, and of further research into post-viral syndromes.”He adds, “Furthermore, we believe it is time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’. They wrongly imply there is something unique and exceptional about longer term symptoms associated with this virus. This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery.” The authors caution that the findings are associations and do not represent prevalence. They point to several limitations, including that participants who were hospitalised or had pre-existing illness were not identifiable within the cohort. They also note that the risk of long COVID has been lower during the Omicron wave compared with other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and because 90% of people in Queensland were vaccinated when Omicron emerged, the lower severity of long COVID could be due to vaccination and/or the variant.Notes to editors:[1] More than 90% of the population of Queensland had been vaccinated against COVID-19 before the community first experienced transmission of the Omicron variant in 2022.

Views expressed are the personal opinions of the experts named. They do not represent the views of the SMC or any other organisation unless specifically stated. Professor Philip Britton is a Paediatric Infectious Diseases physician from the University of Sydney, and a member of the Long Covid Australia Collaboration. I welcome the results of this study given the lack of published research from Australia in this area. There are likely reasons why persistent symptoms following COVID in this Queensland cohort may be no more frequent than following other viruses including the predominantly vaccinated cohort and the high frequency of Omicron variants. These factors are acknowledged by the authors. It is because of these specific factors as well as inherent limitations of the study methodology itself, that their conclusion that it is “time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’” is overstated and potentially unhelpful. Long COVID has been a global phenomenon, recognised by WHO. Studies like this are reassuring that most people will recover from COVID without long-term effects and further, with vaccination and viral evolution, the number of people who experience Long COVID will likely reduce with time. This is good news! Equally, that some people have persistent symptoms following other viruses which can impact on quality of life and function is a message that needs better recognition. However, efforts to dismiss long COVID effects in at least some people by dismissing the term altogether will likely not assist. Last updated: 14 Mar 2024 5:26pm Declared conflicts of interest: None declared. Ms Marie-Claire Seeley is a PhD Candidate at the University of Adelaide and a Clinical Nurse Consultant This abstract reveals a significant finding: approximately 4% of individuals, irrespective of the virus they contracted, may experience persistent health issues post-infection, resulting in chronic incapacitation. This implies that Long COVID is not a standalone condition but rather part of a broader spectrum of post-viral syndromes. These findings align with previous Australian research published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2023. Adelaide researchers objectively demonstrated that 79% of Long COVID patients met the criteria for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), an autonomic nervous system disorder. Considering that POTS typically emerges following viral infection, this correlation is not unexpected. However, it's concerning because POTS significantly impairs quality of life and functional capabilities, particularly affecting women during their childbearing years. Of further concern is the absence of specialised public autonomic physician training programs in Australia, unlike in the USA. This leaves us ill-equipped to manage the increasing burden of post-COVID chronic autonomic disorders. Last updated: 14 Mar 2024 3:24pm Declared conflicts of interest: None declared. Professor Jeremy Nicholson is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Australian National Phenome Center at Murdoch University COVID-19 is a complex respiratory and systemic disease with multi-organ involvement producing a range of severities and secondary complications. A significant number of COVID-19 patients transition to a long-term or persistent form of the disease even after the active virus has departed from the body. This condition has been colloquially termed Long COVID. As the authors of the new paper state, this is a post-viral syndrome of the sort that has long been recognised for other viral infections including influenza. The question is 'is long COVID unique, worthy of its own name, or is it just another post viral syndrome'? The new study reports a year follow-up on 5112 symptomatic adult COVID-19 patients (omicron sub-variant of the SARS CoV-2) and 995 post influenza patients from Queensland Australia. The study indicates that 3-4% of people have significant symptoms a year after either COVID-19 or influenza, hence the authors argue that they are effectively the same. Unfortunately, this question cannot be simply answered in this work. The study is observational, based on reported symptoms with no physiological or detailed functional follow-up data. Without laboratory pathophysiological assessment of individual patients, it is impossible to say that this is indistinguishable from flu-related or any other post-viral syndrome. Also, there are many long-term effects of COVID-19 that do not have significant early-stage symptoms e.g. heart disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. These conditions do however have associated metabolic signatures which were not measured in the current study. The absence of evidence is different from evidence of absence- so the authors' assertion that Long COVID is the same as flu-related post viral syndrome, is not proven, even if Long COVID is indeed a post-viral syndrome (which it is). What is certainly true is that the pandemic nature of COVID-19 created a huge number (millions of people worldwide) of Long COVID sufferers and that this has drawn attention to the problem and given it a name. But we still do not know whether Long COVID is physiologically or mechanistically different to other post-viral syndromes, we lack the evidence because it has not been studied properly to date. This is important because such pathophysiological mechanistic knowledge is relevant to developing therapies for any post-viral syndrome including Long COVID. Until this is resolved, we should still use the Long COVID term because it pinpoints exactly the underlying viral cause for a given individual. Many people with other post-viral conditions do not have an original identifying cause and this has led to the marginalisation of many patients and difficulties in identifying individual treatments; chronic fatigue syndrome being a good example here. We also know from much larger peer-reviewed epidemiological follow-up studies in the USA and elsewhere, that Long COVID is associated with increases in heart disease and heart disease risk, diabetes, and long-term neurological damage; and these can occur after only a mild primary infection. COVID-19 was the biggest biological hit taken by humanity in over a hundred years (since the influenza epidemic of 1918) and has caused major long-term impacts on population health profiles and healthcare costs that will also persist for years. We also know that many patients have persistent and profoundly different metabolic biochemistries after acute SARS CoV-2 infections and beyond, which indicates ongoing systemic immuno-metabolic disturbances. Only by studying these quantifiable perturbations in real populations will we be able to determine if Long COVID is really the same as other post-viral syndromes. Or, if it is immunologically and metabolically different, but still part of an extended spectrum of post-viral syndromes, which will all require their own therapeutic intervention strategies for individual patients. Only further research into the comparative pathophysiology of Long COVID and other post-viral syndromes will answer this question.

But researchers in the University of Washington School of Medicine lab of biochemist David Veesler have found an extraordinary occurrence of it in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Essentially, the imprinting gives the body’s immune response a head start at the beginning of subsequent infections. “It is surprising because it is completely different from what we know from the influenza virus, where imprinting is overcome after exposures to antigenically distinct flu viruses,” said Veesler, a professor and chair in the Department of Biochemistry and investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.The findings were published March 14 in Immunity. M. Alejandra Tortorici, a biochemist in Veesler’s lab, is lead author. Contributors from the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, including Dr. Helen Chu, also participated in the research.Veesler’s lab analyzed plasma samples obtained from humans who had been recently vaccinated with the XBB.1.5 mRNA booster, which was updated in September 2023.“There are two leading hypotheses about what we are seeing,” Veesler said, “and I don’t know which of the two options explains it yet.”One hypothesis for this is residents of Seattle, where most of the samples came from, were exposed to the virus so many times — mostly through vaccination, but also infection — that they began developing antibodies and memory cells created for the original virus. The first U.S. death of the COVID-19 pandemic happened in Seattle, where symptoms of the virus emerged in early 2020.“People in Seattle, including myself, have been so compliant,” Veesler said. “We have been exposed many, many times over the past four years through vaccination and usually at least one infection. And that's very unusual to have so many exposures in such a short amount of time — up to seven vaccine doses in the cohort we analyzed.” A second possibility, which Veesler called a working hypothesis, is that the strong imprinting induced by mRNA vaccines and delay in updating the composition of vaccine boosters throughout the pandemic influenced the imprinting.“MRNA vaccines may have been so good and elicited such strong immune responses that the imprinting may be stronger than what we have been used to seeing with vaccines for other viruses such as for influenza virus,” Veesler said. “Imprinting is not a new concept, but the situation we are looking at seems to be quite unique.“Most of the antibodies recalled by the updated vaccine boosters are cross-reactive and help block new variants, which is a good thing. However, could we do an even better job? The answer is most likely yes.”This study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (DP1AI158186, P01AI167966, and 75N93022C00036), a Pew Biomedical Scholars Award, an Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Awards from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Fast Grants, the University of Washington Arnold and Mabel Beckman Cryo-EM Center, and the National Institutes of Health (S10OD032290).The authors’ conflict-of-interest statements are in the published paper, which will be provided to journalists upon request.

LivemintUpdated14 Mar 2024, 08:39 AM ISTBird flu threat looms across world(REUTERS)Scientists have warned that another pandemic might be underway as cases of bird flu, known as H5N1, go up.According to a report by The Metro, conservation biology professor Dr Diana Bell pointed out that bird flu has been spreading rapidly since 2020.While the first case emerged in domestic geese in 1997, the disease is spreading gradually across other continents, affecting non-avian species as well. The strain has already killed a handful of dolphins in Chile and Peru, some 50,000 seals and sea lions along the coasts, and at least half a million birds regionwide.Antarctica sees first bird flu case, confirms scientistsThe professor said that H5N1 has spread in 26 countries since 2020 and mammals are falling victim to the virus. As many as 882 cases of bird flu were reported in humans across 23 countries in 2020, resulting in a worrying fatality rate of 52%, the report mentioned.The mystery behind the origin of bird flu is similar to the Covid-19 pandemic. Both are believed to have originated from zoonotic spillover events where viruses jump from animals to humans.Polar bear dies from bird flu in Alaska as H5N1 virus spreads across globeThe first person who was confirmed to be infected with H10N5 died in China on January 27 2024, but this patient was also suffering from seasonal flu (H3N2). They had been exposed to live poultry which also tested positive for H10N5.As climate change escalates, animals will be forced to move into new territories, mixing with one another in new ways and possibly boosting opportunities for the virus to further mutate.The biology professor emphasised the urgent need for research and surveillance to understand the adaptability of viruses and their potential to infect other species.Meanwhile, drugmakers, including GSK and Moderna, have said they are developing bird flu vaccines for humans. The pharma giants said they have the capacity to produce hundreds of million so doses within months utilizing production lines used for seasonal flu vaccines.Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Jeremy Faust is editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and a public health researcher. He is author of the Substack column Inside Medicine. Follow Overall, hospitalizations of all three major respiratory viruses we track (COVID-19, influenza, and RSV) have decreased markedly from their late-December/early-January peaks this season. (Explore the data on the Inside Medicine dashboard.) Now, you may recall that I recently wrote that, anecdotally, I felt that I was seeing an increase in flu-associated hospitalizations in the Northeast. Was I right? Or was what I was seeing due to random chance? Updated data now show that my observations were in line with regional trends. The closest state to me that the CDC tracks is Connecticut. Things bottomed out in Connecticut in late January, but had increased by 77% by late February, which is when I posted my frontline observations about a possible late uptick in flu. While things have improved on the flu front overall nationwide, there are indeed a few regions where influenza has been on the rise as of late, with late season peaks. So, for this week's Data Snapshot, here are flu-related hospitalizations (per 100,000 people) for the 14 states that the CDC reports on each week, from the apparent peak of the season for most regions this year (late December/early January) through the end of February. Image: Jeremy Faust for Inside Medicine. Data: HHS, CDC, Johns Hopkins. As you can see, some places like Georgia and North Carolina are way better off than their flu peaks. Conversely, in Michigan, by late February things were getting worse, reaching new highs for the year. Data from this past week actually reveal that flu hospitalizations in Michigan continued to rise in early March, though I did not include early March in this week's graph in order to make the larger points here. (You can explore all of the most recent data here on an interactive graph I made from our dashboard.) Checking My Work In another recent post, I wrote about how sometimes clinicians like me can't actually tell what's happening on the frontline, because our sample sizes are too small to observe what is much more clear in big data. It is easy for us to mix up noise and randomness with a real signal that is statistically meaningful. Yes, our eyes can deceive us. But I'm always interested in whether frontline observations match big data in a measurable way. So, I ran some math. Based on the Connecticut data, my hospital's size, and how often I work, I wanted to know if I even had the ability to notice the mid-to-late February increase in influenza in the Northeast during my ED shifts. (Remember, even if a disease rate increases 100-fold from 1 in a billion to 1 in 10 million, I'd probably not be able to notice that in a week, month, or even year's time, despite the two orders of magnitude difference.) Long story short: Yes. The increase in flu rates in the Northeast that occurred in February basically amounted to me seeing less than one flu case per shift in late January to 1.7 cases per shift a month later. Over the course of 10 shifts, that would amount to around 9.5 flu admissions versus 17 admissions. I think that's enough of an increase to be noticeable to a working clinician like me. So, in this case, my eyes had not deceived me. Still, I'm glad I checked. I always want to be accountable to you when I am linking my frontline experiences with the latest high-quality data.

(Florida Health St. Lucie County)TOPICS:NorovirusIndian River CountyFDOHSymptomsContagiousHealth officialsStomach fluWashing handsVERO BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — More and more people in Indian River County are getting sick from a Norovirus-like illness spreading through the area, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) cautioned on Thursday.Health officials explained people who come down with symptoms feel like they have the stomach flu, but the agency noted that it isn’t an influenza virus. Someone with a Norovirus-like illness will likely start to feel sick within the first couple of days. They will get better about one to three days later.“Health people usually recover within one to three days at home without medical care but the very young and the elderly are at greater risk for dehydration and severe illness,” FDOH’s Indian River County Administrator Miranda Swanson said.According to the agency, people who get sick with it can expect to suffer vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach pain. The entire time they are sick, FDOH warns, they are contagious.See Also:Man on diving trip with son dies while in the water near Juno Beach, PBSO reportsStaying SafeIn the statement, health officials pointed out Norovirus spreads easily by touching contaminated surfaces and objects or by caring for someone with the virus, as well as other ways. It can also wind its way quickly through places where people gather, like daycares, nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships.“It is very important for people to wash their hands thoroughly, especially after using the restroom, as well as before preparing and consuming food,” Swanson continued.Health officials offered these tips to stop the spread of Norovirus (taken from FDOH):Wash hands with soap and running water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before eating or handling food. and sanitizers should not be used in place of washing with soap and water.Stay home for at least 24 hours after symptoms stop.Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly.When you are sick and for 2 to 3 days after you recover, DO NOT prepare food or care for others.Clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces immediately after an episode of illness.Use chlorine bleach solution (1/3 cup of household bleach per gallon of water for non-porous surfaces).Immediately remove and wash clothing or linens that may be contaminated with stool or vomitus (use hot water and soap).More information about Norovirus is available on the CDC website.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOWPECWPECWWHBWWHB-CDPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Weekly review - Week 10 from 4 to 10 March 2024 - The Luxembourg Government Aller au menu principal Aller au menu principal Aller au contenu The Luxembourg Government gouvernement.lu Select language - Please use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate menu en fr de lb Menu main News Conseils de gouvernement All of the news Schedule Conseils de gouvernement The Government FRIEDEN Luc BETTEL Xavier HANSEN Martine MEISCH Claude DELLES Lex BACKES Yuriko HAHN Max ROTH Gilles DEPREZ Martine GLODEN Léon OBERTIN Stéphanie MISCHO Georges WILMES Serge MARGUE Elisabeth THILL Eric Former Members of Government Ministries Departments Topics Political system Head of State Government Electoral system Chamber of Deputies Council of State Court of Auditors The Economic and Social Council Professional chambers Courts and tribunals Political parties European Union and international organisations High Council for Sustainable Development Show hide search Search Search The Luxembourg Government gouvernement.lu Select language - Please use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate menu en fr de lb Show hide search Search Search News Conseils de gouvernement All of the news Schedule Conseils de gouvernement The Government FRIEDEN Luc BETTEL Xavier HANSEN Martine MEISCH Claude DELLES Lex BACKES Yuriko HAHN Max ROTH Gilles DEPREZ Martine GLODEN Léon OBERTIN Stéphanie MISCHO Georges WILMES Serge MARGUE Elisabeth THILL Eric Former Members of Government Ministries Departments Topics Political system Head of State Government Electoral system Chamber of Deputies Council of State Court of Auditors The Economic and Social Council Professional chambers Courts and tribunals Political parties European Union and international organisations High Council for Sustainable Development Your shopping cart contains 0 Item(s) ( €) Partage Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Linkedin Share By Email Copy the link Home News All of the news Weekly review - Week 10 from 4 to 10 March 2024 Weekly review - Week 10 from 4 to 10 March 2024 Press release Created on 14.03.2024 Last update 14.03.2024 The weekly retrospective gives a summary of trends in acute respiratory infections, including COVID-19, the flu (influenza virus) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Stabilisation of the number of RSV cases at a low level. Influenza: Decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 4 to 10 March 2024 (week 10), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 32 cases, compared to 42 cases the previous week (-24%). The positivity rate fell to 2.3% compared to 2.6% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing. [1] These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (86.7%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.1%). It should be noted that variant JN.1, a descendant of variant BA.2.86, has predominated since week 47 of 2023. [2] Influenza For the week of 4 to 10 March 2024 (week 10), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 157 cases from 206 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 24% compared to the previous week. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 4 to 10 March 2024 (week 10), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals detected by laboratories rose to 13 cases, compared with 11 cases the previous week. Given the small numbers involved, this weekly variation indicates that the number of RSV cases has stabilised at a low level. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023. As of today, the weekly press release on respiratory infections will no longer be published. Depending on the evolution of the situation, we will resume the publication of the press release if necessary.

The wildlife concentrations around the coast are just phenomenal - multiple species of penguins, albatrosses, and seals," explained Dr Norman Ratcliffe, a bird ecologist from the British Antarctic Survey. "If bird flu were to take a hold and cause very high mortality across the island, it would be of conservation concern globally. But at the moment, it does seem to be somewhat limited in the way it's spreading," he told BBC News.Four new emperor penguin groups found by satelliteWhat is avian influenza and how is it spread?Image caption, Scientists are on alert for signs of bird flu on islands around the Scotia SeaHigh Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been in existence for decades but the world is currently in the grip of a major flare up, with the H5N1 strain of the virus causing the deaths of countless wild and domesticated birds.Antarctica and its outlying islands have escaped the worst due to their remoteness. But this situation is on the turn. Bird flu was first identified on South Georgia in October 2023, in the large scavenging seabird known as the brown skua, with detections in kelp gulls shortly after.Then, in January this year, cases were confirmed in elephant and fur seals. It's also spread to Antarctic terns and wandering albatrosses.Penguins are the latest animal group to be infected, with five gentoos and five kings testing positive.The cases were confirmed in samples sent back to the UK to the International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratories in Weybridge.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Other animal groups, such as the wandering albatross, have had confirmed cases on South GeorgiaIt's not a great surprise. The virus has already got to gentoos on the Falklands some 1,500km to the west, so it was probably only a matter of time before South Georgia's also became infected."Skuas winter around South America as do giant petrels and we think these birds are the vector that bought the disease into South Georgia," said Dr Ratcliffe."Skuas are constantly in amongst the penguin colonies scavenging and preying on eggs and chicks. If there's a surprise, it's that it's taken this long for the virus to be manifested in the penguins."Scientists are watching closely now to see how bird flu interacts with the different penguin species, which on South Georgia include kings, gentoos, macaronis and chinstraps. Macaronis, for example, will spend much of the coming southern winter at sea, which will help them avoid infection. Kings and gentoos, however, will continue to roost on shore, leaving them open to further exposure.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gentoo penguins have already been affected in the FalklandsAs for the Antarctic proper, two dead skuas infected with HPAI were recently picked up by Argentine scientists near their Primavera base on the continent's peninsula, so the virus is unquestionably moving south.But how far it would progress and what its impacts might be was highly uncertain, said Dr Ashley Banyard, who leads the avian virology workgroup at the APHA."Penguins live in very close proximity to each other, so that lends itself to the idea that they might spread the virus rapidly between each other. But we don't know how easily the virus can get into different penguin species, what sort of clinical disease it might cause and how rapidly it might spread between birds themselves," he told BBC News.Surveillance is key, and this is being assisted by the many cruise ships that now sail in Antarctic waters. Members of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) have long had protocols to prevent the accidental spread of disease by tourists in pristine environments, but these have now been stepped up because of bird flu."Nobody lands on a beach until there's been an assessment done to show if there's any strange behaviour or high mortality," said Amanda Lynnes, the director of environment and science coordination at IAATO."Antarctica is a huge continent but we're actually quite a small community in a way, so the information flow goes rapidly to all stakeholders who need to know and can advise."Related topicsAntarcticPenguinsBritish Antarctic SurveyTop storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished1 hour agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished6 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

Cold & FluNewsShould You Worry About TikTok’s ‘Mystery Virus’?Don’t panic: Viral illnesses are common and often clear up in a few days, experts say. But there are things you can do to protect yourself and others.ByLisa RapaportFact CheckedPublished on March 11, 2024On social media, some people are saying that pink eye is a symptom of the mystery virus now making the rounds.Lumeez Ismail/AdobeStockKey TakeawaysTikTokers are sharing stories about viral infections with no obvious cause.Doctors say to get tested to make sure you don’t have COVID-19 or flu.If symptoms become worrisome (high or persistent fever, shortness of breath), see a doctor.If you haven’t stayed home sick recently, you probably know somebody who has. During cold and flu season, most of us at some point come down with a bug that brings symptoms like nausea, fatigue, light-headedness, and congestion.But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be hard not to worry when lots of these symptoms strike all at once, especially when you can’t figure out just what “mystery virus” is making you ill.“Everyone in the United States is getting sick by some virus, but they don’t know what it’s called, they don’t know where it’s coming from, but somehow everybody is getting sick,” one TikToker says in a video with 1.7 million views.“When I say everybody, I’m including myself too,” says the TikToker, who goes by @thatgirlkanesha. “I just had this so-called virus last week. I was feeling very very lightheaded. I felt like I had to vomit. I felt like I was going to pass out. Like all of these symptoms are really not adding up to me.”What Could the ‘Mystery Virus’ Be?This so-called “mystery virus” trending on TikTok doesn’t appear to be a respiratory virus like COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or the flu. And some TikTokers are complaining of issues like pink eye, which don’t fit the classic symptoms for these respiratory illnesses.While this may seem like cause for alarm, there may be a perfectly simple explanation, says William Schaffner, MD, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.“There are numerous other seasonal respiratory viruses circulating during the winter months beyond the familiar serious influenza, COVID, and RSV,” Dr. Schaffner says.Many common colds, for example, are caused by rhinoviruses, Schaffner says. These are typically mild upper respiratory infections with symptoms like a runny nose, sore throat, headache, body aches, and cough.Adenoviruses, another ailment that usually causes mild cold symptoms, may also be behind the “mystery illness” because it can lead to pink eye, Schaffer posits.With viral illnesses like these, “the vast majority of folks will recover after a few days,” Schaffer says.What Can Relieve Symptoms of a Mystery Virus?Before you assume you have a “mystery virus,” you should get tested for influenza and COVID-19 to rule out these illnesses, Schaffner advises. That’s because there are medications to help prevent severe illness such as Paxlovid for COVID-19 and Tamiflu for influenza.“This is particularly important if you are in a high-risk group for more serious complications — if you are 65 or older, if you have one or more chronic medical conditions, or if you are immunocompromised,” Schaffner says.Assuming you test negative, the best thing you can do is drink lots of fluids and take over-the-counter medicines to help ease symptoms.When Should You See a Doctor?Even though many people recover from a viral infection within a matter of days without ever seeing a doctor, there are times when medical attention is necessary.“If your fever is high or persists or you have shortness of breath or other worrisome symptoms, contact your healthcare provider,” says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston.“You may have secondary bacterial pneumonia or other serious bacterial infection and require an antibiotic,” Dr. Hotez says.What Should You Do to Protect Others From Whatever Virus You Have?Whether you have a “mystery virus” or a respiratory illness like COVID-19, the flu, or RSV, you should stay home and steer clear of others as much as possible until your symptoms start improving and you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without taking fever-lowering medications, Schaffner says. You should also wash your hands often.These are among the new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses. Once you go out in public, the CDC also recommends wearing a mask for five days to minimize the risk of infecting others.“All these viruses are quite contagious,” Hotez says. “The N95 and KN95 masks that work for COVID usually work for these other viruses.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkLisa RapaportAuthorLisa Rapaport is a journalist with more than 20 years of experience on the health beat as a writer and editor.
