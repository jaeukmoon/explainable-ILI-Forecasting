However, molecular markers associated with poor disease outcomes in men are still unknown. In this study, we systematically analysed sex hormone and cytokine levels in males and females with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 influenza in comparison to H7N9-negative control groups as well as laboratory-confirmed seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza cases (n = 369). Multivariable analyses reveal that H7N9-infected men present with considerably reduced testosterone levels associated with a poor outcome compared to non-infected controls. Regression analyses reveal that testosterone levels in H7N9-infected men are negatively associated with the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-15. To assess whether there is a causal relationship between low testosterone levels and avian H7N9 influenza infection, we used a mouse model. In male mice, we show that respiratory H7N9 infection leads to a high viral load and inflammatory cytokine response in the testes as well as a reduction in pre-infection plasma testosterone levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that monitoring sex hormone levels may support individualized management for patients with avian influenza infections.

Article 09 December 2022 Effects of SARS CoV-2, COVID-19, and its vaccines on male sexual health and reproduction: where do we stand? Article Open access 27 October 2021 Considering how biological sex impacts immune responses and COVID-19 outcomes Article 11 June 2020 IntroductionIn early 2013, human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China1. Since then, H7N9 caused five epidemic waves from 2013 to 2017, making it one of the major zoonoses in the current decade. Exposure to live poultry markets is considered a major risk factor for human infections with the H7N9 virus2. An initial epidemiological study revealed that 71% of all H7N9 cases were males in the first wave3. A high degree of infection in men was consistently observed, with similar proportions (68–71%) throughout the entire five H7N9 epidemic waves4. Currently, very little is known regarding the complex interplay of biological sex and gender-specific behaviour as contributors to influenza disease outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) first proposed that gender-associated practises and norms, such as more frequent exposure of men to birds, may pose one of the reasons for sex-specific H7N9 incidence5. However, a follow-up study suggested that an increased risk in older men is not due to higher exposure time in the live poultry market6. Thus, the impact of biological sex on H7N9 influenza outcome remains unknown.Sex hormones, particularly testosterone and estradiol, are important biological factors that affect sex differences in immune responses7,8,9,10. We have previously shown that high-dose H1N1 infection reduces testosterone levels in male (but not female) mice11. Conversely, treatment of female mice with testosterone protects the majority of H1N1-infected females from lethal outcomes11. Similarly, aged male mice with low testosterone levels were reported to undergo elevated pulmonary inflammation and severe disease upon H1N1 influenza virus infection compared to young male mice12. Conversely, other murine models showed that low concentrations of estradiol in female mice were associated with enhanced pro-inflammatory responses and H1N1 influenza pathogenesis13. Thus, there is increasing evidence from small animal models that sex hormones play an important role in influenza virus pathogenesis. However, the role of sex hormones in infectious diseases in humans remains to be elucidated.In this study, we retrospectively analyse the association of sex hormones with H7N9 influenza disease outcome in males and females and show that low testosterone levels are linked to the development of severe or even fatal diseases. Moreover, in a mouse model of H7N9 infection, we demonstrate a causal link between viral infection and testosterone depletion. In summary, our data suggest that reduced testosterone levels upon H7N9 infection represent a poor prognostic marker in critically ill patients. Monitoring sex hormone levels throughout the course of infection might therefore be essential for risk assessment and individualized patient therapy.ResultsParticipant demographicsIn total, we enrolled n = 369 study participants, which were subdivided into those 18–49 years old (reproductive age) and those 50 years of age and older (post-reproductive age) to adequately assess sex hormone levels with respective control groups (Table 1). In both age groups, patients were enrolled with PCR-confirmed H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) infection (within acute phases of 6.5 days (IQR 5–8.3 days) and 7.5 days (IQR 6–9 days) after illness onset; Supplementary Table 2). H7N9 PCR-negative close contacts (herein referred to as H7N9-negative close contacts), H7N9 PCR-negative poultry workers (herein referred to as H7N9-negative poultry workers), outpatients with PCR-confirmed H1N1 or H3N2 infection (herein referred to as seasonal influenza outpatients) and hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed H1N1 or H3N2 infection (herein referred to as seasonal influenza hospitalized).Table 1 Characteristics of study participantsFull size tableH7N9 infection in men is associated with reduced testosterone levelsTo assess the role of sex hormones in the observed sex bias of H7N9 cases, we measured major sex hormones in all groups. In H7N9-infected men, circulating total testosterone levels were reduced compared to H7N9-negative poultry workers and H7N9-negative close contacts (18–49 yrs: p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, ≥50 yrs: p < 0.0001, p = 0.0117) (Fig. 1a). Within the 18 to 49-year-old men, there was a trend towards a higher risk of death during the course of infection if total testosterone levels were low compared to those who survived (p = 0.0399) (Fig. 1b). We also measured the levels of free testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) to distinguish between SHBG-bound testosterone and unbound free testosterone. In H7N9-infected men of both age groups, free testosterone levels were below the lowest reference range according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Supplementary Fig. 1a). SHBG levels, on the other hand, were within the normal reference range14 in H7N9-infected men of both age groups (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Testosterone levels in H7N9-infected patients compared to control cohorts.a Total testosterone expression levels were measured in sera from H7N9 IAV-infected male patients (18–49 yrs: n = 33, ≥50 yrs: n = 38) and compared to male controls as follows: (i) H7N9-negative poultry workers (18–49 yrs: n = 32, ≥50 yrs: n = 45) and (ii) H7N9-negative close contacts (18–49 yrs: n = 29, ≥50 yrs: n = 16). b Total testosterone expression levels in H7N9-infected male patients were compared in dependency of disease outcome (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 18/15, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 27/11). c Total testosterone expression levels were measured in sera from H7N9 IAV-infected female patients (18–49 yrs: n = 10, ≥50 yrs: n = 16) and compared to female control groups as follows: (i) H7N9-negative poultry workers (18–49 yrs: n = 11, ≥50 yrs: n = 20) and (ii) H7N9-negative close contacts (18–49 yrs: n = 11, ≥50 yrs: n = 15). d Total testosterone expression levels in H7N9 IAV-infected female patients were compared in dependency of disease outcome (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 4/6, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 10/6). e, f Total testosterone expression levels were measured in the plasma from seasonal influenza-infected male (18–49 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 15/11, ≥50 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/14) (e) and female patients (18–49 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/4, ≥50 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 13/10) (f) and compared in dependency of disease severity (outpatient vs. hospitalized). a, c The age-specific reference range of testosterone in Chinese men and women was added as dotted lines in (a) and (c) (no age difference in testosterone in Chinese men)14. a–f Data are presented as Box-and-whisker plots (Tukey). The horizontal line in each box represents the median value. The 25th–75th percentiles represent the endpoints of the box. The whiskers stretch to the lowest and highest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25th–75th percentiles. Dots represent outliers according to Tukey’s definition. Unpaired, two-tailed non-parametric analysis (Mann‒Whitney test) was used for comparisons between two groups (b, d, e, f). The Kruskal‒Wallis test (a, c) was used for comparisons among the three groups. P values were classified into four groups: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageIn H7N9-infected women, total testosterone levels were comparable to H7N9-negative close contacts and H7N9-negative poultry workers, albeit a slight tendency towards elevated testosterone levels was observed in those infected with H7N9 (Fig. 1c). This tendency of elevated testosterone levels was also observed in women who died during the course of H7N9 infection compared to those who survived (Fig. 1d). In H7N9-infected women, free testosterone levels were within the normal reference range, albeit slightly higher in those aged above 50 years who later died (Supplementary Fig. 1c). SHBG levels were within the normal reference range according to the manufacturer’s instructions without relevant changes among the groups assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1d).In men with seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 influenza infections, total testosterone levels were lower in those who were hospitalized than in those who were not hospitalized (outpatients), particularly among the 18- to 49-year-olds (p = 0.0128) (Fig. 1e). Free testosterone levels in men with seasonal influenza were distributed at the lowest percentile of the normal reference range in all groups assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1e). SHBG levels were within the normal reference range14 in all groups (Supplementary Fig. 1f).In women with seasonal influenza, there was a slight tendency towards elevated total testosterone levels in those who were hospitalized compared to outpatients (Fig. 1f). Free testosterone levels were within the normal reference range in all women assessed, albeit higher in those above 50 years of age who were hospitalized compared to outpatients (p = 0.0020) (Supplementary Fig. 1g). SHBG levels were within the normal reference range in all women assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1h).These data indicate that H7N9 infection in 18 to 49-year-old as well as in ≥50-year-old men, unlike in women, is associated with reduced total and free testosterone levels. Moreover, the data presented here support the hypothesis that low total testosterone levels in 18- to 49-year-old men are associated with fatal outcomes.H7N9 infection in men does not show an association with altered estradiol levelsNext, we measured estradiol levels, which represent another major sex hormone, in all cohorts. In H7N9-infected men, no alterations were observed among those infected with H7N9 or those who were H7N9-negative as close contacts or poultry workers. However, some H7N9-infected men presented elevated estradiol levels compared to H7N9-negative control cohorts (Fig. 2a). Similarly, some individuals who died during the course of H7N9 infection presented elevated estradiol levels compared to those who survived (Fig. 2b). In H7N9-infected women, estradiol levels were elevated in those above 50 years of age compared to H7N9-negative close contacts (p = 0.0006) (Fig. 2c). However, elevated estradiol levels showed no association with fatal disease outcome, albeit tendencies for poor outcomes in some women with elevated estradiol levels were observed (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2: Estradiol levels in H7N9-infected patients compared to control cohorts.a Estradiol levels were measured in sera from H7N9 IAV-infected males (18–49 yrs: n = 32, ≥50 yrs: n = 27) and compared to male control groups as follows: (i) H7N9-negative poultry workers (18–49 yrs: n = 15, ≥50 yrs: n = 19) and (ii) H7N9-negative close contacts (18–49 yrs: n = 29, ≥50 yrs: n = 16); b Estradiol levels in H7N9 IAV-infected male patients were compared in dependency of disease outcome (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 18/14, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 17/10); c Estradiol levels were measured in sera from H7N9 IAV-infected females (18–49 yrs: n = 9, ≥50 yrs: n = 12) and compared to female control groups as follows: i) H7N9-negative poultry workers (18–49 yrs: n = 8, ≥50 yrs: n = 4) and ii) H7N9-negative close contacts (18–49 yrs: n = 11, ≥50 yrs: n = 15). d Estradiol levels in H7N9 IAV-infected female patients were compared in dependency on disease outcome (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 3/6, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 6/6). e, f Estradiol levels were measured in plasma from seasonal influenza-infected male (18–49 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 16/11, ≥50 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/14) (e) and female patients (18–49 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/4, ≥50 yrs outpatient/hospitalized: n = 13/10) (f) and are compared in dependency of disease outcome (outpatient vs. hospitalization). The age-specific reference range of estradiol in Chinese men and women was added as dotted lines in (a) and (c) (no age difference in estradiol in Chinese men)39. a–f Data are presented as Box-and-whisker plots (Tukey). The horizontal line in each box represents the median value. The 25th–75th percentiles represent the endpoints of the box. The whiskers stretch to the lowest and highest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25th–75th percentiles. Dots represent outliers according to Tukey’s definition. Unpaired, two-tailed non-parametric analysis (Mann–Whitney test) was used for comparisons between two groups. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for comparisons among the three groups. P values were classified into four groups: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageIn men with seasonal influenza infections, estradiol levels were not altered among those who were hospitalized or not hospitalized, albeit again, some individuals who were hospitalized presented elevated estradiol levels (Fig. 2e). In women infected with seasonal influenza, estradiol levels showed no change in those who were hospitalized compared to outpatients (Fig. 2f).These data show no association between H7N9 infection in men and altered estradiol levels. In women, H7N9 infection is associated with elevated estradiol levels in those above 50 years of age. Since disease outcome in H7N9-infected women is not significantly affected, the role of estradiol in women requires further investigation.Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in monocyte and granulocyte pathways are associated with fatal outcomes in H7N9-infected menA complex cross-talk between sex hormones and cytokines with mutual regulatory activity is known to affect key immune pathways15. Thus, in order to elucidate potential interactions between sex hormones and innate immune responses, we first measured and described a panel of 29 different cytokines and chemokines in H7N9-infected men and women separately.In both sexes, H7N9 infection was associated with high-level induction of cytokines and chemokines, in agreement with previous reports on cytokine storms observed in patients infected with avian influenza viruses16,17 (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, some of these cytokines and chemokines were associated with fatal outcomes. In H7N9-infected men, elevated levels of G-CSF (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0364), GM-CSF ( ≥ 50 yrs: p = 0.0438), IL-8 (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0021, ≥50 yrs: p = 0.0381), IL-10 (≥50 yrs: p = 0.0300), IL-15 (18–49 yrs: p < 0.0001, ≥50 yrs: p = 0.0322), MCP-1 (≥50 yrs: p = 0.0116) and TNF-α (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0182) were associated with later death (Fig. 3a–g, o–q). In H7N9-infected women, decreased levels of Eotaxin (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0061) and elevated levels of MIP-1ß (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0121, ≥50 yrs: p = 0.0216) and EGF (≥ 50 yrs: p = 0.0405) were associated with fatal outcomes (Fig. 3h–n, r–t).Fig. 3: Cytokine and chemokine expression profiles in H7N9-infected patients in dependency of disease outcome.a–t Shown are the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the sera of H7N9 IAV-infected males (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 18/15, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 27/11) and female patients (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 4/7, ≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 10/6) who either survived or succumbed to the infection. The measurement was performed using a multiplex immunoassay. Cytokines/chemokines considerably dysregulated in males include: G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; a), GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; b), IL-8 (interleukin 8; c), IL-10 (interleukin 10; d), IL-15 (interleukin 15; e), MCP-1/CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; f), and TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor alpha; g). The same cytokines and chemokines were not altered in female H7N9 patients between both groups (h–n). Cytokines/chemokines considerably dysregulated in females include: Eotaxin (r), MIP-1β/CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta; s), and EGF (epidermal growth factor; t). These cytokines were not significantly altered in males between both groups (o–q). Data are presented as Box-and-whisker plots (Tukey). The horizontal line in each box represents the median value. The 25th–75th percentiles represent the endpoints of the box. The whiskers stretch to the lowest and highest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25th–75th percentiles. Dots represent outliers according to Tukey’s definition. Unpaired, two-tailed non-parametric analysis (Mann–Whitney test) was used for comparisons between two groups. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for comparisons among the three groups. P values were classified into four groups: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageIn seasonal H1N1/H3N2-infected men, on the other hand, elevated levels of IL-8 (18–49 yrs: p < 0.0001, ≥50 yrs: p = 0.0111), MIP-1α (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0346), IL-7 (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0338), IL-15 (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0291), EGF (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0390), VEGF (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0145) and IFN-α2 (≥50 yrs: p = 0.0102) were associated with hospitalization compared to outpatients (Fig. 4a–g, o, p). In women infected with seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza viruses, increased levels of IL-8 (18–49 yrs: p = 0.0148, ≥50 yrs: p = 0.0042) and decreased levels of IFN-γ (≥50 yrs: p = 0.0202) and MIP-1ß (≥50 yrs: p = 0.0137) were associated with hospitalization (Fig. 4h–n, q–r).Fig. 4: Cytokine and chemokine expression profiles in seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza patients in dependency of disease outcome.a–r Shown are the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the plasma from seasonal influenza outpatients and hospitalized patients, each divided into two age groups: 18–49 yrs (male outpatient/hospitalized: n = 16/11, female outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/4) and ≥50 yrs (male outpatient/hospitalized: n = 12/14, female outpatient/hospitalized: n = 13/10). The measurement was carried out using a multiplex immunoassay. Cytokines/chemokines considerably dysregulated in either or both sexes include: IL-8 (interleukin 8; a, h), MIP-1α/CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha; b, i), IL-7 (interleukin 7; c, j), IL-15 (interleukin 15; d, k), EGF (epidermal growth factor; e, l), VEGF (vascular epidermal growth factor; f, m), IFN-α2 (interferon alpha 2; g, n), IFN-γ (interferon gamma; o, q), and MIP-1β/CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta; p, r). Data are presented as Box-and-whisker plots (Tukey). The horizontal line in each box represents the median value. The 25th–75th percentiles represent the endpoints of the box. The whiskers stretch to the lowest and highest values within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the 25th–75th percentiles. Dots represent outliers according to Tukey’s definition. Unpaired, two-tailed non-parametric analysis (Mann–Whitney test) was used for comparisons between two groups. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for comparisons among the three groups. P values were classified into four groups: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageThese findings show that more cytokines and chemokines are associated with poor prognosis in H7N9- and seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza-infected men than in women. Herein, elevated levels of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-α and particularly IL-15 were associated with death in H7N9-infected men, unlike females or males infected with seasonal influenza.Inflammatory markers such as IL-15 are negatively associated with testosterone levels in H7N9-infected menNext, we sought to identify potential interactions between the identified H7N9 male-specific cytokines and chemokines and testosterone levels. Therefore, we applied a linear regression model for all 29 cytokines/chemokines and testosterone levels assessed on the logarithmic scale (Fig. 5). Herein, we detected a negative association between testosterone levels and IL-6 (R2 = 0.3672), IL-10 (R2 = 0.2387), IL-15 (R2 = 0.5049), IL-1RA (R2 = 0.2506), and IL-1α (R2 = 0.2564) in H7N9-infected 18–49-year-old men (Fig. 5a–e) as well as IL-6 (R2 = 0.2355) and IL-10 (R2 = 0.2966) in H7N9-infected men 50 years and older (Fig. 5f, g). In seasonal H1N1/H3N2-infected men, on the other hand, only G-CSF levels were negatively associated with testosterone levels (Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 5: Correlation of testosterone and cytokine/chemokine levels in men infected with H7N9 influenza.a–g Shown is the observed regression between testosterone and cytokine/chemokine levels in H7N9 IAV-infected males. Natural logarithm transformed (Ln) testosterone expression levels measured in the sera from H7N9 males were plotted over the Ln transformed cytokine/chemokines levels. a–e Overall regression of testosterone with cytokines IL-6 (interleukin 6; a), IL-10 (interleukin 10; b), IL-15 (interleukin 15; c), IL-1RA (interleukin 1 receptor antagonist; d) and IL-1α (interleukin 1 alpha; e) observed from H7N9 younger males without interaction between deaths and survivors (18–49 yrs survival/death: n = 18/15); f, g Observed overall regression of testosterone with cytokines IL-6 (interleukin 6; f) and IL-10 (interleukin 10; g) in H7N9 older males without interaction between deaths and survivors (≥50 yrs survival/death: n = 27/11). a–g The best-fit line with 95% confidence intervals of the overall regression is shown in each figure. The centre of the error distribution is the regression line. Two-tailed linear regression was performed. Adjustment for multiple hypotheses was not necessary due to the explorative nature of the study. A hollow blue circle represents survival, and a solid blue circle represents death. R squared values are shown in the figures. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageThese data suggest that testosterone levels are negatively associated with the expression of key cytokines involved in antiviral immune responses, such as the inflammatory cytokine IL-15, which can explain approximately 50% of the variation (R2 = 0.5049) in testosterone levels in H7N9-infected males.In male mice, respiratory H7N9 influenza virus infection spreads to the testes and causes a reduction in circulating testosterone levelsTo address whether the reduction in circulating testosterone levels detected in H7N9-infected men presents a causal relationship, we additionally used a murine model previously shown to provide a valuable preclinical model to study sex hormones in infection11,12,13. Therefore, male mice were infected with avian H7N9 influenza virus or treated with PBS or poly(I:C) as a control (Supplementary Fig. 4a). H7N9 virus was detected in the lungs as well as in the testes of infected mice on days 1, 3 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 6a, b) in line with respiratory inflammation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Pre-infection testosterone levels in the plasma of poly(I:C)-treated mice were considerably reduced on days 1 (p = 0.0120) and 3 p.i. (p = 0.0469) but not 6 p.i. (Fig. 6c–e). Similarly, H7N9 influenza virus infection reduced circulating testosterone levels compared to those before infection (1d.p.i: p = 0.0137, 3 d.p.i: p = 0.0244) (Fig. 6f–h). As a control, we measured estradiol levels which were not significantly affected except on day 1 or day 6 after infection (p = 0.0063, p = 0.0019) and day 1 after poly(I:C) treatment (p = 0.0005) (Supplementary Fig. S4j–o). Testes of H7N9-infected mice presented elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, such as MCP-1 (PBS or poly (I:C) vs. H7N9: p = 0.0071, p = 0.0080), IP-10 (PBS vs. H7N9: p = 0.0472), IL-10 (PBS or poly (I:C) vs. H7N9: p < 0.0001, p = 0.0014), MIP-1ß (PBS or poly (I:C) vs. H7N9: p < 0.0001, p = 0.0004) and IL-1ß (PBS or poly (I:C) vs. H7N9: p < 0.0001, p = 0.0079), compared to PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated animals at days 3p.i., the time point of highest viral replication (Fig. 6i–m; Supplementary Fig. 4b–i). Despite the elevated testicular cytokine response in H7N9-infected male mice, no alterations were observed on the histological level in the testes (Fig. 6n–p; Supplementary Fig. 4p–u).Fig. 6: Infection with H7N9 reduces circulating testosterone levels and promotes an inflammatory response in the testes of male mice.a Lung viral titres of mice control-treated with Poly (I:C) (n = 6, 7 and 7) or infected with H7N9 virus (n = 15, 16 and 7) at 1, 3 and 6 d.p.i. b Viral NP mRNA expression levels in the testes from mice control-treated with Poly (I:C) or infected with H7N9 virus at 1d.p.i (Poly (I:C): n = 6, H7N9: n = 15), 3 d.p.i (Poly (I:C): n = 7, H7N9: n = 16) and 6 d.p.i.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageThese data suggest that circulating testosterone levels are specifically reduced upon H7N9 virus infection but also upon poly(I:C) treatment of male mice. However, an inflammatory cytokine response was detected in the testes of H7N9-infected but not in those of poly(I:C)-treated mice.DiscussionAvian influenza A (H7N9) virus has repeatedly crossed species barriers and infected humans. Since its first emergence in 2013, H7N9 influenza has caused 1,568 laboratory-confirmed cases and 616 deaths, particularly in men18,19. Avian influenza viruses are considered as one of the major candidates posing a high risk to cause the next pandemic. Although many aspects of avian H7N9 infection have been studied, a systematic analysis of the higher number of male H7N9 infections across five epidemic waves in China was still lacking.In this study, we retrospectively analysed five groups (18–49 yrs and ≥50 yrs), including laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases, influenza virus-negative H7N9 close contacts, epidemiologically linked poultry workers and outpatients and hospitalized patients with seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza infections. We systematically measured the levels of the main androgen (testosterone) and estrogen (estradiol) and explored their differences in the groups under study as well as their correlation with cytokine and chemokine responses known to be major drivers of influenza disease severity in both sexes.This retrospective study has some limitations. By nature of the study, these data present secondary data use from the health care sector. Therefore, a systematic explorative statistical analysis was performed as a first translational step to generate hypotheses to be further explored in animal models later. Multiple adjustments with other factors influencing testosterone and estrogen estradiol were therefore not taken into account. Our data were obtained from the Influenza Surveillance Network in the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China, which is responsible for identifying and reporting all novel influenza cases nationwide. However, as the study design includes voluntary participation, it is never free from any selection bias. However, this effect may be ignored, because we do not have any information on underlying comorbidities present in the enrolled sample population that might have additionally affected sex hormone levels. It was reported that some metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity and/or type II diabetes, are also associated with changes in sex hormones irrespective of infection20,21. Therefore, the statistical data exploration is not free from confounding bias. The overall low sample size, particularly in female patients, limits the conclusions as well due to the low statistical power.Thus, the data and results presented here may be interpreted as a first translational step. Future investigations are required in larger and sex-balanced groups to study the impact of sex hormones on influenza disease outcome in a structural epidemiological setting, taking additional individual data into account. In addition, sex hormone levels were measured at one time point. Future studies should monitor sex hormone levels during the course of infection to investigate their impact as biomarkers using a prospective setting.Besides these limitations, the data presented here support a series of interesting hypotheses. Within this explorative process, we observed a strong suppression of total and bioavailable free testosterone levels in H7N9-infected men between 18–49 years and 50 and above years of age. Likewise, seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza-infected men with suppressed testosterone levels were more likely to be hospitalized than outpatients. However, the level of testosterone depletion was more severe in men with avian H7N9 influenza at both age groups than in men with seasonal influenza when referring to their median levels of total and free testosterone. Reduction of total testosterone levels in H7N9-infected men aged 18–49 years was further associated with lethal disease outcome, suggesting a prominent role of testosterone, particularly in avian H7N9 influenza-infected men.Second, we hypothesize from our data that cytokines and chemokines are negatively associated with testosterone levels. IL-6 was negatively associated with testosterone levels in H7N9-infected male patients in both age groups. This is particularly interesting, since high IL-6 levels were repeatedly reported to be a poor prognostic marker for severe infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)22. Importantly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-15, which has been shown to be upregulated in severe influenza infection23,24, showed the strongest association with testosterone in our data. Moreover, IL-15 is considered an ideal molecular adjuvant in universal influenza vaccines, which show robust cross-clade protection against H5N125 and heterosubtypic immunity against H7N9 infection, seasonal influenza and highly pathogenic H7N7 influenza A viruses26. Furthermore, IL-15 is also discussed as a component in immunotherapy in COVID-19 patients27. Among all the H7N9 infection-specific cytokines, we identified IL-10 to be additionally negatively associated with testosterone levels in H7N9-infected men. IL-10 is a master regulator of immunity to infection28. One of its main functions is to promote an anti-inflammatory environment. According to the data generated herein, low testosterone levels associated with high inflammatory cytokine levels, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-15, are paralleled by elevated anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels, likely in response to the cytokine storm induced by H7N9 in men. These findings are in line with reports on the immunosuppressive function of testosterone29,30,31,32.Third, we used a murine model to address the question of whether testosterone levels in H7N9-infected men were reduced upon virus infection or due to other underlying factors. Therefore, we infected male mice and detected that respiratory H7N9 infection causes a significant reduction in circulating testosterone levels compared to levels before infection. Reduction of circulating testosterone levels was also observed upon poly(I:C) treatment of male mice. However, testicular inflammation measured as an increase in inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses was only observed upon H7N9 infection, in line with the high virus load detected in the testes of infected mice. These data suggest that testosterone production may be repressed either directly through local testicular infection and inflammation or through systemic inflammation and its action on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis33,34,35,36.In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which also highlights the male sex as a risk factor for hospitalization and death37, our H7N9 study here might serve as a blueprint for future in-depth investigations. This knowledge may provide a basis for future individualized risk assessment in patients with emerging viral infections.MethodsEthics statementHumansSampling from laboratory-confirmed H7N9 avian influenza cases, seasonal influenza cases, close contacts of H7N9 cases and poultry workers were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects in this study.AnimalsAll animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the German animal protection law (Behörde für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hamburg, Germany; licensing number: N124/2021).Study participantsStored serum samples from the acute phase of laboratory-confirmed H7N9 hospitalized patients were collected between 2014 and 2017 through the influenza surveillance network in the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), China. H7N9 patients (n = 98) aged 18 years or older with complete epidemiological information (age, sex, illness onset date, sample collection date, outcome and antiviral treatment) and the required amount of serum were enrolled in this study. Once a patient was confirmed to have H7N9 influenza virus, serum samples and throat swabs from close contacts and epidemiologically linked poultry workers were collected through the influenza surveillance network of the local CDC, China. Swabs were first screened using real-time RT‒PCR to identify influenza A and B viruses in the local CDC or the Chinese National Influenza Center. Samples positive for influenza A virus were further tested for influenza A (H7N9) virus. No influenza A (H7N9) virus was detected in close contacts or poultry workers. A total of 71 close contacts and 108 poultry workers were included in this study as control groups by matching age or sex of H7N9 cases. Archived plasma samples (EDTA plasma) from laboratory-confirmed outpatients (n = 53) and plasma samples of hospitalized patients (n = 39) infected with influenza A (H1N1) pandemic 2009 or influenza A (H3N2) viruses included in this study were selected based on the same age criteria. Plasma samples and throat swabs were collected simultaneously when the patient went to outpatient care or was hospitalized during the 2015–2016 influenza season in China. Plasma samples were archived when seasonal influenza virus was detected using real-time RT‒PCR. All samples from study participants were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.Measurement of sex hormones in human samplesIn human samples, the total concentrations of estradiol (17β-estradiol) and testosterone were measured in the clinical laboratory of the Sino-Japan Friendship Hospital (Beijing, China) from serum samples of study participants (H7N9 patients, H7N9 close contacts and poultry workers) using the Beckman Coulter DxI 800 Access Immunoassay System. The system uses the Access Estradiol Assay (REF 33540, BECKMAN COULTER) and Access Testosterone Assay (REF 33560, BECKMAN COULTER), which apply paramagnetic particles in a chemiluminescent immunoassay for the quantitative determination of total estradiol and testosterone levels (bound and unbound). For plasma (EDTA-plasma) samples from seasonal influenza-infected patients, the levels of estradiol and testosterone were measured using Abcam’s 17β-Estradiol (ab 108667) and Testosterone (ab 174569) ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kits, which have no cross-reaction with EDTA. The majority of circulating testosterone is bound to the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), but it also exists loosely bound to albumin and in the free state. The levels of SHBG and free testosterone were also measured from all H7N9 and seasonal influenza patients using Abcam’s SHBG (ab 260070) and free testosterone (ab 178663) ELISA kits. Converting of testosterone, free testosterone and estradiol units to SI units (nmol/L or pmol/L) was performed either automatically from the measurement platform or manually according to the following formulas: for conversion of testosterone values given in ng/mL or free testosterone given in pg/mL, values were multiplied by the Factor 3.467; for conversion of estradiol values given in pg/mL, values were multiplied by the Factor 3.671 according to the manufacturer´s instructions.Animal experimentsAll animal experiments were conducted at the Leibniz Institute for Virology (LIV), Hamburg, Germany, according to the German Animal Welfare Regulations. Male C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) were purchased from Envigo RMS Harlan Laboratories (Rossdorf, Germany). Mice were anaesthetized with 100 mg kg−1 ketamine and 10 mg kg−1 xylazine by intraperitoneal injection. The animals were intranasally inoculated with PBS, 5 mg kg−1 poly (I:C) or 103 plaque forming units (p.f.u.) of H7N9 influenza A virus (A/Anhui/1/13). On day 1, 3 or 6 post infection (p.i.), respectively, the animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was drawn by the retrobulbar route and collected in EDTA tubes. According to animal welfare protocols, blood can be drawn only twice per week from mice. Therefore, we divided the mice in the experiment into the following three independent groups: group #1 included pre-infection plasma and 1 day p.i. plasma from the same animal, group #2 included pre-infection plasma and 3 days p.i. plasma from the same animal, and group #3 included pre-infection plasma and 6 days p.i. plasma from the same animal. Blood samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g and 4 °C. Lungs and testes of each time point post infection were collected and homogenized in PBS. All samples were stored at −80 °C before measurement. For histopathological examination of testes, samples were fixed in Bouin for 24 h, washed with 70% ethanol and subsequently embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Body weight and mortality were monitored for 6 days.Measurement of sex hormones in murine samplesAnimal sex hormones were measured at LIV, Hamburg, Germany. The total concentrations of estradiol (17β-estradiol) and testosterone were measured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (DetectX, Arbor Assay) from diethyl ether-extracted plasma samples.Cytokine and chemokine measurement in human samplesHuman cytokines/chemokines were measured at Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China. Sera of H7N9 cases and plasma samples from seasonal influenza cases were analysed for a panel of 29 cytokines and chemokines (EGF, Eotaxin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL12-P40, IL12-P70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-1RA, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, TNF-β and VEGF) by Luminex bead-based multiplex assay using a human cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel 96-well plate assay (HCYTOMAG-60K, Millipore, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A smaller panel including 21 selected cytokines and chemokines showing significant differences in H7N9 cases (GM-CSF, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL12-P40, IL12-P70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-1RA, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α and TNF-β) was then used to measure the expression of these analytes for close contacts of H7N9 cases and poultry workers. For undetectable cytokines and chemokines (below the lowest detection limit) in all groups, we assigned a value of 0.1 pg/ml for analysis.Cytokine and chemokine measurement in murine samplesMurine cytokines/chemokines were measured at LIV, Hamburg, Germany. In mouse experiments, pulmonary cytokine and chemokine responses in the lung were analysed for Eotaxin, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, IL-15 and VEGF by Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine kits (Bio-Rad). For undetectable cytokines and chemokines (below the lowest detection limit) in all groups, we assigned a value of 0.1 ng/ml for analysis.Cells and virusesMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK; CCL-32) cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cell line was regularly confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative by PCR. The influenza A virus used in this study is A/Anhui/1/13 (H7N9). Virus stocks were propagated and grown on MDCK cells, and virus titres were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells following established protocols38.Determination of viral titres in murine samplesAll measurements were performed at LIV, Hamburg, Germany. Homogenization of organs was performed in 1 ml 1x PBS with 5 sterile, stainless-steel beads (Ø 2 mm, Retsch) at 30 Hz for 10 min in a MM400 mixer mill (Retsch). For determination of the viral titres, the tissue homogenates were titrated on MDCK cells in 10-fold serial dilutions for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and overlaid with MEM (Sigma‒Aldrich) supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin‒streptomycin, 1 µg ml−1 L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.25% Avicel. After 72 h p.i., the cells were washed with 1x PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the plaques were visualized by crystal violet staining. Total RNA of testis was isolated from the aqueous phase after chloroform treatment using the innuPREP RNA Mini Kit 2.0 (Analytik Jena) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an additional DNase I treatment using the RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN). cDNA was generated using random nonamer primers (Gene LinkTM, pd(N)9, 26-4000-06) and SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For qPCR, specific primer pairs were used for the NP gene of A/Anhui/1/13 (H7N9). The reactions were set up in MicroAmp Optical 96-Well Reaction Plates (Invitrogen), including Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Roche), forward and reverse primers and the cDNA template. RT‒qPCR was conducted on a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche). The standard curve was obtained by analysing serial dilutions of the NheI-linearized pHW2000-H7N9-NP vector construct. The following primer sequences were used for qRT–PCR:NP forward: 5′-CCTGCTTGTGTGTACGGACT-3′NP reverse: 5′-GGCTGTTTTGAAGCAGACGG-3′Determination of the mRNA expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in murine testesAll measurements were performed at LIV, Hamburg, Germany. Total RNA was isolated from the aqueous phase after chloroform treatment using the innuPREP RNA Mini Kit 2.0 (Analytik Jena) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an additional DNase I treatment using the RNase-free DNase Set (QIAGEN). cDNA synthesis was performed using random nonamer primers (Gene Link, pd(N)9, final concentration: 5 μM) and SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two microlitres of cDNA template was added to 10 µl FastStart Essential DNA Green Master Mix (Roche) and 300 nM forward and reverse primers. RT‒qPCR runs were conducted on the LightCycler® 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche) with endpoint fluorescence detection: 180 s at 95 °C and 45 amplification cycles (15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 65 °C and 20 s at 72 °C). The Ct values of each sample were normalized to the Ct values of the reference gene YWHAZ, and the average ΔCt value (n = 2 technical replicates) was determined. The cytokines and chemokines used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.Statistical analysisA two-tailed non-parametric Mann‒Whitney test or t test was used for comparisons of two groups (paired or unpaired), and a non-parametric Kruskal‒Wallis test or one-way ANOVA was used for comparisons of three groups. For linear regression analysis (two-tailed), values without normal distribution were transformed into natural logarithm (Ln) to describe quantitative relations. Due to the explorative nature of the study, no adjustment for multiple hypotheses was performed. Accordingly, statistical test p values were used as explorative measures at marked *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 9.0.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc.), SAS®, version 9.4 TS level 1M5 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) and IBM® SPSS® Statistics 27.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The detected influenza variant appeared distinct from any variant found previously in Denmark. Study: Severe Human Case of Zoonotic Infection with Swine-Origin Influenza A Virus, Denmark, 2021. Image Credit: Liya Graphics/Shutterstock Background As per official records, during the 2021–22 influenza season, 16,160 cases in Denmark were due to the influenza A virus, predominantly the H3N2 subtype. During this time, no cases of swine-origin influenza virus occurred in humans. Since the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, no reports of persistent human-to-human IAVs transmission have come to light. Also, there have been only sporadic reports of human infections with swine IAVs. Yet, the zoonotic potential of IAVs is highly concerning. Case report A young man in his 50s, working at a swine abattoir in Denmark, was hospitalized after acute onset of illness on November 24, 2021. He had dizziness in the night, followed by chest pain, pain radiating toward the left arm, diarrhea, and malaise, but no fever. The patient suffered repeated convulsions and had to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and put on ventilation to cease seizures and manage declining oxygen levels. He had no cardiovascular, kidney, neurological, or other impairment, including pneumonia, that could rationalize his sudden bout of severe illness. However, a pharynx swab sample of the patient tested positive for IAV. Notably, no other coworker at the patient's workplace reported the incidence of influenza. With antiviral medication (oseltamivir) and supportive treatments, the patient's clinical condition improved over the next two days, so he was discharged from the hospital. The researchers submitted the remaining sample material to the Danish National Influenza Center, which confirmed it was positive for the pandemic H1N1 strain. Further analysis by whole-genome sequencing revealed its consensus sequence to be of the H1N1 subtype. Notably, the virus was more similar to swine IAVs than human influenza strains. The team uploaded this sequence to the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database. Related StoriesCurcumin compound reactivates Epstein–Barr virus, offering safer cancer therapyResearch identifies respiratory transmission potential of H5N1 virusUnraveling the mechanism of Shufeng Jiedu Capsules in influenza treatmentThe sequence had no match to IAV sequences in GISAID, as revealed by the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches; however, a comparison to in-house sequences of swine influenza viruses from Denmark showed a close resemblance to 2021 swine IAVs. This viral strain had several genetic and antigenic differences from other influenza A viruses detected in Denmark. Also, it had poor reactogenicity to the currently used human seasonal influenza vaccines. Furthermore, its phylogenetic analyses revealed that most gene segments were similar to the H1N1 subtype. On the contrary, its neuraminidase and non-structural segments belonged to the clade 1C avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) found in Eurasia. Conclusion Earlier in Denmark, an elderly patient with comorbidities experienced classical influenza-like illness (ILI). However, the reported case in this study was unique because a previously healthy adult experienced severe and sudden illness. Another distinct observation was that this patient experienced convulsions, which are rare in adults and typically accompanied by fever or encephalitis. Therefore, the infecting viral strains in these two cases are likely genetically distinct. Detection of a variant IAV via routine surveillance highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring of both human and swine IAVs with zoonotic potential. Additionally, it underscored the need to promptly take countermeasures for those who come in contact with swine owing to their occupation and experience ILI.

Mailing List Events Community Advocate Program Get Help Donate Blog What Workers Should Know About Taking Paid Sick Time as Influenza and RSV Cases Surge Amidst a nationwide increase in cases of viral infections, read on for what workers should know about taking time off work to care for themselves and their loved ones. Posted: November 17, 2022 Blog Categories: Paid Sick Time Recently, throughout the U.S. there has been an increase in cases of viral infections, like the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While both the flu and RSV are common respiratory viruses, both can cause serious health problems, especially for young children and older adults. This season in particular has proven particularly difficult for working parents and families who, along with rising cases of the flu and RSV, are dealing with increases in cases of other illnesses, such as COVID-19 and the common cold. Last month alone, over 100,000 workers in the US reportedly missed work due to illness-related child care problems. Many workers may have access to important paid sick leave protections to help them and their families weather this season. Workers who work in any of the 34 jurisdictions throughout the country with paid sick time laws in effect—including a number of states with higher influenza rates, such as California, New Mexico, Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York State—may have the right to earn paid sick time, which can be used to recover from physical or mental illness or injury or to seek preventive care. Importantly, workers covered by any paid sick time law can also use their sick time to help a family member recover from physical or mental illness or injury, or to help a family member seek preventive care. Thus, workers covered by the sick time laws in these jurisdictions are likely able to use their paid sick time if they or their family members (such as a parent or child) are sick with the flu, RSV, COVID-19, or the cold, or are being vaccinated against the flu or COVID-19. Now that masking, social distancing, and other protective measures that were adopted during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic are less common throughout the U.S., viral infections such as the flu and RSV, which were not as prevalent during the peak of the pandemic, will become increasingly more common. A Better Balance will continue to work toward ensuring that workers throughout the country have access to paid sick time so that they can take time off work to care for themselves and their family members.

Flu levels are still low in some northern-tier states, such as Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine.But even in Minnesota, flu outbreaks in school doubled over the past week, according to the latest surveillance report from the Minnesota Department of Health.The percentage of respiratory specimens that tested positive for flu rose from 12.8% to 14.7% last week at clinical labs, and the percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness, which can include other respiratory viruses with similar symptoms, rose from 5.5% to 5.8%.Though most viruses are still the H3N2 strain, the CDC said the proportion of H1N1 detections has risen over the past 3 weeks and now makes up about 26% of subtyped influenza A viruses.Hospitalization rates for flu are still at the highest level for this point in the season since the 2010-2011 season and are highest in seniors, followed by children up to 4 years old.Two more pediatric flu deaths were reported, bringing the season's total to seven. The two latest deaths both occurred during the first week of November. One involved H3N2, and the other was due to H1N1.Calls for federal action to battle RSV surgeEarlier this week, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association sent a letter to federal health officials asking them to declare a public health emergency for a surge of kids seeking care for respiratory viruses and mental health concerns.In the letter, Mark Wietecha, MS, MBA, the CHA's chief executive officer, said, "Our system is stretched to its limit and without immediate attention the crisis will only worsen." The groups said flexibilities afforded under the COVID-19 emergency were crucial during pandemic surges and fluctuations and that children and children's providers need the same support to keep up with the surge of illnesses and pressure on the health systems.Yesterday, the Biden administration responded, stopping short of declaring a health emergency but emphasizing that it is ready to help communities that need help, according to NBC News.An NBC analysis of federal hospital data reveals that as of Nov 16, 78% of pediatric beds nationwide are full, with seven states reporting that beds are more than 90% full.US cases ebb as BQ.1 nudges ahead of BA.5In its weekly review of COVID data today, the CDC said the 7-day average for new daily COVID-19 cases as of Nov 16 is 40,102, down 3.2% from the week before. The daily average for hospitalizations also declined, down 4.4% compared to the past week. However, the CDC said it is seeing some shifts in hospitalization patterns. In October, the hospitalization rate for babies as old as 6 months old began rising and is now the highest of all pediatric age-groups.The daily average for deaths is also declining, down 5.3% compared to the previous week.In Illinois, COVID-19 activity is elevated in 21 counties, and the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) urged state residents to take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones as they celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday.Sameer Vohra, MD, JD, in a statement said with multiple respiratory viruses circulating, residents should use all tools available to stay safe and healthy. "These strategies include COVID-19 testing, especially if visiting someone at risk for severe disease, enhanced ventilation, good hand hygiene, staying home if sick, and getting up to date with both the COVID-19 bivalent booster and the flu shot," he said.So far, 35.4 million people have received the updated bivalent COVID-19 booster, the CDC said, adding that only 48.7% of Americans have received any booster doses.In its updated variant projections today, the CDC said BQ.1 is now estimated to make up 25.5% of sequenced samples, putting it ahead of its BA.5 predecessor. Also, BQ.1.1 makes up 24.2% of viruses. The CDC said other variants make up 3.1% of samples, much of it XBB, a recombinant Omicron virus that has fueled new surges in parts of Asia.In other COVID developments:In its weekly COVID-19 update today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said markers in the region continue to decline, even in seniors. The group predicts that COVID levels will remain stable over the next 2 weeks.Pfizer and BioNTech today said their updated BA.4/BA.5 COVID booster shows strong antibody response against newer Omicron sublineages, including BQ.1, when compared to the original vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first detected the early increases of flu activity in mid-October. The agency noted that the phenomenon was happening in most of the country, but more intensely in the Southeast and in south-central regions. A month later, levels of the virus continue to rise steeply. According to the latest CDC flu report, 25 states or jurisdictions now experience high or very high levels of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness, which is characterized by fever plus cough or sore throat.Infectious disease expert William Schaffner, a professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, says the rise came four to six weeks earlier than usual. Each flu season is different, but the season’s early arrival was still unexpected. “It was a very big surprise, even to the experienced influenza watchers, that influenza appeared, rose dramatically and became very widespread so early in the season,” he says.Tennessee, where Schaffner is based, is one of the jurisdictions with very high levels of respiratory illnesses at the moment. “In our urgent care clinic at our medical center, one third of the people coming in test positive for influenza,” Schaffner says. “That’s enormous, and it indicates a very wide spread.” Schaffner has also observed an unprecedented increase over the past three weeks in the number of patients in his practice who are hospitalized with influenza.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Credit: Amanda Montañez; Source: FluNet/Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System at the World Health Organization (data) Why Did the Flu Arrive So Early?The reasons behind the early flu season are not entirely clear, experts say. It is also not possible to predict how severe this flu season will turn out to be.Flu all but disappeared in the U.S. in 2020 to 2021, which coincided with the COVID pandemic. And this lack of exposure to flu could have affected immunity, according to the CDC. “Reduced population immunity, particularly among young children who may never have had flu exposure or been vaccinated, could bring about a robust return of flu,” the agency stated on its website in October.“Typically, the population-level immunity is what counts in terms of how many infections we are going to see” in a given season, says Arnold S. Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “Now almost everybody is going around unmasked, so we have the situation where [flu] transmission can go back to what we have normally seen,” he says. The fact that fewer people currently have antibodies against the flu because they weren’t exposed to it during the pandemic may be facilitating the spread of the virus, he adds.That doesn’t mean that lack of exposure to a virus impairs an individual’s immune system, a misconception that is sometimes referred to as “immunity debt.” “Yes, we’ve had less experience with the influenza virus for the last two seasons. But that doesn’t mean our immune system is in any way weakened,” Schaffner says. “We’re still perfectly capable of fighting off the virus and responding to the vaccine.”What Happened in the Past Two Years?The low number of flu cases in the past two years is often attributed to the implementation of preventive measures against COVID, such as masking and practicing social distancing.Although those behaviors may have played an important role, other factors could be involved. According to epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, the key to understanding why other respiratory viruses all but disappeared in 2020 and 2021 lies in how these viruses interact with each other.“We’ve learned in the past that when you have a seasonal virus circulating, it may dampen the ability of other viral respiratory pathogens to take off,” Osterholm says. One example of this phenomenon, known as viral interference, goes back to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, when almost no one was practicing social distancing or masking. Researchers believe that the circulation of a type of common cold virus called human rhinovirus (HRV) in France may have delayed the H1N1 influenza epidemic in that country. Subsequently, H1N1 seems to have delayed the following local wave of the common virus known as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). (RSV is now surging again in the U.S., after a pause during the COVID pandemic’s first year and a large peak in cases in summer 2021.)While RSV is still increasing nationally, it recently started to decrease in the Southeast and in south-central and north-central parts of the country, according to a recent CDC media briefing. “In those three regions, it seems like RSV is trending downward, and influenza is beginning to increase or surge,” José R. Romero, the director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during the briefing. Exactly how these viruses interact with each other on a population level is not yet well understood, but scientists have increasingly been interested in studying this type of interference.What Can People Do to Protect Themselves?While it is impossible to predict how big the 2022–2023 flu season will be, Schaffner says it’s safe to assume that there will be plenty of flu transmission during November and into December, since the western and northwestern parts of the U.S. have not yet been affected extensively.The most important thing people can do to protect themselves from flu is get vaccinated, experts say. The CDC recommends that every person six months and older get the flu vaccine annually. That includes pregnant people. As cases are going up, now is the time to get your shot if you haven’t already. Experts note that the vaccine doesn’t guarantee you won’t get infected. But much like the COVID vaccine, it considerably reduces the risk of serious illness and hospitalization. You can get information on flu and COVID vaccination sites at Vaccines.gov. And it’s safe to get both shots during the same appointment.The CDC estimates that, as of mid-October, more than 26 percent of adults had received a flu vaccine this fall—slightly higher than the estimated 23 percent at the same time last season. This level of coverage is similar to the most recent flu season before the pandemic, when flu shot coverage was 29 percent in adults by the end of October 2019, according to the CDC.Additional habits to prevent the flu are avoiding close contact with people who are sick, staying home when you have symptoms, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and washing your hands often. People may also consider masking again. “If you’re in a venue where people are in close proximity to each other, it’s never a bad idea to mask,” Monto says. “Masking will prevent transmission not only of COVID, but of the flu.”Vaccination, however, continues to be the gold standard to prevent severe disease, no matter how big or small the flu season turns out to be. “Predictions about flu are a hazardous business because you’re so frequently wrong,” Schaffner says. “This is not something we should try to predict to determine whether or not [to get] vaccinated. Just get vaccinated every year.”Rights & PermissionsMariana Lenharo is a life sciences reporter at Nature.

The outbreak is also taking a heavy toll in Canada and Europe. Better known as bird flu, avian influenza is a family of highly contagious viruses that are not typically harmful to most wild birds that transmit it, but are deadly to domesticated birds. The virus spreads quickly through poultry flocks and almost always causes severe disease or death, so when it is detected, officials quarantine the site and cull all the birds in the infected flock. READ MORE: Rising food costs eating up Thanksgiving dinner funds As of early November, this outbreak had led to the culling of over 50 million birds from Maine to Oregon, driving up prices for eggs and poultry – including holiday turkeys. This matches the toll from a 2014-2015 bird flu outbreak that previously was considered the most significant animal disease event in U.S. history. Yuko Sato, an associate professor of veterinary medicine who works with poultry producers, explains why so many birds are getting sick and whether the outbreak threatens human health. Why is avian influenza so deadly for domesticated birds but not for wild birds that carry it? Avian influenza (AI) is a contagious virus that affects all birds. There are two groups of aviain influenza viruses that cause disease in chickens: highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) and low pathogenic AI (LPAI). HPAI viruses cause high mortality in poultry, and occasionally in some wild birds. LPAI can cause mild to moderate disease in poultry, and usually little to no clinical signs of illness in wild birds. The primary natural hosts and reservoir of AI viruses are wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese. This means that the virus is well adapted to them, and these birds do not typically get sick when they are infected with it. But when domesticated poultry, such as chickens and turkeys, come in direct or indirect contact with feces of infected wild birds, they become infected and start to show symptoms, such as lethargy, coughing and sneezing and sudden death. Migrating wild birds, most of which are not harmed by avian influenza, are known to spread the disease to commercial and backyard flocks. Map by the United States Geological Survey There are multiple strains of avian influenza. What type is this outbreak, and is it dangerous to humans? The virus of concern in this outbreak is a Eurasian H5N1 HPAI virus that causes high mortality and severe clinical signs in domesticated poultry. Scientists who monitor wild bird flocks have also detected a reassortant virus that contains genes from both the Eurasian H5 and low pathogenic North American viruses. Reassortment happens when multiple strains of the virus circulating in the bird population exchange genes to create a new strain of the virus, much as new strains of COVID-19 like omicron and delta have emerged during the ongoing pandemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk to public health from this outbreak is low. No human illnesses were associated with the 2014-2015 H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. The only known human case in the U.S. during the current outbreak was found in a man in Colorado who had contact with infected birds. The man tested positive once, then negative on follow-up tests, and reported only mild symptoms, so health experts theorized that the virus may have been present in his nose without actually causing an infection. Health officials recommend avoiding direct contact with wild birds to avoid spreading avian flu. Are these outbreaks connected to wild bird migration? Yes, wild bird migration has been an important factor in this outbreak. Scientists have detected the same H5N1 virus that is infecting poultry in more than 3,000 wild birds during this outbreak, compared with 75 detections during the 2014-2015 outbreak. This tells us that the virus is highly prevalent in wild bird populations. While most detections occur in ducks and geese, the virus has also been found in other bird species, including raptors, such as eagles and vultures, and other waterfowl, such as swans and pelicans. Birds of prey are among the most susceptible: As of early November 2022, wildlife agencies had reported more than 300 bird flu deaths in black vultures, over 200 deaths in bald eagles and more than 100 each in great horned owls and red-tailed hawks. WATCH: A highly contagious strain of bird flu plagues farmers across the U.S. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service conducts targeted sampling to test wild birds in fall and early winter, which correlates with migration season. This helps scientists and wildlife managers understand where avian flu viruses may be introduced to domestic flocks, track their spread and monitor for any reassortment. Because there are high amounts of virus circulating, wildlife agencies advise against handling or eating game birds that appear sick. Waterfowl can also be infected, with no signs of illness, so hunters need to be especially careful not to handle or eat game birds without properly cleaning their clothing and equipment afterward and ensuring the birds are cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 C) before consuming them. Hunters and other members of the public are advised not to approach any wild animals that are acting strange and to report any such sightings to officials. In some cases, avian flu viruses have spilled over to other wild animals, such as red foxes, raccoons, skunks, opossums and bobcats. We did not see this trend in 2014-15. HPAI is a transboundary disease, which means it is highly contagious and spreads rapidly across national borders. Some research indicates that detection of HPAI viruses in wild birds has become more common. Detection of HPAI in wild birds is seasonal, with a peak in February and a low point in September. Many migratory bird species travel thousands of miles between continents, posing a continuing risk of AI virus transmission. On the positive side, we have better diagnostic tests for much more rapid and improved detection of avian influenza compared to 20 to 30 years ago, and can use molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests – the same method labs use to detect COVID-19 infections. How are poultry farmers affected when HPAI is detected in their flocks? To detect AI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees routine testing of flocks by farmers and carries out federal inspection programs to ensure that eggs and birds are safe and free of virus. When H5N1 is diagnosed on a farm or in a backyard flock, state and federal officials will quarantine the site and cull and dispose of all the birds in the infected flock. Then the site is cleaned and decontaminated, a process that includes removing organic materials like manure and chicken feed that can harbor virus particles. After several weeks without new virus detections, the area is required to test negative in order to be deemed free of infection. We call this process the four D’s of outbreak control: diagnosis, depopulation, disposal and decontamination. Flock owners are eligible for federal indemnity payments for birds and eggs that have to be destroyed because of avian influenza, as well as for the costs of removing birds and cleaning and disinfecting their farms. This support is designed to help producers move past an outbreak, get their farms back in condition for restocking and get back into business as soon as possible. But these payments almost never cover all of farmers’ expenses. Poultry farms can’t always recover financially from major bird flu outbreaks. That makes it especially important to focus on prevention strategies to keep the virus out. This is an updated version of an article originally published on April 7, 2022.

This work includes carrying out enhanced surveillance of H5N1 in mammals, which allows us to monitor for any changes in the virus genome that would make it easier to infect people. Our findings are available to read in our technical briefings. In this blog, we explore the key findings from this research and outline the biosecurity plans and monitoring measures that have been put in place in the UK. We also summarise the current guidance for the public and bird keepers on what action to take if they find sick or dead birds. The current situation While H5N1 is primarily a disease affecting birds, the virus has been found in some mammals in the UK over the last few months. Global reports also show some evidence of limited transmission between mammals. These findings follow record instances of H5N1 in both wild and captive birds during 2021-22. While there are sporadic cases of the infection in humans, the evidence suggests that the virus does not spread easily to people. However, viruses constantly change, and we are alert to any changes in the viral genome that would make it more likely to do so. What action should the public take? Wild birds are susceptible to a range of diseases and injuries and not all dead birds will have been infected with avian influenza. However, our advice is to not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds. Members of the public should submit an online report or call the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77 if they find dead wild birds. Currently, in Great Britain, the public are encouraged to report findings of: a single dead bird of prey (including owls) a single dead wild waterfowl (swan, goose or duck) or gull, five or more dead birds of any species. Some of these birds will then be collected and tested to help us understand the risk posed to poultry and other captive birds through understanding how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of wild bird. Reports to the Defra Helpline of found dead wild birds are triaged and not all birds will be collected. Further information on Defra’s approach to wild bird reports can be found here. If avian influenza is confirmed in wild birds, UKHSA put in place measures to reduce the risk to people who have encountered the dead birds. If you are a bird keeper, you must keep a close watch on your birds for signs of disease and maintain good biosecurity at all times. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds, you must report it immediately by calling in England the DEFRA Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office.

Scotland’s Agriculture and Rural Economy Directorate factsheet on avian influenza (bird flu) outbreaks in Scotland Wales: avian influenza (bird flu) latest updates. What happens when the disease is confirmed in poultry or captive birds? The UK has a comprehensive biosecurity plan and monitoring in place to prevent the disease spreading. When avian influenza is confirmed or suspected in poultry or other captive birds, disease control zones are put in place around the infected premises to prevent onward spread. Within these zones, a range of restrictions can apply. As part of the response to avian influenza incidents, the UKHSA has measures in place to monitor individuals who have had concerning exposures to confirmed and suspected cases of avian influenza in birds to monitor their health and give preventative antiviral drugs where appropriate to reduce the chances of them becoming unwell. People who develop flu like symptoms during their monitoring period are swabbed and samples are tested for avian influenza. What about the risk to humans? The latest evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we are seeing circulating in birds in the UK do not spread easily to people. However, viruses constantly evolve, and we remain vigilant for any evidence of changing risk to the population, as well as working with partners to address gaps in the scientific evidence. We are also undertaking a programme looking for any evidence of asymptomatic infections in people exposed to infected birds. People who have had contact with an infected bird or mammal will be asked to take nose and throat swabs at intervals following exposure, which will be tested for the presence of the virus. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has advised that based on the current scientific evidence, avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Everyone should follow FSA’s food safety and hygiene advice. What are you doing to prepare for situation where avian Influenza does spread between people? UKHSA is working with partners to identify ‘knowledge gaps’ around avian influenza, including whether lateral flow devices could be deployed to test for H5N1 in humans and analysis of the genetic mutations that would signal an increased risk to human health. As there has been no evidence globally of sustained human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5N1) and as we cannot predict the characteristics of a novel influenza virus, we have looked to outbreaks of other respiratory viruses to help us determine which testing and surveillance systems would be necessary at the beginning of an outbreak to detect human cases of avian influenza. These scenarios include different options for clinical severity and age profiles of those suffering severe disease to enable us to look at a range of different options for testing and estimate when these would help us identify a human case of H5N1.

The research, led by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the University of Melbourne, found the safe administration of the seasonal influenza vaccine should be a priority in those with SCN1A-postive Dravet syndrome given the likelihood of severe neurological symptoms and complications such as worsening seizures, deteriorating language and motor skills and even death after catching the flu. Pediatric neurologist, Dr Katherine Howell from the Murdoch Children's said the decision for parents to vaccinate children with this syndrome was complex because seizures could be triggered by both infection and vaccination. Dr Howell said despite the syndrome being associated with high rates of prolonged seizures during infections, the impact of influenza had not been previously studied. The research, published in Neurology, involved children with SCN1A-positive Dravet syndrome who had a confirmed influenza infection at The Royal Children's and Austin Hospital. Researchers found 21 children caught influenza 24 times, with brain complications reported in 88 per cent of cases. All presented to hospital with 75 per cent recovering quickly but death or long-term brain complications occurred in one in five infections. Between them they received 60 influenza vaccinations with most tolerating the vaccine well. "Concerns about giving the flu vaccine and incomplete routine immunizations are common in this patient group due to the risk of seizures after vaccination," Dr Howell said. However, because this syndrome is also associated with a high risk of seizures during infections, it highlights the critical need to protect patients from the complications of vaccine-preventable infections like the flu. Our research highlights that the benefits of flu vaccines for these children far outweighs the risks of seizures being triggered following vaccination." SCN1A-postive Dravet syndrome, the most common severe form of genetic epilepsy, occurs in one in 15,000 children. Melbourne mum Renae Caddy's son Fraser, 4, was diagnosed with SCN1A-Dravet syndrome after experiencing seizures as a baby. Renae said her son now received a flu shot every year to prevent prolonged seizures, which are largely triggered by an infection. At 11 months old a case of the flu caused Fraser to have a two-hour seizure and required four days of hospital treatment. "The seizures have gone from monthly to weekly, but they are much shorter now, resolving after a few minutes rather than a couple of hours," she said. But if he has a viral infection he will seize for as long as his temperature is high and may need a lot of medication and even intubation to get his seizures under control. "It can take Fraser up to four days to get back to normal after he experiences a severe seizure so anything we can do to avoid him getting sick we will do." Renae said all his influenza vaccines had been well-tolerated with no seizures. The research is reassuring for parents that it's beneficial for children with this condition to have the flu shot to try and avoid an onset of seizures caused by an infection, which are damaging and terrifying to watch." Dr Katherine Howell from the Murdoch Children's Related StoriesResearch suggests no need for yellow fever vaccine booster after initial doseKetogenic diet linked to gut microbes and seizure reduction in epileptic childrenStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaUniversity of Melbourne Professor Ingrid Scheffer said the findings would change clinical practice. "Identifying safe strategies and strongly encouraging influenza vaccination in children and adults with SCN1A-Dravet syndrome is critical," she said. "Prior to influenza vaccination, vaccine providers should review the child's regular anti-seizure medications and ensure a seizure management plan is in place. The use of additional anti-seizure medications in the post vaccination period, such as benzodiazepines, is now recommended to reduce the risk of seizures following a vaccine and is becoming routine practice."

Read more about how we use GenAI. a b c With many students traveling to visit home or going on vacation for Thanksgiving break, health care professionals are raising concerns about potential spikes in COVID-19 and influenza.Considering that the past two holiday seasons, most students were required to be masked, the risk of spreading infections is much higher this year, experts say.USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman says that the tracked percentage of flu cases crossed over the threshold for the starting stages of an influenza outbreak – rising from less than 1% to 11%.According to Los Angeles County Health, cases have risen from 86 to 100 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 individuals in the last week.Due to the highly contagious nature of the flu, Van Orman is “concerned about the post Thanksgiving, both COVID and influenza together” and stressed the importance of getting the flu shot to prepare for the holiday season.“We’ve had influenza around for a long time,” Van Orman said. “But we still struggle to get everybody vaccinated who needs to be vaccinated, and depending on the year, 30 to 50,000 people die every year of influenza in the United States.” She said that many of those deaths are vaccine preventable, because they’re in people who did not get an influenza vaccine.In an email sent out Friday morning prior to holiday travel from Student Health Information, Van Orman stated students and faculty can pick up COVID-19 testing kits from the Jefferson Lot and Pappas Quad testing sites, as well as the CSC desks in USC Housing and should test if they are exposed to COVID. She also urged students to get a flu shot and the updated COVID-19 booster and strongly recommends that people wear a high-quality mask when they are in indoor public settings.As these numbers continue to rise, students have mixed feelings about the risk that Thanksgiving travel will bring to the USC community.Mimi Geller, a senior journalism major, isn’t concerned about spending Thanksgiving at home because of the small group of people she will be celebrating with. However, she is worried about the risks she’s taking when traveling between home and school.“I plan on definitely masking in the airports and on my way to the airport and things like that. But thankfully I got my flu shot, I got my booster. So I feel confident that I’ve done all that I can to make sure that I don’t get infected with RSV or COVID,” she said.While Geller doesn’t know how many people are going to be taking the same precautions as her when traveling since masks are not required, only recommended in indoor settings, she believes that “people should pay attention to public health officials and listen to them when they say that you should maybe mask.”On the other hand, senior psychology major Christina Merrifield, said she is not concerned about the increase in illness and feels that taking basic sanitary precautions is enough.“People have to go see their families,” she said. “There’s certain cautions that people should take … to remain safe and not spread stuff. But to a certain extent, you can’t really totally control that without being isolated.”Zachary Guan, a senior studying economics and data science, says one of the reasons that he’s not traveling home to China over break is to try and prevent getting any of his friends or family sick, in addition to the quarantine restrictions overseas. Instead, Guan is “choosing to travel to a place where there’s not a lot of people” over the break to enjoy the holiday without the crowds and health risks.According to Van Orman, while the flu season is different every year, it historically appears during the winter from December to March. However, this past spring saw flu cases spreading widely, and Van Orman says she believes this is connected to the end of masking.As of April 18, masks are no longer required on public transportation, even though the Center for Disease Prevention (CDC) still recommends that people continue to mask up. All major U.S airlines including American Airlines and Delta Airlines have since dropped their requirements and moved to “mask optional.”Last year, all USC students taking classes in-person or living in a university residence were required to get the flu vaccine before November 1, in an effort to “help mitigate the potential simultaneous impact of flu and COVID-19 during the seasonal flu time frame in the fall/winter months,” according to USC Student Health.In lieu of the same mandate this year, USC Student Health and USC Pharmacies organized “Vaxchella” last month to create opportunities for and encourage students to get vaccinated, both for influenza and COVID-19.Schedule your COVID-19 booster and flu shot appointment today through USC Pharmacies.Editor's picks1Chargers outlast Titans 27-17 2Ally Batenhorst: The journey of one of the best in the nation3USC defends home court versus Idaho State4The great gaming layoffs and what is behind it 5USC President Carol Folt announces retirement by end of academic year RecommendedStay-away order issued for student who allegedly assaulted a professor with a water bottleUSC celebrates grand opening of Washington D.C.

Most of the cases in wild and domestic birds have been in the northern United States. U.S. Geological Survey Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link The avian influenza outbreak of 2022 will soon become the deadliest in recorded U.S. history.As of Monday, some 50.3 million birds had been lost, approaching the 50.5 million that died in the 2014-15 outbreak.This year’s outbreak was already the most widespread, with 619 premises infected, adding to the case that this is the worst avian influenza outbreak the nation has ever seen. At the same time, there are signs that the U.S. has improved its performance against the disease since the last outbreak. That’s important because the threat of avian influenza isn’t going away any time soon.This outbreak has affected all sectors of the poultry industry, but not equally.By Nov. 8, when the death toll was just under 50 million, the U.S. had lost nearly 39 million laying hens, 8 million turkeys, 2.6 million broilers, 270,000 ducks and 117,000 backyard birds.Most of the birds were killed not by disease but by humans wiping out the poultry on infected farms. In countries that can afford it, depopulation is used to prevent the disease from gaining a foothold and sickening birds on other farms.The massive death toll for layers — three-quarters of the birds lost — came from just 32 farms, or 5% of infected premises. Egg farms have the largest average flock size of any poultry production system, over 1 million birds among the infected farms.By contrast, 346 infected premises were backyard flocks — pastured and small-scale farms raising birds for sale, as well as coops that homeowners keep for personal use.Because of their small flock sizes, backyard flocks accounted for just 0.2% of bird deaths despite being almost 60% of the infected premises.The explosion of backyard cases is a departure from 2015, when only 21 such flocks were infected. That increase could be a result of the unusual virulence of today’s virus strain.Most avian influenza strains start out comparatively mild, living in wild waterfowl. After the disease jumps from wild birds to poultry — via a gap in the poultry house or tracked-in feces — the virus can mutate to cause more severe illness and death.That’s what happened in 2015, when the last major wave of highly pathogenic bird flu hit the U.S.This year, though, the Eurasian H5N1 strain is starting out in waterfowl as infectious as the already-mutated disease from seven years ago. The current strain is even killing wild birds, which don’t usually show symptoms of avian influenza, said Mary Pantin-Jackwood, a USDA veterinary researcher, at a Maryland conference last month.A History LessonThis year’s avian influenza death toll of 50 million has an equal only in the 2015 outbreak.Since the first recorded highly pathogenic outbreaks in the 1920s, the disease has mainly surfaced in a single flock here or there.The only other large outbreak, in 1983-84, killed 17 million birds, mostly in Pennsylvania.The death toll from the two earliest documented outbreaks is unknown, but they were limited to East Coast live bird markets in 1924 and to New Jersey in 1927.In fact, all of the outbreaks until this year were focused in one region of the country. In 2015, most of the 232 infected premises were in Iowa and Minnesota.This year’s outbreak, with two and a half times more infected premises, is essentially nationwide, hitting 46 states and all four of North America’s migratory bird flyways.With such an infectious strain on the loose, things arguably could have been worse.Experts say the nation’s avian influenza response has been fine-tuned since 2015. Depopulation has been sped up. Indemnity payments to farmers have been streamlined. Other countries have agreed to limit the geographic scope of trade restrictions.Indeed, by one measure of efficiency — the monetary cost of response — the current outbreak is not worse than 2015.The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has so far committed $567 million to fighting the current outbreak, compared to more than $850 million in 2015. USDA has described the earlier outbreak as the costliest animal health disaster in the nation’s history.This year’s costs are $348 million to indemnify farmers for birds and eggs that were destroyed; $119 million for depopulation, disposal and virus elimination; and $100 million for personnel, state agreements and related costs, said Mike Stepien, a USDA spokesman.It’s also notable that the U.S. has taken longer to reach 50 million bird deaths than it did in 2015. The previous outbreak was over in six months, while the current one has taken nine months to reach the same grim milestone.A major reason for the slower overall deaths is faster deaths on infected farms.This year’s focus on rapid depopulation has prevented the virus from multiplying in sick birds. Low virus loads, in turn, have minimized farm-to-farm transmission, which was a problem in 2015, said Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA Veterinary Services, at a meeting last month.Regional DifferencesStill, not every poultry-producing region of the country has been affected equally.As in 2015, the Midwest has been brutalized. Pennsylvania, untouched in 2015, has had 34 outbreaks. Other hot spots have formed in the Delmarva peninsula, Utah, central California and the Canadian province of Alberta.Meanwhile, the Deep South has been largely unscathed. Alabama and Louisiana have reported no cases in domestic birds, and Georgia has flagged just two backyard flocks. Mississippi only confirmed its first infected farm on Nov. 5.It’s not that this region lacks poultry — it’s home to several leading broiler states — or that the South lacks wetland habitat.In Alabama’s case, the state simply lies between the main routes of the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways, so fewer birds migrate through the state than through its neighbors, said Ken Macklin, a poultry science professor at Auburn University.Even with good biosecurity, the amount of time birds spend on a farm may also be a risk factor, Macklin said.Broilers, the South’s specialty, average just six weeks in a house. Turkeys and laying hens, with production centered in the North, stay in place weeks or months more.“The longer the birds are in the poultry house, the more likely a breakdown in biosecurity will happen,” Macklin said.The South may also have benefited from good timing — so far.Macklin suspects avian influenza wasn’t so prevalent among wild birds when they flew north this spring, but they may have since spread it among themselves and passed it to waterfowl that live in the U.S. year-round.As birds migrate south this fall, then, they could be carrying a bigger supply of the virus than they had in the spring.“This winter I believe we will have multiple cases of HPAI in the Southern states,” Macklin said, pointing to the recent farm detection in Mississippi and three flocks of vultures that have tested positive in Alabama.HPAI stands for highly pathogenic avian influenza.Beyond BordersThe current outbreak is historic not just by American standards.Europe has been dealing with an avian influenza epidemic of its own — the largest in the continent’s history, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.By Oct. 3, 48 million birds had been killed across almost 2,500 farms. As in the U.S., the disease has had an unprecedented geographic sweep, hitting 37 countries from Portugal to Ukraine to Norwegian islands north of the Arctic Circle.Earlier this month, England required all poultry and captive birds to be kept indoors following an increase in avian influenza cases there.Globally, 145 outbreaks involving 7 million commercial poultry were reported in 14 countries from September to mid-October.Most of the cases were in beleaguered North America and Europe, though Algeria, South Africa and Taiwan were also affected, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.The agency also said the virus had persisted better in wild birds over the summer than it was ever known to before.Europe’s experience also shows that avian influenza can, in rare instances, cross another type of border — from birds to humans.Two poultry farm workers in Guadalajara, Spain, were infected with avian influenza this fall, though there is no evidence they spread it to other people, the World Health Organization said Nov. 3.In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tracked the health of more than 5,000 people exposed to infected birds this year. Only one was found to be infected with avian flu, a depopulation worker from Colorado in April.Avian influenza remains a low risk to the general public, with the concern being greatest for people who have prolonged exposure to sick birds and virus-contaminated surfaces.The CDC says workers in such situations should wear protective gear like gloves and a mask, avoid touching their mouth or nose, and change clothes after handling birds.Even after this outbreak ends — and it’s not clear when that will be — avian influenza will remain a threat to both humans and animals.After all, four influenza pandemics have buffeted humans since 1918, and at least one, in 1968, involved a strain with genes from avian influenza, according to the CDC.For all of the efficiencies of confinement poultry production, the system also puts thousands of birds at close quarters, allowing viruses to spread and mutate quickly, said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University’s Department of Environmental Studies, in a recent paper.Disease risk is also inherent in a globalized food supply chain that moves products quickly across great distances.“It only takes one incident or error in the value chain, anywhere in the world, to cause a global outbreak,” a group of scientists wrote in a paper published this month by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology.To protect birds during the current outbreak, animal health officials are encouraging farmers to refuse unnecessary farm visitors, exclude other poultry owners from the farm, change clothes before and after entering the poultry house, and clean and disinfect footwear.Sick or dead birds should be reported promptly to the state Ag Department.

The same principle underlies vaccination – only in this case, there is no need to risk a serious infection with a virus or bacterium to develop a memory of it.Crucially, this “attacking arm” of our immune system is specific to the pathogen we have previously encountered. “Trying to build immunity to lots of infections is self-defeating – we just get a nasty infection but it doesn’t protect us against others,” said Prof Sally Bloomfield, the chair of the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene.Even catching a cold may not protect you against catching another one a few weeks later. Prof Deborah Dunn-Walters, the chair of the British Society for Immunology’s Covid Taskforce, said: “We call it the common cold, but it is not one agent that gives you a common cold – there are lots and lots and lots of different agents.”What I wouldn’t advise is deliberately trying to get infected, because every infection has a riskProf Pablo MurciaOn the other hand, zero exposure to disease-causing pathogens isn’t necessarily good for us either. After Covid restrictions were lifted there was a surge in cases of respiratory syncytial virus – a common cause of acute lower respiratory infections in young children. “Usually, it is a winter virus, but after people started mixing again we saw lots of children with the virus during all seasons,” said Prof Pablo Murcia, a virologist at the University of Glasgow.Exposure, little and often, may help to refresh the immune system’s memories of commonly circulating bugs, as well as updating them with information about new variants.However, it is not necessary to inhale or ingest large doses of them to trigger the desired effect.“Exposure and disease are two different things,” Murcia explained. “We get exposed to viruses and other pathogens all the time, and often we mount a response without even realising that it’s there. What I wouldn’t advise is deliberately trying to get infected, because every infection has a risk.”Not everyone’s cold will be mild. “How seriously you’re affected by an infection depends on how old you are, and how much [of the pathogen] you were exposed to,” said Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at the University of Surrey. “Everybody who is over a certain age who gets these colds and things realises that it takes a lot out of you. Younger people might be able to shrug it off, but older people should avoid getting repeated infections.”It is also impossible for people to be selective about their exposure to bugs – breathing in common cold-causing rhinoviruses, or picking them up off surfaces, puts people at risk of other illnesses, including Covid.Besides the risk of long Covid, there is mounting evidence that Sars-CoV-2 may have a negative impact on the immune system for weeks or months after the infection has subsided. For instance, recent research by Akiko Iwasaki, at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, has identified an altered balance of circulating immune cells in people with long Covid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather, Covid-19 appears to be skewing the immune system in not a very good way, meaning people may not be able to react to other infections as well.”An article in Nature Communications this week reported on evidence that exposure to Sars-CoV-2 may reduce the diversity of bacteria in our guts, potentially creating space for antibiotic-resistant microbes to thrive. “Our results highlight how the gut microbiome and different parts of the body’s immune system are closely interconnected. An infection in one can lead to major disruptions in the other,” said the study’s author, Dr Jonas Schluter, at NYU Langone Health, in New York.None of this is to say that we need to return to social distancing or mandatory mask-wearing. But if a person is sick – or would like to avoid becoming so – avoiding crowded indoor spaces, and masking up when planning to enter them remains a good idea. So too is regular hand washing, and coughing or sneezing into the elbow.From influenza to winter vomiting bugs, there are plenty of nasties looking for a warm, moist host in which to reproduce as autumn turns to winter.

In the last week, 38,753 COVID-19 vaccinations and 63,149 flu shots have been administered. As of Nov. 17, 2022, close to 2.69 million or 80.3% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines. Boosters have been administered to 1,495,492 or 60% of 2,491,808 eligible San Diegans. Of those with boosters, the County is now tracking separately COVID-19 bivalent boosters. As of Nov. 17, 2022, 15.1 percent of eligible San Diegans have received a bivalent booster. As of Nov. 12, 2022, 813,065 San Diegans have received a flu vaccination, which is 24.3 percent of the 3,351,784 eligible. This year’s flu shot uptake is slightly higher when compared to the same time last year when 23 percent of the eligible population had received a flu vaccine. It takes about two weeks after vaccination until the body develops sufficient immunity against both vaccinations. “I want to congratulate all of those who have recently been vaccinated against the flu or COVID-19, including those newly boosted, and encourage the community to help us improve on that progress,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Don’t let flu or COVID-19 ruin your family reunions this holiday season. You have the ability to protect yourself, your family, and your community.” COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses. There is no vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but established disease prevention measures can protect people from getting ill with any of the multiple respiratory viruses now circulating in the community. These measures include: Consider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces. Wash hands thoroughly and often; Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands; Stay away from sick people; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; Clean commonly touched surfaces; and Stay home and avoid contact with others, if you are sick. COVID-19 Vaccination Progress: Close to 2.69 million or 80.3% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines. Boosters administered: 1,495,492 or 60% of 2,491,808 eligible San Diegans. More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine. COVID-19 Deaths: 14 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 10, 2022. The region’s total is 5,557. Of the 14 additional deaths, seven were women and seven were men. They died between July 16, 2022 and Nov. 4, 2022. Three of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks. Seven of the people who died were 80 years or older, four were in their 70s and three were in their 60s. 12 received at least the primary series of the vaccine and two had not. 13 had underlying medical conditions and one has medical history pending. COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing: 2,298 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 8 to Nov. 14, 2022). The region’s total is now 935,554. The 2,298 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 2,016 infections identified the previous week (Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2022). 5,153 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 12, and the percentage of new positive cases was 5.3% (Data through Nov. 12). The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 12, is 4.3%. Influenza Activity The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths. For the week ending Nov. 12, 2022, the report shows the following: No additional flu deaths, the season’s total remains at 2 Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 10% of all visits (compared with 9% the previous week) Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 2,361(compared to 1,754 the previous week) Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 7,854 (compared to 314 at the same time last season and a 306 prior 5-year average during the same week) More Information: Data updates to the County’s coronavirus-sd.com website will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays. More information about the flu is available on the County’s influenza website.

"Doc" Rogers / AP)The 1917-18 flu pandemic was one of the most deadly infections, killing approximately 50 million people at its peak. Despite its severity and impact, information surrounding the pandemic was limited because of the heavy censorship during World War I. However, Hispanic publications of the time allow us to have a better understanding of the impact of this disease.Last year, partnering with the University of Houston’s Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage Program, I researched the impact the influenza pandemic had as reflected in publications of the time.AdvertisementMost countries fighting in the war, including the United States, were concerned the pandemic decreased public morale toward the war effort and censored media outlets, documents and news articles regarding the subject.AdvertisementHowever, as a neutral power throughout the war, Spain did not engage in wartime censorship and had widespread publications and reporting on the influenza pandemic. Yet, because Spain was the only country reporting on the illness, general opinion mistakenly held that nation responsible for the disease. Hence, the popularized term — the “Spanish flu.”OpinionGet smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyThese censorship efforts had consequences, and today there is limited documentation of the illness, the spread, or precautions taken, severely limiting our knowledge of the flu pandemic.Nonetheless, Hispanic publications in the United States were not restricted by the same levels of censorship because of the language barrier and continued to report on the pandemic and its spread to communities of color. The Recovery Program has collected, preserved and digitized over 1,400 historical periodicals to study them and better understand life in U.S. Hispanic communities, dating from 1808 to the 1980s."El Mañana" from McAllen, a Soanish publication from the influenza pandemic era, in 1917-18. Publications in Spanish reveal what was censored in the English speaking media at the time, says Carolina Lopez-Herrera.(HANDOUT)These periodicals include various published during the 1917-18 pandemic epidemic, such as San Antonio’s La Prensa, Los Angeles’ El Heraldo de México, Tucson’s El Tucsonense, Laredo’s Evolución, and McAllen’s El Mañana, among others. As an intern for the University of Houston’s Research for Aspiring Coogs in the Humanities Program, I was able to work with these archival newspapers.The more I interacted with the documentation, the clearer it became that Hispanic communities throughout WWI were victims of discrimination as their ethnicity and language characterized them as carriers of the erroneously nicknamed “Spanish flu.”AdvertisementIn particular, a column in El Mañana stuck out to me as a clear example of the daily mistreatment that Hispanic communities experienced. The author writes about how he was quietly sitting in a corner of a bar he visited regularly, smoking a cigar when he noticed a white man entering. After looking around the empty bar, the man approached the author. When the author raised his head, the stranger began yelling obscenities about how “his people” started the pandemic.Throughout this altercation, the author reflected on his country of origin. He could not comprehend why he was the recipient of anger toward Spaniards when he was from a South American country. Additionally, the stranger was not the only one negatively impacted by this pandemic; he too had lost loved ones. It was unfair to be blamed for a tragedy that had also taken from him. In the end, angered by these frustrating thoughts, the man decided to leave as the man kept yelling.This article illustrates the frustration, anger and exhaustion reflected in many of the articles that appear in Hispanic periodicals during this time. There was a sense of confusion and alienation felt by many Hispanic communities that were also severely impacted by the influenza. Moreover, it shows how unwanted Hispanics had become in places they had visited and enjoyed frequently. These discriminatory attitudes extended to every aspect of their lives, including the workplace. The author did not imagine that over a century later, members of the Asian community would suffer from the same prejudices during the COVID-19 pandemic.AdvertisementWhat the article fails to articulate, however, is the feeling of hopelessness and dread about loved ones becoming ill and the frenzy of fear and panic that erupted within the community as the systems that were supposed to support them suppressed them. For example, other articles compared how inequitable care was when compared between Hispanics and their white counterparts. White Americans had medics on call and could receive prescriptions without issue, yet Hispanic Americans were either turned away by physicians or had to haggle for help. Furthermore, while white individuals often had the benefit of being able to quarantine, Hispanic populations could not always afford risking a loss of income, something that has replicated in the COVID-19 pandemic as well with essential workers, many of them Hispanics as well.AdvertisementOther articles in the collection also highlight how hectic and harmful living situations could be throughout the influenza pandemic as Hispanic households often included multiple generations of a family, increasing chances of exposure. The core of these injustices was discrimination, which left Hispanic communities to fend for themselves rather than seek out resources from their local authorities.The depth of insight into the daily struggles and societal attitudes uncovered within these newspapers will be available in the forthcoming 1917-1918 Influenza Epidemic Collection, part of the Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage Digital Collections website.The collection includes newspaper articles and advertisements from various Hispanic periodicals related to the 1917-18 health crisis alongside interventions, treatments and community reactions.AdvertisementDespite being a century apart, the COVID-19 pandemic shares many parallels to the 1917 pandemic, including but not limited to mandatory quarantines, face coverings, public unrest, increase in prejudice to a certain ethnic group, government uncertainty, economic instability and lower-income communities being the most affected, demonstrating that we must continue investigating both pandemics to best prepare against future public health emergencies.Carolina Lopez-Herrera is a master’s degree student of public policy and applied economics at the University of Houston.

Older adults and children are most at risk.Respiratory illness is "elevated" across the country as some pharmacies report shortages of the prescription antiviral Tamiflu, which protects against severe flu complications.A flu vaccine is readied at the L.A. Care and Blue Shield of California Promise Health Plans' Community Resource Center in Lynwood, Calif., on Oct. 28.Mark J. Terrill / AP file Nov. 18, 2022, 9:30 PM UTCBy Erika EdwardsInfluenza continues its fast and furious spread across the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday. Most of the worst of respiratory illnesses remain concentrated in Southern states like Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. There are signs that flu is ramping up in other areas such as Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, according to the CDC.Such widespread flu activity this early in the typical flu season hasn't been recorded in the U.S. in more than a decade. That comes ahead of what is expected to be a busy Thanksgiving travel week."Flu hospitalization rates right now are the highest we've seen at this time of year in the past decade," Lynnette Brammer, an epidemiologist and team lead of CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team, said in an email. The unprecedented early flu surge comes amid a nationwide struggle to control a tripledemic of viruses: flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. While young children are most at risk for complications from viral infections, older adults, too, are affected.As of Nov. 12, "influenza-like illness," or ILI, activity — which includes the flu — was widespread across the South and eastern portions of the country.CDCThe flu strains currently circulating, H1N1 and H3N2, tend to affect very young and very old people, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee."Traditionally, we have thought that H3N2 might be more severe in adults," Schaffner said. "But it clearly is out there affecting children at the same time."Rates of flu "are highest among people 65 and older and children less than 5 years old," Brammer said. Is there a shortage of Tamiflu?The number of people diagnosed with influenza has created isolated shortages of Tamiflu, a prescription antiviral drug that reduces the most severe symptoms of flu."We don't have any," a pharmacist in Charlotte, North Carolina, told NBC News, adding that the drug is on backorder, at least at her pharmacy. North Carolina's flu activity remains "very high" according to the latest CDC report.Two other pharmacists in Indian Land, South Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte that sits on the border between North and South Carolina, said they have had to scramble to meet the demand for Tamiflu in recent weeks. Tamiflu is authorized for patients ages 2 weeks and older. It's generally most effective when given within 48 hours of flu symptoms.All pharmacists spoke on the condition of anonymity, as none had been authorized to speak on behalf of their employer. In an email to NBC News, CVS Health said that it is "seeing increased demand" for Tamiflu nationwide."We're continuing to supply stores with Tamiflu and other flu-related medications using our existing inventory network, but there will be increased instances when individual pharmacies could be temporarily out-of-stock," the company said.Pharmacists who spoke with NBC News said that they'd had difficulty obtaining liquid forms of Tamiflu. The antiviral comes in two versions: a liquid and a pill. The liquid version is often used for children and adults who have difficulty swallowing pills.Nationally, however, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that the agency is "not aware of any shortages of Tamiflu or its generics."Flu shots are widely available, although vaccine fatigue may be kicking in, Schaffner said. So far, this season, Americans are "lagging behind" getting their flu vaccines compared to the last few years, he said. The flu vaccine may not prevent infection, but there are signs that this year's flu shot appears to work well at keeping people out of the hospital.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Erika EdwardsErika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLCNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday LogoCalifornia reports first flu, RSV death in child under 5 | KTVU FOX 2 LiveNewsWeatherSportsElectionContests More Watch Live Expand / Collapse search ☰ Search site News LocalNationalCrime2024 ElectionDroughtWildfiresBusinessConsumerWeb LinksWest Coast WrapFOX News SundayMornings Zip TripsTrafficContestsRecipesWeather Weather Alerts Live Bay Area Weather CamerasAir Quality MapWildfiresEarthquakesSevere WeatherWeather AppFOX WeatherSports San Francisco 49ersGolden State WarriorsSan Francisco GiantsOakland A'sSan Jose SharksOakland RootsUSFLFIFA Women's World CupInvestigations California EDDHomelessnessCost of CaliforniaPowerless In PrisonUnleashed Force: Power and Police DogsSpecials California's Electric RevolutionThe FourHigh Stakes: Sports Betting in CaliforniaMade in the BayPowerless In PrisonSports FocusTalk of the TownThis Is Me: Transgender JourneysUnleashed Force: Power and Police DogsVoices For ChangeWest Coast WrapZip TripsBrand SpotlightMoney Personal FinanceThe EconomySmall BusinessRegional News Los Angeles News - FOX 11Phoenix News - FOX 10 PhoenixSeattle News - FOX 13 SeattleAbout Us How To StreamKTVU StaffJobs and CareersContact KTVUFOX Shows and ProgrammingKTVU's ScheduleLive News Stream ScheduleMobile AppsSubscribe To KTVU's NewsletterFCC Public FileFCC Applications California reports first flu, RSV death in child under 5 By KTVU Staff Published November 14, 2022 2:13pm PST California KTVU FOX 2 Share Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit article Fluvirus - Influenza virus or Influenza virus. The influenza virus causes the seasonal flu, with in humans, a set of symptoms associating: fever, headache, cough, pharyngitis, myalgia, asthenia and anorexia. View produced from a transmission electron Expand SACRAMENTO, Calif. - California health officials on Monday reported the first death of a young child due to flu and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection, also known as RSV. "Our hearts go out to the family of this young child," said State Public Health Officer and CDPH Director Dr. Tomás Aragón. "This tragic event serves as a stark reminder that respiratory viruses can be deadly, especially in very young children and infants. We are entering a busy winter virus season – with RSV, flu and COVID-19 spreading – and urge parents and guardians to vaccinate their children as soon as possible against flu and COVID-19." The child was under the age of five. But officials did not provide other specifics such as the victim's exact age, or the location and date of the child's death. Health leaders said young children are most vulnerable to severe complications from RSV and the flu, especially if they have underlying medical conditions or were born prematurely. RSV cases are on the rise. Some Bay Area hospitals have reported that their pediatric wings are filled with young patients with the disease.

This period coincided with the first, intense wave of infection with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Sweden. Subtyping of samples within the laboratory reporting and sentinel surveillance showed that influenza A(H3N2) dominated the season. Altogether, the first wave is considered to have been at a medium level of activity and the second wave at a low level. In total, just over 13,000 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the 2021–2022 season.The spread and surveillance of influenza have both been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020, particularly in terms of health care-seeking behaviour and frequency of testing. Interventions and behaviour changes to reduce transmission of COVID-19 have also likely had an effect on the spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Testing for influenza has increased and reached populations with mild disease that previously had a low coverage of testing, primarily due to the widespread availability and use of multiplex PCR analyses for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. The increased testing means that a higher proportion of people with an influenza infection have been included in laboratory-based reporting than previously, particularly among older children and adults under 65 years of age. In comparison with previous seasons, weekly incidence was lower than seasons before the pandemic among people aged 65 years and older, but was considerably higher among those aged 5–14 years and 15–39 years. The spread of influenza was very low from the spring of 2020 and throughout the 2020–2021 season, both in Sweden and globally. During the summer of 2021, sporadic influenza cases were reported and the autumn of 2021 resembled the start of a regular season, with an increase in cases beginning in November. Several systems showed increasing influenza activity at levels that were normal for that time of year. The first influenza wave started in the beginning of December, and the number of cases reached its first peak in week 50. At the same time, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Sweden, and as the number of COVID-19 cases increased in the beginning of January, the number of influenza cases decreased drastically. The usual increase after the end-of-year holidays did not occur, and an unusually low number of influenza cases was reported during February and March. A second influenza wave started in the beginning of April, and a lower peak was reached in week 16. Influenza continued to circulate into the summer weeks and reached inter-seasonal levels in week 25 of 2022.There were marked geographical differences in the spread of influenza during the season. In the initial wave, the middle parts of Sweden (Svealand) had higher incidence in comparison to the southern (Götaland) and the northern (Norrland) parts of the country. During the second wave, the incidence was higher in the southern (Götaland) part and the northern (Norrland) part of the country, but was overall lower than in the first wave. These trends were also seen in web search data. During the season, 110 patients with influenza were reported as having received intensive care, which was lower than the 2016–2017 to 2019–2020 seasons, during which an average of 311 patients were reported. Of the patients in intensive care, 76 patients were admitted during the first wave of the epidemic and 34 patients during the second wave. Excess mortality was noted during week 1, 2022, which could be related to the first wave of the influenza season and to COVID-19. No excess mortality was seen in the second wave. Among patients who received a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis, 2 percent died within 30 days, which was lower compared to the previous five seasons (range 3–5.5 percent). Within the season, most deaths among laboratory-confirmed cases occurred during the first wave of the season (72 percent), with the highest number of deaths occurring in week 52, 2021. Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation was performed on viruses from a selection of influenza-positive samples collected in sentinel sampling and from influenza-positive samples sent from laboratories around Sweden. In total, 158 A(H3N2), 6 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 11 B/Victoria viruses were genetically characterised with respect to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene. The vast majority of the investigated viruses belonged to genetic groups that in antigenic analyses were poorly recognised by ferret antisera raised against the vaccine viruses included in the influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere 2021–2022. Genotypically, no evidence of reduced susceptibility to the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir was seen in these 175 viruses. In addition, all 11 viruses [10 A(H3N2) viruses and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus] that were phenotypically analysed with respect to sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir were shown to be sensitive to both substances. Analysis of the PA-gene identified no genetic markers associated with reduced sensitivity to baloxavir in any of the 167 analysed viruses [151 A(H3N2), 6 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 10 B/Victoria]. The amantadine resistance mutation S31N in the matrix protein was present in all 170 analysed influenza A viruses.The Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS) participates in the European Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness (I-MOVE) network with data from the sentinel system. In the end-of-season report, the overall vaccination effect was estimated to be 75 percent for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (all ages) and 31 percent for influenza A(H3N2) (all ages), but the vaccination effect for influenza A(H3N2) was not significant in the age group 65 years and older (1). During the 2021–2022 season, the average vaccination coverage among people 65 years and older was 70 percent, which was five percentage points higher than the previous season. The increase was likely due to a combination of increased interest in influenza vaccination during the pandemic and the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with COVID-19 booster vaccines for those aged 65 years or older. Sammanfattning Säsongen 2021–2022 var ovanlig med två influensavågor och en mellanperiod med mycket låg aktivitet. Denna period sammanföll med den intensiva smittspridningen av omikronvarianten av covid-19. Subtypning av prover från såväl sentinelprovtagningen och laboratorierapporteringen visade en kraftig dominans av A(H3) under säsongen. Den sammantagna bedömningen är att säsongens första våg var medelhög i intensitet medan den andra vågen var av låg intensitet. Totalt rapporterades drygt 13 000 fall under säsongen 2021–2022. Såväl spridningen som övervakningen av säsongsinfluensa har påverkats av covidpandemin sedan mars 2020, särskilt när det gäller vårdsökande beteende och testfrekvens. Åtgärder och beteendeförändringar för att minska smittspridningen av covid-19 har sannolikt också haft en effekt på spridningen av influensa och andra luftvägsinfektioner. Provtagningen för influensa har ökat och många prover analyseras samtidigt för influensa, RSV och SARS-CoV-2 genom multiplex PCR, och nått populationer med mildare sjukdom som tidigare haft en lägre provtagning. Den ökade provtagningen innebär att en högre andel personer med en influensainfektion har ingått i laboratorierapporteringen än tidigare, särskilt bland äldre barn och vuxna under 65 år. Jämfört med tidigare säsonger var incidensen per vecka lägre bland personer 65 år och äldre lägre medan antalet fall per vecka i åldersgrupperna 5–14 år och 15–39 år var betydligt högre. Spridningen av influensavirus var mycket låg från våren 2020 och under hela föregående säsong (2020–2021) både i Sverige och i övriga världen. Under sommaren 2021 rapporterades sporadiska fall och hösten liknade inledningen av en vanlig säsong, med ett ökat antal rapporterade fall under november. Flera system visade på en ökande influensaaktivitet som var normal för årstiden. En första epidemistart inträffade i början av december och antalet fall ökade till en topp under vecka 50. Samtidigt introducerades omikronvarianten av covid-19 till Sverige, och när fallen av covid-19 ökade kraftigt i början av januari minskade influensafallen snabbt. Den ökning som brukar ses efter årsskiftet uteblev och ovanligt få influensafall rapporterades perioden februari till mars. I början av april rapporterades sedan ett ökat antal fall och en andra våg sågs med en topp vecka 16. Spridningen av influensa fortsatte in på sommaren och nådde mycket låg nivå vecka 25 2022. Det har varit tydliga geografiska skillnader i spridningen av influensa under säsongen. Under den första vågen kring årsskiftet var det högre incidens i Svealand, jämfört med Götaland och Norrland. Under den andra vågen var incidensen högre i Götaland och Norrland, men sammantaget lägre än första vågen. Dessa trender återspeglades i data från Webbsök för influensa. Under säsongen rapporterades 110 patienter som intensivvårdade med influensa nationellt, vilket är lägre jämfört med i genomsnitt 311 patienter säsongerna 2016–2017 till 2019–2020. Totalt vårdades 76 patienter på intensivvårdsavdelning under första vågen och 34 under andra vågen. Överdödligheten bland personer 65 år och äldre var strax ovanför normalspannet för årstiden under vecka 1, vilket kan relateras till den första influensavågen och till covid-19. Under den andra influensavågen sågs en dödlighet inom normalspannet för årstiden. Bland personer som fått en laboratoriebekräftad influensadiagnos hade 2 procent avlidit inom 30 dagar, vilket är lägre än föregående fem säsonger (3–5,5 procent). Under säsongen inträffade de flresta dödsfallen bland bekräftade fall under första influensavågen (72 procent), med det högsta veckovisa antalet dödsfall vecka 52 2021. Genotypisk och fenotypisk karaktärisering har utförts på influensastammar från ett urval de influensapositiva prover som samlats in genom sentinelprovtagningen samt de som skickats till Folkhälsomyndigheten från svenska laboratorier. Totalt har 158 A(H3N2)-, 6 A(H1N1)pdm09- och 11 B/Victoria-stammar karaktäriserats avseende genetisk grupptillhörighet baserat på hemagglutinin (HA)-genen. De flesta av dessa stammar visade sig tillhöra genetiska grupper som i antigeniska analyser har uppvisat nedsatt reaktivitet mot illerantisera genererat efter immunisering med de respektive vaccinstammar som ingår i influensavaccinet för norra halvklotet 2021-2022. Ingen minskad känslighet för neuraminidashämmarna oseltamivir (Tamiflu®/Ebilfumin®) eller zanamivir (Relenza®) påvisades vid genotypisk analys av neuraminidas (NA)-genen hos de 175 proverna. Ej heller har någon minskad känslighet påvisats hos någon av de 11 stammar [10 A(H3N2), och en A(H1N1)pdm09] som hittills genomgått fenotypisk analys av känslighet för oseltamivir och zanamivir. Ingen genetisk markör associerad med minskad känslighet för baloxavir har identifierats bland de 167 stammar [151 A(H3N2), 6 influensa A(H1N1)pdm09, och 10 B/Victoria] där PA-genen har sekvenserats. Samtliga av 170 analyserade influensa A-stammarna bar på mutation S31N i matrixproteinet vilken ger upphov till resistens mot amantadin. Folkhälsomyndigheten deltar i det europeiska nätverket för att mäta influensavaccinets effekt I-MOVE med data från den svenska sentinelprovtagningen. Vid säsongsrapporten för 2021–2022 beräknades en vaccinationseffekt på 75 procent för influensa A(H1N1)pdm09 (alla åldrar) och 31 procent för influensa A(H3N2) (alla åldrar), dock sågs ingen vaccinationseffekt mot A(H3N2) i åldersgruppen 65 år och äldre (1). Under säsongen var vaccinationstäckningen bland personer 65 år och äldre i medel 70 procent nationellt, vilket är fem procentenheter högre än föregående säsong. Den ökade vaccinationstäckningen är sannolikt en kombination av ökad efterfrågan under pandemin och möjligheten till samtidig influensavaccination och vaccination med påfyllnadsdos mot covid-19 i åldersgruppen 65 år och äldre. About this publication This report describes the monitoring systems for influenza in use during the 2021–2022 winter season and the results of both epidemiological and virological surveillance. Data are also compared to previous influenza seasons. The report has been prepared for the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the Public Health Agency of Sweden’s function as a National Influenza Centre (NIC). Annual reports in English about the influenza seasons in Sweden have been available since 1997, and those from 2000–2001 onward can be found on the Public Health Agency’s website (suggested search “Influenza in Sweden”) (2).Public Health Agency of SwedenLena DillnerHead of UnitUnit for Laboratory Surveillance of Viral Pathogens and Vaccine Preventable DiseasesAnneli CarlanderHead of UnitUnit for Coordination and Surveillance COVID-19 Influenza surveillance in Sweden Influenza epidemics recur in Sweden during winter, with a range of effects depending on the characteristics of the circulating viruses and the level of immunity in different age groups. In order to get an overall picture of on-going influenza activity and to remain prepared in case of a pandemic, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) (PHAS) has a number of different epidemiological reporting systems for influenza ranging from the collection of data from different healthcare providers to the analysis of web searches. Virological surveillance provides additional data on occurrence and detailed information on typing and resistance in circulating strains. Viruses are typed as influenza A or B by regional laboratories in real time during the influenza season, and some laboratories also determine the subtype for influenza A. Throughout the season, viruses from around the country are characterised at the PHAS laboratory with regard to subtype and lineage, vaccine similarity, and sensitivity to antiviral drugs. Viruses are also isolated and sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) in London for further characterisation and to provide a basis for vaccine strain selection. When new strains of influenza virus emerge, reference methods for diagnostics are established at the PHAS and shared with all microbiological laboratories in Sweden. During the influenza season, the PHAS condenses national and international data into a detailed weekly bulletin that is published on the agency’s website (3). A preliminary summary of the 2021–2022 season was published on July 20, 2022 (4). The bulletin provides timely analysis of the current situation in Sweden and abroad and has a wide readership. Updates to national policies and recommendations During the 2021–2022 season, updated web-based information about vaccinations and influenza were published continuously throughout the season. In addition, updated recommendations about influenza vaccination of risk groups were published in October 2021 (5). Current recommendations for influenza vaccination of risk groups (in Swedish) Surveillance 2021–2022 The surveillance pyramid below illustrates the different outcomes and levels of severity and the corresponding surveillance systems for individuals infected with influenza (Figure 1), ranging from the large number of infected individuals to the small number who die as a result of the influenza infection. Table 1 describes the data collection systems that the PHAS used to monitor influenza activity at the various levels of the pyramid in Sweden during the 2021–2022 season and shows a summary of the results of each system. Each system is described further at the start of each section below showing the season’s results in detail. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on influenza surveillance during the season, with changes to healthcare seeking and testing behaviour and increased calls to medical advice lines. Integration of influenza and COVID-19 surveillance is ongoing. Table 2 shows at which week each system, as applicable, crossed the threshold for epidemic start and when it reached its peak notation in the first and second wave, as well as the maximum intensity level measured by the system during the season.

Number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B together with age, gender, and geographical distribution. Influenza virus and sub-/lineage type distribution. 13,150 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and 137 cases of influenza B. In total, 99% influenza A and 1% influenza B. Of influenza A cases subtyped, 1% A(H1)pdm09 and 99% A(H32). Of influenza B cases with determined lineage, of which 0% B/Yamagata and 100% B/Victoria. Voluntary reporting of denominator data Voluntary reporting of number of samples tested sent via email. Proportion of samples tested that are positive 425,423 samples tested with 3% positive. Antiviral sales Weekly data from the Swedish eHealth Agency Number of packages sold by type of sale, including prescriptions and health care requisitions. 7,023 packages Voluntary clinical reporting of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (all types) in intensive care (SIRI) Collaboration with the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR). Treating physicians in intensive care units voluntarily report clinical information about patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Severity of infections by different influenza subtypes and impact on the intensive care units. 110 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported from SIRI. Of those, 94 were reported as influenza A (unknown subtype) and 16 were A(H3). Excess mortality Weekly data on the aggregated number of deaths in Sweden, by age group, is sent from the Swedish Tax Agency to the Public Health Agency and analysed with a statistical model. All-cause mortality (EuroMoMo model) Excess mortality was seen in weeks 1, 4, and 5 (2022) Deaths within 30 days Weekly data on date of death are sent from the Swedish Tax Agency to the Public Health Agency and analysed intermittently. Death within 30 days of influenza diagnosis 272 of 12,973 persons with a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis died within 30 days of diagnosis, of which 97% were influenza A. Most (90%) were aged 65 years and older. Sentinel sampling Samples from some patients who present with influenza-like illness (ILI), as well as some patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI), are analysed by the Public Health Agency for influenza. The proportion of sentinel patients with ILI or ARI who have an influenza infection (see also virus characterisation below). 376 samples were analysed, of which 52 (14%) tested positive for influenza. Of these, 0% A(H1)pdm09, 81% A(H3), 0% B/Victoria, 0% B/Yamagata, and 19% A not subtyped (low viral load). In total, 90% of the patients had clinical symptom of ILI. Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation Continual genotypic and phenotypic analysis of a selection of influenza-positive laboratory and sentinel samples. Genetic affiliation, genetic vaccine similarity, and susceptibility to antiviral drugs among the viruses selected for characterisation. The vast majority of the 175 analysed viruses were shown to belong to other genetic groups than those affiliated to the viruses included in the northern hemisphere vaccines 2021–2022. Genotypically, no viruses with reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir or zanamivir (175 analysed viruses) or to baloxavir (167 analysed viruses) were identified. Phenotypically, all 11 viruses analysed so far (by the WHOCC London) were sensitive to both oseltamivir and zanamivir. The amino acid substitution S31N conferring resistance to amantadine was identified in all 170 analysed influenza A viruses. Vaccination coverage Periodic collection of coverage data from county councils. Vaccination coverage per age group. 70% coverage among those 65 years or older Webbsök (Web Search) An automated system that uses search data from the national medical advice site 1177.se. The numbers of searches for influenza and influenza symptoms are entered into a statistical model that estimates the proportion of patients with ILI visiting general practitioners. Estimates the proportion of patients with ILI. Between week 27, 2021, and week 26, 2022, a total of 287,742 queries related to influenza were entered, which was 3% of the total number of queries on the website 1177.se. Telephone Advice Line (1177 Vårdguiden) Weekly aggregated data on the primary reason for contacting the medical advice line (phone number 1177) and the age group of the person concerned are manually reported to the Public Health Agency through the system Hälsoläge. Data are collected from 18 of Sweden’s 21 county councils (Stockholm, Sörmland, and Värmland are excluded because of data irregularities). Primary reason for calling by age group (adults and children). Approximately 75,821 calls regarding fever in children during the season. Fever in children accounted for 6.6 % of all calls to 1177. During the peak weeks (weeks 3-4, 2022), 8.6% of calls were due to fever in children. Table 2.

(b) Insufficient samples in second wave. Laboratory-based surveillance Testing for influenza Testing for influenza in Sweden is performed with molecular methods, predominately PCR-based tests. All laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza are reported to the PHAS by the clinical microbiology laboratories. Laboratory reporting of positive cases is mandatory according to the Communicable Disease Act. Denominator data (the total number of samples analysed) are reported voluntarily by the laboratories. As less expensive and faster systems for influenza testing have become available, testing has expanded from mainly hospital settings to also include outpatient care, including primary care to some extent. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the patterns of testing of influenza in Sweden. The introduction of combined tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV has led to a surge in performed influenza analyses and to a different demography of tested individuals. At most, approximately 28,000 samples were analysed per week in weeks 2-3, 2022, corresponding to the peak weeks of the first Omicron wave in Sweden, see Figure 2. The number of samples analysed per week was significantly higher during the 2021–2022 season than the seasons preceding the pandemic, see Figure 3. Since the testing has increased, a greater proportion of people with an influenza infection have been diagnosed, and thus have been included in laboratory-based reporting, than previously. More people with milder symptoms have been tested than during previous seasons, and testing has been higher than usual particularly among older children and adults under 65 years of age (based on analyses of RSV-denominator data, not shown). In turn, more laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported among these age groups than in previous seasons, see also Age and sex distribution of cases. Figure 2. Number of samples analysed for influenza and the proportion of positive samples, season 2021–2022. Figure 3. Number of samples analysed for influenza data per week, per season, 2017–2022. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases The 2021–2022 influenza season was unusual with two epidemic waves separated by very low influenza activity. The first wave of the epidemic started in the beginning of December, week 48, and the number of cases reached the first peak in week 50, during which 2,500 cases were reported (Figure 4). In the beginning of January, as the number of cases of COVID-19 increased, the number of influenza cases decreased drastically. An unusually low number of influenza cases were reported during February and March. A second influenza wave started in the beginning of April, and a second, smaller peak was reached in week 16, during which 450 cases were reported. The two peaks of the season were also seen in the percentage of positive cases (Figure 5). The first peak at 15 percent positive was seen in week 50, followed by a second peak in week 16 at 6 percent positive. During the intervening period of low activity from week 2 until week 13, 1 percent or lower of samples were positive for influenza. Nearly all of the cases (>99 percent) during the first peak (week 50) were influenza A, and influenza A(H3N2) was the dominating subtype during the season. See also Subtyping and lineage determination. In comparison with recent seasons, the number of reported laboratory-confirmed influenza cases during the current season (13,287) was similar to the number of reported cases in seasons 2016–2017 and 2018–2019, see Table 3. However, the lower percentage of positive samples this season in combination with the increased testing shows that despite the similarity of the number of reported cases the current season was milder. During the two peak weeks (week 50 and 16), the percentage of positive samples was lower than recent season peaks (Figure 5). Overall, 3 percent of the samples taken were positive for influenza, which was lower compared to previous seasons, except for 2020–2021, reflecting the high levels of testing compared with previous seasons and the low to medium intensity of the epidemic (Table 3).

Viral distribution During the 2021–2022 season, 13,287 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, of which nearly all were influenza A (99 percent). Table 3 summarises the laboratory reporting results over the last five seasons, including the number of analysed samples and the proportion of positive samples as well as the total number of positive samples by type.

The highest proportions of cases (34 percent) of laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B were seen among individuals aged 15–39 years followed by persons aged 65 years and older (27 percent). People aged 65 years and older had the highest cumulative incidence (171 per 100,000 population) followed by children aged 5 to 14 years (162 per 100,000 population) (Figure 6, see also Table 4). Children aged 5–14 years had the highest weekly incidence, peaking in week 50 followed by persons aged 65 years and older in week 52 (Figure 7). Compared to the four previous season, the incidence of the dominant type of influenza for those aged 65 and older was lower compared to seasons 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 during which influenza A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata circulated, respectively (Figure 8). The peak in weekly incidence amongst children aged 5–14 years and people aged 15–39 years was strikingly higher compared to the four previous seasons (Figure 9 and 10). Changes in the testing during the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic probably influenced the high incidence among children. Older children who previously would not get tested for influenza as often were tested more this season. The median age of individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (35 years) also reflects the increase in younger individuals who were diagnosed with influenza (Table 5). Significantly more women (55 percent) than men (45 percent) had laboratory-confirmed influenza (p < 0.001), which likely reflects a slightly higher testing rate among women than men. Data from a selection of laboratories indicate that more women than men were tested during the season (not shown). The majority of the influenza B laboratory-confirmed cases were seen among individuals aged 15–39 years (38 percent), followed by persons aged 65 years and older (29 percent) (Table 4). The median age for influenza B was 39 years (Table 5). Figure 6. Incidence (per 100,000 population) of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases per age group, Sweden, 2016–2022 seasons (a).

Geographic distribution There were marked geographical differences within Sweden in the spread of influenza during the season. In the initial wave, the middle parts of Sweden (Svealand) had higher incidence in comparison to the southern (Götaland) and the northern (Norrland) parts of the country (Figure 11). Svealand had a peak in incidence in week 50, whereas Norrland followed by Götaland peaked in week 52 at a lower incidence. In January, the influenza activity decreased to a very low level in all regions, and only sporadic cases were reported during February to March. During the second wave, the incidence was higher in the southern (Götaland) part and the northern (Norrland) part of the country, but were overall lower than in the first wave. The percentage of samples positive for influenza had peaks in week 50 for the middle part of the country (Svealand), whereas the southern (Götaland) parts of the country and northern (Norrland) parts peaked in week 52. Altogether, the middle parts of the country (Svealand) had the highest cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases this season, with 184 cases per 100,000 individuals, followed by the northern parts (Norrland) and southern parts (Götaland), both with 82 cases per 100,000 individuals. The greatest numbers of cases were reported from regions with large urban areas (Stockholm, Skåne, and Uppsala). However, in relation to population size, the counties of Uppsala, Västmanland, and Norrbotten had the highest cumulative incidence, and these counties also had higher than average sampling for influenza. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases might be affected by healthcare-seeking behaviour as well as differences in sampling in the various regions; thus, no direct conclusions can be drawn regarding actual influenza activity using the measured incidence. Figure 11. Weekly incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza per 100,000 population and county from week 40, 2021, to week 20, 2022. Antiviral sales Every Monday, the PHAS receives data from the Swedish eHealth Agency on the previous week's sales of the antivirals zanamivir and oseltamivir. Data include prescriptions and healthcare requisitions. Data on prescriptions reflect patients seeking medical care for influenza-like symptoms, whereas requisitions are a combination of medical staff preparations for intense periods as well as patients currently in treatment. Cumulative sales of antiviral medications were at higher levels compared to the last season 2020–2021, but lower than during the last intensive influenza season of 2017–2018 (Table 6). During the 2021–2022 season, sales first increased steeply in the beginning of December (week 49) at the same time that influenza cases were increasing. This increase primarily reflected increased requisitions from hospitals and long-term care facilities. After this period, sales followed the pattern of influenza cases, decreasing through January and increasing again to another, smaller peak around the influenza peak in weeks 15–18. Sales of antivirals were lower than the number of influenza cases during the 2021–2022 season. Table 6.

A special module in the registry, known as SIRI, allows reporting of patients at an intensive care unit with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The module includes individual factors on underlying medical conditions, complications, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, influenza type and subtype, and other data for patients under treatment. During the 2021–2022 season, 110 patients with influenza were reported as having received intensive care (Table 7). All of the patients had influenza A, and of 16 subtyped samples all were influenza A(H3). Of the patients in intensive care, 76 patients were admitted during the first wave of the epidemic and 34 patients during the second wave during the spring (Figure 12). The greatest number of patients were admitted to intensive care during week 51 and 52 (17 patients and 15 patients, respectively), just after the peak of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza in week 50. In comparison to the four previous seasons, fewer patients were reported being in intensive care during the current season. The majority of the patients (48 patients) were 65 years or older, followed by individuals aged 40–64 years (27 patients). The median age for influenza patients admitted to intensive care was 61 years. There was no significant difference in sex distribution, with 50 percent of cases of each sex. Of all reported cases in intensive care, 80 patients (73 percent) were in a risk group for severe influenza illness, either due to age (65 years and older) or due to having one or more medical risk factors. Among patients under the age of 65 years, approximately half (32 patients, 52 percent) did not have a medical risk factor for severe influenza. Chronic heart-lung disease (47 patients), diabetes (25 patients), and immunosuppression (16 patients) were the most commonly reported risk factors during the season. Three of the patients were reported to be pregnant. Vaccination status was known for 42 patients who were in risk groups and therefore recommended vaccination. Of these, 22 patients were vaccinated this season (52 percent). The majority (20 patients) of the patients that had been vaccinated were aged 65 years or older. The median age for vaccinated patients was 76 years. Of the patients requiring intensive care, 26 individuals (24 percent) were reported to have died. The majority (92 percent) of the deceased had a medical risk factor or were aged 65 years or older and therefore were at increased risk of severe influenza infection. The median age of patients who died was 75 years. Figure 12. Number of patients with influenza in intensive care by influenza type or subtype per week, 2021–2022 season. Table 7.

Incidence of patients in intensive care with influenza To enable comparison with the past seasons, we estimated the weekly incidence of patients in intensive care with influenza based on preliminary estimates of regional catchment population denominators. Compared with previous seasons, the highest peak in weekly incidence in weeks 51–52, 2021, was lower than most (Figure 13). The cumulative incidence was also lower than that of previous seasons and followed a somewhat different pattern due to the two waves of infection (Table 8, Figure 14). Table 8.

Influenza-related mortality Influenza-related mortality is often noted during influenza seasons and varies with circulating strains and the intensity of the season. The PHAS uses different systems to measure influenza-related mortality. Data on laboratory-confirmed influenza patients are intermittently linked to Swedish Tax Agency data on death in order to identify deceased individuals and to retrieve their dates of death. If 30 days or fewer have elapsed since the influenza diagnosis, the death is considered to be influenza related. This measurement is not specific nor is it sensitive. It is imprecise because a death within 30 days might have been caused by something else, and it is not sensitive because this measure does not include deaths if the diagnosis of influenza was not laboratory confirmed. Therefore, there are most likely a large number of unrecorded deaths from influenza. In addition, the data do not include information about underlying risk factors or complications of influenza infection. The analysis below includes data on cases reported until June 26, 2022 (Sunday week 25). Status after 30 days could not be ascertained for 207 cases without a national identification number. To better estimate mortality, a model is used to identify excess mortality during the influenza season using the aggregate number of deaths in Sweden per week. The EuroMOMO model estimates the crude excess mortality for the whole country by age group and regionally. Deaths within 30 days of influenza diagnosis In total, 296 of 13,749 persons who received a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis during the 2021–2022 season died within 30 days of diagnosis. This corresponds to 2 percent of the laboratory-confirmed cases, which is lower compared to the previous five seasons for which this analysis has been possible (range 3–5.5 percent, see Table 9). Within the 30 days, most (76 percent) of those who died did so within 15 days of diagnosis. Within the season, most deaths among laboratory-confirmed cases occurred during the first wave of the season (67 percent died between week 40 and week 6), with the highest number of deaths occurring in week 1, 2022 (39 deaths), see Figure 15. Patients who died had a median age of 84 years of age, and patients who did not die within 30 days of diagnosis had a median age of 35 years, which reflects the high rate of testing among people under 65 years of age during the season and the burden of severe influenza illness among the elderly. In total, 7 percent of all people aged 65 and older who had a laboratory-verified influenza died within 30 days, which is similar to the 2018–2019 season, which was of low intensity. During the 2021–2022 season, influenza A(H3N2) was dominant, which is similar to the 2016–2017 season; however, incidence of reported cases in the older age groups was lower (see Age and sex distribution). Of deaths occurring within 30 days of sampling, nearly all had an influenza A diagnosis (288 people). Four of those who died had both influenza A and B, and four had influenza B. This is reflective of the low circulation of influenza B during the season (see Subtyping and lineage determination). Of those who had not died within 30 days, 99 percent had influenza A, and less than 1 percent had influenza B (125 cases) or both influenza A and B (68 cases). For most of those with influenza A who died within 30 days, no subtype was specified (90 percent, 260 patients), while 29 were influenza A(H3N2) and 1 was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Slightly more women than men died within 30 days of an influenza diagnosis (51 percent of the deaths were among women), but the difference was not statistically significant. Figure 15. Deaths among laboratory-confirmed influenza cases per week of death, 2021–2022 season. Table 9.

The proportion of deaths within 30 days increased with increasing age and varied from 0.1 percent for persons aged under 40 years to 19 percent for people 95 years and older. The analyses were not adjusted for expected mortality per age group. Table 10.

It excludes 207 patients whose personal identification number was not included in the case report, meaning that their status at 30 days could not be ascertained. Excess mortality During the 2021–2022 influenza season, excess mortality was noted during week 1, which could be related to the first wave of the influenza season but could also be related to the ongoing circulation of COVID-19. This was followed by excess mortality during week 4 and 5, which was likely due to the high level of COVID-19 transmission at the time. Influenza-related mortality is more often seen in the age group 65 years and older and mainly during seasons dominated by influenza A(H3N2). Older people are the most fragile in terms of the risk of dying from influenza. Despite the fact that influenza A(H3N2) dominated the season, excess mortality that could be influenza-related was lower than during intense seasons dominated by influenza A(H3N2) and during 2017–2018, which was dominated by B/Yamagata, likely due to the lower intensity of spread this season. Sentinel sampling A network of sentinel sampling sites for influenza surveillance was established in Sweden (1999). The active sentinel sampling sites are mainly general practitioners (GPs), but paediatric clinics and infectious disease clinics are also part of the network. Virological analysis of samples from sentinel sites contributes to national and international surveillance of circulating influenza viruses. In order to estimate what proportion of the patients seeking care for influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) actually has influenza, sites are encouraged to collect nasal samples from symptomatic patients. The samples are sent to the PHAS for initial PCR analysis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (included since week 10, 2020). Samples with positive findings from the PCR-analysis are further analysed and the viral strains are characterized. The PHAS carries out laboratory analyses free of charge for these samples. Patient characteristics, including age, sex, risk factors, syndrome (ILI vs. ARI), and vaccination status, are included in the analysis of the virological findings. During the 2021–2022 season, 376 sentinel samples were submitted from 35 GP sites, and none of the paediatric or infectious disease clinics provided samples. In total, 52 samples (14 percent) tested positive for influenza. Figure 16 shows the distribution of samples taken and the positive samples by subtype/lineage. The first positive sentinel sample was taken week 44, and the highest number of positive cases was seen in week 50. During the second epidemic wave in the spring, some positive cases were detected in sentinel surveillance. This pattern was seen in other surveillance systems. Due to late circulation in 2022, the sentinel monitoring of influenza continued after week 20. All positive samples were confirmed as influenza A and none as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A-positive samples, 42 (81 percent) could be typed and belonged to influenza A(H3). No cases of influenza A(H1)pdm09 were found within the sentinel samples. Ten influenza A samples (19 percent) could not be subtyped due to low virus concentration. Of the positive samples, two were co-infections of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. One of the influenza-positive samples could be subtyped as A(H3), while the other could not be subtyped. As a consequence of different aspects of the pandemic, the activity of sentinel sampling sites during the 2021–2022 season has been limited, and hence less data from sentinel sampling have been collected. As a part of the continued work on integrated influenza and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, sentinel surveillance will be strengthened going forward through the recruitment of more sentinel sampling sites. The main goal is to ensure geographical representativeness of the population at national and regional levels. Figure 16. Number of sentinel samples submitted each week, number of samples by subtype/lineage, and the percentage positive, 2021–2022. Clinical features Of the 376 patients sampled through the sentinel system with known symptoms, 90 percent had ILI and 10 percent had ARI. In total, 60 percent of the samples came from women. Thirty-five percent of the samples were collected from patients belonging to a risk group due to age and/or medical condition (n = 131). Of these, 75 percent were aged 65 years or older (n = 98). The most common reported medical risk factors were lung disease (n = 22), heart disease (n = 16), diabetes (n = 13), immunosuppression (n = 10), and pregnancy (n = 1).

Influenza infection among vaccinated patients Vaccination status was reported for 283 (75 percent) of the 376 patients sampled during the season. Of these, 86 (30 percent) were vaccinated. Among the patients belonging to a risk group (131), 49 percent were vaccinated. Influenza A was detected among 5 vaccinated patients. Influenza A(H3) was detected in 4 patients, and one patient had non-subtyped influenza A. The PHAS participates in the European Influenza Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness (I-MOVE) network with data from Swedish sentinel sampling. In the end-of-season report for 2021–2022 (1), the vaccination effect was high for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (75 percent, 95% CI: 43–89 percent) and lower for influenza A(H3N2) (31 percent, 95% CI: 15–43 percent) for all ages. The estimated vaccination effect for influenza A(H3N2) was not significant in the age group 65 years and older (estimate 31 percent, 95% CI: –11 to 58 percent). No estimate was available for influenza B due to limited circulation. Virus characterisation Subtyping and lineage determination All diagnostic laboratories perform influenza typing using molecular assays for influenza A and B and some perform subtyping of influenza A. The PHAS performs subtyping and lineage typing by real-time PCR for all samples sent in from the diagnostic laboratories and on all positive samples from sentinel surveillance. In Sweden, influenza A(H3N2) dominated the 2021–2022 season, and circulation of influenza B and A(H1N1)pdm09 was limited. In total, 1,114 influenza A-positive samples from laboratories in Sweden were subtyped during the season, of which 1,102 (99 percent) were A(H3) and 124 (1 percent) were A(H1)pdm09. The lineage was determined for 13 influenza B-positive samples. All belonged to the B/Victoria lineage and none to the B/Yamagata lineage. Typing results for subtype and lineage from sentinel and laboratory reporting systems are presented in Table 13. In the sentinel sampling system, a higher proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B than influenza A(H3N2) is usually detected during mixed seasons such as 2019–2020. In the sentinel system, patients are sampled by their GPs and generally have milder disease. When influenza A(H3N2) is dominating, influenza usually more severely affects older age groups, resulting in a higher proportion of A(H3N2) detected in the laboratory surveillance system because these samples are primarily taken at hospitals.

Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation A selection of the influenza-positive samples from laboratories and from the sentinel surveillance programme are genetically characterised though whole genome sequencing (NGS on an Ion Torrent platform), and viruses isolated on cell culture undergo phenotypic sensitivity to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using a MUNANA-based NA inhibition assay. Samples are selected to be as representative as possible in terms of geographical location, period of collection, and type/subtype/lineage type. The Swedish laboratories are also asked to send influenza-positive samples from severely ill or deceased patients, patients with vaccine break-through infections, and patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment. These samples all undergo further characterisation if the viral load is high enough. Genetic characterisation and virus isolation is usually successful for samples with a real-time PCR Ct-value ≤30 or below. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene is further analysed and affiliated to genetic groups in accordance with ECDC influenza characterisation guidelines. In addition, the parts of the HA gene that are the target for the subtype/lineage-specific real-time PCR systems used at the PHAS are analysed for sequence mismatches compared to primers and probes used in these systems. The NA gene is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by the NA inhibitors oseltamvir (Tamiflu®/Ebilfumin®), and zanamivir (Relenza®). The PA gene is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with a >3-fold increase in IC50-value for baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). The matrix gene of influenza A viruses is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to result in resistance to amantadine. The parts of the matrix gene sequences of influenza A and B that are targets in the real-time PCR systems that are used for detection of influenza at the PHAS are analysed for mismatches to the PCR primers and probes. Phenotypic analysis of susceptibility to the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir is performed with the neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assay on a selection of the cell-propagated virus with the aim to cover all NA-sequence variants. A representative selection of the isolated virus samples is sent to the WHOCC in London for antigenic characterisation and for phenotypic analysis of susceptibility to NA inhibitors with the NAI assay. Characterisation data are continuously reported to ECDC via TESSy, and sequence data are continuously uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Genetic groups The genetic groups of the 175 characterised Swedish influenza A and B viruses from the 2021–2022 season are shown in Tables 14A through C by influenza subtype or lineage and in the phylogenetic trees in Appendices 1–3. Of the characterised viruses, 158 were subtype A(H3N2), 6 were subtype A(H1N1)pdm09, and 11 were lineage type B/Victoria. Table 14A.

The general antigenic properties of the genetic groups have, however, been summarised in the report by the WHO in conjunction to the influenza vaccine composition recommendation meeting for the northern hemisphere 2022–2023 held in February 2022. The antigenic analyses with ferret antisera raised against the respective vaccine viruses included in the northern hemisphere vaccine 2021–2022 showed the following (7): A(H3N2): Antisera raised against viruses similar to the vaccine virus A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a.1) reacted poorly with viruses in the genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a.2, while viruses in genetic groups 3C.2a1b.1a and 3C.2a1b.1b were recognized well by ferret antisera raised against cell culture-propagated but not egg-propagated A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020-like viruses. A(H1N1)pdm09: Antisera raised against the cell culture-propagated vaccine virus A/Victoria/2570/2019 or the egg-propagated vaccine virus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (both genetic group 6B.1A.5a.2) reacted well against viruses in genetic group 6B.1A.5a.2 but poorly against the 6B.1A.5a.1 viruses. B/Victoria: Viruses in genetic group V1A.3 were recognized well by antisera raised against the vaccine virus B/Washington/02/2019 (genetic group V1A.3), while V1A.3a.1 and V1A.3a.2 were recognized poorly. Antiviral susceptibility The NA gene of 158 influenza A(H3N2), 6 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 11 influenza B/Victoria viruses were sequenced and analysed for amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. In addition, 10 A(H3N2) and 1 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were analysed for phenotypic sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir by WHOCC in London. All 11 viruses were shown to be sensitive to both inhibitors in this analysis. Additional phenotypic results are pending from both the PHAS and the WHOCC. The PA gene of 151 A(H3N2), 6 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 10 B/Victoria viruses was sequenced, and none of the amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with a >3-fold increase in IC50-value to baloxavir were detected. The amino acid substitution S31N in the matrix protein, which confers resistance to amantadine, was present in all 170 Swedish influenza A viruses [163 A(H3) and 7 A(H1)pdm09]. Virus isolation on cell culture Influenza-positive samples for virus isolation on MDCK-SIAT1 cells were selected from samples collected through the sentinel sampling and from samples sent to the PHAS from the Swedish laboratories. Samples are selected for virus isolation based on genetic properties of the virus as determined by sequence analysis, geographical location, period of collection, and type/subtype/lineage type. In addition samples of special interest are selected for virus isolation, for example, samples from severely ill or deceased patients, patients with vaccine break-through infections, and patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment. Samples with a Ct-value >30, as well as samples known to have been inactivated in the laboratory are not selected for isolation. A total of 42 viruses [34 A(H3N2), 2 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 6 B/Victoria] were successfully isolated on MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Of these, 30 virus isolates along with 23 matching clinical samples were sent to the WHOCC London for further characterisation in December 2021 and June 2022. Recommended vaccine composition In February 2022, the WHO recommended that the quadrivalent vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere in the 2022–2023 season contain the following viruses (7). WHO recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2022-2023 norther hemisphere influenza season (who.int) Egg-based vaccines The WHO recommends that the following viruses be included in egg-based vaccines: A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus Cell-based or recombinant-based vaccines The WHO recommends that the following viruses be included in cell-based or recombinant-based vaccines: A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus For trivalent vaccines, exclusion of the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus is recommended. Vaccination coverage There is no national register for influenza vaccinations in Sweden, but data on vaccination coverage among persons 65 years of age and older have been gathered by Sweden’s 21 county medical officers for their respective county councils since 2003. The PHAS took over this task in 2014. Various methods for estimation have been used in different counties, including the use of vaccination registries, the number of vaccine doses given or distributed, sentinel reports on vaccination coverage, surveys among general practitioners, and patient record data. These methodological differences result in coverage estimates of varying quality and precision. Although the methods vary between counties, the methods within most counties have been roughly the same for the past several years, allowing a comparison over time. An estimate of the vaccination coverage in age groups younger than 65 is included, using data from a subset of county councils where registry data by age group are available throughout the season as well as annually. Data for 2021–2022 come from Gävleborg, Jämtland Härjedalen, Jönköping, Kalmar, Kronoberg, Norrbotten, Stockholm, Sörmland, Värmland, Västernorrland, Västmanland, and Östergötland. Coverage among persons 65 years of age and older The national vaccination rate among persons aged 65 and older was approximately 70 percent in 2021–2022, which was five percentage points higher than the previous season (see Figure 17). The increase is likely due to a combination of increased interest in influenza vaccination and the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with COVID-19 booster vaccines for those aged 65 years or older. The PHAS estimates that just under 1.5 million people aged 65 and older were vaccinated this season. Coverage was, as in previous seasons, highest among people aged 85 and older (75 percent), followed by those aged 75–84 years (74 percent, see Table 15). Figure 17. Vaccination coverage among persons aged 65 and older in Sweden, 2010–2011 to 2021–2022. Vaccinations began at the end of October at long-term care facilities, where high-dose vaccines were used. The public vaccination campaign started on November 9, 2021 (week 45), during which quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines were used. Regional differences in vaccination coverage Comparisons among county councils are difficult because estimates use different methods and there is uncertainty associated with each value. Figure 18 gives a picture of the current vaccination coverage rates for the age group 65 years and older throughout Sweden. For more regional data and collection methods, see the Swedish-language summary of the season published in July 2022 (4). Figure 18. Estimated proportion of vaccinated persons aged 65 and older per county council in Sweden for seasons 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 (a). (a) Notes: Different methods to estimate coverage were used in each county, which makes comparison difficult. Percentages were calculated using the county population on December 31 of each year (Source: Statistics Sweden). The data from Gotland come from a patient record system and directly from private healthcare offices. Data for 2021–2022 from some smaller private providers are missing. Data from Halland do not include data on county staff or some of the regional staff. The data from Jämtland Härjedalen include vaccinations given within the regional healthcare system, and doses given at elder care and other facilities are under-reported. Skåne has changed data source to a patient record system for 2021–2022 from a financial system and registry. Data from Stockholm only include vaccinations given to people in medical risk groups (including pregnancy) or those aged 65 years or older. Sörmland and Norrbotten changed data sources from registries to patient record systems on Mar 8, 2022, and Dec 13, 2021, respectively. For Norrbotten, data on regional healthcare staff vaccination are missing. Västmanland has a new registry, but all doses have not been registered. Uppsala data are based on data from a patient record system and reports from private healthcare clinics as a basis for remuneration. Data on vaccinations given in elderly care may be incomplete. Data from Värmland do not include data from private healthcare clinics. Örebro uses data from primary care patient records, which includes doses given to patients in county care facilities and doses given at private healthcare clinics, but doses given in hospitals are not included. Data from Östergötland are based on patient records that include patients in county care facilities and the regional healthcare system, but not vaccinations given at private healthcare clinics, at pharmacies, or through occupational health services. Vaccination coverage among persons under 65 years It is difficult to estimate vaccination coverage among the medical risk groups under 65 years of age because these groups are hard to define and because data are often missing. Twelve county councils (see note under Table 15) have reported the number of persons vaccinated under 65 years of age, although risk group status is often unknown. See Table 15 for a breakdown by age group. Table 15. Percentage vaccinated per age group, 2020–2021 and 2021–2022.

Syndromic surveillance Two systems of syndromic surveillance were used during the 2021–2022 influenza season – Webbsök (Web search) and telephone calls to the medical advice line 1177 Vårdguiden. Webbsök is an automated system established in 2008 that uses a statistical model and completely anonymous data from a medical advice website to estimate the development of sentinel ILI incidence. Data are received daily and analysed weekly. The results are published on the web every Monday during the influenza season in the form of a graph (9), which is three days ahead of the publication of the weekly influenza bulletin. In collaboration with the medical telephone advice line 1177 Vårdguiden, the PHAS receives aggregated weekly data on calls from a system called Hälsoläge. The age group and main reason for calling are registered for all callers. The reported data include the number of calls related to cough, fever, and sore throat. The proportion of calls related to fever in children has been found to be a good indicator of influenza activity in the community. Web search data (Webbsök) According to Webbsök, the 2021–2022 influenza season lasted for 4 weeks, from weeks 49–52, 2021 (Figure 19). The influenza activity was at low levels throughout the season. Between week 27, 2021, and week 26, 2022, a total of 287,742 queries related to influenza were entered, which was 3 percent of the total number of queries on the website 1177.se. Webbsök had one peak, in week 51, 2021, which rapidly decreased. The peak corresponded with the first peak for the laboratory-based surveillance (Figure 20). Some activity was detected by Webbsök during the second influenza wave, but at a very low level. Figure 19. Webbsök’s estimated proportion of the population with ILI per week, 2021–2022. Note that the increased levels during weeks 42–46 (grey period) some seasons are deemed due to searches related to influenza vaccination rather than increased influenza activity. The statistical model is sometimes affected by intensive media coverage and other factors that change how people search for information on 1177.se. Webbsök should therefore be interpreted with some caution and seen as a complement to the PHAS’s traditional monitoring methods (e.g., laboratory-based and sentinel surveillance). Figure 20. Webbsök’s estimated proportion of persons with ILI (incidence per 100,000 population) and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, 2021–2022. Note that during week 17 there was a technical error. Telephone advice line data (1177 Vårdguiden) The percentage of calls to 1177 Vårdguiden regarding fever in children exceeded the epidemic threshold in week 39. The percentage of calls regarding fever among children was at a low level for most of the season but reached a medium level during week 51, 2021, and week 3 and 4, 2022, at around 8 percent. During the second wave of the influenza season, the percentage of calls regarding fever among children varied between 4.5 and 6.5 percent, with the highest levels in weeks 15–16 and 18–20. Fever among children is a non-specific indicator and can be due to causes other than influenza, not least COVID-19. An average of 6.6 percent of the calls throughout the surveillance season (weeks 40–20) were regarding children with fever (Figure 21). This was higher than the previous season when this figure was 2.9 percent. The highest number of calls in a calendar week was 3,299 calls in week 4, 2022, which was higher compared to the previous season’s highest peak (1,710 calls). This was during the peak of the omicron variant of COVID-19 in Sweden. The highest percentage of calls this season was 8.6 percent (compared to 4.1 percent last season) and was registered during weeks 3-4, 2022. A noticeable peak in calls is often seen around the Christmas holidays every year, followed by a drop. The reason for this pattern might be decreased access to face-to-face healthcare services during the holidays leading to an increase in telephone consultations. Figure 21. Percentage of telephone calls regarding fever in children received by the medical advice line 1177 Vårdguiden for the past three seasons. Quality assessment External quality assessment programmes provide a comparison of method performance between laboratories and are a tool to ensure accurate laboratory testing. The PHAS takes part in several external programmes and produces a panel for other Swedish laboratories. Surveillance is dependent on such standardised methods. At the PHAS, one-step real-time RT-PCR assays are used detect influenza A and B, to subtype influenza A positive samples, and to discriminate between the two influenza B lineages. These assays have also been optimized, implemented, and evaluated for avian influenza diagnostics. This is essential because these assays are sensitive, rapid, and can be scaled up if necessary. The PHAS continuously monitors the genomic sequences of circulating influenza strains in order to detect mutations that could affect the sensitivity of our PCR assays. The PHAS also performs in silico (computational) validation of each assay twice a year, both before and during the peak of influenza season. Every year the PHAS produces a PCR panel for Swedish laboratories on behalf of the External Quality Assessment for Clinical Laboratory Investigations (EQUALIS). This allows laboratories to measure the analytical sensitivity and specificity of their methods. The majority of the laboratories performing diagnostics for influenza use commercial PCR kits. A number of these laboratories participate in additional quality controls during the season in order to ensure that circulating influenza strains are detected with these kits. National quality assessment programme for influenza PCR In September 2021, the PHAS produced a new PCR panel for Swedish laboratories, which was distributed by EQUALIS. Twenty-one laboratories participated in the panel, and all of them reported 10/10 correct results (Figure 22). Figure 22. Results of the Swedish External Quality Assessment panel 2021. Control of commercial PCR kits Commercial PCR kits for influenza detection are widely used for diagnostic purposes. Each fall, ahead of the influenza season, a survey is conducted to determine which PCR kits are used by Swedish clinical microbiology laboratories. The survey also presents the option to participate in a panel in order to ensure that the PCR kits that are used are able to detect current circulating influenza strains. For the 2021–2022 season, the survey was distributed to 24 different laboratories, of which 22 replied. All responding laboratories used commercial PCR kits. Of these 22, 15 reported using more than one commercial kit, and 3 used both commercial kits and in-house PCR detection. Eight laboratories, using in total 13 different commercial PCR kits, were selected to receive the panel. The following kits were evaluated: GeneXpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV (Cepheid) NeuMoDx Flu A-B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 Vantage Test (NeuMoDx, Qiagen) InflA/InflB/RSV/(SARS-CoV-2) (Alinity) VitaPCR™ (SARS-CoV-2)/Flu A/B & RSV* (Credo Diagnostics) Biofire® FilmArray (BioMerieux) Panther Fusion (Hologic) Seegene Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV BD-MAX Viasure SARS-CoV-2, Flu(A+B) & RSV Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV Direkt (DiaSorin) BD SARS-CoV-2/Flu for BD MAX™ System GenomEra SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B+RSV kit (Abacus Diagnostica) LightMix ModularDx kit (TIB Molbiol/Roche) QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Qiagen) A summary was presented on the PHAS website in order to inform other laboratories about the results. In the event of methodological issues with clinical samples, Swedish clinical microbiology laboratories are welcome to contact the PHAS to compare their results or to obtain sequence data for further investigation. External quality assessment programmes The PHAS participated in two external quality assessment programmes during 2021. The results are summarised below. Annual WHO External Quality Assessment Programme for influenza The PHAS participated in the annual WHO External Quality Assessment Panel for influenza (no. 20) during 2021. Molecular detection, typing, sub/lineage-typing Ten samples analysed by real-time PCR were correctly typed (A, B, or negative). Seven of these were influenza A, with subtypes A(H1)pdm09, A(H3), A(H5), and A(H7) detected. Two influenza A samples could not be subtyped with real-time PCR, but whole-genome sequencing suggested they were subtype A(H9), and this was confirmed in the final report. This procedure follows the routine protocol at the PHAS in cases where Influenza A subtype cannot be established and where virus titres are high enough for further investigation. Genotyping and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility determination Genotyping analysis of the NA gene was performed by NGS on an Ion Torrent platform, and the results were correct for all three samples (two A(H1N1)pdm09 and one B/Yamagata) included in the programme. Phenotypic analysis was performed using a MUNANA-based NAI assay (fluorescence-based), and the results were correct for all three samples (same samples as above). QCMD 2021 Influenza virus A and B RNA external quality assessment programme (21S) Real-time PCR accurately detected the correct type, subtype, and lineage in all ten samples analysed. Subtyping and lineage typing identified influenza A(H1)pdm09, A(H3), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. References Kissling et al.

Ben Hohenstatt / Juneau Empire File Two bear cubs walk in a Juneau field on a summer evening. Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced Friday that highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in a bear cub in Bartlett Cove, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. It’s just the second time the virus has been detected in a bear. Glacier Bay bear cub diagnosed with bird flu in rare case Health officials say risk to mammals, including people, remains low. by Ben HohenstattFriday, November 18, 2022 2:18pmNewsState & Legislature A black bear cub in Southeast Alaska was sick last month with bird flu, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The cub found in Bartlett Cove, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, is only the second instance of highly pathogenic avian influenza being diagnosed in a bear amid an ongoing outbreak. “The (highly pathogenic avian influenza) passes really easily to poultry, but mammals aren’t really susceptible to it,” said Dr. Kimberlee Beckmen, wildlife veterinarian for the department. “It’s difficult to get, but we suspect the cub probably ate a bird that died from avian influenza.” Beckmen said the cub being a young, small animal with a relatively weak immune system likely contributed to it ultimately becoming ill. The detected illness is not a sign highly pathogenic avian influenza is likely to further spread to other animals or people, Beckmen said. “This particular strain, people are pretty much immune to it,” she said. After the virus was first detected in an adult female black bear in June in Quebec, Canada, state veterinarian Dr. Robert Gerlach and Beckmen have tested scavenging animals for it. So far they have only detected the virus in just two other animals, red foxes in Unalaska and in Unalakleet. Beckmen said that comes despite highly pathogenic avian influenza “really hammering” the state’s wild bird population. “If it was more transmissible to mammals we would’ve picked it up before,” she said. The diagnosis of the Bartlett Cove cub comes after people, including a park biologist working in Glacier Bay, noticed in October one of three black bear cubs accompanying a sow was having difficulty walking, according to the fish and game department. The cub was eventually abandoned by the sow. Shortly after a biologist picked up the cub, it began suffering seizures – as did the Canadian bear previously diagnosed with the illness – and was euthanized by an area biologist. Further examination of the cub showed no signs of trauma, so samples were collected and sent to diagnostic laboratories to rule out usual seizure-causing disorders, including rabies and canine distemper, according to the fish and game department. The virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in multiple samples at Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, according to the fish and game department. It was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory this week. The particular strain of bird flu poses a “very low” risk to humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only one person in the U.S. and three people in the world have been diagnosed in the outbreak, according to the CDC. Beckmen noted the U.S. man who was diagnosed did not become ill after the virus was detected in his nose. There have been no human infections reported in Alaska, according to the state Department of Health. However, health officials advise hygiene when handling sick animals or butchering wild animals for consumption. “There’s low-transmissibility to people, but you never want to be harvesting or handling animals that appear to be sick,” Beckmen said, noting the sick bear cub was visibly ailing. Poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit and meat to 145 degrees to avoid risk of infection. “If you cook the meat there’s no risk of this virus or any of the bacteria causing a problem,” Beckmen said. • Contact Ben Hohenstatt at (907)308-4895 or bhohenstatt@juneauempire.com.

Sign-Up Here Home The Evidence Shows Masks Work They aren’t perfect, but they certainly help curb airborne transmission of viruses. Christopher Labos MD, MSc | 18 Nov 2022 COVID-19MedicalCritical Thinking Add to calendar Facebook LinkedIn Tweet Widget This article was originally posted in the Montreal Gazette. As we see cases of multiple respiratory viruses rising in Canada and around the world, we now have to deal with not just COVID-19, but also respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) and influenza. As a result, overcrowded ERs are functioning so far beyond capacity it beggars belief and the health-care system is struggling to provide people with the optimal care they deserve. One of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to prevent airborne virus transmission is to wear a mask, ideally a well-fitted N95. Hence the Public Health Agency of Canada’s reiteration to do so and Sunday’s suggestion by Quebec’s Collège des médecins that everyone wear masks in public spaces. Some people oppose masks for purely political reasons. However, some oppose their use because they claim that either they do not work or, the more subtle argument, that there is no good evidence that they do. At the beginning of the pandemic, universal mask use for the general public was unheard of. That, and the fact that we collectively under-appreciated how important airborne spread was in viral transmission essentially wrong-footed the conversation around masks from the get go. However, claims that there is no data supporting mask use are just untrue. Even prior to the pandemic, lab studies showed masks prevent the spread of infection, though the studies were in the context of influenza. During the pandemic, it became clear that masks were effective. Data from Massachusetts found that COVID rates rose sharply in March 2020, but stabilized when universal masking was implemented for health-care workers at the end of March, and started decreasing when implemented for patients at the beginning of April. In fact, many other reviews of the published data have found that wearing masks reduced the risk of being infected. Critiques of this data focus on two points. First, that studies are mainly observational, that is, not randomized, and they did not look at the general population. Critics point to a randomized study from Denmark showing that masks don’t work. But they neglect to mention that what was studied was not mask use, but a government recommendation to wear masks. Unsurprisingly, asking nicely isn’t usually enough to get people to change their behaviour. Fewer than half the people in the study actually wore the mask as directed. A more relevant study was a cluster randomized trial from Bangladesh where villages with community-level masking saw a decrease in COVID-19 infections. Another recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows the impact of mask-wearing in Boston-area schools. Using a difference-in-difference statistical design, that is, comparing the difference before with the difference after changes in mask policy, researchers were able to look at how different schools fared when they lifted mask mandates at different times. The researchers found that lifting mask mandates resulted in an extra 45 cases per 1,000 students and staff, or an extra 12,000 cases, which translated into just under 30 per cent of all infections in that time period. I am at a loss as to how some people (including to my great surprise some physicians) can look at the data and doubt the efficacy of masks in preventing respiratory viral transmission. I can only speculate as to their reasons. Some may indulge in the kind of therapeutic nihilism that classifies everything as either perfect or useless because, sadly, masks are not perfect and indeed they only work if people actually wear them. But in life, things aren’t always clean and perfect. When deciding if masks work, we have to look at the pre-pandemic data, simulations with aerosols in labs, data from inside hospitals and the research from the community at large. Look at it all, and clearly masks help reduce the spread of viruses. They aren’t perfect, but they help. And in a pandemic where hospitals are overwhelmed, every little bit helps a lot. @DrLabos Keywords: COVID-19masksResearchinfluenzapandemicrespiratory viruses What to read next Lorenzo's Oil Contributed to the Treatment of a Devastating Disease 8 Nov 2024 Linoleic Acid Is Neither Villain Nor Superhero 8 Nov 2024 Nutrafol; A Holy Grail for Hair Loss or an Overpriced Supplement? 8 Nov 2024 What if Dr. Kellogg had watched Seinfeld? 1 Nov 2024 Are Füm’s Essential Oils Safe to Inhale? 1 Nov 2024 Is There a Magic Bullet for Alzheimer's Disease? 25 Oct 2024 Back to top Department and University Information Office for Science and Society McGill University 801 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A 0B8 Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram McGill University Copyright © 2024 McGill University Accessibility Cookie notice Cookie settings Log inReduce your risk of getting sick this Thanksgiving season | CNN CNN values your feedback 1.

Video Ad Feedback A spike in RSV for children leave hospitals overwhelmed 02:08 - Source: CNN CNN — With this year’s Thanksgiving the third since the onset of the pandemic, there are now many tools to help manage Covid-19 risk, including safe and widely available vaccines. But this coronavirus still presents a danger, especially to older people and those with chronic medical conditions. There are also other viruses circulating across the United States, including influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) that are causing some pediatric hospitals to be overwhelmed. There are steps we can all take to reduce risk and allow for happy, in-person reunions over Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays, says CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. FG Trade/E+/Getty Images What are steps people can take to protect themselves and their loved ones against Covid-19 during Thanksgiving dinners and other gatherings over the coming holidays? Is it still important to require vaccines for attendees at such events? Does a mini-quarantine period help to reduce risk? If people are testing before gathering together, when should they test, and with what tests? And what’s the best way to protect against other circulating viruses? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert, and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.” CNN: What can people do to reduce the risk of catching Covid-19 and becoming severely ill when gathering over Thanksgiving and other winter holidays? Dr. Leana Wen: The same mitigation measures we were discussing last Thanksgiving still apply. The most important thing we can all do to reduce the likelihood of becoming severely ill is be up-to-date with the Covid-19 vaccine. This is particularly important for individuals who are 65 and older and adults who are immunocompromised or have other chronic medical conditions that predispose them to severe disease. Note that it takes about two weeks to reach optimal protection from the vaccine, so it’s best not to wait until just before a gathering to get inoculated. And don’t forget the flu vaccine, and for those eligible, the pneumonia vaccine, too.

(Christina House / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images Thanksgiving is two weeks away. Get your updated Covid-19 shot now, health officials warn The virus that causes Covid-19 is airborne, and good ventilation is key to reducing its spread. Gathering outdoors remains much safer than indoors. It’s already getting very cold in some parts of the country, though, and we know indoor settings can be made safer by opening windows and doors, using fans and HEPA filters, and limiting capacity. The more people attend a gathering, the higher likelihood that someone could be infected and not know it. The risk can be lowered if everyone agrees to take a Covid test the day of the gathering. Of course, masking is a precaution that will reduce risk, though it’s harder to do when attending events with food and drink. Some individuals who are particularly vulnerable and really want to avoid Covid-19 may wish to wear a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask during indoor gatherings, and only take the mask off when they are outdoors. They should also eat and drink outdoors; that way, they keep their mask on at all times while indoors around others. CNN: If someone in the family is vulnerable, should everyone else mask and reduce their risk for several days before gathering — in essence, enter a “mini-quarantine”? If there are going to be vulnerable people in attendance, those who have symptoms such as a cough and runny nose should stay home. Basilico Studio Stock/iStockphoto/Getty Images Wen: Some families will want to take additional precautions and essentially enter a bubble with one another over the holidays. This is a sensible thing to do if there are vulnerable family members to consider, and when it’s not practical to only see them outdoors. What I advise in this mini-quarantine period is for everyone to reduce their own exposures as much as possible. For about 5 days prior to the gathering, everyone participating in the mini-quarantine should wear a high-quality mask when going to indoor spaces like offices, schools, grocery stores and onboard buses and trains. They should not dine indoors in restaurants or gather with others not in their households. And just before the gathering, everyone should take a Covid-19 test. This mini-quarantine plus testing doesn’t guarantee that everyone in attendance will be free from the coronavirus, but it will help to reduce exposure and risk. CNN: For those testing before gatherings, when should they test, and with what tests? Wen: It’s best to test as close to the get-together as possible. The test should definitely be taken the same day as the gathering. In general, PCR tests are more accurate for picking up early infections compared with antigen tests. The problem is that PCR tests are much less available, especially for same-day results. A home rapid antigen test, if done just before attending an event, can be a helpful tool — with the understanding that there’s still a chance someone could test negative and be carrying the coronavirus. CNN: Last year, the prevailing advice was to require the vaccine for all attendees at holidays. Is this still important? Wen: The primary purpose of vaccination is to reduce the likelihood of severe illness. The Covid-19 vaccines are very good at doing this, and that’s the main reason we should all get vaccinated — and that those at risk remain up to date on their shots. Michael Nedelman has made a photo illustration. Michael Nedelman Quick and stealthy 'Scrabble variants' are poised to drive a winter Covid-19 surge But people who are vaccinated can still carry Covid-19, so vaccination alone is probably not enough of a protection against infection. If you are really worried about contracting the coronavirus, you should take additional steps to protect yourself regardless of whether others you’ll be gathering with are vaccinated. CNN: The coronavirus isn’t the only virus that families may be worried about. What’s the best way to protect against other currently circulating viruses, like influenza and RSV? Wen: If there are going to be vulnerable people in attendance, those who have symptoms such as a cough and runny nose should stay home. Viruses like influenza and RSV are spread primarily through droplets, so people should keep washing their hands frequently, including after touching high-contact surfaces. The other mitigation measures that help reduce the risk of Covid-19, including ventilation and masking, will also help to reduce other virus transmission. CNN: Many Americans have stopped coronavirus mitigation measures. Why might they want to resume them for the holidays? Wen: The main reason is if they are getting together with a loved one who wants to continue to be cautious. Many people may not be actively avoiding Covid-19 themselves, and if they are gathering only with others who all feel this way too, that’s one thing. But many people may be getting together with family who are elderly and people with underlying medical conditions. Gatherings are generally planned by taking into the account the needs of the most vulnerable. There are steps we can take to reduce risk and allow for happy, in-person reunions over Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Kids' Health Cold & Flu The Safety of Tamiflu for Children By Vincent Iannelli, MD Updated on November 18, 2022 Medically reviewed by Lyndsey Garbi, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Benefits Downsides Side Effects Antiviral Resistance Close Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is a popular oral antiviral drug used to treat or prevent the flu (influenza). Despite its popularity, the use of Tamiflu in children remains somewhat controversial. It's not uncommon for parents to claim that it doesn't always work, to read reports suggesting that overuse can lead to the development of treatment-resistant influenza strains, or to hear some warn that using Tamiflu causes hallucinations and suicidal thoughts in kids. It can be hard to separate fact from fiction, so here's a look at what the research says. Verywell / Alexandra Gordon Benefits Tamiflu is one of four antiviral drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of influenza. The other two include the intravenous drug Rapivab (peramivir) and the inhaled drug Relenza (zanamivir). Unlike other antivirals used to treat the flu, these three drugs are effective in treating both influenza A and influenza B viruses. Tamiflu has been FDA-approved specifically to treat influenza in children 2 weeks of age or older and to prevent the flu in children 1 year of age or older. It is not recommended for mild cases, however. According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are a number of benefits of using these antivirals. The chief one being prevention of severe illness from the flu. Prevention of Severe Illness When taken within 48 hours of exposure, antiviral drugs can help prevent severe illness and complications from the flu. This can mean having milder symptoms instead of a serious illness that requires a hospital stay. Children are considered to be at high risk for flu complications like pneumonia and respiratory failure if they're under the age of 5 years and/or they have an underlying health condition such as asthma, lung disease, diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, kidney or liver problems, blood disorders, cancer, immunodeficiency, or cerebral palsy. These drugs are also a source of prevention of severe illness for exposed kids who can't get a flu shot, such as those who have had a previous allergic reaction to a vaccine. Other Benefits Other benefits identified by the CDC include: Reduced symptom duration and severity: Using antiviral drugs like Tamiflu within 48 hours after symptoms have begun can decrease the amount of time that flu symptoms last, as well as how bad they are. Decreased risk of complications: Antiviral drugs may lessen the risk of complications that can occur from the flu, including pneumonia, ear infections, hospitalization, and respiratory failure. Shorter hospital stays: When kids are hospitalized for the flu, early antiviral treatment can shorten the length of their hospitalization and help prevent respiratory failure or death. Even if your child is past the 48-hour window, an antiviral drug may still help. Effective for infants: Though it's not FDA-approved, the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend using Tamiflu to treat babies under 14 days old with the flu. Downsides Despite evidence supporting the use of Tamiflu in children, there are a number of barriers that have prevented parents from using it. Cost Price is chief among the concerns, with a five-day course running over $100 without insurance. While lower-cost generics are now available, the price is still significant. Try looking online for prescription discounts and coupons if your child needs Tamiflu. Not Understanding How it Works Some parents don't believe that Tamiflu actually works. In most cases, however, this is related more to using it incorrectly or having unrealistic expectations than to the drug itself. Practically speaking, the effectiveness of Tamiflu can vary depending on when the treatment is started. To this end, most healthcare providers recommend that the drug is taken within 48 hours of the first appearance of symptoms. The problem, of course, is that parents can sometimes miss or dismiss minor symptoms like sniffles or a scratchy throat for a day or two, particularly if the child seems otherwise well. Moreover, while some people think Tamiflu is supposed to immediately kill the flu virus and banish all symptoms, the fact is that it doesn't work as an antibiotic, though it will likely decrease the length of time your child sick. Tamiflu also doesn't work on other kinds of viruses, so it won't help if he or she has something other than the flu. Not Using It for Prevention Tamiflu can be extremely effective in preventing serious illness in a child who hasn't yet been vaccinated or who is at high risk for flu complications and has been around other people with the flu. However, because the benefits are largely invisible, parents will often only reach for it when symptoms appear, rather than use it for prevention. This is a mistake. Any high-risk child should be treated with Tamiflu as soon as possible after exposure to the flu. Side Effects Parents often associate price with potency and fear that a drug like Tamiflu may cause more symptoms than it relieves. For the most part, this is untrue. According to the FDA, the two most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, which are usually not all that severe and occur within two days of starting treatment. Taking Tamiflu with food can usually lessen the risk of these side effects. Other side effects may include mild stomach pain, nosebleeds, headache, and fatigue. More serious side effects have been reported. Reports mostly from Japan in 2005 and 2006 suggested that Tamiflu increased the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delirium and hallucinations, and could lead to thoughts of self-harm or suicide in teens. To date, no similar events have been reported, and further studies have not found any increased risk of neuropsychiatric effects in Tamiflu users. However, updated product labels do now include an advisement that hallucinations, self-injury, abnormal behavior, and suicidal thoughts, while exceedingly rare, are possible. If you notice any serious side effects while your child is on Tamiflu, call your healthcare provider right away. Antiviral Resistance As with antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections, there have long been concerns that the widespread use of antiviral flu medications could lead to the development of a supervirus. To date, we have not seen this. Because the influenza viruses can change so quickly, the CDC routinely tests for antiviral resistance and has found little to no resistance during the past flu seasons. This regular testing also identifies which antivirals the CDC should recommend each flu season and helps keep guidelines updated. That said, taking any medication when it's not really needed is ill-advised. Besides the potential health risks, it may limit the supply of the drug for those who truly need it. 5 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

November 15, 2022 By Verna Yiu As the Fall semester progresses and the temperature cools, we are entering the annual cold and flu season – and this season is expected to be worse than previous years based on current data. As a result, community members may be more likely to need time away to care for dependents and themselves. I thank all of you who have followed personal health measures since returning to campus, including those of you who have stayed home when you were feeling unwell. In the coming weeks, it will be especially important for each of us to continue taking these steps, to prioritize our health and the health of our colleagues and students. Boost your immunity with vaccinations One way to boost one’s immunity and help others stay healthy is by getting the influenza vaccination and the bivalent COVID-19 booster. You may have already received your free flu shot during the recent three-week clinic held at the University Health Centre and UHC Pharmacy on North Campus. If not, you can also visit an AHS immunization clinic near you to receive your shot. The bivalent vaccine, which provides added protection against both Omicron and the original SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, is currently offered by appointment at the University Health Centre and the UHC Pharmacy. Staying home when you feel unwell Despite best efforts and measures taken, should you feel unwell this flu season, please follow the university’s recommendation to stay home and take care of yourself. Accommodating students who are unable to attend class Students, like staff and faculty, also continue to balance their health and their studies. It is important that students who feel unwell and are unable to attend class are provided with the proper accommodations for their circumstances. Instructors, please ensure you are aware of the academic accommodations and wellness services available to students (shared below) and know what to do when a student is sick from exams or term work. For example, remember you cannot require students to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider nor require them to provide a medical note. Discretion and compassion should be used in deciding whether circumstances justify granting an excused absence. Academic accommodations and wellness services for students Wellness Supports — social workers help bridge gaps and connect students with resources that provide ongoing mental health support and referrals to other mental health resources. Academic Success Centre — for student inquiries regarding academic accommodations for students with permanent documented disabilities and chronic physical and mental health conditions. Student Service Centre — provides information and access to services to support students’ academic, financial, mental and physical well-being. Office of the Dean of Students — for inquiries about accommodations and wellness. By taking steps to keep ourselves healthy and ensuring students receive appropriate accommodations when they are feeling unwell, we can protect the health and well-being of our community while continuing to meet our teaching and learning objectives.

Orange County's health officer has declared a local health emergency in response to increases in respiratory illnesses and an onslaught of the quickly spreading RSV, a respiratory virus most dangerous in young children.MediaNews Group via Getty ImagesA child under the age of 5 has died due to complications from flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, health officials in California confirmed on Monday.The California Department of Public Health did not release additional details on the child or their illness, but noted this is the first pediatric death in the state due to RSV and flu this season.The child's death comes as cases of RSV and flu have been appearing earlier this year than usual and are on the rise across the United States.Earlier this month, health officials in Michigan confirmed a 6-year-old died after developing complications from RSV, a contagious virus that can spread from viral respiratory droplets.According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 11,000 RSV infections were diagnosed in September 2022 – which rose to over 44,000 for the month of October.At the same time, positive tests for influenza reported to the CDC by clinical laboratories jumped from 2,083 to 7,504 in October, according to CDC data.Though cases of RSV are on the rise, death from the virus remains rare, according to the CDC.There are between 100 to 500 pediatric deaths and 14,000 adult deaths each year related to RSV, with the actual figure likely higher due to undercounting.Experts told ABC News that a combination of waning immunity to COVID and lack of exposure to other viruses, combined with close gatherings indoors, is fueling a "perfect storm.""Mostly the issue is there's low population immunity and kids are, once again, gathered again," said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, and an ABC News contributor. "And this is facilitating rapid spread of viruses like RSV."On Nov. 4, the CDC issued an official health advisory in response to the rise in respiratory infections in children.The health advisory warned that "co-circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and others could place stress on healthcare systems this fall and winter."Editor’s PicksMom of 5-week-old hospitalized with RSV says she feels 'helpless' For 2nd straight week, flu cases, hospitalizations and deaths have doubledThe best way to protect you and your family this flu seasonMORE: Hero officers perform lifesaving care on infant with RSVDoctors say it's possible for people to become infected with two or more viruses at the same time. If this happens, especially in children or people with weakened immune systems, it can lead to a more severe illness.What parents should know about RSVRSV is a contagious virus that can spread from viral respiratory droplets transferred from an infected person's cough or sneeze; from direct contact with the virus, like kissing the face of a child with RSV; and from touching surfaces, like tables, doorknobs and crib rails, that have the virus on them and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before hand-washing, according to the CDC.People infected with RSV are usually contagious for three to eight days, but some infants can continue to spread the virus even after they stop showing symptoms, for as long as four weeks, according to the CDC.Among children, premature infants and young children with weakened immune systems or congenital heart or chronic lung disease are the most vulnerable to complications from RSV."Pretty much all kids have gotten RSV at least once by the time they turn 2, but it's really younger kids, especially those under 6 months of age, who can really have trouble with RSV and sometimes end up in the hospital," Dr. William Linam, pediatric infectious disease doctor at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, told ABC News last year. "That's where we want to get the word out, for families with young children or children with medical conditions, making sure they're aware this is going on."In the first two to four days of contracting RSV, a child may show symptoms like fever, runny nose and congestion.Later on, the symptoms may escalate to coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing.Symptoms of RSV in babies.TNS via NewscomParents should also be alerted to symptoms including dehydration and not eating, according to Linam."Not making a wet diaper in over eight hours is often a good marker that a child is dehydrated and a good reason to seek medical care," he said. "Sometimes kids under 6 months of age can have pauses when they're breathing and that's something to get medical attention for right away."Infants and toddlers can usually recover at home with RSV unless they start to have difficulty breathing, are not eating or drinking, or appear more tired than usual, in which case parents should contact their pediatrician and/or take their child to the emergency room.MORE: I'm a pediatric nurse and my daughter was airlifted due to RSV. What I want other parents to knowAt-home care for kids with RSV can include Tylenol and Motrin for fevers, as well as making sure the child is hydrated and eating.According to Linam, parents can help protect their kids from RSV by continuing to follow as much as possible the three Ws of the pandemic: wear a mask, wash your hands and watch your distance.Infants who are born prematurely (less than 29 weeks) and are less than 12 months old may benefit from a medication to prevent complications of RSV since they are at increased risk of severe disease, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.Infants born prematurely with chronic lung disease may also qualify for medication. Parents should discuss this with their pediatrician.ABC News' Teddy Grant and Mary Kekatos contributed to this report.Related TopicsFlu SeasonRSV casesPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second term3 hours agoSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsFlu season hits Houston area earlier than usual – Houston Public Media Skip to content TV 8 | News 88.7 | Classical | Mixtape November 12, 2024 75 °F PBS Passport UH Search for: Search MENU CLOSE News & Information Features Hello Houston inDepth Topics Local News Texas Education News Politics Criminal Justice Transportation Energy & Environment Weather Hurricane Tracker All Stories >>> Arts & Culture Arts & Culture Main Classical Music Music Opera & Musical Theater Dance Visual Art Literature Theatre & Film Voices and Verses: A Poem-A-Day Series Awareness Hispanic Heritage Pride Month: Better Together!

Sara Willa Ernst | Posted on November 17, 2022, 10:35 AM Share Facebook Twitter/X LinkedIn Email Houston is seeing a spike in influenza cases several months earlier than in previous years. Late August was when the first cases started trickling into the region. That's compared to the last flu season, which began in February. The number of cases are increasing as the holidays approach as 3.4 percent of reported doctors visits in Harris County during the first week of November were related to the flu or other respiratory viral infections, according to the most recent report from the Houston Health Department. That's up from 1.7 percent in early October. Children have been bearing the brunt of these flu cases. Ninety-two percent of doctors visits that ended up in a flu diagnosis were in children under the age of 18. There have been over 16,000 diagnoses in October and early November. Houston Health Department's Influenza Surveillance Report Dr. Janeana White, the health department's deputy local health authority, said children weren't given much opportunity to build immunity during the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. "The past couple of years, we've really hunkered down — children weren't in school settings and daycare facilities," White said. "Most kids get exposed to RSV under the age of 2. We're now starting to see individuals who really weren't exposed to some of these viruses more robustly getting exposed." White said there are multiple respiratory viruses circulating in the region to be aware of: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), COVID-19, parainfluenza and rhinovirus. RSV, in particular, has been puzzling pediatricians this year. A surge of cases hit the region in the spring and yet again this fall. "We are seeing transmission of RSV among children," Dr. James Versalovic with Texas Children's Hospital said in an interview in early October. "What’s different this year is that now we’ve seen this twice. It is certainly unusual in terms of a second round of RSV." Versalovic said spikes in RSV were easy to predict before 2020 — cases typically go up once a year in late fall and early winter. The year 2022 has defied those patterns. "We know that these transmission patterns have been more dynamic during the pandemic and it’s not been limited to COVID-19," Versalovic said. "RSV has been equally difficult to predict during this pandemic. It’s been a highly dynamic period for respiratory viruses in general." White said the best way to protect yourself from a bad case is to get the available vaccines. COVID-19 boosters and flu shots are available at most pharmacies. The flu vaccine takes up to two weeks before it becomes fully effective. She is recommending tried and true precautions from the pandemic — handwashing, wearing masks, rapid testing before events and surface cleaning. "We should think about how we’re looking at events over this holiday season, the amount of people that we’re gathering with and really how to safely plan our travels during this holiday season," White said.

So far, 852,000 birds (0.04% of the domestic inventory) have been culled to control the disease's spread. Recently, the National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety, and Quality (Senasica) and the National Union of Poultry Producers (UNA) indicated that ending this week, the vaccination against the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) will start. The purpose of the vaccination is to reduce the impact of avian flu in poultry operations. The vaccination will start based on a strategic plan designed by the General Direction of Animal Health (DGSA Spanish abbreviation) from Senasica. During the first vaccination step, the birds in high-risk zones will be vaccinated and protect the broiler breeders and parent stock to guarantee a future supply of chickens. Currently, there are vaccines that three laboratories produce in Mexico for sale abroad. Still, given the presence of HPAI AH5N1, it has been requested that they include distribution in this country for poultry operations that Senasica authorizes to vaccinate their birds. The effectiveness tests of the vaccines currently produced in Mexico were carried out in reference laboratories of the World Organization for Animal Health (WHO) in other countries, for which the effectiveness of the available biologicals is considered. While the vaccination happens, different poultry associations are working closely to keep the supply of chicken and eggs in the country market. So far, the supply of these products has not been affected. Representatives from Senasica and the poultry industry pointed out that the outbreak does not represent a risk to public health since international human health TO CONTINUE READING REGISTER IT IS COMPLETELY FREE Access to articles in PDF Keep up to date with our newsletters Receive the magazine for free in digital version REGISTRATION ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT LOGIN Lost your password?

The sharp rise of influenza and RSV activity in San Mateo County, along with increasing COVID transmission in California, is causing widespread illness, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Which viruses are circulating in San Mateo County? While COVID-19 is still affecting many people in San Mateo County, there is an early (in the winter season) increase in two important respiratory viruses – influenza (“High” level in CA) and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Other respiratory viruses (such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus) are typically milder, causing uncomfortable “common cold” respiratory-tract symptoms for 1-2 weeks. How to prevent infections and severe disease? Vaccination with the updated COVID booster and the annual flu vaccine are effective for preventing infections and very effective for preventing severe disease. COVID vaccines and boosters are widely available from health care providers, pharmacies, and from County Health. See COVID vaccine locations and schedules here (MyTurn) and here (County Health pop-up clinics). Flu vaccines are also available from health care providers and from County Health. See flu vaccine locations and schedules here (MyTurn) and here (County Health pop-up clinics). As respiratory viruses are circulating widely in our communities, prevent infections by limiting exposure to respiratory droplets. Large droplets (carrying influenza, RSV, or COVID virus) can settle onto surfaces and objects and spread by close contact. Prevent transmission of large droplets by washing hands, avoiding touching your face, covering coughs, and cleaning surfaces. Very small droplets (carrying COVID virus) are exhaled into the air farther than six-feet. Prevent airborne transmission by limiting the number of people indoors, improving ventilation (opening multiple doors & windows) and wearing a mask (N95 respirator) to protect yourself. What are the symptoms? Symptoms caused by the many respiratory viruses are similar, which may include runny nose, cough, and sore throat. COVID and influenza viruses infect the respiratory tract (nose, throat, lungs) and can also severely affect other parts of the body, causing fatigue, headache, muscle/body aches, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and/or fever. For COVID-19 and flu infections, tests and antiviral drugs are available — especially useful for people who are at increased risk of complications (older adults, people with certain underlying medical conditions, people who are pregnant). People who are concerned with worsening symptoms and those with underlying medical conditions should consult their health care provider. RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Although most people recover in a week or two, RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Some may need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated. There is no antiviral treatment for RSV. For additional information from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), visit the RSV information page. For those with symptoms of a respiratory virus infection: Stay home until symptoms are mild and improving (and at least 5-10 days for COVID). This includes waiting until 24 hours have passed since resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. On average, people are contagious with COVID for about 8 days after their symptoms begin. People with flu are most contagious in the first 3-4 days of illness. People with RSV are usually contagious for 3-8 days. Test for COVID. If you have symptoms, test immediately. There are two main types of viral tests: antigen tests and PCR tests. Rapid antigen tests produce results in 15-30 minutes. These self-tests for COVID are conveniently available, including over-the-counter at retail stores, pharmacies, and some schools. Tests cost $7 – $12 and are reimbursable through your health insurance. PCR tests are performed in laboratories. They are more reliable (sensitive) than antigen tests, particularly for people without symptoms. Info about PCR is available through health care providers and https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/. For someone, such as a young child or an elderly adult, with worrisome symptoms or a high risk for severe disease, contact a health care provider, who can test for COVID, influenza, RSV, and other illnesses. While COVID guidelines recommend that infected persons wear a well-fitting mask around others for a total of 10 days, masking prevents infections by other respiratory viruses too. Students who have returned to school with some mild and improving symptoms, such as runny nose and cough, should wear a mask to protect their classmates from all the respiratory viruses.

The Southern Hemisphere typically experiences winter from June through September which allows countries like Argentina and Australia to serve as guides for what the Northern Hemisphere flu season will look like. Australia’s alarmingly severe 2022 flu season has caused concern for American epidemiologists heading into the start of flu season. In New England, we are now a little over a month into this year’s flu season, which typically lasts from October through May and peaks in late December. Up to this point, the 2022 season has been looking worse than it has in the last 13 years. This abnormally intense flu season is coming on the heels of two unusually mild years. The percentage of respiratory specimens, such as nasal swabs, that tested positive for influenza between Sept. 28, 2020 and May 22, 2021 was 0.2% while the three flu seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic saw influenza positivity rates peak around 30%. The decline in flu cases during 2020 and 2021 can most likely be explained by the mitigation measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic like face coverings, shelter-in-place orders, physical distancing and well-ventilated spaces. In order to address the impending problem of winter sicknesses, we must look to the recent past and re-implement measures that helped keep us safe from COVID-19. The aversion to return to a masked reality is completely understandable. Seeing only the top half of your friends’, classmates’ and professors’ faces can lead to a feeling of broken community. Holding classes on Zoom rather than in person makes for a less unified learning environment when there is not a physical shared space. Putting events that highlight socializing on hold inhibits unstructured fun on campus. Although all of these measures were necessary throughout 2020 and early 2021 before widespread vaccine rollout, we can afford to take a more relaxed approach to risk mitigation this winter. Unlike the novel coronavirus, in the early stages of the pandemic, the flu has a secret weapon to prevent infections: vaccines. Flu vaccines have been around for more than 50 years and are an essential part of preventing the spread. After getting your annual flu shot, there is still a risk of getting sick before your body has time to build immunity; in these cases, it is up to other mitigation efforts. Even if there aren’t government or university regulations in place to reduce the spread of influenza, we as individuals can implement moderate safety measures to decrease our community’s risk and protect the most vulnerable. This approach might include wearing a mask when in crowded indoor spaces, like large lectures, but not in less densely-packed classes like small seminars. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands first. When handwashing is difficult, such as in-between classes, opt to carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer on you or use some hand sanitizer from the dispensers set up around campus; this will reduce the amount of germs on high-contact surfaces and touch points such as door handles and desks. As a leader at Tufts, there are even more ways you can help reduce infection rates on campus. When organizing club meetings, social events or any other group gathering, opt to move outdoors, if weather permits. If it is imperative that your gathering includes a large number of people, consider holding it virtually or strongly encourage the use of face coverings. Even if you’re not ready to bring back face shields and 6-foot bubbles to prevent the spread of influenza, there are steps each of us can take to make this flu season less deadly and keep the most vulnerable among us safe. Don’t throw out all the public health skills you learned during the COVID-19 pandemic just because J.P. Licks stopped requiring the use of face coverings.

The south and southeast are seeing especially high levels of flu-like illness. State health officials say the flu is notoriously unpredictable so it’s hard to predict how the rest of flu season will shape up but they do know getting a flu shot is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and others from the virus.RoxxAnn Pena, a mother from Sinton, Texas who tragically lost her daughter to the flu in 2013, says she’ll never stop talking about the importance of getting vaccinated against the flu.“She was a very vibrant little girl. She loved chocolate milk. She sported a purple tutu over all of her clothes,” RoxxAnn says with a smile. In December of 2013 RoxxAnn's daughter, Reese went to bed and never woke up. She’d been energetic and happy the day before leaving her family heartbroken and confused.“I remember asking, ‘Does anybody remember if she hit her head? Or maybe she ate something?’ I was just baffled because we had no idea why she had passed away,” RoxxAnn explains. An autopsy revealed Reese was positive for Influenza B and the virus had attacked her heart. That year she had not gotten a flu shot.“Thinking back now, I don’t know that it would have made a difference, but if it's a chance it could have made a difference I completely regret the fact that I didn’t get her vaccinated. Just because it's not required doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it,” RoxxAnn says.Flu activity has been low since 2020 when COVID-19 precautions also helped stop the spread of influenza. However, two years later that now means community immunity is low.ALSO|Texas lawmakers file bills for 2023 legislative session“People are mingling. They’re getting back together with their loved ones and as we know, the flu doesn’t know any bounds as far as travel is concerned,” says Dr. Kevin Taheri at Breathe ENT in Cedar Park. Taheri says his clinic is seeing an increase in upper respiratory infections in general, one of which is the flu.Some of the most important things people can do to protect themselves and others include:washing your hands frequentlycovering coughs and sneezesstaying home if you’re sickgetting a flu shotThe current influenza vaccine is proving to work well against current strains, according to Texas DSHS. “This year they have advised it has been highly effective, so it helps reduce the transmission of the flu and it helps reduce the severity of the symptoms,” Dr. Taheri says.Today Reese would have been 11 years old. Not a year goes by that her mother doesn’t share her story and the importance of getting vaccinated. She's part of a nationwide group of families speaking out about influenza, Families Fighting Flu.“My daughter—she was just a bay. She had a bright future ahead of her and it was all cut short because of influenza,” Pena says.The CDC recommends flu shots for anyone ages 6 months and older.

Here's what we knowLici Beveridge Hattiesburg AmericanShow Caption Hide Caption East African Crowned Crane moves from Poplarville to Hattiesburg ZooThe Hattiesburg Zoo recently took in Tina, an East African Crowned Crane, from a man who lived in Poplarville.Cam Bonelli, Hattiesburg AmericanAn increase in the number of avian flu outbreaks across the country has led Hattiesburg Zoo officials to take precautionary measures to prevent exposure and spread of the disease.“We have moved some of our birds to different habitats and moved food and water bowls under shelters or into the interior area of the birds’ habitats, which will provide protection while still giving the birds access,” said the zoo's Animal Curator Kristen Moore.While some of the birds won't be in their usual spots, the zoo will remain open to visitors, who also should take precautions against avian flu infection, zoo officials said in a news release."Although the overall risk to the general public from the current bird flu outbreaks remains low, it is important that people take preventive measures around infected or potentially infected birds/poultry to prevent the spread of bird flu viruses to themselves or to other birds/poultry and other animals, including pets," the zoo staff said.Contact with the avian flu — also known as bird flu — is not limited to the zoo environment. Exposure can happen in the workplace, in the back yard or from household pets exposed to the virus. Avian influenza affects the respiratory, neurological and digestive systems.Zoo officials encourage increased handwashing and the use of hand sanitizer. People should avoid unnecessary contact with both wild and domestic birds.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported they are seeing a sharp increase in the number of cases across the country, which could lead to a record-setting year for bird flu infections."Since early 2022, more than 49 million birds in 46 states have either died as a result of bird flu virus infection or have been culled (killed) due to exposure to infected birds," the CDC said in a news release. "This number is nearing the 50.5 million birds in 21 states that were affected by the largest bird flu outbreak that occurred in 2015. Even so, the number of states affected in 2022 is already more than double the number of states that were affected in 2015."The Hattiesburg Zoo has been monitoring migratory paths and outbreaks that have followed across the U.S.“When positive cases occur within 250 miles or less of our Zoo, our well-established action plan is put into place immediately,” Hattiesburg Zoo's Director of Conservation, Education and Wildlife Jeremy Cumpton said.An avian influenza outbreak occurred this month within 52 miles of the Hattiesburg Zoo, which led the animal care team to take direct and specific precautions to prepare and protect the birds in its care.Some of the more susceptible birds include domestic poultry, flamingos, geese, swans, egrets and resident waterfowl, zoo officials said.In addition to providing additional protection for the birds, the Hattiesburg Zoo’s animal care team has intensified their use of personal protection equipment including the use of footbaths when entering and exiting bird habitats, wearing of masks, gloves and, in some cases, single-use full-body suits.The zoo is taking other measures to protect both the animals at the zoo and the visiting public.“Several of our birds are among the most popular animal ambassadors at the Hattiesburg Zoo, but will not be used for education or interaction around guests at this time,” Cumpton said.Moore added, “We have also drained pools in the Eagle Habitat and in the Veldt of Africa.” Additional cleaning will be done on the sidewalks around the flamingo habitat and Wallaby Walkabout. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all chickens and Parrots off the exhibit. We are also closely observing the waterfowl that reside on the zoo’s pond.”The zoo's efforts will not be permanent, however. Zoo officials hope to have the animals back in their regular environments before the end of the year.“The actions we are taking are in the best interest of our birds,” Cumpton said. “We fully expect to return to our regular protocols and have our birds back in their regular habitats within the next 21 days.” Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Flu season arrives, Public Health Agency of Canada says | CBC News ContentSkip to Main ContentAccessibility HelphamburgerMenuWhen search suggestions are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.SearchSearchSign InQuick LinksNewsSportsRadioMusicListen LiveTVWatchnewsTop StoriesLocalClimateWorldCanadaPoliticsIndigenousBusinessThe NationalHealthEntertainmentScienceCBC News InvestigatesGo PublicAbout CBC NewsBeing Black in CanadaMore Flu season arrives, Public Health Agency of Canada says | CBC News LoadedHealthFlu season arrives, Public Health Agency of Canada saysFlu indicators show the annual influenza epidemic has begun nationally.Triple threat of viruses comes on top of health-care staffing challenges, children's medication shortagesCBC News · Posted: Nov 14, 2022 5:53 PM EST | Last Updated: November 15, 2022A pedestrian walks by a sign in a store window encouraging people to receive a seasonal flu shot in Toronto last October.

PM ESTSpencer Kimball@spencekimballWATCH LIVEKey PointsThe Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics told the Biden administration that "unprecedented levels" of RSV combined with increasing flu circulation are pushing some hospitals to the breaking point.They asked the federal government to declare an emergency to provide hospitals with added flexibility to meet the surge.Infants 6 months and younger are getting hospitalized with RSV at seven times the rate observed before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2018, according to CDC data.Kazuma Seki | Istock | Getty ImagesDoctors are calling on the Biden administration to declare an emergency in response to an "alarming surge" of children hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus and flu this season.The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics warned President Joe Biden and Health Secretary Xavier Becerra in a letter this week that "unprecedented levels" of RSV combined with increasing flu circulation are pushing some hospitals to the breaking point.Infants 6 months and younger are getting hospitalized with RSV at more than seven times the weekly rate observed before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2018 at this time, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Flu hospitalizations are also at a decade high with children and the elderly most at risk, according to the CDC.As respiratory viruses surge, more than three-fourths of pediatric hospital beds are occupied across the U.S., according to data from the Health and Human Services Department. Seventeen states are reporting that more than 80% of beds are full, according to the data. Children's hospitals in Arizona, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Kentucky and Utah are almost completely at capacity.watch nowVIDEO3:0003:00RSV virus cases among children spike early this yearThe News with Shepard SmithAn emergency declaration would provide hospitals with the flexibility needed to free up bed capacity and staffing to make sure children get the care they need, Children's Hospital Association CEO Mark Wietecha and AAP CEO Mark Del Monte told Biden and Becerra in the letter this week.The president should declare an emergency under the Stafford Act or the National Emergencies Act, and the health secretary should declare a public health emergency, Wietecha and Del Monte wrote."We need emergency funding support and flexibilities along the same lines of what was provided to respond to COVID surges," they wrote.State emergenciesThe surge in kids falling ill with respiratory viruses comes amid staffing shortages as many health care workers have switched careers or retired due to pandemic-era burnout. There also are large numbers of children being hospitalized for mental issues which is also straining capacity.The American College of Emergency Physicians, in a letter to Biden earlier this month, warned that emergency departments are at a "breaking point" as patient volume exceeds staffed beds. Hospitals are often forced to hold patients in emergency departments because there are no inpatient beds available, which can result in long waits, diminished care and bad results for patients. ACEP described the situation as a public health emergency.Oregon this week became the first state to declare on emergency in response to the RSV surge. Gov. Kate Brown said the declaration will support the state's two pediatric hospitals through the deployment of emergency volunteer medical teams. Oregon's pediatric hospitalization rate has more than tripled since late October, according to the governor's office.watch nowVIDEO2:3702:37Pfizer says it's developed a vaccine to fight RSV virusThe News with Shepard SmithA spokesperson for the Health and Human Services Department said the federal government is offering communities support on a case-by-case basis. A national public health emergency would be determined based on countrywide data, science trends and the insight of public health experts, the spokesperson said.Senior U.S. health officials, in a call with reporters earlier this month, said the federal government is working with state and local partners to ease capacity issues at hospitals as respiratory illnesses surge. Dawn O'Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said federal health teams and medical supplies in the national stockpile are available for states when needed. So far, no state has requested this level of support, O'Connell said.Newborn hospitalization rates doublePublic health officials in the U.S have repeatedly called on all eligible people to receive their Covid booster and flu shot to help ease the burden of respiratory disease this winter. There is no vaccine for RSV.About 171 out of every 100,000 infants younger than 6 months were hospitalized with RSV for the week ending Nov. 12, according to the CDC's surveillance system that tracks 12 states. That is more than double the RSV hospitalization rate for newborns last year and more than seven times the rate in 2018, the last complete season before the Covid-19 pandemic.The flu is hospitalizing about 13 out every 100,000 kids younger than age 5, according to CDC data. The hospitalization rate for these kids is at a decade high and nearly double the overall current national rate. Seven kids have died of the flu so far this season, according to CDC.RSV and flu are surging in part because people have largely abandoned the public health measures implemented during the height of the Covid pandemic, such as masking and social distancing, which suppressed circulation of these viruses, according Dr. Jose Romero, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.Romero, during a call with reporters earlier this month, said many children did not get infected with RSV over the past two years due to the Covid health precautions. As a consequence, many kids did not develop any immunity and are catching the virus for the first time. The first infection tends to be more severe.RSV is a common respiratory virus that almost all children catch by age 2. It normally causes mild symptoms similar to a cold, but the virus can be dangerous for infants 6 months and younger as well as school-aged kids who have weak immune systems. It is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S., according to the CDC.No underlying conditionsRSV causes inflammation and congestion in the lower airways, called bronchiolitis. Infants often need oxygen support because their airways are smaller and the inflammation makes it difficult for them to breathe. They also often need IV fluids for several days because they are dehydrated or not feeding well.About 2% of all infants are hospitalized with RSV and 79% of those hospitalized younger than age 2 have no underlying medical conditions. Up to 300 children under age 5 die annually from RSV, according to the CDC.Children's Hospital Colorado is "bursting at the seams" primarily due to a surge of RSV cases, said Dr. Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert. Inpatient beds and the intensive care unit are both full, O'Leary said.The hospital's emergency department has set up a tent outside to see patients. Staff that typically don't work in the emergency room are taking hours there to help out, and the primary care clinic is also adding hours to help ease the pressure, he said."We are breaking census records for the history of the hospital every day. It's unprecedented," said O'Leary, who is also vice chair of the AAP's infectious disease committee.Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago has been at capacity for two months, said Dr. Allison Bartlett, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert. RSV arrived earlier and in greater force this year than in the past, Bartlett said. Many of the hospitalized kids have tended to be older this year, age 2 and above, likely because they did not get infected during the pandemic, she said.UPMC Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh has faced a huge surge in respiratory illnesses since September, said Dr. Raymond Pitetti, director of the hospital's emergency department. The surge began with RSV but now influenza cases are skyrocketing, Pitetti said. About 20% of children who are brought to the hospital with respiratory illness are admitted and about five kids end up in the intensive care unit daily, he said.Full hospital bedsSome days the hospital is full and children have to be held in the emergency room until an inpatient bed opens up, Pitetti said, but UPMC has been able to create new beds every day to move kids out of the ER.More than 80% of the beds at Children's Healthcare Atlanta have been full for the past several months, said Dr. Andi Shane, head of epidemiology at the hospital. RSV began circulating during the summer months and then surged in early September, Shane said. Then more children started falling with the flu in early October as RSV cases started to decline, she said."We had Covid, then we have RSV, then we have influenza," Shane said. "So basically four months with no break and many, many children needing emergency room care, needing urgent care, needing hospitalizations. It's been very challenging just to keep up with all those children."Flu activity is highest in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, D.C., according to CDC data. Arkansas, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York City and Texas are seeing high levels of flu-like illness.In the Southeast, the influenza A H3N2 strain appears to be the most common right now, the CDC's Romero told reporters earlier this month. This strain is associated with more severe illness in the elderly and young children, he said.UnvaccinatedAlmost all children hospitalized with the flu at Children's Healthcare Atlanta have not received their annual vaccination, Shane said. Part of the problem is the virus came early this year so people didn't have time, she said."We usually say get your flu vaccine by Halloween. Well by Halloween, we were having lots and lots and lots of flu here in Georgia," Shane said.In addition to vaccination, public health officials are encouraging people to stay home when sick, avoid close contact with those who are ill, cover coughs and sneezes and wash their hands frequently. Those who want to take extra precautions can also wear a mask in public.Romero said parents should seek immediate medical attention for their children if they show any of the following warning signs: trouble breathing, blueish lips or face, chest or muscle pain, dehydration (dry mouth, crying without tears, or not urinating for hours), or not being alert or interactive when awake.Update: This story was updated to include the latest RSV, flu and pediatric bed occupancy data.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Here's what scientists know — and what they don'tHealth-care workers are scrambling to care for unprecedented levels of seriously ill young patients, with some Canadian facilities now resorting to surgery cancellations and patient transfers in order to make space. But why are there so many sick kids, all at once?RSV, influenza straining pediatric hospitals, as theories consider impact of COVID-19Lauren Pelley · CBC News · Posted: Nov 16, 2022 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: November 16, 2022A woman pushes a child in front of the BC Children’s Hospital Emergency Department. Across Canada, pediatric hospitals have seen a surge of children ill with respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). (Justine Boulin/CBC)Social SharingPediatric hospitals remain under intense pressure in Canada amid a resurgence of childhood respiratory viruses, ongoing shortages of children's pain medication, and the return of the annual flu season. Across the country, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are above expected levels for this time of year and keep increasing, federal data shows. Influenza is also spreading widely, and earlier than usual. It's clear health-care workers are scrambling to care for "unprecedented" levels of seriously ill young patients, with some Canadian facilities now resorting to surgery cancellations and patient transfers in order to make space.What's less clear is — why are there so many sick kids, all at once?While scientists say it's difficult to know the full answer, they do have a few theories.RSV roars back after pandemic dropWhen it comes to the pressure from RSV, an infection so widespread that most people catch the virus by the time they're toddlers, there may be a ripple effect from the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.Immunologist Deepta Bhattacharya, a professor at the University of Arizona, said RSV cases fell to very low levels in 2020, "presumably because of COVID mitigations" — a range of precautions that included social distancing, mask wearing, and widespread lockdowns during which a significant portion of the workforce began working from home.There's a population-wide impact from skipping a year of infections, he said, since the immune system's antibody production after an RSV infection drops off fairly quickly.Ontario pediatric ICUs operating above capacity, provincial data showsThat means more people are susceptible to infection in the first place, and those that do get infected don't have as many antibodies to slow the virus down, and mothers who weren't exposed recently aren't transferring as many antibodies to their infants through breast milk, Bhattacharya explained.It's a situation several Canadian scientists warned about in a commentary on RSV published back in July 2021 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal."For many months, Canada has seen virtually no cases of RSV infection, which may mean that pregnant women and infants have had lower exposure and therefore pediatric immunity levels may be low," the group wrote, adding a resurgence in cases could stretch resources in pediatric intensive care units across the country.Virus transmission ebbs and flows each yearCanada eventually experienced a mid-pandemic spike in RSV cases in early 2021 — but it didn't lead to the current level of hospital pressure. Notably, by that point, influenza still hadn't fully resurfaced, with just a slight rise in cases quite late into the typical flu season.With flu now firmly back in the mix, alongside a slate of respiratory infections including COVID, co-infections might also be a factor in rates of severe disease, said Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist with McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont.Growing number of Alberta students home sick as flu, COVID-19 and RSV cases trend upwardsEach virus operates — and impacts the body — a little differently. Research on adults suggests people who are infected with multiple viruses at once, such as those behind COVID, along with flu or RSV, can face poorer outcomes, Bowdish said.On its own, RSV is largely known for causing mild symptoms in most children and healthy adults, but infants, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems can experience serious illness.Research suggests that in some cases, infections in infancy may be linked to the later development of severe RSV or other long-term respiratory system impacts — and it's a virus that's capable of infecting people over and over again throughout their lives. WATCH | Officials encourage masking as viruses overwhelm health-care system:Concerns grow over triple threat of surging respiratory illnesses2 years agoDuration 2:50"RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations long before anybody had ever discovered COVID-19," said infectious diseases physician Dr. Amesh Adalja, who works with the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. "And RSV had a considerable toll on adults, similar to influenza."And it was always bound to come back, along with flu and other temporarily-suppressed pathogens, he added."It wasn't like we would always not have respiratory viruses because of COVID," Adalja said. "And you have children that were born around the pandemic who just have not gotten RSV."Emergency supply of kids' meds is coming amid national shortageOne team of Canadian researchers analyzed more than a decade of respiratory virus seasons, alongside mathematical modeling for possible future seasons, and found "striking regularity" in how multiple viruses alternated between mild and severe winter peaks, year by year.Their 2021 study, published in the scientific journal JAMA, suggests a certain level of predictability, said University of Alberta infectious disease specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger.Lower transmission years are typically followed by a stretch of more aggressive transmission, due to the loss of immunity across an entire community, she said. That could partially explain this year's return of RSV, and the aggressive start to the flu season not long after. "Next year we would expect a smaller wave if most kids get exposed this year," Bowdish said.What role did COVID play?In the meantime, as scientists are scrambling to understand the current viral landscape, other theories attempting to explain the ongoing pediatric health-care crisis involve potential immune system impacts from prior bouts of COVID-19, perhaps in line with already-documented post-COVID health issues.After getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, some children face a serious condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C. The cause remains unclear, though it's thought to be an overactive immune response. Q & AInside an Ottawa children's hospital battling against rising RSV, COVID-19, flu casesIn fairly rare circumstances, other kids — and more often, adults — can face lingering, sometimes debilitating, long COVID symptoms long after an infection, which might also be tied to the virus' impacts on the immune system. In both cases, experts note the mechanisms at play are still not fully understood. But does this mean childrens' immune systems are going haywire after they catch COVID, putting them at risk of falling seriously ill from other bugs? That's not likely, several medical experts told CBC News.People walk past St. Michael’s Hospital, in Toronto, on Oct. 12, 2022. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Bowdish called the notion "unproven but not impossible," while Bhattacharya stressed there's scant evidence suggesting COVID leads to lasting immune suppression against other infections.During the acute phase of COVID-19, the T-cells in your blood — which are a part of the human immune system that target specific foreign invaders — do drop in number. "But then they come right back to normal after you recover," Bhattacharya said.Calls increase for provincial support to help ease pressures at McMaster Children's Hospital"I do think it's possible that additive inflammation, if you get COVID and RSV in close succession, could make you really sick," Bhattacharya said. "But that is very different than COVID causing immunodeficiency lasting long into recovery."Dr. David Naylor, co-chair of Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, said the "plausible" role for COVID in the current pediatric crisis is as a co-factor, disrupting immune responses and exacerbating the impact of all those first exposures to other viruses. "The evidence for that concept is weak so far," he said in an email to CBC News, "but this nasty virus is full of unpleasant surprises."Calls for masks, vaccination campaignsParents and health-care workers alike are struggling to care for children at a time when hospital beds are full and medication shelves are empty. In recent weeks, multiple pediatric health-care facilities across the country have reported being well over capacity and short on staff, while federal officials say they've finally secured a foreign supply of children's fever and pain medication to ease a months-long shortage, hopefully giving parents a greater ability to treat sick children at home.Conversations around the use of masks to mitigate virus transmission are also ramping up, with leading public health officials in several regions calling on the public to mask up this fall and winter. Winnipeg's Children's Hospital sees unprecedented number of patientsWidespread vaccination campaigns for flu and COVID are important as well, Saxinger said, alongside other protective measures.Adalja, meanwhile, called for better viral surveillance. RSV has remained a "severe pediatric burden for decade after decade after decade," he said, adding testing for the virus needs to become more routine.

"And we always want to make sure that we're protecting them."ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

ByNicole LeonardNovember 19, 2022 (pancaketom/BigStock) Despite rising inflation and a deadly avian influenza affecting the availability and cost of turkeys, Pennsylvania farms say demand for fresh birds remains strong ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Bolton Turkey Farm in Bucks County raises about 10,000 turkeys annually. Torrie Bolton said her family’s farm expects to sell more than 4,000 of those birds just for the upcoming holidays. “We do maybe a tenth [of that number] at Christmas, because people eat other things,” she said. “But everyone wants a turkey at Thanksgiving.” Pennsylvania is among the top 10 states in the country for year-round turkey production. About 6.7 million birds were raised in the Keystone State in 2020, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Local farmers say they haven’t slowed down in preparing for one of their busiest times of year. Even when all turkey orders have been picked up at the farm by Thanksgiving, Bolton said the farm will begin marking and selecting birds that will be used to breed more turkeys for next year. “It starts all over again,” Bolton said. “There is never a period of time on our farm when there are no turkeys. There’s always turkeys.” At Lindenhof Farm in Lancaster County, about 700 birds are being processed and prepared for people to pick up over the next couple of days. “Some of these repeat customers have been doing it the last 10, 15 years from us,” said farm owner Axel Linde. “It’s fun to see their faces again every year. That’s the fun part of it.” Breeding, raising, and protecting hundreds of turkeys just for this holiday can be exhausting, Linde said, “but we’ve been doing it for 15 years now.” During the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Linde said people downsized their turkey orders and stuck with medium or small birds. “But now, this year that people are gathering again in larger groups, we’re selling a lot more jumbo turkeys,” Linde said, referring to birds over 25 pounds. “Still a significant amount of small turkeys and medium turkeys, too, but people are going a little bit bigger this year.” This is the first Thanksgiving turkey season for David Perlman, who became the new owner of Quarry Hill Farm in Montgomery County in July 2021. There wasn’t enough time to raise birds for holiday sales that year, but Perlman said this year, they offered three different sizes of heritage turkeys. The farm sold out and he’s preparing under 100 birds for pickup this coming week. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor The farm plans to do more next year. As a nonprofit, Perlman said all the proceeds from turkey sales will be donated to hunger organizations. “Our goal has always been to give back. So, 100% of the profit from the farm…will go to different charities that are feeding young families, whether that be here or abroad,” he said. “That’s why we started the farm.” Related Content Health ‘This thing isn’t over’: Avian flu outbreak reaches 4.4 million birds in Pennsylvania ahead of Thanksgiving sales An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has killed millions of birds in Pennsylvania, and farms, wildlife centers, and testing labs are bearing the costs. 2 years ago Listen 4:16 As far as cooking turkeys go, Bolton recommends cooking fresh birds upside down. “So that the juices that are in your back run down into your white meat and keep it nice and juicy,” she said. “Also, your thighs and your leg is where it often doesn’t get finished quite as much, so if you’re upside down, that’s closer to the heat source and it seems to work out well.” Over the years, Linde said he’s seen and heard of all the different ways people choose to cook their birds, some more unique than others. “One lady did it in the pizza oven out in their backyard, because they lost electricity,” Linde said. “They fired up their wood stove out in the backyard, and they’ve been doing that ever since, enjoying their turkey in their pizza oven. Farmers recommend that the best time to pick up fresh turkeys in order to avoid having to freeze them is in the four days leading up to Thanksgiving. Never miss a moment with the WHYY Listen App!

This strain is associated with more severe illness in the elderly and young children, Romero said."There are also early signs of influenza causing severe illness in precisely these two groups of individuals this season," Romero told reporters during a call earlier this month.Nearly 11 out of every 100,000 seniors were hospitalized with the flu during the week ending Nov. 5 while about 10 out every 100,000 kids younger than age 5 were admitted to the hospital, according to CDC data.

Romero said these viruses are probably surging because immunity declined as pandemic-era public health measures crushed transmission of these viruses. May kids, as a consequence, are getting infected for the first time.Public health officials are also expecting another wave of Covid infection this winter. The CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the White House have called for everyone whose eligible to receive a flu shot and Covid booster ahead of the holidays.More CNBC health coverageFTC sues drug middlemen for allegedly inflating insulin pricesPfizer says drug for deadly cancer condition that causes weight loss shows positive trial dataGilead says its twice-yearly shot cut HIV infections by 96% in trialSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

So far, 282 flu patients have been reported since the beginning of October, according to the State Office for Health and Social Affairs (Lageso) on Friday. Last week, 56 cases were registered in Berlin, according to the weekly report of the Lageso on Friday. The reporting figures are only a slice of the actual situation: the number of infections during a flu epidemic is estimated at 5 to 20 percent of the population, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), which corresponds to about 4 to 16 million people in Germany. Not every infected person falls ill. Influenza wave usually begins in JanuaryOn Wednesday evening it had become known that the flu wave in Germany had started much earlier than usual according to the RKI definition. The start was dated to the week ending October 30. In the years before Corona, the wave usually began in January, according to the RKI. In the past two seasons, however, the pandemic and the measures taken against it greatly changed the typical course: in 2020/21, the flu wave failed worldwide. And in 2021/22, there was also no wave on a known scale in Germany. Flu vaccination recommended for people over 60The assessment that the wave has begun is based on results from a surveillance system that examines samples from people with acute respiratory illnesses. The system routinely looks for various pathogens, such as rhinoviruses, Sars-CoV-2 and influenza. However, the RKI is also registering significantly more reports of influenza cases from the federal states than usual at this time of year. This is probably also due to the recommendation since the Corona pandemic that respiratory symptoms should also be tested for influenza viruses. In Germany, flu vaccinations are recommended for people over 60 as well as pregnant women, the chronically ill, residents of old people's homes and nursing homes, and people at increased occupational risk.

Public Documents Public Meetings Accessibility Commitment Donor Portal Donate AK Passport Alaska health officials urge flu vaccines as case counts rise among children By Katie Anastas, Alaska Public Media - Anchorage - November 17, 2022 The Children’s Hospital at the Providence Medical Center in Anchorage. (Joey Mendolia/Alaska Public Media) State health officials are urging Alaskans to get flu vaccines and take other protective measures as case counts increase rapidly across the country. States in the southern half of the Lower 48 have the most flu cases right now. But in a public health presentation Wednesday, state epidemiologist Dr. Joe McLaughlin said the wave is expected to reach Alaska in the coming weeks. “We’re seeing very high rates of increase of influenza-like activity in the nation, and it’s occurring much earlier than it has in recent years,” he said. Influenza-like illness activity refers to hospital visits for a range of respiratory illnesses, including flu, RSV and COVID. (Map from the CDC’s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network) Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is also spreading. McLaughlin said elderly people and young children — especially premature babies and those with chronic respiratory illnesses — are particularly vulnerable. “Most people who get an RSV infection will have mild illness and will recover within one to two weeks, but some people do get very sick and require hospitalization,” he said. There’s no vaccine for RSV, but a monoclonal antibody treatment is available for at-risk patients. Both RSV and the flu are already straining regional hospital systems. Flu-related hospitalizations among children are currently at levels not usually seen until late December and early January, according to data from the CDC. RELATED: Children’s hospitals grapple with a nationwide surge in RSV infections Gene Wiseman is the Division of Public Health’s section chief for rural and community health systems. He said staff shortages and the early rise in RSV and flu cases are already impacting hospitals’ ability to transfer patients out of state. “Region IX and Region X, which are our neighboring states — Region X being Idaho, Washington and Oregon — are all at capacity as well in their hospitals,” Wiseman said. “So although they’re a normal pop-off valve for some of our sicker patients here, we’re finding that we’re needing to hold patients in Alaska.” While some transfers are still happening, Wiseman said, there are “extreme limitations.” Health officials say having less capacity in children’s hospitals would impact the availability of emergency medical treatment for things like injuries. The state’s clinical pharmacist, Coleman Cutchins, said the situation mirrors COVID. “With COVID, we were really worried about adults. Fortunately, it didn’t hit kids all that hard. We were worried about adult hospitals being overwhelmed, adult ICUs. But now, when we’re talking about RSV and the flu, yeah they affect adults, but we’re a lot more worried about kids. Health officials stressed the importance of getting kids vaccinated against the flu and COVID. Annual flu vaccines are available for kids 6 months and older, and according to health officials, it’s not too late to get one this year. RELATED: New omicron subvariants now dominant in the U.S., raising fears of a winter surge Nationwide, kids’ flu-related hospitalizations are currently at levels not usually seen until late December and early January.

Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is urging vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, the elderly and those with chronic diseases to get the influenza vaccine, amid reports that five people have already died.Speaking at a vaccination drive held by the North West Regional Authority at the Brian Lara Promenade on Friday, Deyalsingh said the influenza virus is “very severe” and can be fatal, compared to the common cold which people easily recover from.In fact, Deyalsingh said for the year to date, five people have died from the influenza virus.To date, he said 15,913 doses of the influenza vaccine have been administered – compared to the previous year which saw a total of 26,000 - more than 50 per cent of last year’s total delivered in just three weeks, as opposed to the six-month period last year.“That tells me the population isn’t vaccine-weary, which was a concern.”Deyalsingh said 7,149 people with chronic diseases have been vaccinated, however, only 136 pregnant people to date have gotten their flu shot.He urged people with chronic diseases and pregnant people to get the vaccine.In fact, it was noted that if a pregnant person is vaccinated, their babies may have immunity to the virus for the first six months of life. The vaccine protects against influenza A and B.For more information on getting your flu shot, visit the Health Ministry online at https://health.gov.tt/ Loop is better in the app. Customize your news feed, save articles for later, view your reading history and more.

Are you prepared? Here's what doctor suggests ByZarafshan Shiraz, Delhi Nov 14, 2022 08:15 AM IST Share Via Copy Link In India the flu virus circulation peaks during the monsoon season, with secondary peaks during the winter months from November to February. Here's what you need to know since the winter influenza symptoms are the same as Covid-19 Influenza or ‘flu’ as it is commonly called, has caused massive global pandemics and resulted in uncountable deaths globally since it is a highly transmissible infection affecting both adults and children. Just a sneeze or a cough is enough to start the transmission, should the minuscule droplets fall on someone’s face, mouth or eyes and in India, the flu virus circulation peaks during the monsoon season, with secondary peaks during the winter months from November to February. The flu season is approaching. Are you prepared? Here's what doctor suggests ( Andrea Piacquadio) The transmission can be halted by following simple hygiene measures such as use of masks in crowded places and frequent handwashing like during the Covid-19 pandemic, because of the government restrictions and guidelines, these measures were followed consistently which resulted in decrease of flu cases. However, as the restrictions eased, people went back to their old habits which led to a rise in flu cases last winter hence, we need stronger protection against this infection and this can be provided by the annual WHO endorsed vaccination. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr (Major) Rajesh Bhardwaj, Consultant on Practo, highlighted, “Young children between the ages of 2 to 6 years, pregnant women, elderly and people suffering from pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes, asthma, pneumonia, or those on prolonged treatments such as cancer and dialysis are at a higher risk of the flu infection. For these individuals, the annual flu vaccination before the seasonal onset of the virus becomes a high priority.” Talking about flu vaccination and why is it needed annually, he said, “After two years of living with the pandemic, most of us are now well aware that respiratory viruses such as Covid-19 are capable of rapid mutation that impact the infection rate and severity. Similarly, the influenza virus also mutates every year and new strains are transmitted every flu season. The respiratory viruses are largely winter viruses and are more transmissible in the cold winter months. Flu vaccine manufacturers develop annual flu vaccines to protect against the strains likely to dominate in any given year. These annual vaccines should be taken every year to protect against the prevalent strains of the flu virus. Anyone above the age of 6 months can safely take the annual flu shot. Children who take the flu vaccine for the first time may need two doses spread 4 weeks apart for optimal protection.” He shared, “The most common flu vaccines that are available in India, are quadrivalent vaccines that protect against two strains of influenza A and B each. These vaccines provide close to 60% protection against the infection. Even if a vaccinated person gets the infection, it is likely to be milder and recovery from it faster. Taking a vaccine now will prevent one from catching the Flu this winter season – it takes about two to three weeks before the immunity from the vaccine starts.” However, there is a certain hesitancy regarding the flu vaccination and despite the glaring need, the coverage of flu vaccines in India is low. Dr (Major) Rajesh Bhardwaj explained, “There are concerns about the cost and side effects of the vaccine. There is a need to understand that though flu looks like a simple infection, it can have severe complications such as hospitalizations and deaths especially in children, ageing adults, and those with chronic conditions. The infection can also increase the risk of a heart attack by ten times and of stroke by eight times within a week following it. The vaccine can prevent these complications and reduce healthcare expenses. The flu vaccine is well researched and there are no major side effects. Minor side effects include mild fever and body ache for 2 days; these are much less serious than the flu or its complications.” Some people may believe that they are protected from all respiratory infections after two shots of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, Dr (Major) Rajesh Bhardwaj said that this is not true. He said, “Flu is a different viral infection that requires a vaccine which is different from the Covid-19 vaccine. It is safe for people who have taken the Covid-19 vaccine to take the flu vaccine. So this winter be well prepared for the arrival of the flu. Your most effective protection is the annual flu vaccine. Since the winter flu symptoms are the same as Covid-19 it would be difficult to distinguish the two and getting Influenza in the winters would reduce your immunity and make you more prone to catch Covid-19 (specially for the vulnerable elderly). So stay healthy and stay safe for the sake of yourselves and your loved ones.” Catch every big hit,...

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix are expected to speak about the flu season at a press conference Wednesday at 11am.Flu in schoolsGreater Victoria teachers are bracing for a surge in illness in the coming weeks, and they have already started to see some effects.Â Ilda Turcotte, the president of the Greater Victoria Teachersâ Association, says she has heard from more SD61 teachers who have had to take time off work due to illness in recent weeks.âI've had a number of teachers call me that have COVID. We have had some struggles with coverage in our schools,â she said. âThey donât want to miss work, because they know that there may not be somebody there to cover for them and that puts the pressure on their colleagues.âShe says there is a shortage of substitute teachers, so there is added pressure for teachers to stay healthy and show up to work. And for the substitutes that are called in, many are arriving at schools prepared to teach one class to find out they have been reassigned to a different class where they are more needed.While she doesnât know what the current rate of absenteeism is in Greater Victoria schools, she has heard from colleagues that theyâre seeing an increase in absences in classes.Â SD61 did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement from SD62, the district said it is currently not experiencing âelevated absenteeism for students or staff at any of our schools or sites.âÂ Turcotte says she is concerned the flu seasons will start affecting schools worse because of the reduced budget for custodian staff at some SD61 schools. To help reduce the budget deficit, the Greater Victoria School Board voted in April to halve the number of daytime custodians at elementary and middle school levels. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of extra cleaning was happening to keep the school community healthy, Turcotte says, but thatâs not the case anymore with the budget cuts.Â âThat means there's no custodians in our elementary classrooms during the day helping to wipe down desks after lunch or keeping bathrooms clean, and all that kind of thing,â she said. âSo there's quite a worry that that's going to make things worse in their schools, if, you know, the level of cleanliness can't be upheld.âShe says the district is following provincial guidelines on cleaning, but those guidelines are too general for schools.Â While mask mandates are no longer in effect, and some schools in the district are still not equipped with proper ventilationâshe said she taught in a school last year where opening a door or window was the only way to properly ventilate her classroomâmaintaining proper cleaning is essential.âStudents donât sit at their desk by themselves the whole day long,â she said. âSo the cuts to custodial time is of real concern.âJolene Rudisuela,Â EMAIL:TWITTER:@jrudisuela Related CoverageNo items found.Related NewsVictoria school board ordered by province to develop safety planVictoria and the CRD highlight initiatives during National AccessAbility Week VNFC opens new medical clinic for Indigenous people in Greater VictoriaCost reduction, not waste reduction, focus of CRD waste managementA streamlined program aims to boost Esquimaltâs curb appealVictoria getting the green light for fewer barriers to green roofsRelated NewsVictoria school board ordered by province to develop safety planSD61 board must collaborate with Greater Victoria police departments to create the planVictoria and the CRD highlight initiatives during National AccessAbility Week There are roughly 19K people in Victoria dealing with a disability.VNFC opens new medical clinic for Indigenous people in Greater VictoriaThe clinic is able to serve 4500 urban Indigenous people in the communityThe best morning read in Victoria, bar none.Stay connected to your city with the Capital Daily newsletter.By filling out the form above, you agree to receive emails from Capital Daily.

Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Niue, Wallis & Futuna and FSM. The increased ILI cases seen in Fiji and Vanuatu may be due to the increased number of sites reporting for the week Reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in CNMI, Tonga and Palau.

This was confirmed by the zoo administration and the Senate Department for Consumer Protection. According to the zoo, the infection in a deceased hammerhead - a wading bird about 50 centimetres high - was discovered during a routine check. Since avian influenza has been occurring more and more frequently in Central Europe for several years, deceased birds are examined at random at Berlin Zoo and Tierpark. The Berlin-Brandenburg State Laboratory and the National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza had confirmed the result. Humans rarely affected by bird fluSo-called avian influenza is known as bird flu or avian influenza. The virus behind it is called H5N1. So far, it has only been linked to human infections in rare individual cases. However, it can easily spread in bird populations - for them it is a deadly danger. Duration of closure still unclearThe staff in charge of caring for the birds were wearing protective clothing to prevent the virus from spreading, the statement added. The veterinary authorities had ordered the closure of the zoo's animal population. The closure of the premises was an important step to get a better overview. As a precautionary measure, the Tierpark Berlin has also started to move most of its birds into stables.

KERWIN PIERRE Am­bi­ka Ja­gas­sars­ingham­bi­ka.ja­gas­sars­ingh@guardian.co.ttMin­is­ter of Health Ter­rence Deyals­ingh says thou­sands of peo­ple are elect­ing to take the in­fluen­za jab this year. De­spite this, there have been 5 fa­tal­i­ties record­ed.Deyals­ingh made the com­ment at an in­fluen­za vac­cine out­reach at the Bri­an Lara Prom­e­nade, Port-of-Spain, yes­ter­day.“We start­ed our in­fluen­za dri­ve about three weeks ago and to date, we have de­liv­ered 15,913 dos­es, in com­par­i­son to last year’s sea­son where we de­liv­ered 26,000 dos­es. We have de­liv­ered more than 50% of last year’s to­tal in on­ly three weeks, as op­posed to the whole six-month sea­son for last year,” Deyals­ingh said.Oc­to­ber to May is con­sid­ered to be in­fluen­za sea­son in the north­ern hemi­sphere.Deyals­ingh said these high­er-than-usu­al num­bers might be a good sign, since they in­di­cate that the pop­u­la­tion is “not vac­ci­na­tion weary.”De­spite this, he said the vac­ci­na­tion rate in vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tions is not at a lev­el where it should be.“One of the crit­i­cal pop­u­la­tions we are try­ing to tar­get is those with chron­ic dis­eases ... to date, we have vac­ci­nat­ed 7,149 per­sons with chron­ic dis­eases, which isn’t bad. How­ev­er, one of the pop­u­la­tions that every year we have chal­lenges with is our preg­nant pop­u­la­tion and this year we have on­ly done 136 preg­nant women.”Deyals­ingh said these women “fear that the vac­cine will harm them, their un­born child and noth­ing is fur­ther from the truth.”Di­rec­tor of Health at the North West Re­gion­al Health Au­thor­i­ty (NCWRHA), Dr An­tho­ny Parkin­son, sup­port­ed the min­is­ter’s state­ments, urg­ing the pop­u­la­tion, es­pe­cial­ly those who are more sus­cep­ti­ble to dis­eases, to get vac­ci­nat­ed. He said if moth­ers take the vac­cine and have the an­ti­bod­ies in their sys­tems, “it will give the ba­by a fight­ing chance” against the dis­ease.Dr Parkin­son al­so em­pha­sised that in­fluen­za “comes in when you are weak­ened in your im­mu­ni­ty, it al­so, what it does, at­tacks your lungs...caus­es a pneu­mo­nia, once you get a pneu­mo­nia and your lungs be­come wa­ter-logged then you have to go to the ICU, and we have to put you on the ven­ti­la­tor...in­fluen­za goes straight to your lungs and caus­es pneu­mo­nia in peo­ple who are sus­cep­ti­ble.”In light of this, he once again told cit­i­zens, “When you can, go to your near­est health cen­tre...it’s not go­ing to stop you from get­ting the cold, but it may make the symp­toms go away faster.”Deyals­ingh al­so ad­dressed COVID-19 vac­ci­na­tions. “The COVID-19 vac­cine rate has dropped tremen­dous­ly, we are now at 51.3 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, months ago it was 51.1.”Re­gard­ing the fu­ture of the par­al­lel health­care sys­tem, he said: “We have start­ed to de-em­pha­sise the par­al­lel health­care sys­tem since May when we de-cant­ed the Point Fortin Hos­pi­tal. Then around June, we de­cant­ed the Ari­ma Hos­pi­tal. So, by at­tri­tion, be­cause our num­bers are very low now, we ex­pect by the end of the year the par­al­lel health­care sys­tem as you know it, may no longer be there be­cause we have been mov­ing to what we call a hy­brid sys­tem and we an­nounced pub­licly some months ago that the Ari­ma Hos­pi­tal will be the ac­tu­al first hy­brid sys­tem.” Click HERE to Login Want FREE access to all our content?

Ekbal, has recommended the expansion and strengthening of the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), introduction of adult immunisation in the State against influenza and pneumococcal infections and uniform and mandatory vaccination of all food handlers in the State against Enteric fever and Hepatitis A. The committee has also recommended that given the huge increase in the stray animal population and the increase in the incidence of rabies in the State, pre-exposure prophylaxis vaccination against rabies would be worthwhile for Kerala, as it can avoid the need for the expensive rabies immunoglobulin serum and reduce the rabies vaccine doses required in case of accidental exposure in future.Dr. Ekbal submitted the report to Health Minister Veena George on MondayThe committee, which has given broad-based recommendations which can be implemented as short-term /intermediate / long term priority plans, also does not see any immediate imperative for the State to introduce HPV vaccination for adolescent girls in the State, given the steady decline in cervical cancer incidence in Kerala (current incidence 8/lakh). HPV vaccination may be considered in Kerala only if the cervical cancer incidence goes up from the baseline. For the first time, the committee has delved deep into the issues in the vaccination of immunologically compromised persons, including those undergoing organ transplant and stem cell transplantation and has drawn up detailed guidelines for the immmunisation of this category of persons. The committee recommends that in view of the new developments in vaccinology and the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable infections like diphtheria and measles in adults, State-specific modifications be adopted into the existing UIP schedule. Accordingly, it has recommended that the current UIP be expanded over a period of five years to replace MR (Measles Rubella) vaccine with MMR vaccine (Mumps, Measles,Rubella) and the TD (Tetanus, diphtheria) vaccine at 10 years to be replaced with Tdap, which offers additional protection against pertussis. Typhoid conjugate vaccine [TCV] at 6-9 months of age, Hepatitis A vaccine at 12 months of age, Varicella vaccination and annual influenza vaccination may be adopted to UIP, the committee has recommended An epidemiological study should be conducted to assess the burden of Japanese Encephalitis in Kerala, based on which, the State should take a decision on expanding JE vaccination (currently in two districts) to the rest of the State. If so, instead of the single dose, two doses should be administered at 9 and 16 months of age. Given the high mortality and morbidity due to influenza and pneumococcal infections in the elderly, immunocompromised and those with comorbidities, those above 65 years should be administered Pneumococcal vaccine (PCV 13), 23 valent polysacccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and annual quadrivalent influenza vaccine, the committee has recommended As mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 in pregnancy is high, quadrivalent influenza vaccine should be considered in pregnancy. Other recommendations include assessment of the immunisation status amongst guest workers and issue of vaccination cards to them; recording of vaccination status of all students when they join school/college’ and improved capture of vaccination data from private sector Published - November 14, 2022 11:52 pm IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINTTop News Today0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu News PM Modi launches projects worth ₹12,850 crore Jio’s Diwali Dhamaka plan Brazil becomes second BRICS country not to join BRI ‘Vijay 69’ trailer Bomb threats to airlines iQOO 13 will get a rear floating halo light Kaala Bhairava Army vehicle was fired upon in Battal area Spanish PM Sanchez arrives in Vadodara Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today Hockey Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

PTI | Ontario | Updated: 14-11-2022 09:19 IST | Created: 14-11-2022 09:19 IST Country: United States SHARE By Sameer Elsayed, Professor of Medicine, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University Ontario (Canada), Nov 14 (The Conversation) Public health experts in the Northern Hemisphere are predicting a fall/winter respiratory virus season for the ages — one that highlights the importance of global surveillance efforts and vaccines as tools in the fight against influenza (flu) and COVID-19.Making sense of COVID-19's impact on seasonal flu Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual respiratory virus season in northern and southern climates was an epidemic of sorts, one that was characterised by a rapid uptick in the rate of influenza (flu) and of influenza-like illness beginning in mid-fall, peaking in mid-winter and winding down in mid-spring.The previously predictable pattern of influenza activity in the global North and South has become somewhat unpredictable in post-pandemic seasons.In the United States, approximately 36 million infections, 390,000 hospitalisations and 25,000 deaths due to flu were reported during the 2019-20 season.In contrast, minimal influenza activity was noted in 2020-21 while the 2021-22 season saw a four-fold decline in activity compared to pre-pandemic seasons.Implementation of strict public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was instrumental in reducing the incidence of flu and flu-like illnesses during the past two respiratory virus seasons in both hemispheres.However, the relaxation of these measures is expected to promote a tidal wave of respiratory virus infections in the weeks to come.These infections include influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), which often affects children.Influenza in the Southern Hemisphere Despite the impact of COVID-19 on global health and the almost negligible level of seasonal influenza activity over the past two years, the Southern Hemisphere experienced a major shift in influenza activity during the 2022 respiratory virus season.In Chile, the season began with a burst of influenza B activity in January, followed by a relative lull in March and April, and then a surge in influenza A that peaked in June.In contrast, Australia's flu season started in March, had a record peak in June, and was dominated throughout by influenza A.What's in store for fall and winter? Unlike seasonal influenza, COVID-19 primarily behaves as a pandemic virus, with simultaneous, high-level viral transmission in all parts of the globe. COVID-19 activity may be "seasonal" in some respects, with higher rates of transmission during the fall and winter months when people are indoors more often than not and, consequentially, less socially-distanced.The 2022 Southern Hemisphere experience serves as a harbinger for what to expect during the 2022-23 respiratory virus season in northern climates.In the North, the respiratory virus season is already off to an early and blazing start, particularly in the US and Canada, and appears destined to wreak havoc on health-care systems that are already struggling from the impact of COVID-19.The importance of influenza vaccination Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions in our battle against influenza and COVID-19.Recommendations on the composition of flu vaccines are made biannually by the World Health Organisation (WHO) several months in advance of the forthcoming respiratory virus season in each respective hemisphere.However, licensing of influenza vaccines generally falls under national jurisdictions. Similar vaccine formulations are approved for use in the US, Canada, United Kingdom and other northern countries, and are now widely available.Flu vaccine composition for the 2022-23 respiratory virus season in northern latitudes is based on surveillance of circulating influenza virus strains during the most recent respiratory virus season in the Southern Hemisphere.The WHO has recommended both quadrivalent vaccines (containing four strains) and trivalent vaccines (containing three strains), with no preference given to either formulation.The quadrivalent vaccine contains two inactivated strains of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and two inactivated strains of influenza B. The trivalent vaccine is similar with the exception of having a single inactivated strain of influenza B.How effective are flu shots? Vaccine-mediated protection against influenza infection, severe illness and death has immense public health ramifications, yet is often misunderstood.Vaccine effectiveness varies from one respiratory virus season to another and hinges on several factors, including the degree of vaccine mismatch with circulating strains, the use of high-dose versus standard-dose vaccines, prior influenza illness or vaccination, age, general health status, and public health measures such as social distancing, medical mask use, and travel restrictions.Flu vaccines tend to confer a greater degree of protection against influenza B and influenza A H1N1 subtypes, with a lower degree of effectiveness against the influenza A H3N2 subtype.Research has shown that the effectiveness of standard-dose flu vaccines in preventing severe influenza illness during the 2019-20 US respiratory virus season was highest in young adults (60 per cent), relatively low in middle-aged adults (20 per cent) and modest or negligible in the elderly.High-dose vaccines improve effectiveness to 30 per cent in the elderly. Therefore, people 65 years of age or older should receive a high-dose quadrivalent vaccine.Flu shots should be complemented by other infection control precautions including social distancing, indoor masking and frequent handwashing.Do I really need a flu shot? You can get a flu shot concurrently with a COVID-19 shot.Influenza vaccines are considered safe and effective in virtually all individuals, despite the lack of robust evidence of protection in very young children and the elderly.Their use is akin to protection from wearing seatbelts; you may not necessarily be involved in an accident but if you are, the chances of survival and protection from serious injury are higher with their use than without.During the 2019-20 respiratory virus season in the US, influenza vaccination prevented over 100,000 hospitalisations and over 6,000 deaths.Given the expected burden of influenza illness and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the benefits of vaccination will likely be greater during the current respiratory viral season compared to those in the past few years.What is the role of COVID-19 boosters? Orange masses studded with small green dots.For COVID-19, the effectiveness of a two-dose primary vaccine series plus a single booster in preventing hospitalisation is close to 90 per cent but gradually drops to around 65 per cent over the course of four to five months after the last vaccine dose.Bivalent vaccine boosters may serve as a means of preserving vaccine-induced immunity against newer variants of SARS-CoV-2.COVID-19 vaccines remain part of an effective strategy to counter the next wave of infection.The latest bivalent vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna are recommended as boosters for individuals with at least two primary COVID-19 vaccinations.The bivalent vaccines are believed to be more effective against the dominant BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 than the original mRNA vaccines, but equal in effectiveness to first-generation bivalent vaccines that target the original strain and the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.The US, Canada and Europe have slightly different age-based and time-based eligibility criteria for these boosters.Influenza and COVID-19 are expected to make headway during the current respiratory virus season in northern climates.Vaccination in conjunction with personal protective measures are the best means of staying healthy.
