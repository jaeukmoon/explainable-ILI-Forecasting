These viruses lost the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes critical for antigenic characterization and give low yields and acquire adaptive mutations when cultured in eggs and cells, contributing to recent vaccine challenges. Examination of receptor specificities of A/H3N2 viruses reveals that recent viruses compensated for decreased binding of the prototypic human receptor by recognizing α2,6-sialosides on extended LacNAc moieties. Erythrocyte glycomics shows an absence of extended glycans providing a rationale for lack of agglutination by recent A/H3N2 viruses. A glycan remodeling approach installing functional receptors on erythrocytes, allows antigenic characterization of recent A/H3N2 viruses confirming the cocirculation of antigenically different viruses in humans. Computational analysis of HAs in complex with sialosides having extended LacNAc moieties reveals that mutations distal to the RBD reoriented the Y159 side chain resulting in an extended receptor binding site.

This antigenic evolution, or drift, is mainly caused by amino acid substitutions in the globular head of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein where binding occurs with sialic acid receptors of host cells3,4. These substitutions in circulating influenza viruses lead to antigenic differences as compared to employed vaccines, resulting in poor vaccine-mediated protection5. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) continuously monitors antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses and recommends updated compositions of influenza vaccines biannually6.Antigenic surveillance and vaccine strain selection rely predominantly on the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, in which the ability of serum antibodies to block receptor binding by the influenza virus HA protein is quantified7. Such antibodies prevent virus-mediated agglutination of erythrocytes and are measured as a correlate of protection8. The HI assay makes it possible to select virus strains that are antigenically representative of circulating viruses for vaccine development9,10,11. It is easy to perform in a high throughput manner, can be standardized and is highly reproducible across laboratoria12.A/H3N2 viruses, which have become the leading cause of seasonal influenza illness and death since their introduction in the human population in 196813,14, exhibit a particularly rapid antigenic drift. As a result, the WHO has recommended 28 vaccine strain updates since these viruses started circulating in humans13. The rapid antigenic evolution of A/H3N2 viruses coincided with altered receptor usage, which in turn has resulted in an inability to agglutinate erythrocytes commonly employed for HI assays. As a result, antigenic characterization of circulating A/H3N2 viruses using the HI assay is increasingly difficult, complicating the selection of appropriate vaccine strains1,8,9,10. The receptor-binding phenotype of recent A/H3N2 viruses is also hampering virus replication under laboratory conditions for amplification of clinical isolates and leads to adaptive substitutions when grown in embryonated chicken eggs15,16. The difficulties to antigenically characterize circulating A/H3N2 viruses, in particular those belonging to the dominant 3C.2a clade, and the inability of large-scale virus production without egg-adaptation has led to serious problems with A/H3N2 influenza vaccine production and effectiveness1,11.HAs of human influenza viruses bind to cell surface glycans carrying terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid moieties (Neu5Ac(α2,6)Gal), which is referred to as the prototypic human receptor17. These receptors are usually part of N-linked glycans, which are highly complex biomolecules composed of a core pentasaccharide modified by various numbers and patterns of branching N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties18. These branching points can be extended by several N-acetyl-lactosamine (Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc, LacNAc) repeating units, which in turn can be capped by various types of fucosylation and sialylation. Several studies have shown that not only the α2,6-linked sialoside but also the underlying oligosaccharide structure of N-linked glycans can contribute to HA binding selectivities19,20,21,22,23. Antigenic pressure results mainly in amino acid substitutions near the receptor-binding site of HA, which may result in changes in glycan receptor specificities. Thus, failure of contemporary A/H3N2 viruses to agglutinate erythrocytes, the poor replication in mammalian cells and the emergence of egg adaptive mutations are probably due to an adaptation to glycan receptors that are not expressed by these cell substrates. Understanding of the evolution of receptor usage by A/H3N2 viruses at a molecular level will open avenues to address challenges in surveillance and vaccine production for these viruses.In this work, we examined receptor specificities of A/H3N2 viruses representing different evolutionary time points and clades using a novel glycan microarray to identify the minimal receptor requirements for recent, non-agglutinating A/H3N2 strains. Glycan analysis of cell surface N-glycans on various erythrocytes reveal an absence of such receptors. We developed an exo-enzymatic cell surface glycan remodeling strategy to install appropriate receptors on fowl erythrocytes to regain binding by contemporary A/H3N2 viruses. Such viruses can agglutinate the glyco-engineered erythrocytes and made it possible to antigenically characterize A/H3N2 viruses by HI assays. We reveal substantial antigenic differences of circulating virus isolates to current vaccine strains providing a rationale for poor vaccine performance.ResultsGlycan microarray analysis to determine A/H3N2 receptor specificityAlthough glycan microarray technology has been used to examine receptor requirements of HAs24, these were not populated with biologically relevant glycans to establish minimal receptor requirements. This information is, however, critical to understand how receptor binding has evolved over time and how a lack of expression of specific glycans by erythrocytes or laboratory hosts may have resulted in a loss of agglutination or a lack of propagation, respectively.We have constructed a glycan array that is populated with biologically relevant bi-antennary N-glycans having different numbers of LacNAc repeating units in various structural configurations. They resemble structures found on human respiratory tissue, which abundantly expresses N-glycans having multiple consecutive LacNAc repeating units that can be capped by sialic acid25,26. The synthetic glycans are either unmodified (compounds 1-3), capped by avian α2,3-linked (compounds 4-6), or human α2,6-linked sialosides (compounds 7-17). Most naturally occurring N-linked glycans have asymmetrical architectures in which the various antennae are modified by oligo-LacNAc moieties of different lengths27. To probe the importance of such architectures for HA recognition, we prepared symmetrical as well as asymmetrical glycans (8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 17) that are modified by either one or two sialosides linked to LacNAc chains of different length. The collections of compounds made it possible to probe the importance of mono- vs. bidentate binding interactions, and a possible preference or requirement for a sialoside at specific antenna or at an extended LacNAc chain. All glycans contain an anomeric asparagine moiety and its α-amine facilitated immobilization on amine reactive, NHS-activated glass slides. The quality of the printing was validated by probing the array with the lectins ECA, SNA, and MAL1 as well as an anti-H3 antibody (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1: Receptor-binding specificities of representative A/H3N2 viruses using glycan microarray analysis and glycomic analysis of N-glycosylation of unmodified fowl erythrocytes.a Binding was visualized using a human anti-H3 stalk antibody (CR8020).

High-mannose type N-glycans are not shown and their abundance is presented in Supplementary Fig. 5. The structures of all detected glycans are shown in Data S1.Full size imageThe glycan array was probed with various A/H3N2 viruses, representing distinct evolutionary time points and clades and having different abilities to agglutinate erythrocytes derived from species commonly used in HI assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). In this respect, chicken and turkey erythrocytes are widely employed in HA assays because they are nucleated, which unlike mammalian erythrocytes, sediment rapidly thereby greatly facilitating the visual readout of the assay7. They express α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialosides and can be agglutinated by avian as well as human influenza viruses. Other types of erythrocytes have been employed for HI assays28 and in particular those of guinea pig erythrocytes have been proven to be useful because they exhibit a somewhat broader agglutination ability and can for example be employed to antigenically characterize H3N2 viruses of the 3C.2 clade which cannot be agglutinated turkey and chicken erythrocytes29.In the studies, we included A/NL/816/91 (NL91) which can agglutinate chicken, turkey, and guinea pig erythrocytes, A/NL/109/03 (NL03) which only agglutinates turkey and guinea pig erythrocytes29 and A/NL/761/09 (NL09) which only agglutinates α2,6-resialylated turkey and guinea pig erythrocytes30,31,32. During the past decade, A/H3N2 viruses have evolved into distinct, cocirculating antigenic groups, referred to as clades (Supplementary Fig. 2). We examined A/NL/1797/17 (NL17) and A/NL/371/19 (NL19) as recent examples of the 3C.2a clade that insufficiently hemagglutinate all commonly used erythrocytes for HI assays, and poorly infect MDCK cells33. The 3C.3a clade is represented by A/NL/10006/19 and A/NL/384/19, and their evolutionary predecessor A/NL/622/12 (3C.3). Although 3C.3 viruses cannot agglutinate any erythrocyte type, 3C.3a viruses are unique as they regained an ability to agglutinate turkey and guinea pig erythrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2).Whole viruses were applied to the microarray and detection of binding was accomplished by a human anti-H3 stalk antibody (CR8020) (Supplementary Fig. 1). NL91 recognized most of the human-type receptors, including compounds that have an α2,6-sialoside on a mono-LacNAc residue (glycans 7-9, Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). Compound 8 exhibited a substantial greater responsiveness compared to 9 indicating that this virus has a preference for a sialoside at the α1,3-arm. Interestingly, the sialyltransferase, ST6Gal1, which is solely responsible for installing human-type receptors, preferentially modifies the α1,3-arm of N-linked glycans34. Compounds 7 and 8 did bind similarly demonstrating that an additional sialic acid at the α1,6-arm does not substantially contribute to binding. Another unanticipated observation was that compounds 12 and 16 did not exhibit binding whereas 9 showed responsiveness highlighting that an extended and unmodified LacNAc moiety at the α1,3-arm can block recognition of the other arm. Collectively, the results show that the minimal receptor for NL91 is a bi-antennary N-glycan having two LacNAc moieties modified by a single sialoside (glycan 8).NL03 and NL09 recognized far fewer glycans and did not bind to structures having their α2,6-sialosides at a mono-LacNAc moiety (7-9, 12 and 16). This observation indicates that the minimal receptor for these viruses is a bis-sialylated N-glycan having at least one di-LacNAc moiety (glycan 13). NL17 and NL19 (3C.2a) showed only strong responsiveness to 14, 15, and 17. These glycans have in common that at least one of the arms is extended by three consecutive LacNAc units that is further modified by an α2,6-sialoside. Thus, a glycan having four LacNAc units arranged in an asymmetrical manner (15) represents the minimal receptor for these viruses. Mono-sialylated derivative 15 gave a similar responsiveness compared to the bis-sialosides 14 and 17 indicating that a bidentate binding event does not substantially contribute to recognition as previously suggested22. Instead, it appears that reduction in binding of an α2,6-sialyl-Gal moiety, which is widely regarded as the prototypic human receptor, has been compensated by recognition of sialosides at extended LacNAc chains. 3C.3a viruses (A/NL/10006/19 and A/NL/384/19) exhibited a similar binding profile as NL03 and 09 and bound to bis-sialosides 10 and 13 having the Neu5Ac residue at a di-LacNAc chain. Interestingly, their ancestor (A/NL/622/12, 3C.3) required the Neu5Ac residue to be presented on a tri-LacNAc structure similar to the requirement of 3C.2a viruses. Thus, recent 3C.3a viruses have regained an ability to recognize shorter structures.Glycomic analysis of chicken and turkey erythrocytesNext, we examined structures of N-linked glycans expressed by chicken and turkey erythrocytes and compared the data with the receptor requirements of the various A/H3N2 viruses. Membrane fractions of the cells were treated with PNGase F to release the N-glycans which were isolated by solid phase extraction using C18 and Porous Graphitized Carbon (PGC) cartridges, and then analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)35. The 30 most abundant complex type N-glycan compositions for the two cell types are presented in Fig. 1b. The compounds are organized according to an increasing number of LacNAc moieties (indicated by different color coding) and include hybrid-type and core structures having none (black bars) or 1 LacNAc moiety (yellow bars) and complex N-glycans having variable numbers of LacNAc repeating units (2–4 LacNAc, green, blue and purple bars, respectively). High-mannose type N-glycans were also detected and their structures and abundance are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. Strikingly, chicken erythrocytes do not substantially express N-glycans having 4 LacNAc units which is the minimal epitope requirement for contemporary non-agglutinating A/H3N2 viruses. Turkey erythrocytes do express some glycans with this number of LacNAc units (purple bars in Fig. 1b), but the majority was assigned as tri- and tetra-antennary glycans because of substitution with three or four sialic acids. The latter was supported by selective release of bi-antennary N-glycans by Endo F2, and in this case LC-MS analysis did not detect glycans having four LacNAc moieties (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, turkey erythrocytes also do not substantially display sialylated epitopes having three consecutive LacNAc moieties. The majority of the glycans released by Endo F2 lacked fucose indicating that the fucosides observed in some of the structures depicted in Fig. 1 can be assigned to core modification. Chicken erythrocytes express substantial quantities of high mannose glycans (Supplementary Fig. 5) whereas turkey cells display almost none of these structures. The greater abundance of complex type glycans on turkey erythrocytes offers a possible rationale for the ability of the NL03 and NL09 A/H3N2 viruses to agglutinate unmodified or α2,6-resialylated turkey erythrocytes, respectively.Erythrocyte glycoengineering to install functional receptorsWe embarked on a strategy to enzymatically remodel glycans of fowl erythrocytes to install receptors for A/H3N2 viruses of the 3C.2 clade to make them suitable for HI assays (Fig. 2a). Treatment of erythrocytes with a neuraminidase was expected to remove sialic acids and reveal terminal galactosides which are appropriate acceptors for installing additional LacNAc moieties. The latter residues can be introduced by the concerted action of the enzymes B4GalT1 and B3GnT2, which sequentially install β1,4-linked galactoside and β1,3-linked N-acetyl-glucosamines, respectively. The terminal galactosides of the resulting extended LacNAc moieties can then be modified by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal1 to install terminal α2,6-linked sialosides36. The enzymatic remodeling was conveniently performed by incubating the erythrocytes with the neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens for 6 h after which B4GalT1, B3GnT237, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc were added followed by incubation overnight. Next, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed to remove the enzymes and sugar nucleotides, and then incubated with ST6Gal1 in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac for 4 h. Glycomic analysis of the resulting cells, which were denoted as 2,6-Sia Poly-LN cells, confirmed that the antennae of the N-linked glycans had been extended by additional LacNAc moieties, and both cell types expressed sialylated structures having four LacNAc units (Fig. 2b, 4 LacNAc units are indicated in purple bars). Analysis of glycans on turkey erythrocytes released by Endo F2 treatment confirmed the presence of bi-antennary glycans that have 4 LacNAc moieties and are potentially suitable receptors for contemporary A/H3N2 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 4, glycans having 4 LacNAc units are indicated by purple bars). Chicken and turkey erythrocytes express a mixture of α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialosides. To examine whether an increase in the abundance of α2,6-sialosides would improve agglutination, control cells were prepared by treatment with neuraminidase and resialylation with ST6Gal1 (denoted as 2,6-Sia cells). As negative control, we employed cells that have extended LacNAc moieties but lack sialic acids (denoted as Poly-LN cells).Fig. 2: Schematic overview of enzymatic modification of erythrocytes followed by glycomic analysis of N-glycosylation and their use in hemagglutination assays.a Neuraminidase A.U.: Neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens; B3GnT2: β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2; B4GalT1: β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1; ST6Gal1: α-2,6-sialyltransferase 1. b The 30 most abundant N-glycans on the enzymatically modified erythrocytes from chicken and turkey (based on relative intensity, excluding high-mannose type N-glycans, for all structures refer to Data S2) sorted by abundance and number of LacNAc units. Proposed structures are assigned to detected glycan compositions. c A/NL/816/91, A/NL/109/03, A/NL/761/09, A/NL/1797/17, A/NL/371/19, A/NL/622/12, A/NL/10006/19, and A/NL/384/19 tested with modified erythrocytes (2,6-Sia Poly-LN) from chicken (blue) and turkey (red). Unmodified, 2,6 resialylated (2,6-Sia) and extended desialylated (Poly-LN) erythrocytes were added as controls. Assays were performed in biological triplicates in the presence of oseltamivir and the means ± SEM were plotte.Full size imagePhenotypic properties of the glyco-engineered erythrocytes were examined using the hemagglutination (HA) assay (Fig. 2c). As expected, NL91 agglutinated unmodified, 2,6-Sia and 2,6-Sia poly-LN erythrocytes, which was in agreement with the finding that these viruses can employ N-glycans that have simple and extended α2,6-sialylated structures. NL03 agglutinated unmodified turkey erythrocytes, but interestingly also α2,6-resialylated chicken erythrocytes. The latter may be due to an increase in the abundance of α2,6-linked sialosides having two consecutive LacNAc repeatin units, which are present on chicken erythrocytes. α2,6-Resialylation of turkey erythrocytes was sufficient to recover agglutination of NL09, and in this case the greater abundance of α2,6-sialylation on extended structures already present on these cells is probably responsible for the improved agglutination. Importantly, NL17 and NL19 (3C.2a) agglutinated only erythrocytes that were enzymatically remodeled to have extended sialylated LacNAc moieties (2,6-Sia Poly-LN cells). Similar results were obtained for A/NL/622/12 (3C.3), which is in agreement with receptor requirements similar to viruses of the 3C.2a clade. As anticipated, the 3C.3a viruses (A/NL/10006/19 and A/NL/384/19), which have reverted to recognize shorter structures, could also agglutinate α2,6-resialyated turkey erythrocytes.Next, HA assays were performed with a wider collection of A/H3N2 viruses (Table 1) to validate the robustness of the glycoengineering method with a focus on contemporary A/H3N2 viruses that have lost the ability to hemagglutinate unmodified erythrocytes and do not replicate efficiently in wild-type MDCK cells. Several recent vaccine strains heavily adapted to growing in eggs (X-161B, IVR-147, X-223A, NIB-104, NIB-112, and X-327), an A/H1N1 (A/Singapore/GP1908/15) and an influenza B (B/Maryland/15/15) strain were included as controls. As expected, pre-2000 A/H3N2 (A/Bilthoven/16190/68, A/Beijing/353/89, and A/Netherlands/816/91) strains efficiently agglutinated unmodified chicken and turkey erythrocytes. Importantly, A/H3N2 viruses that emerged after 2010 only agglutinated the 2,6-Sia Poly-LN cells having extended sialylated epitopes. Although some contemporary A/H3N2 viruses can agglutinate turkey erythrocytes when applied undiluted, especially the two 2019 3C3a viruses, extended sialylated LacNAc moieties increased the efficiency of agglutination by 3–10-fold, including the A/H1N1 and influenza B controls. We performed a time course to determine the stability of the glyco-engineered cells, and no loss in titer or autoagglutination for up to three weeks was observed similar to unmodified cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).Table 1 Hemagglutination assay of A/H3N2 virus isolates using unmodified and 2,6-Sia Poly-LacNAc fowl erythrocytes and unmodified guinea pig erythrocytes.Full size tableThe 2,6-Sia Poly-LN cells were employed to antigenically characterize typical recent seasonal A/H3N2 viruses of various clades by HI assay using post-infection ferret sera (Table 2). All antisera showed robust inhibition of the homologous viruses and variable inhibition of heterologous viruses. Egg-derived vaccine strains displayed poor correspondence with data generated with cell-passaged viruses of the same clade. Antisera raised against cell-passaged virus isolates showed greater clade specificity compared to antisera raised against egg-derived vaccine strains. Additionally, egg-derived vaccine strains were inhibited stronger by various antisera than cell-passaged viruses. The HI assay also revealed that antisera raised against recent vaccine viruses, including A/Kansas/14/17 that was selected for the 2019/2020 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine38, exhibited only minimal cross reactivity against circulating viruses from the same clades, indicating that the circulating viruses differ antigenically from the vaccine strains of the same clade.Table 2 Hemagglutination inhibition assay.Full size tableThe results of the HI assay were compared with a focus reduction assay (FRA) using the same sera and viruses (Supplementary Table 1)39. In this assay, the ability of antibodies to block virus infection in mammalian cell culture (MDCK-Siat cells, which overexpress Sia(α2,6)Gal moieties) is quantified. The FRA confirmed the trends observed in the HI assay (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that the modified erythrocytes are reliable for antigenic characterization of A/H3N2 viruses.Molecular dynamics simulations of HAs in complex with their receptorsα2,6-Sialyl-Gal is widely considered as the prototypic human receptor for IAVs17. All viruses we examined, including A/H1N1 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 8), recognized with high avidity N-glycans having an α2,6-linked sialoside on an extended LacNAc moiety. Human respiratory tissue abundantly expresses such extended structures25,26, and thus we reasoned that mutational changes in recent A/H3N2 viruses led to a reduced binding avidity of the prototypic human receptor (α2,6-sialyl-Gal), which was compensated by making interactions with an extended LacNAc chain.X-ray crystal structures31,40,41 have shown that sialic acid is recognized in a conserved hydrophobic pocket (Y98, H183, Y195, and W153) (Supplementary Table 2). It makes further interactions through a hydrogen bonding network with residues 135-137, E190, and S228. Sequence alignments showed that post-2000 strains acquired single point mutations at one of these residues (Supplementary Table 2), which disrupted the hydrogen bonding network, and likely resulted in a reduced binding affinity of the prototypic human receptor, which is a sialoside α2,6-linked to galactose31. Furthermore, HAs of early human A/H3N2 strains have Glu at residue 190, which can form a hydrogen bond with O9 of sialic acid, whereas post-2000 strains, favor Asp190 at this position, which due to its shorter side chain, cannot form such an interaction. The 190E/D mutation was accompanied by a 225G/D mutation, which resulted in a rotation of Gal-2 allowing a hydrogen bond interaction with the site chain of 225D31,40. This rotation places the extended LacNAc chain closer to the 190-helix and potentially allows for addition interactions. To examine this mode of binding, we compared molecular dynamics generated structures of α2,6-sialyl poly-LacNAc in complex with NL91, NL03, and NL17 (Fig. 3). It recapitulated observations made by X-ray crystallography studies and provided insight in how mutational changes allowed for interactions with an extended LacNAc chains. The MD trajectory of NL91 only showed interactions with sialic acid, including the important hydrogen bond between Sia-1 O9 and Glu190 (Fig. 3a)31,40. In the case of NL03 and NL17, Asp190 is at a distance of 4.5 Å to Sia-1 O9, and thus cannot establish a hydrogen bond (Fig. 3d, g). The G225D substitution resulted in a rotation of the bond between the sialic acid and Gal-2 to form an H-bond with its O316, (Fig. 3e, h). As anticipated, the resulting rotation of Gal-2 placed the extended LacNAc moieties near the 190-helix41 resulting in a hydrogen bond between Asp190 and Gal-4 O2, while either Ser or Asn193 provided a H-bond with the acetamide moiety of GlcNAc-3 (Fig. 3e). In addition, Gal-6 (Fig. 3e, h) makes a CH-π interaction with the side chain of Y159 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Such interactions are often observed in glycan-protein complexes and contribute substantially to binding42. Structural analysis of the HAs of NL91 and NL03 showed that mutations distal to the receptor-binding domain (A131T, H155T, and E156H), reorient the side chain of Y159 resulting in an extended receptor-binding site allowing interactions with Gal-6 (Supplementary Fig. 9). The MD simulations support that A/H3N2 of the 3C.2 clade have undergone mutations to create and extended binding site to compensate for reduced binding of the non-extended human receptor (Fig. 3c, f, i). Interestingly, 3C.3a viruses, which can utilize shorter receptors having two LacNAc units (Fig. 1a), have a tyrosine to serine mutation at position 159 (Supplementary Table 2). Thus, the dependence on extended receptors is reversible, and these viruses have found a way to bind shorter structures with sufficient affinity for infection. The observation that distant mutations can alter the position of a side chain of an amino acid in the receptor-binding site, which subsequently can become susceptible to antigenic pressure, indicates that such remote mutations need to be considered for the evolution of receptor binding and antigenic distance.Fig. 3: Structural comparison of HAs from evolutionary different strains in complex with extended glycan receptor.Details of the sialic acid binding sites are shown for A/NL/816/91 (a), A/NL/109/03 (d), and A/NL/1797/17 (g). The interactions of the poly-LN chain with the protein are shown for A/NL/816/91 (b), A/NL/109/03 (e), and A/NL/1797/17 (h). The surface and spheres representations of HA/glycans complexes are shown for A/NL/816/91 (c), A/NL/109/03 (f), and A/NL/1797/17 (i).Full size imageDiscussionChanges in receptor-binding properties of H3N2 viruses were first noticed by a lack of agglutination of commonly employed red blood cells and poor recovery of isolated viruses that were propagated in laboratory hosts such as eggs and MDCK cells29,43. Conventional binding assays using a limited set of relevant glycans showed these viruses had lost the ability to bind to what was regarded as the canonical human-type receptors, namely α2,6-sialyl-Gal21,44. Screening of a glycan microarray populated with symmetrical N-glycans (each arm modified by the same epitope) identified receptors for contemporary A/H3N2. In particular, these viruses could bind bi-antennary N-glycans having an extended sialo-LaNAc epitope at each of its arm. Modeling studies indicated that the two sialic acid moieties are sufficiently spaced to bind to a protomer of the same HA trimer. It was proposed that the resulting bidentate binding mode increased the binding avidity22.Progress in methods for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycans45 allowed us to construct a glycan microarray populated with bi-antennary N-glycans that more closely resemble structures expressed in human respiratory tissue25,26, and include asymmetrical glycans having either one or two sialic acid moieties linked to LacNAc chains of different length. It made it possible, for the first time, to uncover the minimal receptor of contemporary A/H3N2 viruses, which is a bi-antennary N-glycan in which one of the arms is extended by three consecutive LacNAc units that is modified by an α2,6-sialoside. It demonstrated that the previously proposed bidentate binding event does not substantially contribute to binding22. Based on our microarray data, sequence alignments, reported crystal structures, and MD simulations, we developed alternative binding model for A/H3N2 of the 3C.2 clade. In this model, mutations remote to the receptor-binding domain resulted in the rotation of the side chain of tyrosine at position 159 which gives rise to an extended binding site. Furthermore, a 225G/D mutation reoriented the poly-LacNAc chain allowing it to make interactions with the extended binding site. These interactions compensate for reduced contacts with sialic acid caused by mutations in the receptor-binding site arisen from antigenic pressure4. It is, however, possible that factors other than antigenic pressure may have contributed to adaptions of receptor specificity. For example, a binding requirement for sialic acid on poly-LacNAc chain may provide a benefit because such structures are usually not found on O-glycans of mucins, and therefore such a receptor specificity may contribute to escaping the mucosal barrier”.The identification of the minimal receptor for contemporary H3N2 viruses made it possible to engineer the surface of erythrocytes with functional receptors allowing easy antigenic characterization of recent A/H3N2 isolates using the HI assay. It confirmed that antigenically distinct viruses are circulating in humans and that egg-passaged A/H3N2 vaccine components match poorly to circulating strains. Due to the failure of the classical HI, focus reduction assays have been employed to antigenically characterize A/H3N2. These assays are, however, time-consuming, have low throughput, suffer from low reproducibility, and can lead to adapted mutations thereby providing incorrect results12. These limitations are addressed by the glyco-engineered red blood cells described here. The altered receptor requirement of A/H3N2 viruses is also complicating propagation in the laboratory. Recently, an MDCK cell line (hCK) was introduced in which α2,3-sialyl transferases were genetically removed and ST6Gal1, which introduces human-type receptors, was overexpressed33. This cell line supports efficient replication of contemporary human A/H3N2 viruses that maintain higher genetic stability46. The minimal receptor requirements of contemporary A/H3N2 viruses established in this study support further engineering of such cells to biosynthesize extended α2,6-sialylated LacNAc moieties. Furthermore, it is the expectation that the described glycan engineering approach for erythrocytes can be extended to other cells, such as MDCK cells, to quickly provide laboratory hosts for virus replication. The results presented here may also provide a rationale for why certain sialylated inhibitors do not bind HA when expressed in CHO vs. HEK cells where the nature of the sialylated linkages are different47. Finally, an understanding of the evolution of receptor specificities of A/H3N2 viruses and associated antigenic changes will facilitate the development of predictive evolutionary models for the reliable selection of vaccine strains.MethodsVirus productionMaterialsEagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM), penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, HEPES, 1x non-essential amino acids, and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) treated trypsin were purchased at Lonza Benelux BV, Breda, The Netherlands.

To produce virus stocks in eggs, 100 μL of virus was inoculated in the allantoic cavities of 11-day-old embryonated hens’ eggs. The allantoic fluid was harvested after 2 days.Microarray studiesMaterialsVirus isolates were produced as described above. Oseltamivir was purchased from Sigma Aldrich [Cat# SML1606]. CR8020 A/H3N2 stem antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Eggink and expressed following previously published procedures48. Goat anti-human Alexa-647 [Cat# A21445] and streptavidin-AlexaFluor 635 [Cat# SA1011] antibodies were obtained from Thermo Fisher.

Scienion sciFLEXARRAYER S3 non-contact microarray printer equipped with a Scienion PDC80 nozzle (Scienion Inc) was used for printing. Glycans were dissolved in printing buffer (sodium phosphate, 250 mM, pH 8.5) at a concentration of 100 µM. Each compound was printed in replicates of 6 with a spot volume of ~400 pL, at 20 °C and 50% humidity. Slides were blocked with 5 mM ethanolamine in Tris buffer (pH 9, 50 mM) for 1 h at 50 °C and rinsed with DI water after printing.Glycan microarrayQuality control was performed using the plant lectins ECA (specific for terminal Gal), SNA (specific for α2,6-linked Neu5Ac), and MAL-I (specific for α2,3-linked Neu5Ac) and is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Quality control of the CR8020 A/H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin stem specific antibody specificity was performed by incubation of the antibody to the array as described below, in the absence of a virus (Supplementary Fig. 1). The printed library of compounds comprised the glycans described in the Supplementary Information (#8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #15, #16, #17) and published previously (#1-#7, #10, #14)49.SampleVirus isolates (25 µL) were diluted with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween, 25 µL) and applied to the array surface in the presence of oseltamivir (200 nM) in a humidified chamber for 1 h, followed by successive rinsing with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween), PBS, and deionized water (2x) and dried by centrifugation. The virus-bound slide was incubated for 1 h with the CR8020 A/H3N2 influenza hemaglutinin stem specific antibody (100 µL, 5 µg mL−1 in PBS-T) and washed according to previous washing procedure. A secondary goat anti-human AlexaFluor-647 antibody (100 µL, 2 µg mL−1 in PBS-T) was applied, incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber and washed again as described above. The control lectins containing a biotin tag were visualized with Streptavidin-AlexaFluor635. Slides were dried by centrifugation after the washing step and scanned immediately.Detection and data processingThe slides were scanned using an Innopsys Innoscan 710 microarray scanner at the appropriate excitation wavelength. To ensure that all signals were in the linear range of the scanner’s detector and to avoid any saturation of the signals various gains and PMT values were employed. Images were analyzed with Mapix software (version 8.1.0 Innopsys) and processed with our home written Excel macro. The average fluorescence intensity and SD were measured for each compound after exclusion of the highest and lowest intensities from the spot replicates (n = 4).Glycomic analysisMaterialsAcetic acid [Cat# 5330010050], MS–grade formic acid [Cat# 5330020050], 2-aminoanthrallic acid (2-AA) [Cat#10680], dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) [Cat# W387520], and sodium cyanoborohydride [Cat# 156159] were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) was purchased from Acros Organics [Cat#434161000]. MS-grade acetonitrile (MeCN) was obtained from Biosolve [Cat# 200-835-2]. PNGase F was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (1U defined as the amount of enzyme catalysing the conversion of 1 µmol(substrate) min−1) [Cat#06538355103]. Denaturation buffer (0.5% SDS, 40 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 1% NP-40, and glycobuffer (50 mM sodium phosphate) were obtained from New England BioLabs. Ammonium formate was purchased from Fluka chemicals [Cat# AGG1946-85021], C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) Sep-Pak® Vac (1cc) columns from Waters Corporation [Cat# WAT054955], PGC SPE Hypercarb Hypersep (1cc) columns from Thermo Scientific [Cat# 60106-303], and PD Minitrap Sephadex G-10 size exclusion cartridges from GE Healthcare [Cat# 28-9180-10]. MilliQ water was obtained from a Synergy® water purification system. N-glycan extraction and release from erythrocytesCell surface N-glycans were extracted according to a reported protocol35. Briefly, erythrocytes (400 µL, 50%) were concentrated by centrifugation (430 rcf, 10 min) and removal of the supernatant. Erythrocytes were lysed under gentle shaking at room temperature for 1 h using deionized water (3x pellet size). The suspension was centrifuged (4000 rcf, 10 min), the supernatant removed, and the pellet resuspended in deionized water. The process was repeated until the pellet decolorized, indicating an efficient lysis of the erythrocytes. Denaturing of the cell membrane pellet was performed by heating for 10 min to 95 °C in denaturation buffer (0.5% SDS, 40 mM DTT in H2O). The N-glycans were released during overnight incubation at 37 °C with PNGase F (5 U) in a sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) or with Endo F2 in sodium acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 4), both containing NP-40 (1%).Purification and labeling of N-glycansThe released N-glycans were applied to a C18 SPE cartridge and glycans were eluted with 5% MeCN in H2O (0.05% TFA, 1 mL). The eluate was further purified on a PGC SPE cartridge by gradually increasing the hydrophobicity from 100% H2O (0.05% TFA, 1 mL) to 5% MeCN in H2O (0.05% TFA, 1 mL), and to 50% MeCN in H2O (0.05% TFA, 1 mL) which eluted the glycans. After drying in a N2 flow, the sample was dissolved in H2O (10 μL) and labeled by addition of a solution (10 μL) of 2-AA (48 mg mL−1) and sodium cyanoborohydride (63 mg mL−1) in DMSO/acetic acid (10:3 v/v) for 2 h at 65 °C. The crude mixture was diluted with H2O (80 µL) and purified on a Minitrap Sephadex G-10 gravity column by washing with of H2O (700 µL) and eluting with H2O (600 µL). The eluate was dried under N2 flow and dissolved in 20 µL of 50% MeCN in H2O prior to LC-MS analysis.HILIC-IMS-QTOF analysis of N-glycans and data treatmentThe N-glycan analysis was performed on a 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 6560 IM-QTOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) and HPLC separation with a ZIC®-cHILIC column (3 µm, 100 Å, 150 mm × 2.1 mm, Merck) and a similar guard column (20 mm × 2.1 mm, Merck) using a gradient from 30% A to 50% A within 25 min (A: 50 mM (NH4)2CO3 in H2O; B: MeCN; 0.2 mL min−1; 60 °C). MS analysis was performed with a drying gas temperature of 300 °C and a flow of 8 mL min−1. The nebulizer pressure was set to 40 psi, the sheath gas flow to 11 L min−1 and the temperature to 350 °C. Measurements were run in negative mode with the capillary established at 3500 V. During the runs the Agilent tuning mix was infused for mass calibration based on reference signals at m/z 112.9855 and m/z 1033.9881.The data analysis was performed with the Mass Hunter IM-MS Browser and the find feature function filtering for masses with an ion intensity of ≥500. Found masses were processed with the online Glycomod tool to identify glycan related masses50.Glycoengineering of erythrocytesMaterialsArthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase was purchased at New England Biolabs (1U defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1 µmol(substrate) min−1) [Cat# P0722L]. Mammalian glycosyltransferases were expressed according to literature reports37. B3GnT2 and ST6Gal1 were cleaved and purified from GFP tags prior to use. Alkaline phosphatase (FastAP) was purchased at Thermo Scientific [Cat# EF0651]. Nucleotide sugars UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc and CMP-Neu5Ac were obtained from Roche Diagnostics [UDP-Gal: Cat# 07703562103; UDP-GlcNAc: Cat# 06369855103; CMP-NeuAc: Cat# 05974003103].Erythrocyte preparationFresh blood from chicken or turkey was centrifuged (10 min, 430 rcf) followed by removal of the supernatant. Pellets were washed three times in PBS with intermittent centrifugation (430 rcf, 10 min). Erythrocyte solutions were stored in a 50% solution in PBS until further use.Enzymatic extensionTo a suspension of fowl erythrocytes (250 µL, 50%), PBS (900 µL) and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (12 U) were added. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C while tilting. Next, glycosyltransferases B4GALT1 (37.5 µL, 1 mg mL−1) and B3GnT2 (37,5 µL, 1 mg mL−1), the nucleotide sugars UDP-Gal (4.4 mM) and UDP-GlcNAc (4.4 mM), alkaline phosphatase (6 U), MnCl2 (2 mM) and BSA (6 µL, 2 mg mL−1) were added. This reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C while tilting. The erythrocytes were washed in PBS (2x, 600 µL) and the pellet was reconstituted in 900 µL PBS. Resialylation of the erythrocytes was performed using ST6Gal1 (37.5 µL, 1 mg mL−1) and CMP-Neu5Ac (4.4 mM) in the presence of alkaline phosphatase (6 U) and BSA (6 µL, 2 mg mL−1) for 4 h at 37 °C while tilting. The erythrocytes were washed in PBS (1x, 600 µL) and diluted to a 1% solution for hemagglutination (inhibition) assays.Stability assayFresh fowl erythrocytes were glyco-engineered as described above or used unmodified. A hemagglutination assay was performed every 2 days using two viruses, A/NL/761/09 and A/NL/816/91. Hemagglutination assays were performed as described below in full biological triplicates. The means were plotted ±SEM and are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.Hemagglutination assayHemagglutination assays were performed following standard procedures7. Briefly, virus stocks were two-fold serial diluted in the presence of oseltamivir (20 nM). Turkey erythrocytes (1%, 25 µL) were mixed with the serial diluted viruses and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before recording of the results. Titers were expressed as the highest dilution of virus stock that completely agglutinated the turkey erythrocytes.Hemagglutination inhibition assayHemagglutination inhibition assays were performed following standard protocols7. Briefly, for the preparation of the antisera, ferrets were inoculated intranasally and blood was obtained 14 days later. Experiments were performed in strict compliance with European guidelines (EU Directive on Animal Testing 86/609/EEC) and Dutch legislation (Experiments on Animals Act, 1997). An independent animal experimentation ethical review committee (Dutch Stichting Dier Experimenten Commissie Consult) approved all animal studies (license AVD101002015340). Antisera were pre-treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) by incubating overnight with an in-house produced filtrate of Vibrio cholera at 37 °C followed by 1 h incubation at 56 °C. The treated antisera were pre-absorbed with extended turkey erythrocytes (10%) in two cycles of 1 h incubation at 4 °C. Pre-absorbed antisera were two-fold serial diluted (starting at 1:10) and mixed with virus stock (25 µL) containing 4 hemagglutinating units. Viruses were incubated with the antisera for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of BSA (0.25%) and oseltamivir (20 nM). Turkey erythrocyte solution (25 µL, 1%) was added and after 1 h incubation at 4 °C inhibition patterns were recorded. Titers were expressed as the value of the highest serum dilution that gave complete inhibition of agglutination.Focus reduction assayFocus reduction assays were performed following standard protocols51. First, infectious titers of the virus stocks were determined in hCK cells as described previously52. RDE-treated sera were twofold diluted in a 96-well plate (starting at 1:10) and mixed 1:1 with 100 TCID50/50 µL of virus. After 1 h incubation at 35 °C, 100 µL of the mixtures were transferred to hCK cells and after 90 min incubation at 35 °C, cells were washed and overlaid with 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose. After 48 h at 35 °C, cells were washed and fixed with formalin and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, immunostaining was performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody (HB65; EVL, Woerden, The Netherlands) directed against the viral nucleoprotein (NP), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti mouse immunoglobulin preparation (GAM-HRPO, Invitrogen, Foster city, CA), both for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, True-Blue substrate (KPL, Gaitherburg, Maryland) was added followed by a 10 min incubation at room temperature. The plates were washed, dried, and submitted to automated image capture using a Series 6 ImmunoSpot Image Analyzer (CTL Immuno-Spot, Cleveland OH, USA) to quantitate the percentage well area covered by spots of infected cells. Inhibition ≥90% was considered positive for neutralization.Structural studiesAlignmentTo investigate the relevance of specific mutations in defining receptor preferences during antigenic drift, primary amino acid sequences were compared of A/H3N2 HAs from 1968 to 2019. Protein sequences and structures were derived from the 3DPlu database (http://3dflu.cent.uw.edu.pl/index.html)53 and the GISAID webpage (https://www.gisaid.org). It identified specific mutations that may influence receptor-binding preferences. We paid specific attention to mutations in the four structural elements that define the RBS, including the 130-loop, the 150-loop, the 190-helix, and the 220-loop. The results from this analysis are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.MD simulationsA starting pose of the NL91 from 1991 was generated by superimposition of the model derived structure (id code ACU12494) [http://3dflu.cent.uw.edu.pl/index.html] onto the X-ray crystal structure of the A/HK/1/1968 H3N2 influenza virus hemagglutinin in complex with 6′-SLNLN (pdb code 6TZB)41. The starting pose of NL03 was generated by using the X-ray crystal structure of the A/Wy/3/03 influenza virus hemagglutinin in complex with 6′-SLN (pdb code 6BKR)37. Glycan receptors, NeuAcα2-6(LacNAc)2 and NeuAcα2-6(LacNAc)3, were generated by using the carbohydrate builder GLYCAM-web site [http://glycam.org]. The glycosidic torsion angles of the monosaccharides were maintained as observed by X-ray crystallography, while those not resolved were defined according to the lower energy values predicted by the GLYCAM-web modeling tool. The structural model of the NL17 was obtained by using the mutagenesis tool implemented in PyMOL. The resulting poses were used as starting points for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations were performed using the Amber16 program4 with the protein.ff14SB, the GLYCAM_06j-1 and the water.tip3p force fields parameters. Next, the starting 3D geometries were placed into a 10 Å octahedral box of explicit TIP3P waters, and counter ions were added to maintain electroneutrality. Two consecutive minimization steps were performed involving (1) only the water molecules and ions and (2) the whole system with a higher number of cycles, using the steepest descent algorithm. The system was subjected to two rapid molecular dynamic simulations (heating and equilibration). The equilibrated structures were the starting points for a final MD simulations at constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm). In all, 100 ns Molecular dynamics simulations without constraints were recorded, using an NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions, a cut-off of 10 Å, and the particle mesh Ewald method. A total of 50,000,000 molecular dynamics steps were run with a time step of 1 fs per step. Coordinates and energy values were recorded every 50000 steps (50 ps) for a total of 1000 MD models. The detailed analysis of the H-bond and CH-π interactions was performed along the MD trajectory using the cpptraj module included in Amber-Tools 16 package.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Sign up for Nature Briefing: Translational ResearchNew Influenza Vaccine Recommendations for 2021-2022 Season | AAFP Search search close New Influenza Vaccine Recommendations for 2021-2022 Season ACIP Guidance Contains Several 'Primary Updates' for Clinicians September 16, 2021, 9:21 a.m. News Staff — The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has released updated recommendations on the use of influenza vaccines for the 2021-2022 influenza season. The recommendations, published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Aug. 27, contain six primary updates that will be of interest to family physicians and other health care professionals, as well as comprehensive guidance for use of the vaccines in specific populations and situations. The AAFP officially approved the ACIP’s recommendations earlier this month. The updates are now available at the Academy’s Seasonal Influenza Prevention & Control webpage. “There are no changes to the recommendation that all persons 6 months of age and older should be vaccinated against influenza, and the flu vaccine may be co-administered with other vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines,” said Pamela Rockwell, D.O., of Ann Arbor, Mich., the Academy’s liaison to the ACIP. “Keeping safe with preventive measures such as avoiding crowds, wearing masks and frequent hand-washing will also help keep influenza and other infectious diseases from spreading.” Update Summary Overall, the ACIP continues to recommend routine annual influenza vaccination for all individuals age 6 months and older who do not have contraindications. In addition, the ACIP does not recommend any particular influenza vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended and age-appropriate vaccine is available. Story Highlights The six primary updates are as follows. 1. All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2021-22 season are quadrivalent, and contain hemagglutinin derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. 2. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) vaccine components have been updated. Specifically, for the 2021-2022 season, U.S. licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus (for cell culture-based inactivated and recombinant influenza vaccines); an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. 3. Flucelvax Quadrivalent, a cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine, is now approved for use in individuals age 2 years and older. Previously, the vaccine had been approved for individuals age 4 years and older. 4. Guidance on the administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines has been expanded to include COVID-19 vaccination. According to the recommendations, current guidance indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered with other vaccines, including vaccines for influenza. However, clinicians also are advised to periodically consult recommendations from the ACIP and interim clinical considerations from the CDC for the latest information. 5. Guidance on vaccination timing has been updated for certain populations: For patients in the third trimester of pregnancy, vaccination soon after a vaccine becomes available can now be considered. Children who require two doses of influenza vaccine administered four or more weeks apart should receive the first dose as soon as possible after a vaccine becomes available. For nonpregnant adults, influenza vaccination early in the season should be avoided unless there is concern that vaccination may not be possible later. 6. Contraindications and precautions for Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) have been modified: A previous history of severe allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine, of any valency, is now considered a precaution to use of quadrivalent ccIIV or RIV rather than a contraindication. In these instances, use of quadrivalent ccIIV or RIV should occur in a medical setting under the supervision of a health care professional who can recognize and manage a severe allergic reaction; clinicians can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. For quadrivalent ccIIV, a history of severe allergic reaction to any ccIIV of any valency, or any component of ccIIV, is a contraindication to future use of quadrivalent ccIIV. For quadrivalent RIV, a history of severe allergic reaction to any RIV of any valency, or any component of RIV, is a contraindication to future use of quadrivalent RIV. Other Items of Note The ACIP’s recommendations also contain guidance for use of the influenza vaccine in specific populations and situations. For example, the recommendations state that in situations where vaccine supply is limited, efforts should focus on administering the vaccine to those at increased risk for medical complications to severe influenza who do not have contraindications to being vaccinated. This includes all children age 6 months through 59 months and anyone 50 years and older; any adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (excluding asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic or metabolic disorders; those who are immunocompromised due to any cause; those who are or will be pregnant during influenza season; children and adolescents age 6 months through 18 years who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who may be at risk of Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities; American Indians/Alaska Natives and; individuals who are extremely obese (defined in adults as a BMI of 40 or higher). An age-appropriate quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or RIV is suitable for patients in all risk groups. However, quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended for some populations. For other populations, the ACIP’s recommendations are as follows. Pregnant patients. Any licensed, recommended age-appropriate quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or RIV may be used in patients who are pregnant or might be pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season. Quadrivalent LAIV should not be used during pregnancy, but can be used postpartum. Older adults. For patients 65 years and older, any age-appropriate quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or RIV (standard dose or high dose, adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted) is acceptable. The committee will continue to review data on the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines as more information becomes available. Immunocompromised patients. Those with immunocompromising conditions should receive an age-appropriate quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine or RIV. The committee also recommends that quadrivalent LAIV should not be used in these individuals because of a biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the vaccine. International travelers. For travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza, the ACIP recommends influenza vaccination at least two weeks before departure. In particular, individuals who live in the United States, are at higher risk for complications and did not receive influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider vaccination before departure if they plan on traveling to the tropics, traveling to the Southern Hemisphere between April and September, or traveling with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at the CDC’s Travelers’ Health Flu webpage. The recommendations also contain additional guidance on administration of the vaccines in patients who have a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome after influenza vaccination, those who have a history of egg allergy and those who have had previous allergic reactions to influenza vaccines; an overview on influenza dosage, administration, contraindications and precautions; vaccine storage and handling; and resources on influenza surveillance, prevention and control. Additional Comments Rockwell provided additional guidance for FPs who are caring for patients in an office setting. “When administering flu shots in the office please take care to see if your patient is due or overdue for any other routine vaccines,” Rockwell said. “Pediatric and adult vaccination rates have decreased dramatically since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we can start to remedy that with co-administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines.” “Remember that a physician recommendation has the strongest impact on our patients’ receipt of vaccines,” she added. The ACIP is currently scheduled to hold a virtual meeting on Sept. 29 followed by a two-day meeting in October. Look to AAFP.org for relevant details from these meetings as more information becomes available. Copyright © 2024 American Academy of Family Physicians.

In fact, the feared twindemic of co-circulating flu and COVID-19 last season actually never was. So, with such an unusual preceding year, along with all other COVID-related surprises, what can we really say about flu season 2021-2022?Influenza season usually takes place during winter months for both southern and northern hemispheres. In the United States, flu season peaks during January and February, while in the southern hemisphere it is generally June through August. For the 2020 season, influenza activity has been negligible throughout the world (as has been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) FluNet1 (data provided by National Influenza Centers (NICs) of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)2 and has actually been at the interseason levels since early 2020 (beginning of COVID pandemic). The exact reason for atypical influenza is difficult to define and is likely multifactorial due to COVID-related mitigation strategies, including: universal masking, social distancing, many people working from home, significantly reduced and restricted international travel, and at least suggested possibility of “viral interference” between SARS-COV-2 and Influenza viruses. How One Health System is Addressing the Upcoming Influenza Season The New York City-based Montefiore Health System is preparing for the upcoming influenza season with a plan to vaccinate employees, patients, and their community. Concern for the “twindemic” with cocirculating SARS-COV-2 and influenza viruses make flu vaccination even more important than ever. As in the prior years, Montefiore will be offering flu vaccination to all patients and associates to protect the Bronx community, where the health system is headquartered.This year, all flu vaccines are quadrivalent and are available in a number of formulations including egg-free formulation for persons with severe egg allergies, and high dose vaccine for persons over the age of 65. In addition, flu and COVID vaccines can be given at the same time, and all COVID vaccination sites will be able to administer flu vaccines, as well. For persons recovering from COVID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends delaying flu vaccination until isolation can be discontinued. Only people who have suffered a severe reaction to influenza vaccination in the past, and some people with a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome, should discuss flu vaccine formulation and safety of vaccination with their doctor.For employees: our flu vaccination program includes traveling flu pods that will be available at Montefiore hospitals and ambulatory sites, as well as centralized vaccination stations.For patients: the flu vaccines will be available at doctor’s offices and community health clinics, and can also be obtained at local pharmacies. Hospitalized patients can receive the flu vaccine, as well.Montefiore is recommending that all persons should continue to wear a mask in accordance with COVID pandemic precautions to protect themselves and those around them from other circulating respiratory viruses, in addition to flu and COVID viruses.As has been the practice in the past, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO ) continue ongoing monitoring of influenza activity, and release their findings in weekly reports. 3,4 As per the most recent report, influenza activity worldwide remains very low at < 10% positivity of tested specimens. In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity also remains at the interseasonal level, with the majority of influenza virus that has been detected worldwide being influenza B. There is currently ongoing reported influenza activity in Southeast Asia, but still at low levels. During the 2020-2021 flu season, regulatory agencies including WHO and local State Departments encouraged or required continued influenza surveillance along with SARS-COV-2 testing, and the US can be expected to resume surveillance as we enter into the traditional flu season time period. Last year, for example, the New York State Department of Health required both flu and COVID testing for all patients being hospitalized for respiratory viral illness. While no similar mandates have yet been released, such co-testing would be prudent this year, as well.So, what can we expect for the 2021-2022 influenza season?5 To date, Australia and the southern hemispheres, where flu seasons begin, has minimal or nominal number of influenza cases making season prediction difficult.6 This year in particular there are serious concerns for a severe flu season due to decreased population flu immunity from last year’s absent influenza season. There appears to be masking and social distancing fatigue and relaxation of some of the mitigation practices. This is especially concerning as manifested by the rise of other seasonal and endemic respiratory viruses such as RSV and parainfluenza, especially as these viruses are circulating in significant amounts despite masking and social distancing of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to community circulation of respiratory viruses, with this year’s pattern is also different from previously observed and known seasonality. 7 Worldwide there has been a notable increase in severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in some regions: RSV in South America; and RSV, Parainfluenza and Rhinovirus in the US.What can we do and how can we prepare? The answer to a large part is vaccine. As in prior years, there are a number of vaccine choices available, including inactivated influenza vaccine both as egg-based and cell-culture-based products, adjuvanted vaccine, recombinant flu vaccine product, and intranasal formulation. All flu vaccines are now quadrivalent. A high-dose vaccine is available for persons ≥65, and two doses are recommended for children who had never received flu vaccine. Is it more important than ever for everyone to get vaccinated against flu. A recently published study suggests that due to non-pharmacologic interventions of the COVID pandemic, the population is more susceptible to viral illnesses, and early and widely utilized vaccination (including vaccination of children), is important in reducing susceptible population. 8It is also possible to have flu and COVID at the same time, and although it is unclear how common that is, the possibility of “twindemic” remains a serious concern. Flu and COVID vaccines can be given at the same time, which is great news for persons who haven’t yet gotten their COVID vaccine or those receiving their third dose. As we have learned, vaccination and non-pharmacologic mitigation strategies are our best tools to prevention and protection from both flu and COVID.References1.

Log out Cancel News > Medscape Medical News CDC Says COVID, Flu Vaccines Can Be Co-Administered Michael Vlessides September 16, 2021 When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its latest round of recommendations regarding seasonal influenza vaccines, the document contained one notable update: flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can now be given simultaneously. This change stands in marked contrast to previous recommendations, in which the CDC said that other vaccinations should not be administered within a 2-week window before or after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. "We believe flu vaccination is very important in the context of ongoing COVID-19 activity," said Lisa A. Grohskopf, MD, MPH, medical officer, Influenza Division, CDC, in an interview with Medscape Medical News. "First, as COVID-19 cases continue to increase, our healthcare system is increasingly burdened by caring for COVID-19 patients. While flu activity has been unusually low since March of 2020, we are seeing the return of other common respiratory viruses, so we anticipate that we will experience an annual epidemic of flu this season as we do during most winters. "Substantial flu activity occurring at the same time as COVID-19 activity could overwhelm our healthcare systems," she added. The update was published online on August 27 in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Universal Recommendations Unchanged Grohskopf explained that the current recommendations ― the product of regular meetings of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP's) Influenza Working Group — are intended to guide clinicians in the use of influenza vaccines for the upcoming flu season, from late fall through early spring. Not surprisingly, they recommend routine annual influenza vaccination for all people who are at least 6 months of age and who do not have contraindications. Following such precautions will not only reduce the prevalence of illness caused by influenza but will also reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19, the authors say. In addition, preventing flu and mitigating the severity of its symptoms will likely result in a reduction of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions, which in turn may alleviate stresses on the healthcare system caused by COVID-19. "ACIP and CDC's universal flu vaccine recommendation has not changed," Grohskopf noted. "Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exception. There are some groups of people who are at higher risk of developing severe flu complications, and vaccination is especially important for them. This includes adults 65 years and older, people with certain chronic health conditions (for example, asthma, diabetes, heart disease), pregnant people, and children younger than 5 years old." Several Updates In addition to the timing of COVID-19 vaccinations, the recommendations have other notable updates. First, the composition of flu vaccines has been updated such that all vaccines are now quadrivalent, designed to protect against four flu viruses. Additionally, licensure for the Flucelvax Quadrivalent flu vaccine has changed: the approved age indication for the cell culture–based inactivated vaccine has been increased from age 4 years or older to age 2 years or older. The agency also changed the recommended timing of flu vaccination for some groups of people, including pregnant women in the third trimester, nonpregnant adults, and children who need two doses (ie, those aged 6 months to 8 years who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of at least two doses). The latest recommendations update guidance regarding contraindications and precautions for the use of the Flucevax Quadrivalent and Flublok Quadrivalent vaccines. Co-Administration the Focus The new recommendation regarding co-administration of COVID-19 and flu vaccines dominated the update. Although Grohskopf admitted that there is a paucity of data regarding the safety of co-administration, experience with other vaccine combinations has demonstrated that immune response and potential side effects are generally similar when given alone or with other vaccines. "Based on this prior experience, we do not anticipate any unusual or unexpected safety problems with giving COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines at the same time," she commented. Americans are now free to get both vaccines at the same time, and Grohskopf was quick to point out that persons should not delay in receiving either vaccine. "Ideally," she noted, "people should get their flu vaccines by the end of October. If COVID-19 booster shots are approved by FDA and recommended by ACIP, some Americans will not be eligible for their third dose of COVID-19 vaccine until later. People should go ahead and get their flu shot and then schedule their COVID-19 vaccine at the proper time." Consistent with the CDC recommendations, Andrew Noymer, PhD, did not see any problems with co-administration of the COVID-19 and flu vaccines. "The seasonal flu shot is very well tolerated (has low rates of serious adverse events), as is the COVID shot," commented Noymer, of the Department of Population Health and Disease Prevention at the University of California, Irvine. He was not involved in preparing the CDC recommendations. In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Noymer commented, "People often wonder, can the body handle two vaccines simultaneously? The answer is yes, and we do this all the time. The MMR vaccine given to children is, in fact, a cocktail of three vaccines, and the MMRV is a cocktail of four. So I'm not concerned by dual administration of influenza and COVID vaccines. "In some Platonic-ideal sense, it would be better to do the vaccines 2 weeks apart, because then one can disentangle adverse effects," Noymer added. "But these are rare enough at this point that it doesn't concern me. The reason for the recommendation of both at once is attrition: some people who intend to come back for their second shot wind up just skipping it. Thus, do them both at once." Grohskopf and Noymer have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. Published online August 27, 2021.

An MSOE senior design team is working on making it easier to answer that question by developing an over-the-counter test that will check for both COVID-19 and influenza. Team Argus is comprised of biomolecular engineering seniors Rebekah Bartels, Benjamin Bruckert, Brian Chavez and Steven Imp and advised by Drs. Eryn Hassemer and Gul Afshan, Physics and Chemistry Department. The team was inspired to create a test to provide clarity and keep the community safe. “Our goal for this project is to create a product that can safely, accurately and quickly detect and differentiate COVID-19 from influenza,” explained Bartels. “COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory diseases and can display similar symptoms to each other, even though their severities are much different. Our design hopes to give clarity as to whether someone has one, both or neither of the diseases.” So far, the team has conducted research for their project and will begin testing different subparts of their design to ensure everything works. “In the laboratory we will be performing a series of 10 different tests for our test kit, which will take lots of time and patience to perform. We are doing several adhesion tests to ensure our materials stick to the surface we are using, as well as several tests to ensure our materials bind to each other to give the correct results for each user.” The science behind the dual at-home-test is very similar to at-home pregnancy tests. The COVID/influenza test is saliva based, so users will spit into a vial which will then be transferred to test strips. “If the compound of interest (COVID-19 or the flu) is in the sample, it binds to a colored antibody on the test strip,” said Bartels. “This antibody is carried along the membrane by the sample flow. Another antibody is bound to the membrane that detects the compound of interest. If it is detected, it makes a colored line on the strip that can be seen by the naked eye. The test is easy to use and requires no equipment!” By the end of the academic school year, the team hopes to have a working prototype for their design. They also hope to have data that could be used to optimize the tests. “Although this project is just in its very early stages, we hope that the idea will influence more research towards this type of testing methodology. Our team also hopes to get sponsored by a larger entity that can turn this idea into a product that could be available at every commercial drugstore.” As with any research project, this project will require trial, error and supplies to perform their necessary tests. To fund their project’s costs, Team Argus set up a crowdfunding page with a fundraising goal of $2,500. “The money will be spent on supplies that our team needs to perform necessary tests. These supplies include antibodies, specific proteins and other reagents.” If you would like to learn more about their project or make a donation to help fund their research, visit together.msoe.edu.

Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for PWD, but vaccination rates are suboptimal. The study aimed to increase influenza vaccination rate in people with self-reported diabetes. This study was a prospective, 1:1 randomized controlled trial of a 6-month Digital Diabetes Intervention in U.S. adults with diabetes. The intervention group received monthly messages through an online health platform. The control group received no intervention. Difference in self-reported vaccination rates was tested using multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and comorbidities. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03870997. A total of 10,429 participants reported influenza vaccination status (5158 intervention, mean age (±SD) = 46.8 (11.1), 78.5% female; 5271 control, Mean age (±SD) = 46.7 (11.2), 79.4% female). After a 6-month intervention, 64.2% of the intervention arm reported influenza vaccination, vers us 61.1% in the control arm (diff = 3.1, RR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08], p = 0.0013, number needed to treat = 33 to obtain 1 additional vaccination). Completion of one or more intervention messages was associated with up to an 8% increase in vaccination rate (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.17, 1.38], p < 0.0001). The intervention improved influenza vaccination rates in PWD, suggesting that leveraging new technology to deliver knowledge and information can improve influenza vaccination rates in high-risk populations to reduce public health burden of influenza. Rapid cycle innovation could maximize the effects of these digital interventions in the future with other populations and vaccines.

Preventing viral illnesses such as influenza is truly a global concern, given the potential for transmission in a modern, global culture, with this global risk and impact having been emphasized by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. People with diabetes (PWD), face increased risks from influenza, including poor glycemic control, pneumonia, premature death, acute cardiovascular complications, and hospitalizations3,4,5 which may result in a significant burden to the personal costs of healthcare for PWD. Vaccination remains the most effective primary prevention method against influenza, with effectiveness ranging from 29 to 48%6,7. Vaccination for influenza in PWD is effective in reducing the risk of hospitalizations and mortality3,8, as well as the overall cost of hospitalizations3,7. Influenza vaccination has also been shown to be safe for PWD and does not impact an individual’s ability to engage in daily activities in the days following vaccination5,7,9. However, vaccination rates remain suboptimal, consistently falling under the 70% vaccination rate goal set by national guidelines for all individuals in the United States10. In 2015 in the United States, 61.6% of adults with diabetes received an influenza vaccine11. During 2016–17, national rates of influenza vaccination were approximately 40% in adults without any high risk conditions, and 59.7% for adults with a variety of high risk conditions (including diabetes)12.Therefore there is a need for effective and scalable solutions to increase influenza vaccination rates in PWD. While a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effectiveness of interventions for increasing influenza vaccination rates, many have focused on other age groups or populations13. One prospective digital interventional study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of general messaging and incentives via a health-related smartphone application (app) to increase vaccine uptake in a general Canadian population14, suggesting this kind of intervention could be effective in PWD. A large RCT using digital messaging was also effective in increasing vaccination rates in the general population of adults in the United States15. The use of health information technology (e.g., searching the internet for health information, emailing providers) and even simple electronic reminders delivered via digital patient portals have resulted in increased influenza vaccination rates, suggesting the potential of simple digital solutions16,17. One of the primary reasons PWD report not getting vaccinated is a belief that they are not in a high-risk group, and providing education on the increased risk of negative health outcomes following influenza infection has shown promise in increasing vaccination rates in other populations18. Additional reasons include fear of adverse reactions, difficulties with accessing the vaccine (e.g., time, health center access), or other beliefs surrounding the influenza vaccine (e.g., not effective, transmits the flu)19. Therefore, digital messaging that counters this lack of knowledge and barriers to vaccination could be effective for increasing uptake.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digitally administered intervention to increase influenza vaccine rates for PWD using a decentralized, blinded RCT. The primary endpoint was to examine the difference in self-reported influenza vaccination rates in 2 groups: PWD who received a digital intervention (PWD-I) and PWD who received no intervention (PWD-C). The following exploratory associations were also examined: (a) the impact of engagement with interventions on the influenza vaccination; (b) the impact of the timing of the intervention messages during influenza season on influenza vaccination status; (c) the reported level of influence on getting the influenza vaccine by each intervention message type within the PWD-I group; (d) the level of engagement with each intervention message within the PWD-I group; and (e) the impact of a healthcare worker’s recommendation on getting the influenza vaccine.ResultsParticipant descriptionThe study was launched in September of 2018 and the last participant completed the final survey in April of 2019, with the intent to capture outcomes during the 2018–2019 influenza season in the United States. A CONSORT diagram is included (Fig. 1) as a description of the larger investigation, including information on the 3 cohorts. For the PWD cohort, a total of 31,404 individuals were randomized, resulting in 15,702 in the PWD-I group and 15,702 in the PWD-C group. The PWD-I group consisted of 5158 individuals who completed the mid-study or final survey reporting their influenza vaccination status, and 5271 in the PWD-C group who reported their influenza vaccination status over the same interval. Approximately one-third of participants who were enrolled and randomized reported on the final endpoint. Figure 2 shows the flow of participants through the study, timing of the surveys, and timing of the intervention messages.Fig. 1: CONSORT flow diagram.CONSORT diagram presents the study flow for the larger investigation (NCT03870997).

Demographic variables of age, race/ethnicity, and sex were not different between the two groups, indicating that randomization was successful. The participants were predominantly female, White, and in the middle age range and had high levels of income and education. Hypertension, depression, and high cholesterol were the most commonly reported comorbidities, with a small proportion reporting coronary artery disease. Participants included individuals from 48 of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, United States Armed Forces, and Guam. A total of 101 individuals reported discrepant answers at the 3-month and 6-month questionnaires with regard to vaccination status. The effect size remained unchanged and statistically significant after re-running the primary outcome without these individuals.Table 1 Participant demographics.Full size tablePrimary endpointWith regards to the primary outcome, 3310 (64.2%) of 5158 participants from PWD-I reported flu vaccination, compared with 3220 (61.1%) of 5271 among the PWD-C participants, with an absolute intervention difference of 3.1%. The number needed to treat or message for this effect is 33 people to result in 1 additional influenza vaccination. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, the intervention group was more likely (RR 1.05, 95% CI [1.02, 1.08], p = 0·0013) to get flu vaccination than the control group.Exploratory outcomesGreater rates of engagement measured by larger number of interventions completed was associated with an increased vaccination rate for PWD-I (Fig. 3). Participants in the PWD-I arm who completed at least one digital intervention were more likely to report influenza vaccination (PWD-I: 66.6%; PWD-C: 61.1%, OR 1.27 95% CI [1.17, 1.38], p < 0·0001) than PWD-C. Participants in PWD-I who responded to at least 3 messages had an even greater odds of reporting influenza vaccinations (PWD-I: 69.0%; PWD-C: 61.1%, OR 1.42, 95% CI [1.30, 1.56], p < 0·0001) than PWD-C. Of note, within PWD-I, participants who did not complete any messaging interventions were less likely to report influenza vaccination (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.52, 0.72]) than those who completed interventions.Fig. 3: Vaccination rate per completed interventions for people with diabetes in the intervention group.Depicts the influenza vaccination rate for the PWD-I People with diabetes-intervention group, based upon the number of the intervention messages that were completed during the intervention period with standard error.Full size imageThe impact of timing of the intervention messages during influenza season on influenza vaccination rates within the PWD-I group, compared to the passage of time in the PWD-C group, is shown in the Kaplan–Meir curves in Fig. 4. Participants were asked to score the level of influence each message had on their decision to vaccinate (Fig. 5). Participants within PWD-I did not report differences in the effect of the messaging itself on the decision to vaccinate. Participants reported a mean score ranging between 2.75 to 2.93 for each of the messages. Figure 6 presents the response rates (i.e., number of responses per 100 persons) for each of the 6 different interventions. Each intervention message had a pattern of similar rates of clicks and completions with a much smaller rate of dismissals. Participants were most likely to respond to the first two messages with an overall decline in response rates in later months. Advice given by a healthcare worker to vaccinate had a strong effect on the decision to vaccinate among both control and intervention groups (OR 12.3, 95% CI [10.2, 15]). Participants who reported specific counseling to get influenza vaccination were slightly older than those who did not (44.9 vs 46.7 yrs., OR 1.01, 95% CI [1.01, 1.02], p value <0.001), more likely to have a self-reported cholesterol disorder (33.3 vs 45.1%, OR 1.18 95% CI [1.05, 1.32], p value <0.01).Fig. 4: Time to vaccination in the PWD-I group compared to the PWD-C group.Depicts the vaccination rate over the course of the study using a Kaplan–Meier curve.

Greater rates of engagement with a larger number of interventions were associated with increased vaccination rate, up to 8% for at least 1 or more intervention messages completed compared to the control group. Engagement rates with the intervention were overall high, with completion rates between 17 and 25% across intervention messages, consistent with digital communication industry standards20. The increase in vaccination rate seen in this study is much higher than that previously seen in other general digital interventions for increasing influenza vaccination rates15; it was, however, smaller than that was seen in a prospective interventional study (5% increase) that provided compensation for vaccination14. Although compensation was provided for completion of the interventions, the total compensation was only $0.30 per participant, suggesting that this was not a motivating factor for completing the intervention. The Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrate that from the start of the influenza season in 2018, the steepest rates of influenza vaccination took place in the first two months, with individuals in the PWD-I group being more likely to vaccinate earlier in the influenza season. Divergence between the two groups appeared to occur shortly after the first two months, with the PWD-I group continuing to experience more vaccinations until the fourth month, when both groups started to plateau. Given that the vaccination rates between the intervention and control groups diverged during the later months, the messages in months 3–6 might have had a greater impact on vaccination rates at an earlier date in the flu season. Although not statistically significant in difference, the two messages rated as directionally most influential for getting an influenza shot were in October and November, which were messages that targeted information on “The Flu and Diabetes” and centered around “World Diabetes Day,” respectively, suggesting a synergy could be possible between relevant disease-focused events and intervention deployments. These also provided information that was very specific to the diagnosis of diabetes and the impact of influenza. Results also indicated that people who received the recommendation from a healthcare worker to get vaccinated were vaccinated at greater rates, consistent with prior literature suggesting the importance of the role of the healthcare provider in promoting influenza vaccination19.The analysis found that vaccination rates increased 3.1% in the intervention group compared to controls, but the association of completing the interventions with vaccination rate could be up to 8% for those who completed interventions. The CDC21 estimates that there are 26.8 million individuals with diabetes living in the US. An absolute increase of 3.1% in vaccination rate at a national level could represent approximately 830,000 additional PWD in the United States receiving the influenza vaccination. While there are unique characteristics in the medical and insurance system in the United States that present barriers to influenza vaccination that may not be encountered in countries with universal healthcare, suboptimal vaccination rates are a global concern, and this intervention could have broader generalizability. Strengths of the study include the large and diverse sample of PWD, representing most of the geographic United States with wide age and socioeconomic range. Additionally, a unique strength of a web-based RCT is the ability to blind participants not only to their treatment condition, but to their study participation, providing the opportunity to test how individuals would respond to the intervention in real-world settings. This clinical trial also enrolled participants quickly with high geographic variability, a strength of this decentralized trial format and consistent with other decentralized clinical trials22. As only approximately 33% of the participants completed the mid-point or final survey containing the primary endpoint, these results could be an inaccurate estimate of the true effect of the intervention given missing data. What remains true is that participants who completed 50% or more of intervention messages in the PWD-I cohort had an even higher vaccination rate than those who did not, suggesting that the current results could be an underestimate of the effect measured in this population. While self-report of influenza vaccination has shown good specificity in large populations, the most accurate estimate of vaccination status would result from a combination of self-report and medical claims data23,24. Future research should consider this approach to reduce potential self-report bias.The primary shortcoming of this study is the limited generalizability of the study population which may not represent the entire United States population with diabetes. The majority of participants were female and of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity. They also represented an educated population, with most having a college degree and above average income levels. It is also possible that the Achievement population represents a more digitally connected population, representative of those who seek out digital health resources. While the initial results from evaluating the Digital Diabetes Intervention are promising and demonstrated an effect in this sample, these results are not easily generalizable to a broader population of PWD. This study should serve as a building block for future research. The intervention content would benefit from further development and tailoring to reach individuals from diverse backgrounds effectively. Brewer and colleagues25 highlight the potential of mobile health interventions for improving health outcomes in individuals from diverse backgrounds, demonstrating that more individuals from racial and ethnic minorities use mobile apps and smartphones to access health information than white individuals and are generally receptive to participating in digital health research. Digital interventions have great potential for reducing health disparities if barriers to health equity surrounding internet connectivity and equitable access to hardware are reduced26. While delivered via the Achievement app, the intervention messages within the Digital Diabetes Intervention were built as individual webpages. For dissemination, messages like these could also be sent using hyperlinks via text or even as healthcare medical record portal messages. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the significant reach of digital health technologies, with increased adoption of telehealth services during the pandemic around the world25,27, highlighting the ability of individuals to adapt to changing models of healthcare. Approximately 33–52% of PWD use mobile apps to manage their health28, suggesting that a digital intervention may be especially impactful for PWD, with the increasing prevalence of app-connected continuous glucose monitors and the use of technology for managing diabetes.This study shows that a relatively low-cost digital intervention using information from existing trusted sources is an effective way to increase vaccination rates among individuals with diabetes. Total compensation for the study, had all individuals completed all of the interventions, would have been approximately $4700, and recruitment leveraged an existing community of PWD, a generalizable cost-effective recruitment strategy for connected patient-focused or healthcare organizations. Digital interventions such as this have wider public health implications. A single influenza season costs the United States approximately $3.2 billion in medical costs, $8.0 billion in indirect costs, and $11.2 billion in overall economic burden2. There is also evidence that hospitalization due to influenza is 78% lower in PWD who are vaccinated than in PWD who are not vaccinated3, compared to a 58% lower chance of hospitalization in vaccinated people without diabetes. This suggests that high healthcare costs from hospitalization due to influenza are likely to impact this high-risk population of PWD disproportionately and could be reduced by vaccination. Further analyses should be conducted to understand how to maximize the cost-effectiveness of a digital intervention, compared to traditional in-person interventions. It would also be beneficial to evaluate efficacy of a digital intervention in increasing vaccination rates for individuals with other high-risk conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. As the world undergoes the most extensive vaccination campaign in history for the COVID-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of interventions that address hesitancy and misinformation surrounding vaccination is critical given the already high levels of hesitancy and resistance to vaccination29,30. This study supports that personalized and timely digital messages could make a significant difference in the number of people who get vaccinated. Although this intervention was developed with the input of patients via focus groups and expert opinions, the exact mechanisms of action for the intervention messages (i.e., the active ingredients) are unknown. Future research should aim to determine the mechanisms of action for digital interventions, as well as the motivations for initial and sustained engagement in the intervention. Obtaining this knowledge would help to generalize and apply this intervention to other populations to increase the reach of digital interventions for improving influenza vaccination rates.MethodsRecruitment and enrollmentThis decentralized RCT was conducted in the United States using the Achievement platform, an online study platform with more than 3.5 million members (myachievement.com, Evidation Health, Inc., San Mateo, CA) with a research community of users ranging in age from 18 to over 90 years, some with self-reported medical conditions. Achievement members can connect their activity trackers, fitness, and health apps to the platform and members accumulate points that are redeemable for monetary rewards for completing tasks. This study is a part of a larger investigation into the effectiveness of digital interventions for increasing vaccination rates, registered at clinicaltrials.gov, posted 12 March, 2019 (NCT03870997). The larger investigation consists of 3 cohorts, with 2 arms in each cohort (Fig. 1—CONSORT diagram). The 3 cohorts in the larger investigation are: (a) Individuals with self-reported diabetes (PWD cohort in white on Fig. 1), (b) individuals without self-reported diabetes but who are otherwise similar to PWD based on their demographic and activity tracker data (NC-S: normal controls who are similar) and (c) individuals without self-reported diabetes who are not in NC-S, but are similar to PWD with regards to age and gender (NC: normal controls). The focus of this presentation is on the particularly vulnerable population of PWD. Study design and sample size calculations were based upon this cohort. The study was a 6-month RCT, consisting of 2 arms: PWD who received the digital intervention (PWD-I) and PWD who received no intervention, serving as a control (PWD-C). Examples of the interventions are shown in the Supplementary Note 1.Participants were blinded to study participation status, providing a pragmatic trial design that has been advocated for in order to enhance the generalizability and applicability of research conducted involving mobile health technologies31. This study was approved by the ethical committee, Solutions Institutional Review Board (IRB-Little Rock, AR) prior to any participant engagement. It was determined that participants faced no more than minimal risks from the study, as the intervention messages were consistent with current standard of care, and a waiver of informed consent was obtained from the IRB. Participants were informed that their survey responses and behavioral data would be used for research purposes via a Data Usage and Permissions Agreement at the beginning of each survey.For inclusion in the study and allocation to the PWD cohort, participants needed to be at least 18 years of age, have self-reported type 1 or type 2 diabetes designated in their Achievement health profile, and live in the United States. For recruitment, a set of existing Achievement members who met the inclusion criteria were tagged for study inclusion. This constituted the set of study participants; they did not take any active steps to enroll in the study. These study participants were sent offers to receive “points” as compensation for completing surveys and study tasks, which is a routine component of participating in the Achievement platform. Total compensation for completing study surveys was the equivalent of $0.90, and total compensation for interacting with the six monthly Diabetes Digital Interventions was the equivalent of $0.30. Participants were randomized to the intervention (PWD-I) or control (PWD-C) arm prior to receiving any study offers using stratified randomization based upon sex and age as covariates with simple random sampling based upon an a priori list of participants. Due to the web-based nature of the study, blinding by investigator was not necessary as the messages and study experience were determined prior to enrollment in the trial, with the messages dispatched on predetermined dates without any additional investigator interaction. Participants were blinded not only to their intervention or control arm status, but also to the fact that they were enrolled in a study, a factor that is unique to a web-based RCT. Due to the study design and IRB determination that the study posed no more than minimal risk, information on adverse events was not solicited and none were spontaneously reported.MeasuresParticipants were sent an online baseline questionnaire, a mid-study assessment at three months, and a final assessment at six months. Due to the study design, participants could complete any or all assessments; completion of mid-study and final assessment was not predicated on completion of the baseline assessment. The primary endpoint of influenza vaccination status was collected in the three- and/or six-month questionnaires. Questions on demographics, influenza vaccination status, and healthcare worker recommendation were asked of all participants. Participants in the PWD-I cohort were additionally asked about their perceptions of the interventions, and their engagement with intervention tasks was assessed.A demographic questionnaire was administered at baseline, three and six months to all participants. Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were collected in all three questionnaires. Participants were able to “select all” for race/ethnicity and comorbidities. Information on medical comorbidities, income, and education was collected only in the three- and six-month questionnaires. For assessing influenza vaccination status, all participants were asked, “Did you get vaccinated against the flu (sometimes called getting a flu shot) this season? This year’s flu season began in September 2018,” and responded with Yes/No. Self-reported influenza vaccination status has been shown to have good specificity and positive predictive value23,24. Influenza vaccination status was collected both at mid-study and end of study to minimize recall bias. Participants were also asked for the approximate date on which they received their influenza vaccine. All participants were asked in the final survey “Have any of your healthcare providers recommended that you get a flu shot?” and asked to indicate Yes/No. The PWD-I cohort was also asked about their perceptions of the interventions and how much each message-type influenced whether they got their flu shot, rating each message from 1—“not influential at all” to 5—“very influential.” For each intervention, engagement statistics were tracked for the PWD-I participants who (a) clicked to open the digital intervention, (b) continued to complete the call to action or (c) explicitly dismissed it.Intervention contentEach of the six monthly messages was structured in two parts: educational content, and a call to action for the participant to complete (Table 2). Education and recommendations provided in the intervention were based upon data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), thus reflecting the current standard of care recommendations for PWD. Content was reviewed by an expert advisory board and focus group of PWD. Messages were communicated via the Achievement app using month-specific messages, for example occurring around World Diabetes Day in November and National Heart Month in February. Calls to action would award points to the participant for completing actions such as needing to find the nearest clinic offering flu shots (CDC Flu Finder Widget) or planning prompts32, which have been shown to be effective at increasing influenza vaccination33. Incentives (via Achievement points) were provided upon the completion of the call to action as described.Table 2 Description of intervention messages.Full size tableSample size calculations and analytical planFor sample size determination, we estimated a 2.7% increase in vaccination rate between the PWD-I and PWD-C groups. This value was selected to be consistent with prior research and clinically meaningful14,15. Power analysis indicated the need for an analysis set of 4043 individuals in each arm of the study (total N = 8086) to achieve 80% power to detect a 2.7% increase in vaccination rate with a type I error rate of 0.0534. To account for potential non-response to study surveys, we tagged 31,404 PWD for study inclusion, with 15,702 randomized to each of the two arms (~25% assumed response rate).Logistic regression models were used to compare self-reported vaccination rates in both study arms (PWD-I versus PWD-C) controlling for demographics (i.e., age, sex, and race/ethnicity) and comorbid conditions, to calculate the relative risk and absolute risk change using intent to treat analyses. Per protocol analyses were used on all other analyses. Kaplan–Meier plots were constructed to evaluate self-reported time-to-vaccination for the two arms. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the effect of the number of completed interventions and recommendations given by health care workers on vaccination rates, controlling for demographics and comorbid conditions. Significance is reported at a type I error rate of 0.05, with a type II error rate of 0.20.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

FluWatchers: Evaluation of a crowdsourced influenza-like illness surveillance application for Canadian influenza seasons 2015–2016 to 2018–2019. Can Commun Dis Rep 2021;47(9):357–63. https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i09a02 Keywords: influenza, seasonal, digital participatory surveillance, crowdsourced, Canada, FluWatchers, syndromic, influenza-like illness (ILI) Abstract Background: Sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is an essential component of a comprehensive influenza surveillance program. Community-based ILI surveillance systems that rely solely on sentinel healthcare practices omit important segments of the population, including those who do not seek medical care. Participatory surveillance, which relies on community participation in surveillance, may address some limitations of traditional ILI systems.Objective: We aimed to evaluate FluWatchers, a crowdsourced ILI application developed to complement and complete ILI surveillance in Canada. Methods: Using established frameworks for surveillance evaluations, we assessed the acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness of the FluWatchers system 2015–2016, through 2018–2019. Evaluation indicators were compared against national surveillance indicators of ILI and of laboratory confirmed respiratory virus infections.Results: The acceptability of FluWatchers was demonstrated by growth of 50%–100% in season-over-season participation, and a consistent season-over-season retention of 80%. Reliability was greater for FluWatchers than for our traditional ILI system, although both systems had week-over-week fluctuations in the number of participants responding. FluWatchers' ILI rates had moderate correlation with weekly influenza laboratory detection rates and other winter seasonal respiratory virus detections including respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal coronaviruses. Finally, FluWatchers has demonstrated its usefulness as a source of core FluWatch surveillance information and has the potential to fill data gaps in current programs for influenza surveillance and control.Conclusion: FluWatchers is an example of an innovative digital participatory surveillance program that was created to address limitations of traditional ILI surveillance in Canada. It fulfills the surveillance system evaluation criteria of acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness. Introduction FluWatch is Canada's national seasonal influenza surveillance program and consists of a network of laboratories, hospitals, physician offices, provincial and territorial ministries of health and CanadiansFootnote 1. FluWatch consists of seven surveillance components (geographical spread, laboratory confirmed detections, syndromic influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, outbreak surveillance, severe outcome surveillance, strain characterization and antiviral resistance testing and vaccine monitoring) that work together to allow FluWatch to meet three main program objectives (detect, inform and enable). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the global standards for the collection, reporting and analysis of seasonal influenza surveillance data and provides a framework for influenza surveillance for member statesFootnote 2. While the WHO does not mandate the exact surveillance components that every surveillance system must contain, it does recommend the inclusion of community-based surveillance of ILI as part of a comprehensive influenza surveillance systemFootnote 2. Developed in 1996, the Sentinel Practitioner ILI Reporting System (SPIR) is the primary source for ILI surveillance data for the Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) FluWatch programFootnote 1. The SPIR consists of outpatient influenza data submitted by primary care practitioners or registered nurses. There are, however, three major limitations to SPIR: it is reliant on voluntary reporting from a convenience sample of volunteer sentinel physicians or registered nurses; only data from individuals who seek medical attention are captured; and data submission is highly manual and interrupts practitioner workflow. A growing trend is the use of hybrid surveillance systems that use digital surveillance to complement traditional surveillanceFootnote 3. One popular digital surveillance trend is participatory surveillance or crowdsourced surveillance. Participatory surveillance systems rely on volunteer members of the community to regularly share and report health information via the internet for disease surveillanceFootnote 3Footnote 4. Relying on volunteers address various limitations of traditional ILI surveillance systems, such as reporting delays, low participation and exclusion of individuals who do not seek medical care. The need to address the limitations of SPIR and the advantages presented by participatory surveillance prompted the FluWatch program to create FluWatchers, an online participatory syndromic surveillance platform to help improve and complement ILI surveillance in Canada. The FluWatchers system was developed on the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) platform, an established PHAC initiative developed and managed by the National Microbiology LaboratoryFootnote 5. The CNPHI is a purpose-built scientific public health informatics and biosurveillance platformFootnote 6. Its infrastructure provides a secure, reliable and robust technical environment to facilitate and promote multi-jurisdictional collaboration, supporting the cross-domain and cross-discipline exchange of information, ideas and intelligence. The CNPHI was a natural choice to help develop the FluWatchers program, administer the weekly questionnaire and manage the data. FluWatchers' participants complete a brief, weekly symptom-based report via an anonymous online questionnaire that asks whether the participant, and/or registered household members, have had a cough and/or fever in the past week and their influenza immunization status. Data on other symptoms, absenteeism and healthcare utilization are also collected from individuals reporting cough and fever. The weekly questionnaire is typically administered from October through May. The objective of the present study is to present a formal evaluation of the FluWatchers program against four surveillance metrics that were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Framework for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems for Early Detection of OutbreaksFootnote 7: Acceptability—Are Canadians willing to participate in FluWatchers? Reliability—Are participants providing data consistently? Accuracy—How well does the FluWatchers data track influenza patterns in Canada? Usefulness—Is FluWatchers adding value to the FluWatch program? Methods Data FluWatch Sentinel Practitioner Influenza-like Illness Reporting System The SPIR program consists of sentinel practitioners who report the total number of patient visits and the number of patient visits presenting with ILI on a weekly basis. Influenza-like illness is defined as a sudden onset of fever and cough and with one or more of the following: sore throat, joint pain, muscle aches, fatigue, which could be due to the influenza virusFootnote 1. The weekly percentage of visits for ILI is defined as the number of patient visits to healthcare providers presenting with ILI symptoms in a given week divided by the total number of weekly patient visits to healthcare providers as a whole for that same week. Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System The Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance System (RVDSS) is FluWatch's primary source for laboratory-based data on influenza and other seasonal respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirushinovirus, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV])Footnote 8. The RVDSS collects weekly data from provincial, regional and some hospital labs across Canada. Laboratories report on the number of tests performed and the number of tests positive for influenza and other respiratory viruses. The weekly percentage of tests positive for influenza and all other respiratory viruses were used for this analysis. The weekly percentage of tests positive is defined as the number of positive tests for a given virus in a given week divided by the number of tests performed for a given virus for that same week. FluWatchers FluWatchers data consist of self-reported weekly episodes of cough and/or fever. For any participant reporting cough and fever, data on other symptoms experienced, absenteeism and healthcare utilization are collected. For the FluWatchers program, ILI is defined as a report of fever and cough. The weekly percentage of FluWatchers reporting ILI is defined as the number of reports of cough and fever in a given week divided by the total number reports received by participants for that same week. Measures The four evaluation components were assessed as outlined in Table 1. Table 1: Evaluation framework, indicators and calculations used to evaluate the FluWatchers surveillance program Evaluation component Indicator Estimation method/calculation Acceptability Participation rate Median number of weekly participants for a given season Average weekly response rate Retention rate Number of baseline participants who participated in the subsequent season Reliability Proportion of registrants who report in a given week Percentage of weeks within ±5%, ±10% or ±15% of the median number of weekly participants Accuracy Association between FluWatchers data compared with ILI and laboratory data Pearson correlation for FluWatchers data and the weekly percentage of tests for influenza, other respiratory viruses and the SPIR data Usefulness Contribution to detection of cases and the program's impact and value-added applications Qualitative assessment of other applications and the additional data variables Table 1 footnote Table 1 - abbreviation Abbreviations: ILI, influenza-like illness; SPIR, Sentinel Practitioner Influenza-like Illness Reporting Analysis Analyses used data from epidemiological weeks 44 to 18 in the pilot 2015–2016 season, weeks 41 to 18 in 2016–2017 and weeks 40 to 18 in 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 to correspond to the weeks when the FluWatchers surveillance program was active. Analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 and Excel 2016. Results Acceptability The number of FluWatchers participants increased from a weekly median of 500 participants in season 2015–2016 to just over 3,200 participants in season 2018–2019 (Figure 1). This represents a percent increase of 98% (from seasons 2015–2016 to 2016–2017), 112% (from 2016–2017 to 2017–2018) and 52% (from 2017–2018 to 2018–2019).

The median number of participants also increased from 398 in 2015–2016 to 2,188 in 2018–2019. The average weekly response rate was 78% in 2015–2016, 78% in 2016–2017, 74% in 2017–2018 and 74% in 2018–2019. Reliability Across four seasons, FluWatchers was consistently more reliable than SPIR (i.e. the denominator was more consistent week to week). The percentage of weeks where the denominator (number of weekly FluWatcher participants) was found to be within ±5% of a season median ranged from 55%–64% (Table 2). This range is higher than the denominator (weekly number of patients seen) reported by SPIR sentinels, where only 26%–41% of reporting weeks were within ±5% of a respective season median. The percentage of weeks where the denominator was within ±10% or ±15% of a respective season median was always higher in the FluWatchers data. In the season 2018–2019 (Figure 2), the percentage of weeks where the denominator was found to be within ±5% of a season median was 65% in the FluWatchers data compared with 26% in the SPIR data.

As a validation measure, the weekly percentage of visits for ILI was compared with the percentage of tests positive for influenza. During the four seasons, the correlation was variable between SPIR ILI and laboratory data, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.858, 0.685, 0.738 and 0.501 in seasons 2015–2016, 2016–2017, 2017–2018 and 2018–2019, respectively, all with statistically significant p values.

These data include healthcare utilization, laboratory testing, vaccination status, absenteeism and demographic information such as age, gender, regular contact with patients and location (first three characters of a postal code—forward sortation area). Additionally, the FluWatchers program collected surveillance data from individuals who did not seek medical care or get tested. A more detailed analysis on healthcare utilization, vaccination status and absenteeism within the FluWatchers population can be found in the publication by Desroches et al. in this issueFootnote 9. Discussion Our analyses show that the FluWatchers program fulfills the four surveillance evaluation areas assessed. Acceptability—Canadians are willing to participate in FluWatchers, as reflected by an increase in uptake over the four seasons and a high retention rate. In its fourth year of surveillance, the number of participants was comparable to that seen in mature participatory ILI surveillance systems, some of which have been established as early as 2005 and in countries with populations larger than CanadaFootnote 10Footnote 11. Some programs from countries with smaller populations than Canada, such as the Flutracking in Australia and the De Grote Griepmeting system in Belgium and the Netherlands, have between 15,000 and 50,000 registered users. The United States’ Flu Near You has over 50,000 users from a national population of over 327 millionFootnote 10Footnote 11. FluWatchers is still a small and relatively new program and has the potential to attract and retain more participants. Reliability—FluWatcher participants have been consistently providing data. The percentage of weeks where the number of FluWatcher participants (denominator) was within either ±5%, ±10% or ±15% from the season median was always higher than that of the SPIR system. Influenza season in Canada often peaks around Christmas and New Years (late December, early January), when data providers such as practitioners and laboratories may be at reduced capacities. This affects the timing and the quality of data around peak influenza season. FluWatchers participation consistently dropped in late December and early January; however, the drop was not as drastic as that seen for SPIR participants. Receiving consistent and reliable data is important in surveillance to interpret trends. Accuracy—The FluWatchers data appeared to track influenza in Canada with a moderate to strong positive correlation to our main influenza activity indicator, the percentage of laboratory tests positive for influenza. The timing of the peaks suggest that FluWatchers ILI data peaks before the influenza laboratory data. This is not unexpected because one of the aims of syndromic surveillance is to identify an increase illness activity before formal diagnoses are confirmed and reported to public health agenciesFootnote 12. The observed moderate to strong positive correlation between the FluWatchers data and seasonal coronavirus and RSV in all seasons (except the 2015–2016 season) and the weak or negative correlation with adenovirus, enterovirushinovirus, hMPV and parainfluenza is also not unexpected. Seasonal coronavirus and RSV often circulate at the same time as influenza in Canada, while viruses such as enterovirushinovirus often circulate outside the FluWatchers surveillance seasonFootnote 8. The FluWatchers’ ILI case definition of cough and fever could identify activity of other respiratory viruses such as RSV and seasonal coronavirus. Since FluWatchers collects data on other symptoms, the FluWatchers case definition for ILI could be tailored to be more specific to influenza. Usefulness—FluWatchers added value to the FluWatch surveillance program by filling gaps in data that is either not collected by PHAC or not available in a timely manner. Traditional surveillance programs within FluWatch typically capture the “tip of the iceberg” of influenza cases in Canada since only reports of positive laboratory confirmed cases are collected. FluWatchers may give us a better idea about the burden of influenza in Canada by capturing cases who did not seek medical attention or get tested for influenza, and by providing data on absenteeism and healthcare utilization. Additionally, the FluWatchers data can be used to inform work on initiatives such as the WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment (PISA)Footnote 13. For example, “impact” is one of PISA’s three main indicators, where school and work absenteeism due to influenza is recommended as a measurement of how an influenza epidemic affects society. Currently, data on the impact indicator is not currently available for Canada, and FluWatchers could potentially fill this gap with the weekly absenteeism data it collects. Strengths and limitations FluWatchers does have its limitations. The FluWatchers population differs from the Canadian population as seen in the 2016 Canadian Census: FluWatchers participants, while coming from all provinces and territories, from urban and rural settings, and all age groups, genders and influenza vaccine acceptance, under-represent the tails of Canada’s age distribution and over-represent females, urban-dwelling Canadians and those who engage in health promoting behaviors as indicated by high influenza vaccine coverageFootnote 9. This is not unique to Canada as other participatory surveillance systems around the world experience the same limitations but are still able demonstrate similar trends as traditional ILI sourcesFootnote 3Footnote 4Footnote 14Footnote 15. Despite this limitation, the FluWatchers data demonstrated positive attributes of other participatory surveillance systems, such as accuracy and sensitivity and being able to measure burden of illnessFootnote 4Footnote 15. While the data provided by FluWatchers was comprehensive, further exploration of the data must be done and biases need to be quantified before using the data for other purposes than that of surveillance for ILI. The FluWatchers program is still in its infancy and public health practitioners can work towards using these data for other purposes, such as estimating vaccination coverage and effectiveness, informing disease transmission models, and supplying information for cost-benefit analyses of public health measures such as vaccination, as has been done by similar programs in other countriesFootnote 4. Conclusion FluWatchers is an example of an effective and innovative surveillance program that was created to address limitations of traditional ILI surveillance in Canada. Currently, FluWatchers ILI rates are a formal indicator under syndromic surveillance and have been incorporated into Canada’s weekly FluWatch report.

Covid-19.Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), here's what you should know about the flu.What is influenza?Influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and in some cases the lungs.This virus can cause mild or severe illness and can sometimes lead to death. The best way to prevent and protect yourself from the flu is to get vaccinated every year. Your essential guide to Health and Medicaid in North Carolina Newsletter Health Subscribe to our newsletter!

Subscribe here What are the sflu symptoms?Influenza can cause mild or severe illness and can sometimes lead to death.It is a illness other than a cold. It usually starts suddenly. People with the flu sometimes feel some or all of these symptoms:Fever or feeling feverish/chills* Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) Vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children than adults.* It is important to clarify that not all people with influenza will have a fever. How is it transmitted?Most experts believe that flu viruses are spread primarily through small droplets produced when people with the flu cough, sneeze, or talk.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. Rarely, a person can get the flu if they touch a surface or object contaminated with the flu virus and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes.¿How to prevent seasonal flu?The first and most important measure in prevention is to get vaccinated every year.The vaccine has been shown to reduce the occurrence of related diseases and the risk of serious complications from this disease that can lead to hospitalization or even death.Preventive measures in influenza season:Avoid contact with sick people Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing Wash your hands frequently to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses.¿Which people presentan high risk of contracting seasonal flu? People 65 years of age and older People of any age with certain chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, or heart disease Pregnant women Girls and boys under five years old.It is important to know that anyone can get the flu, including healthy people. Serious health problems from the flu can occur at any age; However, some people are at high risk for serious complications from the flu if they get sick.Authorities report the first death due to flu in a child in North Carolina¿CuThese are the ccomplications due to influenza?Complications can include: bacterial pneumonia Ear infections Sinusitis Worsening of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. How many people get sick from the flu each year?A 2018 CDC study looked at the percentage of the U.S. population that got the flu using two different methods and compared the findings.Both methods yielded similar results suggesting that, on average, about 8% of the U.S. population contracts it each season, with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season.Why does the 3% to 11% estimate differ from the 5% to 20% range cited above?The commonly cited 5% to 20% estimate was based on a study that looked at symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, meaning it also included people who may have had the flu but never found out because they had no symptoms.The range of 3% to 11% is an estimate of the proportion of people who have symptomatic influenza illness.Who is more likely to get the flu?The same study found that children are the most likely to get sick and that people 65 years of age and older are the least likely to get the flu.The average incidence (or attack rate) values ​​by age group were 9,3% for children aged 0-17 years, 8,8% for adults aged 18-64 years, and 3,9% for adults aged 65 years. age onwards.This means that children under 18 years of age are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic influenza virus infection as adults 65 years of age and older.📌 Health authorities urge people to get vaccinated against influenzaHow is the seasonal incidence estimated?Influenza virus infection is so common that only the number of people infected each season can be estimated.These statistical estimates are based on flu hospitalization rates calculated by the CDC, which are adjusted to make an estimate of the total number of cases of flu infections in the United States during a given season.Estimates for the number of infection cases are then divided by the demographic census to estimate the seasonal incidence or attack rate.Does seasonal incidence change depending on the severity of the season?Yes. The proportion of people who get the flu varies. A study published in CID revealed that between 3% and 11% of the US population contracts the infection and manifests symptoms each year.The estimate of 3% arises from the 2011-2012 season, in which the H1N1 virus classified as low severity predominated.The estimated incidence over two seasons was approximately 11%; In the 2012-2013 season, the H3N2 virus classified as moderate severity predominated, while in the 2014-2015 influenza season, the H3N2 virus classified as very severe predominated.Contagion periodYou can spread the flu to another person before you know you are sick, and also while you are sick.People with influenza are most contagious in the first three to four days after illness onset. Some healthy adults can infect others from one day before before symptoms appear and up to five to seven days después of contracting the disease. Some people, especially children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for a longer time.How long does it take for symptoms to appear?The time from a person's exposure to the influenza virus to the onset of symptoms is about two days, but can range from one to four days.What to do if you suspect you have influenza?Consult your doctor immediately. There are different antiviral treatments that have been shown to be effective in combating the influenza virus. The earlier you have a medical diagnosis and begin treatment, the less likely you are to suffer complications.With information from the CDC.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), here's what you need to know about the flu. What is influenza? Influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and in some cases the lungs. This virus can cause mild to severe illness and sometimes death. The best way to prevent and protect yourself from influenza is to get vaccinated every year. Public Health Insurance Programs in North Carolina. Find out which ones there are here . What are the symptoms of influenza ? Influenza can cause mild to severe illness and can sometimes lead to death. It is a different illness than the cold . It usually starts suddenly. People with influenza sometimes experience some or all of these symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish/chills* Cough Sore throat Nasal discharge or congestion Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) Vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children than in adults. * It is important to clarify that not all people with influenza will have fever. How is it transmitted? Most experts believe that influenza viruses are spread primarily through droplets produced when people with influenza cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. Although rare, a person can get the flu by touching a surface or object contaminated with the flu virus and then touching his or her mouth, nose, or eyes. How to prevent seasonal influenza ? The first and most important measure in prevention is to get vaccinated every year. The vaccine has been shown to reduce the occurrence of related diseases and the risk of serious complications from the disease that can lead to hospitalization or even death. Preventive measures during flu season: Avoid contact with sick people Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing Wash your hands frequently to help decrease the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses. Who is at high risk for seasonal influenza? People aged 2 years and older People of any age with certain chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes or heart disease Pregnant women Girls and boys under five years old. It is important to know that anyone can get the flu, including healthy people. Los problemas de salud graves a causa de la influenza pueden surgir a cualquier edad; sin embargo, algunas personas tienen elevado riesgo de presentar complicaciones graves por la influenza si se enferman.</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /> <p>Autoridades reportan la <a href="https://enlacelatinonc.org/autoridades-de-carolina-del-norte-anuncian-la-primera-muerte-de-un-nino-por-influenza/">primera muerte</a> por influenza de un niño en Carolina del Norte</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" /> <h2>¿<strong>Cu</strong>áles son las c<strong>omplicaciones por influenza</strong>?</h2> <p>Las complicaciones pueden incluir:</p> <ol> <li> neumonía bacteriana</li> <li>Infecciones del oído</li> <li>Sinusitis</li> <li> Agravamiento de las afecciones crónicas, como insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, asma o diabetes.</li> </ol> <h2><a></a><a></a> <strong>¿Cuántas personas se enferman a causa de la influenza cada año?</strong></h2> <p>Un estudio de los CDC en 2018 analizó el porcentaje de la población estadounidense que contrajo la influenza mediante dos métodos diferentes y comparó los hallazgos.</p> <p>Ambos métodos arrojaron resultados similares que sugirieron que, en promedio, cerca del 8% de la población estadounidense la contrae cada temporada, con un rango de entre el 3% y el 11%, según la temporada.</p> <h2><strong>¿Por qué la estimación del 3% al 11% difiere del rango del 5% al 20% citado antes?</strong></h2> <p>La estimación del 5% al 20% que se cita comúnmente tenía base en un estudio que analizó la enfermedad sintomática y asintomática, lo que significa que también incluyó a personas que pudieron haber tenido influenza pero que jamás se enteraron porque no manifestaron síntomas.</p> <p>El rango del 3% al 11% es una estimación de la proporción de personas que tienen la enfermedad sintomática de la influenza.</p> <h2><strong>¿Quiénes son más propensos a contraer la influenza?</strong></h2> <p>El mismo estudio descubrió que los niños son los más propensos a enfermarse y que las personas de 65 años de edad en adelante son las menos propensas a contraer la influenza.</p> <p>Los valores de incidencia promedio (o índice de ataque) por grupo etario fueron del 9,3% para niños de 0-17 años, 8,8% para adultos de 18-64 años y 3,9% para adultos de 65 años de edad en adelante.</p> <p class="has-text-align-left">Es decir que los niños menores de 18 años tienen más del doble de probabilidades de desarrollar una infección sintomática por el virus de la influenza que los adultos de 65 años en adelante.</p> <p>📌 <a href="https://enlacelatinonc.org/autoridades-sanitarias-instan-a-vacunarse-contra-la-influenza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Autoridades sanitarias instan a vacunarse contra la influenza</a></p> <h2><strong>¿Cómo se estima la incidencia estacional?</strong></h2> <p>La infección por el virus de la influenza es tan común que solo puede estimarse la cantidad de personas infectadas cada temporada.</p> <p>Estas estimaciones estadísticas tienen base en las tasas de hospitalización por la influenza calculadas por los CDC,&nbsp;que se ajustan para hacer una estimación de la cantidad total de casos de infecciones por el virus en Estados Unidos durante una determinada temporada.</p> <p>Las estimaciones para la cantidad de casos de infección luego son divididas por el censo demográfico para estimar la incidencia estacional o el índice de ataque.</p> <h2><strong>¿La incidencia estacional cambia según la gravedad de la temporada?</strong></h2> <p>Sí. The proportion of people who get influenza varies. A study published in CID found that between 3% and 11% of the US population becomes infected and develops symptoms each year. The 3% estimate comes from the 2011-2012 season, when the H1N1 virus, classified as mild, predominated. The estimated incidence over two seasons was approximately 11%; in the 2012-2013 season, the H3N2 virus classified as moderate severity predominated, while in the 2014-2015 influenza season, the H3N2 virus classified as very severe predominated. Period of contagion You can spread the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, or even while you are sick. People with influenza are most contagious in the first three to four days after the onset of illness. Some healthy adults can infect others from one day before symptoms appear and up to five to seven days after becoming ill. Some people, especially children and people with weakened immune systems, may be contagious for a longer period of time. How long does it take for symptoms to appear? The time from a person's exposure to the influenza virus to the onset of symptoms is about two days, but can range from one to four days. What to do if you suspect you have influenza? Consult your doctor immediately. There are different antiviral treatments that have proven effective in combating the influenza virus.

(Pexels: Andrea Piacquadio)abc.net.auews/queensland-what-happened-to-the-flu-in-2021/100456616Link copiedShareShare articleIf you have been thinking the flu has virtually disappeared from our lives, you are not wrong.Key points:Experts say we have never, and probably will never see such low cases of the flu againResearchers say the flu will return when international borders reopen, but how severe is unknownDoctors say the flu vaccine is still our best protection against a future outbreakBefore COVID-19 arrived, the number of influenza cases was reaching some of its highest levels, with 313,033 notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza across Australia in 2019 — 2.7 times higher than the five-year average — and 953 deaths.In 2020, there were more than 20,000 notifications to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and 37 deaths.This year, to August 29, just 484 cases were recorded and zero deaths.Perhaps surprisingly, almost half of those were in Queensland, with 235 cases, but experts do not have an answer as to why.Victoria recorded just 75 cases, New South Wales recorded 61 and the next highest was just 31 in the Northern Territory.WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza's deputy director, Professor Ian Barr, said the majority of the cases were detected in quarantine, coming in from overseas, particularly from India."They have been having ongoing influenza circulation for the last three or four months," he said."It's not surprising we're picking up a few coming from quarantine."Mal Grieg, from the Windsor Bowls Club, says no-one talks about the flu anymore. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)Mal Greig is the treasurer of the Windsor Bowls Club — a place normally impacted by severe influenza seasons — and said the flu was a "non-existent issue" this year."The flu used to impact the club and attendances at the club quite dramatically," Mr Greig said.Now, he said, it was not even spoken about.What happened to the flu?Professor Barr said Australia was in "uncharted territory"."The whole influenza world is topsy-turvy at the moment," he said."This is the time we should be seeing not a few hundred, a few thousands cases per state, with tens of thousands of cases overall throughout Australia."We've never seen figures this low ever before."Social distancing has helped reduce the circulation of the flu. (ABC News: Dean Faulkner)He said the fewer-than-usual cases was not just a phenomenon of 2021, it had also occurred last year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."As soon as COVID restrictions were enforced, and international borders were closed … last year, we saw a dramatic tail-off in influenza cases," he said.Professor Barr said the closure of schools — normally a "hot bed for influenza activity" — also played a part in the low number of cases."All those measures have contributed to the lack of influenza circulating over the last two years," he said.Dr Kirsty Short says we're not seeing any cases from the northern hemisphere, as we do normally. (Supplied: University of Queensland)University of Queensland virologist Dr Kirsty Short said the main reason behind the low circulation of flu was the closure of international borders."It's been a really incredible situation where we've seen flu basically disappear," she said."So we're not having new flu viruses coming from the Northern Hemisphere into the Southern Hemisphere and then triggering a localised outbreak."It's been a really bizarre situation not to see any flu in our community."MonthFlu cases 2019Flu cases 2020Flu cases 2021Jan6,8296,98255Feb7,1617,17450Mar11,1585,89962Apr18,66730968May30,37223175Jun5,784222473Jul70,15119052Aug60,9641261**Cases for 2021 recorded in Australia until August 9. Source: Immunisation CoalitionOther viruses circulatingIf you've experienced flu-like symptoms this winter, and were not positive with COVID-19, it was possible you had one of a range of other respiratory illnesses.Dr Short said that flu surveillance in Australia was "incredibly good" so it was unlikely there was a surge of undetected flu cases."What we have seen is that the social distancing measures and these hygiene measures, restriction on borders, isn't effective [for] all respiratory viruses," she said."For example, we're seeing rhinovirus — which [causes] the common cold — causing outbreaks and we're also seeing RSV, which is a virus of particular concern in kids."So it's not a universal protection against all respiratory viruses but it has seemed to have had an effect on the flu."Dr Kirsty Short says other respiratory illnesses have still been circulating. (Supplied: University of Queensland)Dr Short said that could simply be because the flu was much more susceptible to being broken down, compared to the much more "heartier" virus of the common cold."So, it could be one possible explanation: that all the measures we're taking to protect ourselves against COVID are working against the flu virus, but they're not working against heartier viruses like the common cold virus."Dr Maria Boulton says GPs have still been busier than ever, due to mental illness from COVID and other respiratory illnesses. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)Brisbane general practitioner Dr Maria Boulton said that, while it had been a noticeably mild flu season, GPs were "busier than ever"."We've seen a lot more presentations with things like mental health issues, there's been a huge spike in that because of the pandemic," she said."And we're also seeing families present with other respiratory viruses [including andenovirus and parainfluenza virus]."Will the flu return?Professor Barr said "it will come back for sure", when international borders reopen."What we don't know is the timing of that and how quarantine is going to open up, whether there's going to be some level of quarantine, home quarantine, or something like that," he said."Which may ameliorate major outbreaks … but I think this is golden times for a lack of influenza. I don't think we'll see these times ever again."Australia's Chief Medical Officer wants people to get the flu injection when it becomes available. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)Dr Short said the concern was that because we have had a few seasons, without the natural boost to our immunity that seasonal flu provides, we will be more susceptible to the virus in the future."So maybe we're going into a severe flu outbreak," she said.Are PCR tests unable to distinguish between the flu and COVID-19?Photo shows A man sits in a red car while a doctor in blue scrubs and face mask puts a small stick in his nose.An exchange between a reporter and Victorian Chief Health Officer at a press conference this week gave rise to a another wave of misinformation regarding the tests Australia uses to detect COVID-19."The optimistic side is because we haven't had much flu circulating, maybe the virus hasn't mutated so much, so that our past vaccines will still provide good protection."The reality is, we don't know and it really could go either way."She said researchers were going to be carefully watching the upcoming winter season in the northern hemisphere, especially with more borders opening and travel occurring compared to last year."It's really difficult to say … but it's definitely something we all need to be watching because the last thing we want is to have a bad flu season after going through everything with COVID."A Brisbane GP clinic says it has still had a strong uptake of the flu vaccine. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)Professor Barr said RSV has been a good lesson in how quickly a virus can reappear.He said it was almost non-existent in 2020 before Sydney experienced a large outbreak in October, followed by another surge in cases in Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland."And they were in summer, which is quite unusual for RSV. Normally it's a very winter-bound disease, so it shows you how quickly these respiratory viruses, which are not there one minute, then they're back the next and they can cause severe outbreaks even in the middle of summer," Professor Barr said.What about the flu vaccine?Professor Barr said there has also been a reduction in flu vaccination uptake this year, with just 33.3 per cent of Australians getting the jab.However, about 80 per cent of those over 65 are vaccinated.About 33 per cent of the community has had the flu vaccination so far this year. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)The low number of cases has made developing new vaccines difficult."Let's just say it's been tricky," Professor Barr said."Normally we have a very good influx on samples from not just Australia, but New Zealand and other surrounding countries so we've been scratching around for samples in the last 18 months."It's an interesting time, because we've never seen the virus under this sort of pressure before."How can we prepare for return of the flu?Professor Barr said many lessons learned from COVID-19 could be applied to influenza."Hopefully we don't have to resort to severe responses," he said."We do have influenza vaccines, and we do have drugs against influenza as well."[Qld local edition teaser]He said things like masks, social distancing and quarantining have obviously impacted circulation of the flu."So there's no reason why we couldn't introduce at least some of those in a severe influenza season," he said.Dr Boulton said she has still seen a strong uptake of the flu vaccine at her clinic, and recommended people keep that in mind for when the flu makes a comeback.Posted Wed 15 Sep 2021 at 7:36pmWednesday 15 Sep 2021 at 7:36pmWed 15 Sep 2021 at 7:36pm, updated Wed 15 Sep 2021 at 11:42pmWednesday 15 Sep 2021 at 11:42pmWed 15 Sep 2021 at 11:42pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

Flu vaccines have been made in the same way for nearly 70 years: based on growing the flu virus in chicken eggs or mammalian cells, which is then inactivated and processed to be made into vaccines.The disadvantage of this approach is there can be much variability in the finished product – the virus can mutate during vaccine production – and the production process must be updated for every new strain.The manufacturing process for the RNA vaccine is also simpler that the current vaccine technology. At research scale, Pfizer estimates RNA vaccine can be made eight days after the sequence of a new flu virus is first known. Pfizer’s mRNA flu vaccine – also in partnership with BioNTech but started in 2018 before the companies’ COVID-19 collaboration – is set to enter human trials this month, said Frank A. D’Amelio, Pfizer CFO and executive VP of global supply, at the Morgan Stanley 19th​ Annual Global Healthcare Conference this week.“Current vaccines for flu provide 40% to 60% protection,”​ said D’Amelio. “And it can be lower than that in vaccine years where there's a poor matching of the strains, right, because it's all about the matching of the strains when it comes to flu. ​“So we think if we can provide a vaccine that provides much more protection, and when we can do more timely manufacturing of the known strains, that combination of that better manufacturing… [and]… strain knowledge manufacturing… we think that could provide much greater protection to patients relative to the flu. ​“So we think there's a significant opportunity here for patients and obviously for ourselves. We expect to begin a first-in-human trial of a quadrivalent flu vaccine by the end of September, by the end of this month."​ModernaModerna, meanwhile, is working on mRNA-1010: a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine targeting WHO recommendations including A H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B Yamagata and Victoria lineages.Last week it announced that a Phase 1/2 study for the candidate is now fully enrolled. The study is assessing three different dose levels of mRNA-1010 in adults ages 18-49 years and above 50 years The company has also set out plans for a new development candidate, mRNA-1073, which would be a combination COVID-19 booster and seasonal flu booster vaccine.Translate BioIn June, Sanofi and Translate Bio (which Sanofi acquired this week) started a Phase 1 clinical trial for their mRNA influenza vaccine.Interim data is expected by the end of 2021.The monovalent flu vaccine candidate codes for the hemagglutinin protein of the A/H3N2 strain of the influenza virus (Sanofi notes that flu seasons dominated by A/H3N2 strain tend to be more severe, especially among those considered at-risk such as older adults and younger children.)Sanofi and Translate Bio have developed and will evaluate two formulations of the vaccine (MRT5400 and MRT5401) in the Phase 1 influenza mRNA vaccine clinical trial. The two formulations differ in the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that contains the mRNA. The US trial will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate in up to 280 participants aged 18-49 years old.The candidate is not far behind their mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate: which started a Phase 1/2 trial in March.Next generation mRNAMeanwhile, CSL business Seqirus is working on a next-generation mRNA vaccine, using self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA). The company is targeting commencement of clinical trials for both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine candidates in the second half of 2022.mRNA vaccines help protect against infectious diseases by giving instructions to cells in the body to create the protein for the immune response to fight. Self-amplifying mRNA - ‘the next generation version of today’s mRNA technology,’ - also instructs the body to replicate mRNA, amplifying the amount of protein made. This could enable vaccine manufacturers to potentially develop more effective vaccines with a smaller dosage and with lower rates of reactogenicity, says Seqirus.

Bennett chose to stay home and seek out tests for additional illnesses while awaiting her COVID-19 test results. Molly Ropelewski/The Hoya | As of Sept. 13, Georgetown University has confirmed 65 cases of Influenza A on the main campus and at the Medical Center. “I decided not to go to classes because I realized that I had been in contact with a friend that has the flu and that could be a possible reason for my sore throat rather than the common cold,” Bennett said in an interview with The Hoya. According to Bennett, the Student Health Center (SHC) turned her away for testing when she reported that she did not have a fever. “After following up with one of the doctors at the Student Health Center, it was advised that I stay home, get rest and not go to classes but not go to get tested for the flu just because they are focusing on patients who are more sick right now,” Bennett said. Now, Bennett has a negative COVID-19 test but is still unclear on why she is feeling sick. Amid increased health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, students are now occupied with a new concern: the flu. As of Sept. 13, Georgetown University has recorded 65 confirmed cases of Influenza A on the main campus and at the Medical Center, according to Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02). Amid the spread of this strain, students reported facing barriers to flu testing and treatment at the SHC. Positive cases can be attributed to the social behaviors of a college campus, according to Mishori. “It is unusual for the flu to spread so early in the season,” Mishori wrote in an email to The Hoya. “But the close proximity, density, and social behaviors of people in college settings are the perfect facilitators for influenza (or any other infectious disease) to spread.” The university has announced free flu vaccine clinics Sept. 19 and Sept. 23 for undergraduate students, according to a Sept. 16 email from Mishori to the Georgetown community. The university will also host a communitywide flu vaccination clinic in October. Dilara Kamrava (COL ’23) expressed similar concerns about the inaccessibility of the SHC. “I started having some really severe flu symptoms, got tested for COVID the same day and was negative,” Kamrava wrote in a GroupMe message to The Hoya. “I tried going through the Health Center to get tested for flu, but they don’t take walk-ins and didn’t have an appointment for the next 10 days.” Kamrava said she eventually scheduled a test through the One Medical app, a primary care provider available to Georgetown community members. As a result, Kamrava said she took a flu test off campus. When asked about the university’s strategies to contain the influenza outbreak, a university spokesperson redirected The Hoya to a Sept. 10 email from Mishori. Viha Vishwanathan (MSB ’24) said she was able to successfully schedule a test through the SHC while experiencing flu-like symptoms. “It was difficult to schedule an appointment by calling the office, since I called a few times and no one answered the phone,” Vishwanathan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am not sure if this was a connectivity issue, or if the office was backlogged. I went to the office to schedule an appointment, and they were able to give me an appointment for the next day.” While students who test positive for the flu or come in close contact with an individual who has tested positive are not required to isolate or quarantine, they should limit in-person activities and wear a mask when around others, according to Mishori. “You should stay home and wear a mask around others if you’ve been infected or have symptoms that can be related to the flu or COVID-19,” Mishori wrote.

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines annually to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Objective: To summarize NACI recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines for 2021–2022 and to highlight new recommendations.Methods: Annual influenza vaccine recommendations are developed by NACI's Influenza Working Group for consideration and approval by NACI. The development of the recommendations is based on the NACI evidence-based process.Results: The following new recommendations were made: 1) Influvac®Tetra may be considered as an option among the standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) offered to adults and children three years of age and older; 2) Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) may be considered an option for individuals 65 years of age and older who are currently recommended to receive Fluzone®High Dose (trivalent); and 3) Flucelvax®Quad may be considered amongst the quadrivalent influenza vaccines offered to adults and children nine years of age and older for annual influenza immunization. Guidance for use of influenza immunizations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is also highlighted.Conclusion: NACI continues to recommend that an age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone six months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine. Vaccination should be offered as a priority to people at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, people capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of complications, and others as indicated. Introduction Seasonal influenza is an infectious viral illness that occurs globally with an annual attack rate estimated at 5%–10% in adults and 20%–30% in childrenFootnote 1. Epidemics of seasonal influenza occur annually in Canada, generally in the late fall and winter months; however, the burden of influenza illness can vary from year to year. Current information on influenza activity globally can be found on the World Health Organization's FluNet websiteFootnote 2 and nationally on the Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) FluWatch websiteFootnote 3. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides PHAC with annual recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, which reflect identified changes in influenza epidemiology, immunization practices and influenza vaccine products authorized and available for use in Canada. The development of the annual influenza vaccine recommendations, which is led by the NACI Influenza Working Group (IWG), involves a thorough review and evaluation of the literature as well as discussion and debate at the scientific and clinical practice levels on a variety of issues, which can include the following: the burden of influenza illness and the target populations for vaccination, efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of influenza vaccines, vaccine schedules, and other aspects of influenza immunization. Issues related to ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability are also systematically examined by NACI for comprehensive development of vaccine guidanceFootnote 4. The objective of this article is to provide a concise summary of NACI's recommendations and supporting information for the 2021–2022 influenza season, including conclusions from reviews of evidence on 1) a new, biosimilar, egg-based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Influvac®Tetra; IIV4-SD), 2) a new quadrivalent, egg-based high dose inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone®High Dose Quadrivalent; IIV4-HD), and 3) a mammalian cell culture-based influenza vaccine (Flucelvax®Quad; IIV4-cc). Complete details can be found on the PHAC website in the NACI Advisory Committee Statement: Canadian Immunization Guide Chapter on Influenza and Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022 (the Statement)Footnote 5 and related publications.

For a more detailed explanation of the strength of NACI recommendations and the grading of evidence refer to Appendix Table A1. A published, peer-reviewed framework and evidence-informed tools (including the Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, and Acceptability Matrix) was applied to ensure that issues related to ethics, equity, feasibility and acceptability were systematically assessed and integrated into guidanceFootnote 4. For the 2021–2022 influenza season, the IWG reviewed evidence regarding the use of two new vaccines: 1) Influvac Tetra, a new biosimilar, egg-based, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine; and 2) Fluzone High Dose (HD) Quadrivalent an egg-based high dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). Influvac Tetra (IIV4-SD) was first authorized for use in Canada in adults in March 2019 and subsequently in children three years of age and older in February 2020. Fluzone High Dose (HD) Quadrivalent was first authorized for use in Canada in adults in June 2020. A trivalent formulation, Fluzone High-Dose, was previously authorized for use in adults 65 years of age and older in Canada, and recommended by NACI, but marketing of the vaccine was discontinued as of February 2021. Following the review and analysis of available pre-licensure clinical trial data and Health Canada's Clinical Review Reports for these two vaccines, the IWG proposed new recommendations for vaccine use to NACI. NACI critically appraised the available evidence and approved the specific recommendations brought forward. Recommendations and supporting evidence on the use of mammalian cell culture-based, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Flucelvax Quad) from the NACI Supplemental Statement - Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza VaccinesFootnote 7 were also incorporated into the Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022. Flucelvax Quad is the first and only available mammalian cell culture-based inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine in Canada; it was first authorized for use in adults and children nine years of age and older on November 22, 2019. The IWG oversaw the completion of a systematic review to inform the development of guidance on the use of Flucelvax Quad (IIV4-cc). Six electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest Public Health and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from inception until February 12, 2019, using a predefined search strategy to identify relevant literature on the efficacy, effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety in adults and children four years of age and older. Registered clinical trials and grey literature from international public health authorities and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups were also considered. Additionally, hand-searching of the reference lists of included articles was performed by one reviewer to identify additional relevant publications. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of records retrieved from the search and eligible full-text articles for inclusion. One reviewer extracted data from eligible studies and appraised the methodological quality of these studies using the criteria outlined by Harris et al.Footnote 8. A second reviewer independently validated the data extraction and quality assessment. A narrative synthesis of the extracted data was performed. NACI provided new recommendations based on assessment of the evidence. Results Use of seasonal influenza vaccine in the presence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) In light of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, PHAC, in consultation with NACI and the Canadian Immunization Committee, has developed the following additional guidance on the delivery of influenza vaccination programs and administration of seasonal influenza vaccine to support provincial and territorial vaccine programs and primary care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic for 2021–2022: Guidance for Influenza Vaccine delivery in the presence of COVID-19Footnote 9 Guidance on the use of seasonal influenza vaccine in the presence of COVID-19Footnote 10 This guidance is based on currently available scientific evidence and expert opinion. The content will be reviewed regularly, and updates will be made as necessary throughout the upcoming influenza season as the public health context evolves and new evidence and policy issues emerge. New egg-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine NACI concluded that Influvac Tetra is safe and has non-inferior immunogenicity to the trivalent Influvac formulation. Therefore, NACI recommended that Influvac Tetra may be considered among the standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) offered to adults and children three years of age and older (Discretionary NACI Recommendation). New egg-based high dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine NACI concluded that Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent is comparably safe and has non-inferior immunogenicity to the previously authorized trivalent Fluzone High Dose formulation. Therefore, NACI has issued the following discretionary individual-level recommendation on the use of Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD): For individuals 65 years of age and older whom are currently recommended to receive Fluzone High Dose (trivalent), NACI recommends that Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) may be considered as an option (Discretionary NACI Recommendation). Recommendations for public health programs remain unchanged at this time. Inclusion of mammalian cell culture-based quadrivalent influenza vaccine The peer-reviewed published evidence on the effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of IIV4-cc manufactured using fully cell-derived viruses was sparse. The systematic review identified four observational studiesFootnote 11Footnote 12Footnote 13Footnote 14 investigating the vaccine effectiveness of IIV4-cc compared with egg-based IIV and two peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials that assessed the immunogenicity and safety of IIV4-cc compared with different IIV3-cc formulations (produced using the same Madin-Darby Canine Kidney [MDCK] cell culture-based manufacturing process). There was evidence indicating that IIV4-cc may be more effective than egg-based IIV3 and IIV4 influenza vaccines against non-laboratory confirmed influenza-related outcomes, including influenza-related health care interactions and influenza-like-illness (ILI). Although some data suggest that IIV4-cc may be more effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) virus infection than egg-based IIV, there was no consistent and statistically significant difference in effectiveness identified for adults or children vaccinated with IIV4-cc compared with egg-based IIV. Two studies that assessed the immunogenicity and safety of IIV4-cc compared with different IIV3-cc formulations (produced by Seqirus using the same MDCK cell culture-based manufacturing process) were identified in this reviewFootnote 15Footnote 16. There was also evidence indicating that IIV4-cc has a comparable immunogenicity and safety profile to egg-based influenza vaccines already licensed in Canada and the trivalent formulation of this cell culture-based influenza vaccine that has been licensed in the United States and Europe, but for which licensure has never been sought in CanadaFootnote 17Footnote 18Footnote 19Footnote 20Footnote 21Footnote 22. Based on assessment of the available pre-licensure and post-market clinical trial and observational data, NACI concluded that IIV-cc is an effective, safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic alternative to conventional egg-based influenza vaccines for children and adults. Therefore, NACI has made the following recommendation, supplementing NACI's overarching recommendation for influenza vaccination, which is available in the NACI Seasonal Influenza Vaccine StatementFootnote 5:NACI recommends that Flucelvax Quad may be considered among the IIV4 offered to adults and children nine years of age and older (Discretionary NACI Recommendation). NACI concludes that there is fair evidence to recommend vaccination of adults and children nine years of age and older with Flucelvax Quad (Grade B Evidence) For complete details of this review, rationale, relevant considerations and additional information supporting this recommendation, refer to the NACI Supplemental Statement: Mammalian Cell Culture-Based Influenza VaccinesFootnote 7. Notably, Flucelvax Quad was recently authorized by Health Canada for use in adults and children two years of age and older. This updated authorized age indication supersedes the information for Flucelvax Quad found in relevant sections within the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccine for 2021–2022Footnote 5. Further details are available in the new product monograph for this vaccineFootnote 23. Summary of National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the 2021–2022 influenza season NACI continues to recommend influenza vaccination to anyone six months and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine. Vaccination should be offered as a priority to people at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, people capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of complications, and others as indicated in List 1. List 1: Groups for whom influenza vaccination is particularly recommended People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization All children 6–59 months of age Adults and children with the following chronic health conditionsFootnote a: Cardiac or pulmonary disorders (includes bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, and asthma) Diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases Cancer, immune compromising conditions (due to underlying disease, therapy, or both, such as solid organ transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) Renal disease Anemia or hemoglobinopathy Neurologic or neurodevelopment conditions (includes neuromuscular, neurovascular, neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental conditions, and seizure disorders [and, for children, includes febrile seizures and isolated developmental delay], but excludes migraines and psychiatric conditions without neurological conditions) Morbid obesity (body mass index of 40 and over) Children six months to 18 years of age undergoing treatment for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid, because of the potential increase of Reye's syndrome associated with influenza All pregnant women People of any age who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Adults 65 years of age and older Indigenous peoples People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Health care and other care providers in facilities and community settings who, through their activities, are capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk Household contacts, both adults and children, of individuals at high risk, whether or not the individual at high risk has been vaccinated: Household contacts of individuals at high risk Household contacts of infants less than six months of age, as these infants are at high risk but cannot receive influenza vaccine Members of a household expecting a newborn during the influenza season Those providing regular child care to children 0–59 months of age, whether in or out of the home Those who provide services within closed or relatively closed settings to people at high risk (e.g. crew on a ship) Others People who provide essential community services People who are in direct contact with poultry infected with avian influenza during culling operations List 1 footnote List 1 footnote a Refer to Immunization of Persons with Chronic Diseases and Immunization of Immunocompromised Persons in Part 3 of the Canadian Immunization Guide for additional information about vaccination of people with chronic diseasesFootnote 24 Return to first List 1 footnote a referrer List 1 - Source Source: List reproduced from NACI Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Statement for 2021–2022Footnote 5 Recommended influenza vaccine options by age group and by dosage and route of administration by age are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Table 2: Recommendations on choice of influenza vaccine type for individual- and public health program-level decision-making by age group Recipient by age group Vaccine types authorized for use Recommendations on choice of influenza vaccine 6–23 months IIV3-SDFootnote a IIV3-Adj IIV4-SD A quadrivalent influenza vaccine licensed for this age group should be used in infants and young children without contraindications, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine. If a quadrivalent vaccine is not available, any of the available trivalent vaccines licensed for this age group should be used. 2–17 yearsFootnote b IIV3-SDFootnote a IIV4-SD IIV4-cc (nine years of age and over) LAIV4 An age appropriate IIV4-SD, LAIV4, or IIV4-cc (IIV4-cc only authorized for nine years of age and older) should be used in children without contraindications, including those with non-immune compromising chronic health conditions, given the burden of influenza B disease in this age group and the potential for lineage mismatch between the predominant circulating strain of influenza B and the strain in a trivalent vaccine. There are currently no IIV4-cc vaccines licensed for children younger than nine years of age. LAIV4 may be given to children with: Stable, non-severe asthma Cystic fibrosis who are not being treated with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. prolonged systemic corticosteroids) Stable HIV infection, if the child is currently being treated with HAART and has adequate immune function LAIV should not be used in children for whom it is contraindicated for, such as those with: Severe asthma (defined as currently on oral or high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing) Medically attended wheezing in the seven days prior to vaccination Current receipt of aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy Immune compromising conditions, with the exception of stable HIV infection, i.e. if the child is treated with HAART (for at least four months) and has adequate immune function LAIV is contraindicated in pregnant adolescents. IIV4-SD or IIV4-ccFootnote c should be used instead. If IIV4-SD, IIV4-ccFootnote c, and LAIV4 are not available, IIV3-SD should be used. 18–59 years IIV3-SDFootnote a IIV4-SD IIV4-cc LAIV4 Any of the available influenza vaccines should be used in adults without contraindications. There is some evidence that IIV may provide better efficacy than LAIV in healthy adults LAIV is not recommended for the following: Pregnant women Adults with any of the chronic health conditions identified in List 1, including immune compromising conditions Healthcare workers 60–64 years IIV3-SDFootnote a IIV4-SD IIV4-cc Any of the available influenza vaccines should be used in those without contraindications. 65 years and olderFootnote d IIV3-SDFootnote a IIV3-Adj IIV3-HDFootnote e IIV4-SD IIV4-cc Individual-level decision-making Public health program-level decision-making IIV-HD should be used over IIV-SD, given the burden of influenza A(H3N2) disease and the good evidence of IIV3-HD providing better protection compared to IIV3-SD in adults 65 years of age and older. Other than a recommendation for using IIV-HD over IIV-SD formulations, NACI has not made comparative individual-level recommendations on the use of the other available vaccines in this age group. In the absence of a specific product, any of the available age appropriate influenza vaccines should be used. Any of the available influenza vaccines should be used. There is insufficient evidence on the incremental value of different influenza vaccines (i.e. cost-effectiveness assessments have not been performed by NACI) to make comparative public health program-level recommendations on the use of the available vaccines.

For the 2021–2022 influenza season, NACI newly recommends that Influvac Tetra and Flucelvax Quad may be considered as options among the quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines offered to adults and children for their annual vaccination. NACI also newly recommends that Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent may be considered as an option for adults 65 years of age and older. In addition, people capable of transmitting to high-risk individuals, people who provide essential community services and people in direct contact during culling operations with poultry infected with avian influenza are particularly recommended to receive the influenza vaccine.

That mounting death count will soon render the COVID-19 pandemic as America’s deadliest. The number of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have already surpassed those from the 1968 flu ( an estimated 100,000). At their current pace, COVID-related deaths will also surpass the 675,000 estimated U.S. deaths caused by the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic—the deadliest in U.S. history—before the end of September. While deaths attributed to COVID-19 are likely to surpass those from the Spanish flu, it doesn’t mean the coronavirus pandemic is the deadlier of the two: On a per capita basis, the Spanish flu pandemic—caused by the H1N1 Influenza A virus—killed a much higher percentage of the nation than COVID-19. In 1920, the U.S. population stood at 106 million, compared with 331.5 million in 2020. Because there was no vaccine or antibiotic treatment for the Spanish flu, there was a higher mortality rate than for COVID-19, affecting, according to the CDC, all age groups over age 5. As the CDC writes: “High mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20–40 year age group, was a unique feature of [the 1918] pandemic.” While COVID-19 will soon become the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history, it won’t come close globally. In fact, it won’t even surpass the 1918 influenza pandemic: Globally, COVID-19 has claimed nearly 4.7 million lives, according to data collected by John Hopkins University, compared with the estimated 50 million killed globally between 1918 and 1919 by the Spanish flu. We should note that death counts for both the 1918 Spanish flu and the 1968 flu pandemic are rough estimates. The lack of data reporting, in particular amid the Spanish flu, makes pinning down the number of fatalities very challenging.

So I'm sure you're going to be wondering soon are the symptoms that you're having-- cough, fever maybe runny nose, is it flu? Is it RSV? Is it COVID? Well, some good news. It's pretty easy to find that out now. And the reason why is because of some new panel tests. So to help provide some insights, I've gone straight to the source. Dr. Brian Caveney is the Chief Medical Officer and President of Labcorp Diagnostics. Brian, thanks for joining me again. It's good to see you. BRIAN CAVENEY So good to be with you Dr. Whyte. And thank you for the great reporting that you've done throughout this pandemic. It's amazing, the number of my physician friends who have said that they routinely watch these videos and read content on the website so that they can stay up-to-date on what the real evidence is saying and what the science is progressing. JOHN WHYTE You and I first talked last year really in the height of the COVID pandemic. And since then, a lot has happened. And I referenced this testing that you all have created at Labcorp. Can you walk us through what it does and what patients should know? BRIAN CAVENEY Sure. So almost a year ago, we were able to get an FDA emergency use authorization for a variety of combination panels to help doctors and other clinicians determine what respiratory pathogen their symptomatic patient may have, including a combination of COVID, of course, as well as influenza A, influenza B, and RSV or respiratory syncytial virus. As we all know, there was virtually no flu season last year because most places were on lockdown, many schools were virtual, people weren't going to work, and so there wasn't much social mixing taking place. But we sure have seen an increase, particularly in RSV over the past couple of months, and we are unfortunately expecting as many schools are back in-person this fall, as people are preparing to do more holiday travel over the coming month or two. There is likely to be a resurgence of influenza as well. So we need to be able to find those. We have a variety of combination tests that are available for doctors to test their patients among those for respiratory pathogens. Now each of them needs to be individually clinically indicated, and that's why we have all of the different combinations. So of course, mainly pediatricians and maybe urgent cares taking care of kids that might want the one including RSV, kids under two, in particular, kids with immunocompromising conditions or taking medications that might impact their immune system. There has been a pretty significant increase in RSV over the past month. JOHN WHYTE And we have been seeing more RSV in older adults as well. As you point out, we primarily see it in children. But there are instances we're starting to see it in adults as well. So I want to ask you, is it all one swab? How does it work? BRIAN CAVENEY Yes, we're trying to make it as fast and convenient for the doctor, or nurse, or whoever is doing the swab as possible. First, they make the clinical decision based on seeing the patient, what needs to be tested for, what is clinically indicated, perhaps what's circulating in their local community. And then with just one swab instead of multiple, then we can test for each of the pathogens that they have ordered as part of the panel for that particular patient. Easier for the patient, easier for the clinician, and then we get the result back to them using PCR technology. JOHN WHYTE Right now, you still need to have a doctor's order. Is that correct? One can't go to a Labcorp facility him herself and say I want the test. Is that correct? BRIAN CAVENEY That is possible for COVID only under a variety of situations and many of those over-the-counter at-home tests are available at retail pharmacies or from our website, for example. The combination test currently needs to be ordered by a clinician. We have actually submitted the application to the FDA for a fully at-home consumer-initiated, not over-the-counter, but a consumer-initiated methodology where we would be able to provide a valid physician prescription suitable for your state. JOHN WHYTE OK. So in fairness Dr. Caveney, some people aren't going to really understand what that means. So it is as you point out, a PCR test, correct? So it's not like a rapid test. So just walk us back one more time. So OTC, over-the-counter, really means they go to pharmacy, they order online, they pick it up and they have it, and they do self collection, and they still could may or may not send it back. So tell us what consumer-initiated means? BRIAN CAVENEY: Consumer-initiated would be a person, let's say, they have symptoms or they've been exposed to a known positive case, then they would be able to, for example, go on our website pixel by Labcorp and fill out a clinical questionnaire. If they're appropriate to be tested for COVID, then we would be able to provide the physician prescription applicable for their state and then they could get the test at home. That is not currently available for the combination panel, including influenza and RSV. We have submitted that to the FDA. We hope that it becomes available after we go through that process. JOHN WHYTE So what type of impact do you think this single panel test will have, especially as the fall approaches, weather starts to get colder or inside more? You think this is going to have a big impact? BRIAN CAVENEY If we do see a surge in influenza over the coming months, and in particular I'm worried about vaccine fatigue as you've been reporting on and then whether people need a COVID-19 booster shot. For doctors to have the difficult conversations to say, I also want you to get a flu shot and we want to space it out between your COVID shots, your booster shot, et cetera, I'm a little worried that the flu vaccine uptake will be low this year. And that might be the perfect storm setup for a resurgence of influenza. If that takes place, then we believe doctors will want to rule out COVID for sure, but also potentially test for influenza in a person where they might be considering using one of the antiviral medications in order to definitively determine whether that patient has flu. JOHN WHYTE But will they get the test results back soon enough compared to some of the rapid tests that they ordered as part of this panel? BRIAN CAVENEY We have had many conversations with our physician customers exactly around that in the time window for starting oseltamivir and some of the other medications. We are priming our labs to be as efficient as we possibly can make them in order to turn those tests around as fast as possible to get that information to doctors. Many urgent cares, of course, even pre-COVID have rapid flu testing mechanisms. And that is still probably going to be part of the screening protocol if they see a symptomatic patient and they're circulating influenza in their community, and in particular if that person had not been vaccinated for the flu, or if there's not a good match between the strains in the quadrivalent vaccine and the ones that we identify as circulating throughout the community this fall. JOHN WHYTE Do you feel physicians know enough about the single panel test? BRIAN CAVENEY We're having conversations with our customers. We're trying to create some work on our website and in information that we provide to ordering physicians around the unfortunate nature that many of the symptoms of all of these different respiratory pathogens, including regular cold viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, have annoyingly similar symptoms. It's very difficult for doctors to determine viral versus bacteria, and then whether it's something that there is a clinical reason to test for it versus treat somebody symptomatically. We're trying to help through those. As you know Dr. Whyte, very few signs and symptoms are pathognomonic for a specific pathogen. One that is potentially helpful is an acute loss of taste or smell, is probably COVID-19 until proven otherwise. That's probably the presumptive. And we believe many doctors will test just for COVID-19 if the patient presents with that symptom. But for some of these others, nothing is going to replace the 3,000-year old good patient history, knowing your patient, knowing their medical history, and then figuring out what you think the clinical indication is for the test. JOHN WHYTE Well, this single panel test is certainly going to be another tool in our toolbox as we work to fight the COVID pandemic, as well as influenza and RSV this fall and winter. Dr. Caveney, thanks for taking the time again to share your insights. BRIAN CAVENEY My pleasure. Thank you Dr. Whyte. JOHN WHYTE And if you have questions about coronavirus, drop us a line.

Right now, there’s just one virus on everyone’s minds: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But humanity is plagued by many respiratory viruses, such as influenza A (IAV) and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), which cause hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. Most of these viruses – apart from influenza and SARS-CoV-2 – have no vaccines or effective treatments.A recent study from the University of Glasgow has discovered what happens when you get infected with some of these viruses at the same time, and it has implications for how they make us sick and how we protect ourselves from them.For many reasons, respiratory viruses are often found during winter in the temperate regions of the world, or the rainy season of equatorial regions. During these periods, you’ll probably be infected with more than one virus at any one time in a situation called a “co-infection”. Research shows that up to 30% of infections may harbour more than one virus. What this means is that, at some point two different viruses are infecting the cells that line your nose or lungs. We know that co-infection can be important if we look at a process called “antigenic shift” in influenza viruses, which is basically caused by virus “sex”. This sometimes occurs when two different influenza strains meet up inside the same cell and exchange genes, allowing a new variant to emerge.Co-infection can create a predicament for viruses when you consider that they need to compete for the same resource: you. Some viruses appear to block other viruses, while some viruses seem to like each other. What is driving these positive and negative interactions during co-infections is unknown, but animal studies suggest that it could be critical in determining how sick you get.The University of Glasgow study investigated what happens when you infect cells in a dish with two human respiratory viruses. For their experiments, they chose IAV and RSV, which are both common and cause lots of disease and death each year. The researchers looked at what happens to each virus using high-resolution imaging techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy, that their labs have perfected over the years.They found that some of the human lung cells in the dish contained both viruses. And, by looking closely at those co-infected cells, they found that the viruses that were emerging from the cell had structural characteristics of both IAV and RSV. The new “chimeric” virus particles had proteins of both viruses on their surface and some even contained genes from the other. This is the first evidence of this occurring from co-infection of distinct respiratory viruses.Follow-up experiments in the same paper showed that these new chimeric viruses were fully functional and could even infect cells that were rendered resistant to influenza, presumably gaining access using the RSV proteins could even get into a broader range of human cells than either virus alone could. Potentially, this could be happening during natural co-infections during the winter. Why we need to study chimeric virusesStudying disease-causing pathogens is extremely important and helpful for creating vaccines and treatments, yet safety is still paramount. It’s important to point out that the researchers in this study did not perform any genetic engineering between two viruses and only modelled what is already happening in the real world, but using safer laboratory strains of viruses under lab conditions.We know about the significant role co-infection can play in a virus’s life, such as during influenza antigenic shift or the curious case of hepatitis D virus borrowing bits of the other viruses, such as hepatitis B, to spread. Nevertheless, the work by the University of Glasgow researchers has significant implications for our understanding of how other very different respiratory viruses might interact, antagonise and even promote each other’s infections in the ecosystem of our nose and lungs. Together, this work shows the complex and often messy interactions between viruses during the winter.Undoubtedly, future work will explore how this co-infection affects transmission, disease and immunity – things that aren’t easy to determine in a dish.Connor Bamford, Research Fellow, Virology, Queen’s University BelfastThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Given reiterated treatments of immunogenic biopharmaceuticals should lead to antibody responses precluding repeated administration, the development of flagellin not inducing specific antibodies would greatly expand the chances of clinical applications. Here we computationally identified immunogenic regions in Vibrio vulnificus flagellin B and deimmunized by simply removing a B cell epitope region. The recombinant deimmunized FlaB (dFlaB) maintains stable TLR5-stimulating activity. Multiple immunization of dFlaB does not induce FlaB-specific B cell responses in mice. Intranasally co-administered dFlaB with influenza vaccine enhanced strong Ag-specific immune responses in both systemic and mucosal compartments devoid of FlaB-specific Ab production. Notably, dFlaB showed better protective immune responses against lethal viral challenge compared with wild type FlaB. The deimmunizing B cell epitope deletion did not compromise stability and adjuvanticity, while suppressing unwanted antibody responses that may negatively affected vaccine antigen-directed immune responses in repeated vaccinations. We explain the underlying mechanism of deimmunization by employing molecular dynamics analysis.

Recognition of TLRs with cognate agonists activates innate immune responses and subsequently modulates adaptive immunity. TLR ligands are incorporated into vaccine formulations as adjuvants to effectively induce potent protective immune responses against co-formulated vaccine antigens [3]. Recently, it has been suggested that nonspecific activation of innate immune system manifests adaptive characteristics sufficient to protect host from later coming infections such as COVID-19, articulating a new jargon ‘trained innate immunity’ [4,5,6]. In this regard, pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-targeting vaccine adjuvants may serve dual players that enhance antigen-specific immune responses and train host innate immunity at the same time. We previously reported that bacterial flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, is a versatile adjuvant applicable to wide spectrum of vaccines and immunotherapies [7,8,9,10]. When FlaB was administered with antigens (Ags) as mixture formulation or as a built-in adjuvant, FlaB strongly induced Ag-specific protective immune responses. The intranasally administered flagellin does not accumulate in olfactory nerve and bulb, guaranteeing no uptake into the central nervous system [11]. We also reported that FlaB-secreting Salmonella typhimurium effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in mouse cancer models and prolonged survival through converting the tumor microenvironment towards tumor-suppressive condition [7]. In addition, flagellin-influenza vaccines have been tested in phase I/II clinical trials [12, 13], suggesting potent efficacy and safety profiles of flagellin in human applications. Given that flagellin is not only a strong immune modulator but also an immunogen in itself, in vivo administered flagellin adjuvant is likely to induce flagellin-specific immune responses. When vaccine administration is repeated, flagellin component may induce B-cell activation and antibody (Ab) production, interfering with the functions of subsequently administered flagellin-adjuvanted vaccines or immunotherapeutics and causing unwanted reactogenic responses [14]. Therefore, the development of flagellin derivatives not inducing flagellin-specific antibody without compromising the adjuvant activity would expedite clinical application.In the present study, we hypothesized that deletion of B-cell epitopes in FlaB would restrain host antibody responses induced by repeated administration, which may make flagellins readily applicable to clinical grade vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Modifying or deleting appropriate amino acid sequences or domains without compromising the stable structure and TLR5 stimulating activity is pivotal in developing a deimmunized FlaB adjuvant. It was reported that Salmonella typhimurium FliC flagellin is comprised of four domains (D0, D1, D2, and D3) and TLR5-binding site is located at the D1 domain. Flagellin monomers are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the flagellated bacteria and transported to the cytoplasmic membrane to spontaneously polymerize to filamentous flagellum structure on the bacterial surface. The conserved TLR5-recognized short sequence in the D1 domain is buried inside when flagellar filament structure is formed, suggesting that monomeric flagellin released from the filament, but not the polymeric filamentous molecule, stimulates TLR5 [15]. The helical D0 and D1 domains are relatively well conserved while D2 and D3 domains are variable among different flagellated bacteria across genus and species. The D2 and D3 domains are exposed outward and induce specific antibody responses [16, 17]. V. vulnificus, a halophilic pathogenic bacterium, possesses a total of six flagellin genes and among the six flagellin genes, flaB is the major subunit contributing to the flagellum biogenesis and the function, indicating FlaB should have been conserved physico-chemically stable throughout the long history of natural evolution [18]. Here, we employed computational prediction for B-cell epitopes to identify immunogenic determinants inducing specific antibody responses in FlaB hypervariable D2-D3 domains. We generated a D2D3 domain-depleted FlaB (FlaBΔD2D3) and a truncated variant (dFlaB) based on the in silico prediction. The freshly purified recombinant dFlaB, a less self-polymerizing mutant protein, induced stable TLR5-stimulating activity. However, the FlaBΔD2D3 protein appeared unstable, resulting in compromised TLR5-stimulating activity under environmental challenges.Here, we report a deimmunized stable flagellin (dFlaB) having comparable TLR5 stimulating potency and significant therapeutic benefit of the dFlaB as an immunomodulator. We show that multiple immunization of the dFlaB does not induce FlaB-specific Ab responses using mouse immunization models. When mucosal adjuvant activity of the flagellins was assessed, comparable levels of adjuvant activity was observed in both dFlaB and wild type (WT) FlaB. To presume dFlaB’s clinical benefits, we employed a lethal influenza virus challenge experiment. Notably, three-time vaccination with dFlaB-adjuvanted H1N1 mucosal vaccine induced significantly stronger protection against lethal virus challenge compared with FlaB plus H1N1 vaccine. It was interesting that the survival was significantly higher in dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccinee animals while induced antibody titers and antiserum neutralizing activities were comparable or lower than with WT FlaB-adjuvanted vaccinees, respectively, suggesting antibody-noninducing dFlaB’s additional advantages.ResultsDevelopment of deimmunized FlaB by deleting B-cell epitope in the variable region of FlaBFlagellin is a strong immune modulator that enhances specific immune responses against co-administered Ags and easily engineered with protein antigens as built-in adjuvants [10, 19]. Since flagellin is well documented as an immunogenic protein being used as a vaccine antigen or a diagnostic target for previous infections, flagellin-specific Ab production is a major concern for repeated administration as adjuvant or immunotherapeutic. In order to develop a druggable flagellin, we attempted deimmunization of V. vulnificus FlaB that our group has been studying as an adjuvant for various vaccine antigens. Firstly, potential B-cell epitopes of FlaB were predicted using BepiPred-2.0 with the threshold value > 0.6 [20]. The variable domain 2 and 3 (ND2-D3-CD2) were predicted to harbor dominant B-cell epitopes (Fig. 1A, B). As most B-cell epitopes are known to be conformational [21], to verify the predicted B-cell epitopes, we built a homology model of FlaB using MODELLER [22] with two most homologous structure templates (PDB ID 3K8V and 6JY0). Homology models were further energy-minimized using the TINKER [23] molecular dynamics package (AMBER99sb) [24] with the GB/SA implicit solvent model [25]. The model monomers were assembled and arranged onto a complex structure of S. Typhimurium flagellin (PDB ID: 6JY0). Structural analyses show that the epitope region in D2 and D3 are solvent-exposed in both complex and monomeric forms (Supplementary Fig. 1). We thus removed entire D2 and D3 from FlaB for deimmunization (FlaBΔD2D3). In addition to the ΔD2D3 variant, we also identified a specific region (175 SYQAEEGKDKNWNVAAGDN 193) in ND2 and D3 that has relatively higher epitope score as well as the Parker hydrophilicity metric (Fig. 1c) [26] but the lowest energy impacts according an in silico alanine scanning using FoldX (Fig. 1d) [27]. In order to develop deimmunized flagellin, from which only an essential minimum of amino acids were removed, we constructed a flagellin variant only lacking above the 19 amino acids (dFlaB).Fig. 1: Development of deimmunized flagellins.a Schematic view of deimmunized FlaB variants. Wild type Vibrio vulnificus FlaB consists of conserved N- and C-terminal domains required for flagellum biogenesis. dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 were deimmunized by deleting potential B-cell epitopes in ND2, D3, and CD2, where variability among different bacterial genus and species. b BepiPred-2.0 predicted ND2 to CD2 domains being most immunogenic. c The Parker hydrophilicity predicted that the most of ND2 domain may also be immunogenic. d In silico alanine scanning by FoldX additionally identified residues in little interactions with other regions (near zero). Based on these three metrics, we selected a linear region of 19 amino acids (175 SYQAEEGKDKNWNVAAGDN 193; shaded in blue) for deimmunization. The red box in ND1 represents TLR5 binding motif while blue box in CD0 represents NLRC4 binding motif, respectively. The 6H represented 6xHis-Tag for purification of recombinant dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3.Full size imageWe constructed expression plasmids to produce recombinant dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 proteins (Table 1). The DNA sequences of the resulting expression vectors were confirmed by the dideoxy-chain termination sequencing method via the Macrogen Online Sequencing Order System (http://dna.macrogen.com/kor/) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and confirmed by SDS-PAGE, native-PAGE, and Western blot analysis using FlaB-specific mouse antiserum, which was raised by subcutaneous immunization as a mixture with complete Freund’s adjuvant. Despite estimated molecular mass of dFlaB (40.7 kDa) is smaller than the wild type FlaB (41.47 kDa), dFlaB showed slower mobility on SDS-PAGE than wild type FlaB (Fig. 2a). We confirmed that the recombinant dFaB mutant was correctly expressed by MALDI-TOF analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3). When the same amount of protein is loaded, dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 showed fainter band intensity in both Western blot analyses following SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE (Fig. 2a). The results suggest that FlaB D2 and D3 domains are more antigenic and 19 amino acids (175~193) play a dominant role in inducing FlaB-specific Ab response. To test TLR5-stimulating activities of the proteins, we measured TLR5-dependent NF-κB signaling by using freshly purified proteins immediately after the solvent change with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). As shown in Fig. 2b, the fresh dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 induced TLR5-stimulating activity in a dose dependent manner. Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of FlaB, dFlaB, or FlaB ΔD2D3 was calculated using triplicate OD 620 values for each protein concentration over a wide range of protein concentrations (0.03719 nM to 76.16 nM). The calculated EC50 values were 4.183 nM for FlaB, 9.0131 nM for dFlaB, and 13.1615 nM FlaBΔD2D3. This result indicates that dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 display slightly decreased activity compared to FlaB. Notably, in higher than 9.52 nM of protein concentrations, TLR5-dependent NF-kB activation showed no significant difference between FlaB and dFlaB (P = 0.2064). The native-PAGE data revealed that freshly purified dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 proteins in PBS showed lower polymerization tendency than WT FlaB. When the recombinant proteins were stored long-term under various environmental conditions, FlaBΔD2D3 protein was subject to aggregation resulting in compromised TLR5-stimulating activity (Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, these results show that dFlaB, where the most immunogenic 19 amino acid B cell epitope was deleted, maintains physicochemical stability and TLR5-stimulating activity.Table 1 Bacterial strains, plasmids, and influenza virus.Full size tableFig. 2: Characteristics of the recombinant proteins.a Characterization of dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis with mouse anti-FlaB serum induced by intraperitoneal immunization of FlaB formulated complete Freund’s adjuvant. b Determination of TLR5-dependent NF-κB stimulating activity by FlaB, dFlaB, and FlaBΔD2D3. The relative NF-κB activities were analyzed by using HEK-BlueTM hTLR5 cells and HEK-BlueTM detection assay systems. EC50 were calculated using triplicate OD 620 nm values for each protein concentration over a wide range of protein concentrations (0.03719 nM to 76.16 nM at the AAT Bioquest website (https://www.aatbio.comools/ec50-calculator). The same molar ratio of proteins was used, and PBS was used as a negative control.Full size imageRepeated immunization of dFlaB does not induce flagellin-specific AbsNext, to test whether the engineered dFlaB protein does not induce FlaB-specific immune responses in vivo, we compared antibody responses induced by repeated immunization with FlaB, dFlaB, or FlaBΔD2D3 proteins. Groups of BALB/c mice were intranasally vaccinated with flagellin proteins seven times at 2-week intervals (Fig. 3a) and the FlaB-specific B cell responses were determined at appropriate time points. The reason why intranasal route was employed is that we have observed, in previous studies, that flagellin serves an excellent mucosal vaccine adjuvant inducing efficacious immune responses in both mucosal and systemic compartments [10, 11, 28]. After three times immunization, FlaB-specific IgG-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells were assayed by ELISPOT [29]. As shown in Fig. 3b, FlaB, FlaBΔD2D3or dFlaB produced 16.50 ± 1.19, 2.50 ± 0.87, or 0.75 ± 0.25 FlaB-specific IgG secreting plasma cells in bone marrow and 14.75 ± 1.80, 0.50 ± 0.29, or 0.25 ± 0.25 memory B cells in spleen, respectively. Given that mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) has potent protective efficacy at mucosal infection sites, we also determined FlaB-specific IgA secreting plasma and memory B cells. Three times immunization with FlaB, FlaBΔD2D3or dFlaB produced 17.75 ± 3.63, 1.41 ± 0.82, or 0.50 ± 0.29 FlaB-specific IgA secreting plasma cells in bone marrow and 36.25 ± 9.25, 2.00 ± 1.25, or 0.25 ± 0.29 memory B cells in spleen, respectively. To confirm whether even multiple immunization of the dFlaB still does not induce FlaB-specific Ab, we continued seven times immunization with FlaB, dFlaB, or FlaBΔD2D3 proteins. After six times immunization, we compared antigen-recognition patterns of the FlaB-, dFlaB- or FlaBΔD2D3-elicited anti-sera by Western blotting. To determine Ab production in mucosal secretions, two-weeks after the third vaccination, we collected BALF and determined FlaB-specific Ab responses by Western blot analysis. Since it has been reported that deletions of hypervariable region of Salmonella typhimurium FliC abrogates antibody-mediated neutralization [16, 17], we employed FlaBΔD2D3 as a control protein to investigate the role of 19 amino acids on the Ab production as well as Ag–Ab interaction profiles. As shown in Fig. 3c, anti-FlaB serum and BALF recognized corresponding FlaB, dFlaB, and FlaBΔD2D3 proteins. Though we loaded same amount of proteins on the polyacrylamide gel, the Western blot showed stronger band intensity for WT FlaB protein compared with dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 proteins, suggesting the variable D2 and D3 domains dominantly induce specific antibodies. The anti-dFlaB and anti-FlaBΔD2D3 sera barely detected FlaB-, dFlaB- or FlaBΔD2D3 proteins. The anti-FlaBΔD2D3 sera showed similar pattern with that recognized by normal naive sera. After the multiple immunization, we determined FlaB-, dFlaB- or FlaBΔD2D3-specific serum IgG titers in anti-FlaB, anti-dFlaB, and anti-FlaBΔD2D3-sera. Seven-time immunization of WT FlaB induced significant levels of FlaB-, dFlaB, and FlaBΔD2D3-specific serum Log2 IgG titers (12.00 ± 0.89, 10.4 ± 0.93, and 10.8 ± 0.80 respectively). While dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 immunization resulted in 6.0 ± 0.0 and 5.8 ± 0.2 FlaB-specific serum IgG titers, respectively, indicating dFlaB and FlaBΔD2D3 were significantly attenuated in inducing FlaB-specific serum IgG even after seven-time repeated intranasal immunizations (Fig. 3d). These results collectively indicate that the 19 amino acid hydrophilic domain serves an essential B cell epitope as well as where anti-FlaB Abs dominantly bind. Furthermore, the deletion of only 19 amino acid is sufficient to inhibit FlaB-specific Ab production while the stability is not compromised.Fig. 3: Multiple immunization of dFlaB does not induce FlaB-specific Ab responses.a Experimental schedule of multiple immunization with FlaB, dFlaB or FlaBΔD2D3. Groups of BALB/c mice (n = 5) were intranasally immunized with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 4 μg FlaB, 4 μg dFlaB and 2.84 μg FlaBΔD2D3 seven times in 2-week intervals, and FlaB-specific B cell responses were determined by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay, Western blot analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). b FlaB-specific memory B and plasma cell responses induced by multiple immunization of 4 μg FlaB, 4 μg dFlaB and 2.84 μg FlaBΔD2D3 ELISPOT assay. Two weeks after the 3rd immunization, FlaB-specific IgG- and IgA-secreting plasma cells from bone morrow and IgG- and IgA-secreting memory B cells from spleen were determined, respectively. c FlaB-specific Ab production evaluated by Western blot analysis. One week after the 6th immunization, anti-sera (anti-FlaB, anti-dFlaB, and anti-FlaBΔD2D3) were prepared from the immunized mice. Two weeks after three-time immunization, BALF was prepared from the immunized mice. Purified FlaB, dFlaB, or FlaBΔD2D3 were run by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blot analysis with the anti-sera or BLAF. d Flagellin-specific Ab titers after seven immunizations. One week after the last immunization, sera were collected and FlaB-, dFlaB- or FlaBΔD2D3-specific IgG titers were determined by ELISA. Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two groups. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; and ***P < 0.001; ns, non-significant.Full size imageBiodistribution of in vivo-administered FlaB or dFlaBTo visualize in vivo-administered FlaB or dFlaB, we generated fluorescence-conjugated proteins [8] and then the biodistribution was determined by measuring fluorescence signals in the draining lymph nodes. Purified FlaB or dFlaB was mixed with FNR675-NHS ester (BioActs, Korea) at 4 °C and maintained overnight in the dark with stirring. The labeled FlaB- or dFlaB-FNR675 was then separated from the unconjugated dye using a centrifugal filter (10 kDa cutoff) (Amicon Ultra®-4, UFC801024), followed by washing (5x) in PBS. Next, the amount of conjugated protein was determined from the calibration curve of the FNR675-NHS ester using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan). BALB/c mice were administered with 100 μg of FlaB-FNR675 or dFlaB-FNR675 through intranasal or footpad route. Six hours after intranasal administration, the cervical lymph node (cLN) was isolated to measure fluorescent photons. Significant fluorescence signal was detected in both FlaB- or dFlaB-administered mice compared to PBS-administered group with no significant differences between two test groups (P < 0.05 for PBS vs FlaB; P < 0.001 for PBS vs dFlaB; P > 0.05 for FlaB vs dFlaB) (Fig. 4a). We also determined biodistribution of FlaB or dFlaB in inguinal lymph node (iLN) and popliteal lymph node (pLN) after footpad injection. As shown in Fig. 4b, both FlaB and dFlaB localized in the draining iLN and pLN with comparable levels in fluorescence intensity (P > 0.05 for FlaB vs dFaB). These results clearly indicate that in vivo-administered dFlaB similarly distributed in the dLNs as compared with WT FlaB.Fig. 4: Biodistribution of in vivo administered flagellins.a Biodistribution of intranasally administered FlaB or dFlaB. BALB/c mice were intranasally administered with 100 μg of FNR675-conjugated FlaB or dFlaB. b Biodistribution of FlaB or dFlaB administered by footpad injection. BALB/c mice were administered with 100 μg of FNR675-conjugated FlaB or dFlaB. Six hours after the administration, the cLNs, iLNs, and pLNs were isolated to determine the biodistribution of the FlaB or dFlaB by measuring fluorescence intensity as described in Materials and methods.Full size imagedFlaB-adjuvant exert equal efficacy to WT FlaB in inducing influenza vaccine-specific Ab responsesNext, to confirm whether the dFlaB maintains equivalent mucosal adjuvant activity as WT FlaB, we performed in vivo immunization experiments employing a commercial influenza vaccine. We compared Ag- and FlaB-specific Ab responses in the same way described above. Previously we had shown that FlaB-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine induced excellent protective immunity in both mucosal and systemic compartments [11]. It has been reported that influenza A H3N2 infection results in severer morbidity than influenza H1N1 or type B infection [30, 31]. All influenza vaccines for 2019–2020 season contain two influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and one or two influenza B virus. Observational studies have consistently shown that influenza vaccine effectiveness is lower for H3N2 relative to H1N1pdm09 and type B, and this is not entirely explained by antigenic match [32]. In the present study, we compared adjuvant activities of dFlaB and FlaB by co-administering inactivated H3N2 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 NIB-88 split vaccine (sH3N2; IL-YANG PHARM. Yongin, Korea). To evaluate Ag-specific Ab responses induced by the mucosal immunization of dFlaB-adjuvanted H3N2 split vaccine (sH3N2), we measured H3N2-specific IgG and IgA titers in blood and BALF, respectively. BALB/c mice were intranasally vaccinated three 3 times with PBS (PBS), 4 μg dFlaB (dFlaB), 4 μg FlaB (FlaB), 1.5 μg sH3N2 (sH3N2), 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg dFlaB (sH3N2 + dFlaB), and 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg dFlaB (sH3N2 + FlaB) at two-week intervals. Two weeks after the last immunization, the sH3N2- or FlaB-specific Ab responses in systemic (serum) and mucosal (BALF) compartments were assayed by ELISA and Western blot analysis.Co-administration of FlaB or dFaB in combination with sH3N2 Ag induced significantly higher levels of anti-sH3N2 serum IgG (P < 0.01 for sH3N2 vs sH3N2 + FlaB; P < 0.001 for sH3N2 vs sH3N2 + dFlaB). The sH3N2-specific IgA was detected in the FlaB- or dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccination only, suggesting secretory IgA production is dependent on the mucosal adjuvant. The dFlaB exerted equivalent adjuvant activities with WT FlaB in both systemic IgG and mucosal IgA levels (P > 0.05 for sH3Ns + FlaB vs sH3Ns + dFlaB) (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5). To ascertain the ELISA result, we performed Western blot analyses following SDS-PAGE or native-PAGE by using anti-sera and anti-BALF. As shown in Fig. 5b, the anti-sH3N2 sera detected both SDS-denatured and native sH3N2 Ags with weak binding intensity. Expectedly, the anti-dFlaB + sH3N2 or anti-FlaB + sH3N2 serum more strongly recognized both denatured and native H3N2 antigens than anti-sH3N2 serum under 1:1,000 serum dilution. Notably, in contrast to the anti-FlaB + sH3N2 serum recognizing both denatured and native form of FlaB, anti-dFlaB + sH3N2 serum could not detect denatured FlaB. The anti-dFlaB + sH3N2 serum minimally reacted with non-denatured form of FlaB. To confirm whether intranasal immunization efficiently induced corresponding mucosal immune responses, we also determined sH3N2- or FlaB-specific Ab responses by Western blot analysis using BALF. The anti-sH3N2 BALF barely detected both denatured and native sH3N2. The anti-dFlaB + sH3N2 or anti-FlaB + sH3N2 BALF strongly detected both denatured and native H3N2 antigens, indicating both dFlaB and FlaB have efficacious mucosal adjuvant activities generating protective secretory antibody responses. Compared with WT FlaB + sH3N2 vaccination, dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccine did not induce efficient FlaB-recognizing Igs in the BALF. Taken together, dFlaB maintains mucosal adjuvant activity without inducing FlaB-specific Ab responses in this influenza vaccination model, suggesting clinical applicability of dFlaB in future mucosal vaccines against various viral infections.Fig. 5: The dFlaB has strong mucosal adjuvant activity without FlaB-specific Ab induction.a Ag-specific antibody response after intranasal vaccination. Groups (n = 9–10) of mice were intranasally vaccinated with PBS (PBS), 4 μg FlaB (FlaB), 4 μg dFlaB (dFlaB), 1.5 μg H3N2 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 NIB-88 split vaccine (sH3N2), 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg FlaB (sH3N2 + FlaB), or 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg dFlaB (sH3N2 + dFlaB) three times at two-week intervals. Two weeks after the last immunization, serum or BALF was collected and sH3N2-specific serum IgG or BALF IgA titers were determined by ELISA. b Determination of sH3N2- or FlaB-specific Ab production. Two weeks after the last immunization, serum or BALF was collected. SDS-denatured or non-denatured sH3N2 or FlaB was resolved by PAGE. The sH3N2- or FlaB- specific Abs in the sera and BALF were probed by Western blotting analysis. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare two groups. ***P < 0.001; ns, non-significant; ND, not detected (under the detection limit); M, marker; H, sH3N2; F, FlaB.Full size imagedFlaB-adjuvanted vaccine confer enhanced protection against lethal influenza challengeTo comparatively assess the protective efficacies of the dFlaB- and FlaB-adjuvanted vaccines against lethal virus infection, we performed a challenge study using mouse-adpated virulent H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/07 influenza virus [11]. We tested two Ag doses to reproduce sufficient and suboptimal immunization conditions. BALB/c mice were intranasally vaccinated three times with PBS, inactivated H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/07 split vaccine (Green Cross, Hwasun, Korea; 0.2 μg for sufficient Ag dose or 0.08 μg for suboptimal Ag dose) plus 4 μg dFlaB (sH1N1 + dFlaB), and sH1N1 plus 4 μg FlaB at two-week intervals. Two weeks after the last immunization, serum samples were collected and vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of live A/Brisbane/59/07 virus (2.4× LD50). Survival and body weight changes were monitored for 14 days. As shown in Fig. 6a, in both challenge experiments, all of the vehicle immunized mice (PBS) lost 30% of their body weight by day 7 with 0% survival. The final survival percentages of 0.2 μg sH1N1 + dFlaB or 0.2 μg sH1N1 + FlaB-vaccinated mice were 90% and 33.3%, respectively. Mice immunized with 0.2 μg sH1N1 + dFlaB showed a significantly increased survival rate compared to those immunized with sH1N1 + FlaB (P = 0.0094). In the suboptimal Ag dose (0.08 μg sH1N1) immunization setting, dFlaB-adjuvanted group showed 60% survival at day 14. However, 0.08 μg sH1N1 + FlaB group showed only 20% survival. Median survival period of the FlaB-adjuvanted sH1N1 vaccinated group (0.08 μg sH1N1 + FlaB) was 8 days. Both dFlaB-adjuvanted sH1N1-vaccinated groups showed significant reductions in morbidity as determined by body weight changes (P < 0.05 for 0.2 μg sH1N1 + dFlaB vs 0.2 μg sH1N1 + FlaB; P < 0.001 for 0.08 μg sH1N1 + dFlaB vs 0.08 μg sH1N1 + FlaB) (Fig. 6a). To test virus-neutralization capacity of anti-sera, we performed a virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). As shown in Fig. 6b, FlaB- or dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccine showed significantly higher titers than the 0.2 μg sH1N1 alone (P < 0.05 for 0.2 μg sH1N1 vs 0.2 μg sH1N1 + FlaB; P < 0.001 for 0.2 μg sH1N1 vs 0.2 μg sH1N1 + dFlaB). Specifically, the sH1N1 + dFlaB groups showed significantly lower PRNT levels compared with sH1N1 + FlaB, suggesting the dFlaB-mediated adjuvanticity would employ other components of immunity than virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses. We also measured Ag-specific serum IgG titers. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6, similar level of H1N1-specific serum IgG was detected in FlaB- or dFlaB- adjuvanted group. When we compared the body weight change, the sH1N1 + dFlaB groups showed severe body weight loss in earlier time points (until day 3 for 0.2 μg sH1N1 and day 5 for 0.08 μg sH1N1 Ag doses). Three- or five-days after the virus challenge, groups of mice immunized with dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccine showed faster body weight recovery (Fig. 6a). This result clearly suggests that deimmunization potentiates immune modulatory function of flagellin against lethal infection and the dFlaB would have advantage over WT FlaB as a vaccine adjuvant with virtues other than antibody-noninducing characteristics. It will be interesting, in future studies, to check the ability of dFlaB in inducing trained innate immunity [4,5,6] or cell mediated immunity against viral antigens.Fig. 6: The dFlaB-adjuvant induced better protection than that of wild type FlaB in a H1N1 influenza lethal challenge model.Groups of mice (n = 9–10) were intranasally immunized with PBS, FlaB, dFlaB, H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/07 split vaccine (sH1N1), sH1N1 plus FlaB (sH1N1 + FlaB), or sH1N1 plus dFlaB (sH1N1 + dFlaB) three times at a two-week interval. Two weeks after the immunization, mice were intranasally challenged with a 2.4 × LD50 live A/Brisbane/59/07 influenza virus. After the challenge, survival rate and changes in body weight (a) were monitored for 2 weeks. Naive mice were used as controls for the determination of body weight change. b Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using live influenza A/Brisbane/59/07 virus. Two weeks after the last immunization, serum was collected from the retroorbital plexus. PRNT50 titer was determined as 50% neutralization of plaques based on positive control virus wells. Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two groups.Full size imageDiscussionFlagellin, the major structural component of flagellum biogenesis [18], is a unique protein-based TLR agonist that serves as an efficacious adjuvant for various mucosal vaccines and immunotherapeutics [7,8,9,10,11, 19, 28]. Immune responses against protein therapeutics itself would be detrimental to efficacy and safety. Though it has been reported that there was no apparent relationship between anti-flagellin Ab and adverse events after influenza–flagellin fusion vaccine administration in a clinical trial [33], since flagellin is a strong immunogen [34] the flagellin-specific Ab production has continuously raised concern for the development of flagellin-based therapeutics. Repeated immunization with flagellin-adjuvanted vaccine induces high titer of flagellin-specific Ab production, which may interfere with subsequently administered flagellin-adjuvanted vaccine resulting in unwanted neutralizing or reactogenic responses. Therefore, deimmunization of flagellin that preserve adjuvant activity is a promising option to make a pharmaceutically optimized flagellin. Modification of proteins, being highly optimized throughout long history of evolution, often results in drastic deterioration in physicochemical stability. In the present study, we reported a rather conservative way of deimmunizing highly antigenic protein flagellin by deleting minimal number of amino acids constituting a dominant B-cell epitope.In the present study, we generated a deimmunized version of flagellin (dFlaB). To develop deimmunized FlaB, we targeted B-cell epitopes by using in silico prediction and structure modeling tools. It has been reported that deletions of hypervariable region of Salmonella typhimurium FliC abrogates antibody-mediated neutralization [16]. Our computational analyses also found that the most probable B-cell epitope would be located within hypervariable D2D3 regions (170–284 amino acid) of the FlaB molecule. According to the 3D structure prediction, D2D3 deletion (FlaBΔD2D3) do not influence TLR5-binding motif (89–96 amino acid). However, we noted that FlaBΔD2D3 should have limited usefulness a pharmaceutical because of its poor stability in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 4) and in vivo. It has been reported that the D3 domain of S. typhimurium FliC play an important role in the stabilization of the D1 and D2 domains [35]. As shown in Figure 1, since the deleted 19 amino acids of dFlaB encompass 17 amino acids of ND2 and 2 amino acids of D3 domain, it is likely that the dFlaB preserve the essential amino acid sequences responsible for stabilization of the flagellin structure without disrupting folding kinetics. From the native-PAGE and Western blot analyses of dFlaB, we found that it tends to less polymerize in the PBS condition (Fig. 2b). It was reported that a short-conserved sequence buried in the polymeric flagella filament serves the TLR5 recognition site, which suggests that monomeric flagellin, but not the polymeric filamentous molecule, stimulates TLR5 [36]. As shown in Fig. 2a, dFlaB showed slow mobility on SDS-PAGE than WT FlaB, suggesting probable conformational change not compromising with TLR5 binding. In our previous report, we observed same molecular mass FlaB-PspA and PspA-FlaB fusion polypeptides showed significantly different mobility on SDS-PAGE gel [19]. Later, as will be discussed below, it was presumed that more robust molecular dynamics of remaining D2D3 region in dFlaB would be attributed to the slower mobility. Since monomeric flagellin molecules of bacteria automatically assembles into a filamentous super-structure, it is likely that dFlaB has advantages in terms of pharmaceutical manufacturing and reproducible activities under in vitro and in vivo conditions because of its lower propensity of polymerization.Though the detailed mode of action for the lowered antigenicity of dFlaB has yet to be investigated, it has been known that B-cell epitopes tend to be less mobile [37, 38] and the low antigenicity of dFlaB may be due to the change in structural flexibility by the 19 amino acids removal. To address this hypothesis, we performed short-period molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. dFlaB was homology-modeled using the same template structures with the same settings as for FlaB (The Tinker package with AMBER99sb and the GB/SA implicit solvent model). Triplicate MD was run per target monomer. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of Cα atoms. RMSF values are overall similar, but significant differences were observed at residues right after the truncated region. The flexibility becomes stabilized again at the end of D3. From these observations, we presume that the removal of the 19 amino acids induces high flexibility of D2-D3, which should have hindered antibody recognition [39] (Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Data 1).Given than flagellin is a representative protein-based TLR agonist, the pharmacokinetic property of flagellin might determine the in vivo efficacy of this immunomodulator. In our previous studies, we showed that mucosally (intranasal or intravaginal route) administered FlaB moved to draining lymph nodes (dLNs) within 4–6 h as intact protein aggregates or in association with antigen presenting cells. In the present study, we noted that intranasally administered dFlaB showed equivalent adjuvant activity as WT FlaB in inducing Ag-specific Ab responses, suggesting in vivo stability was not compromised by the deletion of B-cell epitope. It has been reported that biodistribution and antigen delivery to dLN of recombinant protein vaccine is critical for the development of optimal recombinant vaccine [40]. We also observed that in vivo-administered dFlaB similarly distributed in the dLNs as compared with WT FlaB (Fig. 4).In this study, we developed deimmunized FlaB (dFlaB) by deleting B-cell epitope in the variable region of FlaB. The dFlaB maintains stable TLR5-stimulating activity. We confirmed that repeated immunization of dFlaB does not induce flagellin-specific Abs and dFlaB-adjuvant exert equal efficacy to WT FlaB in inducing influenza vaccine-specific Ab responses. The dFlaB-adjuvanted vaccine confer enhanced protection against lethal influenza challenge. The deimmunizing B cell epitope deletion did not compromise stability and adjuvanticity, while suppressing unwanted antibody responses that may negatively affected vaccine antigen-directed immune responses in repeated vaccinations.MethodsComputational methodsBepiPred 2.0 [20] was used to identify potential B-cell epitopes. Additionally, the Parker hydrophilicity [26] was measured using the IEDB webserver [41]. Structure models of FlaB were built using MODELLER [22]. One hundred models were generated and the best one was selected based on the DOPE potential [23]. The final model was deduced by minimizing with the TINKER molecular dynamics package with AMBER99sb [24] and the GB/SA implicit solvent model [25]. Triplicate molecular dynamics (MD) runs were carried out per each target for one nanosecond. Structural snapshots were taken every 5 picoseconds and thus the RMSF values were calculated from 2,000 structural conformations against the initial minimized structure. FoldX [27] was employed to conduct the in silico alanine scanning on the TINKER minimized model. Side-chains were re-minimized using FoldX before alanine scanning.Plasmid construction and recombinant protein productionThe expression vector for FlaBΔD2D3 and dFlaB fusion proteins were constructed by crossover-PCR-mediated deletion mutagenesis [42, 43]. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The PCR primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Plasmids were maintained in Escherichia coli grown on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plates with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (100 μg/ml). To construct the expression vectors for the FlaBΔD2D3 and dFlaB, we designed two sets of primers to amplify upstream or downstream region of flaB gene. The primers were synthesized with overhangs recognized by specific restriction enzymes (REs). The upstream and downstream amplicons of flaB fragments were ligated by cross-over PCR to produce corresponding nucleotide sequences for FlaBΔD2D3 and dFlaB proteins. The purified PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and fusion fragments were digested with appropriate REs and subcloned into pET30a+ plasmids. The DNA sequences of the resulting expression vectors were confirmed by the dideoxy-chain termination sequencing method via the Macrogen Online Sequencing Order System (http://dna.macrogen.com/kor/). The resulting expression plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli BL21. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 18 h incubation at 20 °C, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. The bacterial pellets were lysed by 50 mL of lysis buffer (pH 8, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% TritonX-100, 0.1% Tween, and 20 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min, cell-free supernatant was loaded on a column containing Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instruction. Wild type recombinant FlaB protein was produced from pCMM250 plasmid which was originally established in our previous study [28] by using pTYB12 expression system (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). Briefly, pCMM250 plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli ER2566 and an intein-FlaB fusion protein was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG. To prepare a bacterial lysate for affinity column chromatography, the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–Cl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated (Vibra Cell VCX500; Sonics & Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) on an ice bed. After sonication, recombinant intein-free FlaB was purified by using a chitin column and 50 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol solution in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (Chitin Resin, New England Biolabs, Inc.). The purity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis with an anti-FlaB antibody raised in mice using complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All blots derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel. Column-purified protein buffer was exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugal filter tubes (Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter, 10k). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination was removed by treatment with TritonX-114 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and traces of Triton X-114 were removed by treatment with Bio-Beads™ SM-2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions by incubating with 0.3 g of Bio-beadsTM-2 for 1 ml of protein. The residual LPS content was determined by using the gel-clotting Endosafe LAL kit (Charles River, Charleston, SC). The LPS levels in protein preparations were kept below the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guideline (less than 0.15 EU/30 g per mouse).Determination of TLR5-dependent NF-κB activationWe measured TLR5-dependent NFκB stimulating activity of the recombinant proteins by using HEK-BlueTM hTLR5 cells (InvivoGen, hκb-htlr-5) and HEK-BlueTM Detection (InvivoGen, hb-det2) assay systems following the manufacturer’s instruction. EC50 was calculated using triplicate OD 620 nm values for each protein concentration over a wide range of protein concentrations (0.03719 nM to 76.16 nM at the AAT Bioquest website [https://www.aatbio.comools/ec50-calculator]).Ethics statementAll animal experimental procedures were performed with approval from the Chonnam National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol CNU IACUC-H-2018-66. Animal research facility maintenance and experimental procedures were carried out strictly keeping the guideline of the Animal Welfare Act legislated by Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs.Intranasal immunizationSeven-week-old female BALB/c mice (OrientBio, Seongnam, Korea) were intranasally immunized with vaccine components at 2-week intervals under anesthesia by using Zoletil® 50 (Virbac corporation, Carros, France) and RompunTM (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). To evaluate flagellin-specific Ab responses induced by FlaB or dFlaB, mice were immunized with 4 μg FlaB or 4 μg dFlaB seven times at two-week intervals. For the influenza vaccine study, groups of mice were immunized with 10 μl PBS, per each nostril, containing 4 μg dFlaB, 4 μg FlaB, 1.5 μg H3N2 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 NIB-88 split commercial vaccine (sH3N2; IL-YANG PHARM. Yongin, Korea), 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg dFlaB or 1.5 μg sH3N2 plus 4 μg FlaB three times at 2-week intervals. The serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from the immunized mice in each group [28] and stored at −80 °C until use.In vivo tracing of FlaB or dFlaBTo test in vivo biodistribution of FlaB or dFlaB, BALB/c mice were administered with 100 μg of FlaB-FNR675 or dFlaB-FNR675 through intranasal or footpad route. To prepare fluorescence-conjugated proteins, purified FlaB or dFlaB was mixed with FNR675-NHS ester (BioActs, Korea) at 4 °C and maintained overnight in the dark with stirring. The labeled FlaB-FNR675 or dFlaB-FNR675 was then separated from the unconjugated dye using a centrifugal filter (10 kDa cutoff) (Amicon Ultra®-4, UFC801024), followed by washing (5×) in PBS. Next, the amount of conjugated protein was determined from the calibration curve of the FNR675-NHS ester using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2700, Shimadzu, Japan). Six hours after the administration, cervical, inguinal, and popliteal lymph nodes were isolated to assess the biodistribution of the FlaB or dFlaB. The photon signals were collected using a fluorescence labeled organism bioimaging instrument (FOBI; NeoScience company, Korea). and Signal intensities were assessed quantitatively in the specimens by measuring the maximum photons per second per centimeter squared per steradian (p/s/cm2/sr).ELISPOT assay of Ab-secreting cellsTo evaluate FlaB-specific B cell responses after multiple immunization of the dFlaB or FlaB, we determined IgG- or IgA-secreting plasma cells in bone marrow and memory B cells in spleen [29]. To determine FlaB-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), multi-screen 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with recombinant FlaB (1 μg/well) overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with RPMI1640 (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA), 106 splenocytes or 106 bone marrow cells were added to the FlaB-coated plates, followed by incubation for 24 h for bone marrow cells, or 5 days for spleen cells. The plates were subsequently incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgA according to the manufacture’s protocol, and the spots were visualized with the AEC substrate (BD Biosciences, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and counted with a CTL-Immunospot Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Shaker Heights, OH).Determination of sH3N2- or flagellin-specific antibody responses by ELISA and Western blotting analysisTo determine antigen-specific antibody (Ab) titers by ELISA, the serum and BALF were collected from immunized mice. The ELISA plates (Corning Laboratories, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were coated by incubating with antigens in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. The plates were washed with sterile distilled water (DW) to remove the unbound-antigen and treated with blocking buffer [0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1 mM EDTA (BIONEER, KOREA) in PBST] at RT for 1 hour. Serially diluted sera or saliva in blocking buffer were added into the plates and incubated for 2 h at RT and then the 5 washes were repeated. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgA antibodies were used as secondary Abs. The signal was developed with 30 μl of 3,3′5,5′tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 1 N H2SO4. The optical density was measured with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) at 450 nm. The titers were expressed as the reciprocal log2 value of the dilution that yielded 2-fold higher values of optical density at 450 nm than the no serum blank well.For Western blotting, the recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE or native-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Anti-sera or BALF were diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 were incubated with the respective membranes for 2 h at room temperature (RT) to probe corresponding proteins. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) was used to visualize proteins following the manufacture’s instruction.Virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)Anti-sera were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (Cosmos Biomedical Ltd, Derbyshire, United Kingdom) for 24 h at 37 °C and then heat inactivated at 56 °C for 1 hour. Virus neutralizing activity was determined [44,45,46,47]. Briefly, the two-fold serially diluted heat inactivated serum samples were incubated with equal volume of influenza virus suspension (30–40 PFU) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere for 2 h. The mixture of serum and virus were adsorbed to 12‐well plates containing confluent Madin‐Darby canine kidney cells. The agar‐overlaid plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Four days after the virus infection, to visualize plaques, the plates were stained with 0.03% crystal violet.Lethal challenge with live influenza virusTo test whether dFlaB- or FlaB-adjuvanted influenza vaccines elicit protective immune responses in a viral infection model, we carried out challenge experiments. Groups of mice (n = 9–10) were vaccinated with 4 μg dFlaB plus 0.2 or 0.08 μg H1N1 A/Brisbane/59/07 split vaccine (Green Cross, Hwasun, Korea) (sH1N1 + dFlaB) or 4 μg FlaB plus 0.2 or 0.08 μg sH1N1 (sH1N1 + FlaB). Two weeks after the 3rd immunization, the vaccinated mice were infected with live 2.4x LD50 of A/Brisbane/59/07 homologous influenza virus strain under anesthetic condition. After the lethal viral infection, the challenged mice were monitored daily for 2 weeks [11]. Mice that lost 30% of their total weight were euthanized. The A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) viruses were amplified by infecting Madin Darby Canine (MDCK) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) [48, 49]. Briefly, MDCK cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Media/Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (MEM/EBSS) (HyClone Laboratories, Marlborough, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. To propagate A/Brisbane/59/07 virus, the MDCK cells were infected with the virus in serum-free MEM/EBSS for 2 h at RT. Then the cells were incubated with MEM/EBSS containing 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (MP biomedicals 160069, Irvine, CA) and 1 μg/ml 1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) media up to 2 days. When cytophatic effect was evident, the viruses were harvested by centrifugation.Statistical analysesThe results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Mann-Whitney or unpaired t-test was used to compare two groups. Statistical significance for survival and body weight changes were calculated by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and two-way ANOVA, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism 8.00 software for Windows (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). P values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Getting a shot in the arm isn’t exactly fun, but there is another option: the nasal flu vaccine.Known as FluMist Quadrivalent or the live attenuated influenza vaccine, this flu vaccine lets you bypass the whole needle-in-arm scenario, making it a good option for children and people who are nervous about shots. But the nasal flu vaccine isn’t for everyone, including adults over 50. Here’s what you need to know before bypassing the shot.What is the nasal flu vaccine, exactly?The nasal flu vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, meaning it contains weakened flu viruses so they won’t make you sick, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains. Those weakened viruses are specially designed to only multiply at the cooler temperatures found in your nose and not in your lungs or other areas in your body that are warmer. Just like the “regular” flu vaccine, the nasal flu vaccine targets certain strains of influenza that researchers predict will circulate the most during that given year. This year’s nasal flu vaccine is a quadrivalent vaccine, meaning it targets four strains of the flu, the CDC says. The 2021-2022 nasal flu vaccine will target the following strains, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC:an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus a B/Washington/02/2019- like virus (B/Victoria lineage) a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage)How does the nasal flu vaccine work?The process of getting the nasal flu vaccine is pretty simple, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There is a syringe type of device that contains the vaccine, it’s inserted into your nose, and it mists the vaccine into your nostrils,” he says. “The person usually sniffs it.” This method, he explains, exposes the lining of your nose (aka your nasal mucosa) to the vaccine.How effective is the nasal flu vaccine?The effectiveness of any flu vaccine varies from year to year, but the nasal flu vaccine is “considered comparable to the flu shot,” Dr. Adalja says.“There have been questions of the efficacy of the nasal flu vaccine for certain influenza types such as H1N1 in the past, but that’s been addressed,” says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not show a preference for any type of flu vaccine over another this year, provided you meet the right qualifications.What are potential side effects of the nasal flu vaccine?Potential side effects can vary, depending on whether the vaccine is given to a child or an adult, the CDC says.Side effects for kids can include:Runny nose Wheezing Headache Vomiting Muscle aches Low grade fever Sore throat For adults, they might include:Runny nose Headache CoughWho is the nasal flu vaccine good for?The nasal flu vaccine is approved for use in healthy people who aren’t pregnant and are between the ages of two and 49, per the CDC. But there is a laundry list of health conditions that can keep you from being eligible for this flu vaccine (more on that in a moment). “It’s sort of a niche vaccine, given that there are so many contraindications,” Dr. Russo says. “But it can be helpful for people who have a needle phobia.”While adults can get the nasal flu vaccine, most tend to opt for the shot. “Generally, the nasal flu vaccine is more often given to kids,” says Richard Watkins, M.D., an infectious disease physician and professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University. Who shouldn’t get the nasal flu vaccine? The CDC has a big list of people who should skip the nasal flu vaccine. That includes:Children younger than 2 Adults 50 years and older People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any flu vaccine Children 2 through 17 years old who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications Children 2 through 4 years old who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months People with weakened immune systems (immunosuppression) from any cause People who care for severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment (or otherwise avoid contact with those persons for seven days after getting the nasal spray vaccine) People without a spleen, or with a non-functioning spleen Pregnant people People with an active leak between the cerebrospinal fluid and the mouth, nose, ear, or other place within the skull People with cochlear implants People who have taken flu antiviral drugs within a certain amount of time. (48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, 5 days for peramivir, and 17 days for baloxavir)The CDC also cautions against using the nasal flu vaccine for people with the following health conditions:Asthma (in people 5 years and older) Other underlying medical conditions that can put people at higher risk of serious flu complications, including lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease (like diabetes), kidney or liver disorders, neurologiceuromuscular, or metabolic disorders Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever Developing Guillain-Barré Syndrome within six weeks following a previous dose of flu vaccineWhere can you get the nasal flu vaccine?It’s usually available where other flu vaccines are offered. But, given that it’s not as popular as the flu shot, not every doctor’s office or drugstore will have it in stock.

Be as safe as possible.”The flu shot can be given to people from the age of 6 months old up. That includes pregnant women.“This upcoming flu season will be worse than the last flu season because it was a record-breakingly light flu season,” said Dr. Daniel Haight, vice president of community health for Lakeland Regional Health and its medical director for infection prevention.“We’re already seeing other respiratory illnesses (like rhinovirus and RSVespiratory syncytial virus) being diagnosed right now.”These physicians recommend getting the flu shot in mid-to-late September, ahead of the start of flu season. The vaccine takes at least a couple of weeks to fully take effect.Not getting it by October, however, doesn’t mean it’s too late.Flu season typically starts in late October and November. It usually peaks in December or January.Flu vaccination is available through doctors’ offices, clinics, pharmacies and Department of Health Polk County immunization clinics.DOH Polk usually starts getting the vaccine between September and October.It’s available to uninsured patients at no cost at DOH immunization clinics.Watson Clinic customarily starts flu clinics for its patients in mid September.You don’t get flu from getting the flu vaccine, a common misconception that’s still around, each doctor said.Haight advises people living in long-term care facilities to quiz their caregivers on whether they’ve received vaccinations against flu and COVID-19.“We are seeing far too few staff in nursing facilities vaccinated against the flu,” he said.People can get flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine safely at the same time if the timing works out.People often erroneously dismiss flu as a cold and runny nose, Hendrix said.“It’s a serious infection,” he said. “It will keep you down at least a week.”Vaccination against pneumonia also is recommended. Unlike flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine isn’t needed annually.Two pneumococcal vaccines have Food and Drug Administration approval: Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23. Pneumovax 23 is recommended for all adults who are 65 and older and for people over the age of 2 who are at increased risk of getting pneumonia.If you had a Pneumovax 23 shot before age 65, get another one when you turn 65, Chiques said.Prevnar 13 is for routine use in children younger than age 5, in adults 65 or older and for some people ages 5-to-64 at increased risk of getting pneumonia, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.People getting both pneumonia vaccines usually get Prevnar 13 first and, a year later, Pneumovax 23, Chiques said.In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended people 65 and older get both, which work in different ways, as protection from pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis.But, in late 2019, the committee stopped routinely recommending Prevnar 13 for everyone 65 and older. It recommends a single dose of Pneumovax 23 for people those ages.The CDC recommends people 65 and older talk with their doctor about whether they need Prevnar 13, in addition to Pneumovax 23, unless they have a condition compromising their immune system, have a cochlear implant or have a cerebrospinal fluid leak.Getting both vaccines still is recommended for people with those conditions.Contact Robin Williams Adams at robinwadams99@yahoo.comDO YOU HAVE THE FLU?Signs and symptoms of flu usually come on suddenly. People who are sick with flu often feel some or all these symptoms:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigue (tiredness)Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children than adults. Not everyone with flu will have a fever.Because some symptoms of flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory illnesses are similar, testing is needed to tell what the illness is and confirm a diagnosis. People can be infected with both flu and the virus that causes COVID-19.Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices© Copyright Gannett 2024Period Flu - Why Hormones Make You Feel Sick Before Your PeriodSearchAbout Women's HealthSubscribeMy BookmarksWomen's Health+FitnessHealthBeautyFoodSports & AthletesStyleWeight LossSex & LoveRelationshipsLifeAwardsNewsletterFollowWorkout Routines FinderShopOther EditionsPrivacy NoticeTerms Of UseSkip to ContentHealthFitnessBeautyLifeShoppingRelationshipsSubscribesign inBuilding Muscle at 50Weight Loss PatchesWNBA Expansion TeamsIron Deficiency in WomenHigh Protein BreakfastHealth‘Period Flu’ Might Be Why You Feel So Crappy Right Before Your Period‘Period Flu’ Might Be Why You Feel So Crappy Right Before Your PeriodIt can even mimic a fever.By Alexis Jones and Korin MillerUpdated: Sep 16, 2021 10:46 AM EDTSave ArticleNausea, fatigue, body aches…sounds like the flu, right? But if it happens regularly around your period, it’s likely what experts often refer to as the “period flu.” While "period flu" is not a formal medical term or diagnosis, Alyssa Dweck, MD, a practicing gynecologist in Westchester County, New York and host of the podcast Business of the V, knows exactly what I'm talking about. "My patients complain about all kinds of different illness that seem to come about right before their period, and they’re always cyclical," she says. It's common for women to experience flu-like symptoms and even a fever between ovulation and the start of their period.So what's really going on with your body? Below, doctors weigh in on this period phenomenon and how to Get. Some. Relief. Already. Can your period make you feel like you have the flu?Well, you don’t actually have the influenza virus, but your body is mimicking similar symptoms. "My feeling from a medical standpoint is that this is all part of PMS syndrome, which can have both physical and emotional symptoms," Dr. Dweck says. Some of her clients' most common PMS complaints are all reminiscent of flu symptoms, including irritability, breast soreness, headaches, joint pain, and excessive fatigue. Dr. Dweck also points out that often times women with pre-existing conditions, like autoimmune issues or rheumatoid arthritis, will even experience exacerbation or a flare-up of their symptoms just before their period—and then things get better after they menstruate. "So it does make you wonder, [even though] it's not in the literature, if there’s some sort of immune hit that occurs just before your period bringing these flu-like symptoms to life," Dr. Dweck notes. There are no studies that show your immune system is actually taking a hit. So you can just blame the hormonal rollercoaster that is PMS until there's more conclusive science on this. Why does it happen for some people with periods but not others?One word: hormones. "In the mid-portion of your cycle when you ovulate, your estrogen and progesterone levels start to surge, and they decline when you do not get pregnant and get your period," Dr. Dweck explains. "So that precipitous decline, particularly in estrogen, is what causes a lot of the symptoms."But that's not all (lucky you!). "The other thing that's going on as we get into our periods is that the uterus cranks out a chemical called prostaglandin," says Mary Jane Minkin, MD, clinical professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale University School of Medicine. Period problems, solved:How Gynecologists Soothe Their Own Period Cramps Is Your Heavy Period a Sign of Something Serious?8 Ways To Get Rid Of Period BloatingProstaglandin causes that annoying AF uterine cramping. It also causes the muscles to contract and can give you gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea. According to Dr. Minkin, "prostaglandins can also make you feel like you have the flu and even give you a temperature." Fun, right? But many women also change up their lifestyle habits before their period starts, Dr. Dweck points out. For instance, you might up your sugar and salty snack intake, which can cause swelling and inflammation, she explains. And you may have increased water retention, which could lead to joint pain, Dr. Dweck says. The effects of these diet and lifestyle changes right before your period can mimic flu like symptoms too. So that's definitely something you want to keep in mind. How to prevent period fluIf period flu is a regular thing for you, it’s more than understandable that you’d want to stop symptoms before they even start. There are a few potential hacks you can try, according to women’s health expert Jennifer Wider, MD. “Preparation is key for managing and preventing some of these uncomfortable symptoms,” she says. Her advice: Ask your doctor about hormonal birth control. When you get your period, the estrogen levels in your body drop. Taking hormonal birth control can help keep them more consistent and lower your risk of developing period flu symptoms. Take an NSAID early. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen can help tackle symptoms like achiness, joint pain, and headaches. “Taking a NSAID before the symptoms even start can help prevent them,” Dr. Wider says. So, if you know that you tend to get period flu symptoms three days before your period arrives, you’ll want to try taking an NSAID four days beforehand. Stay hydrated. “Dehydration can exacerbate all the symptoms,” Dr. Wider says. And, she says, avoiding alcohol and caffeine can do you a solid, too. Get some sleep. Sure, you probably hear this advice a lot, but it’s important since Dr. Wider says that sleep deprivation can make symptoms worse. FWIW: The National Sleep Foundation recommends aiming to get seven to nine hours a night. Exercise regularly. Getting in regular workouts and keeping them up around the time your period flu arrives can help you feel better, Dr. Wider says. Should feeling sick before your period ever be a cause for concern?In other words, is period flu...dangerous? Period flu symptoms usually last between ovulation and the start of your period. When menstruation begins, both Dr. Dweck and Dr. Minkin generally see their patients' symptoms dissipate. So, in general, while you might feel icky, you'll be totally fine in a few days.Related Story7 Ways Your Thyroid Messes With Your Body "If your symptoms are so bad, physically or emotionally, that they’re interrupting with your day-to-day life or interfering with your relationship, then you need to get checked out," Dr. Dweck says. There could be a different underlying issue at play, and the timing with your period is coincidence. For example, maybe you have a thyroid disorder, which exhibits similar symptoms (excessive fatigue, weakness, muscle and body aches), Dr. Dweck notes. And while you may feel feverish, if you have an actual temperature of 101 or 102, that’s not period flu—that’s something else, Dr. Dweck says. "And if that’s persistent, you should get that checked out."How can I tell the difference between period flu and COVID-19?It can be a little tricky, Dr. Wider says. “The period flu is obviously not caused by a virus, but some of the symptoms can mimic COVID-19, including fatigue, lethargy, headaches, and gastrointestinal upset or changes in bowel habits,” she says. Just a quick refresher on the most common symptoms of COVID-19, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting DiarrheaOf course, if you’re not sure what’s happening with you, Dr. Wider says you should take a COVID-19 test. (They’re even available at your local drugstore now!) Just practice safety methods while you wait for the results, like wearing a mask when you’re around others and social distancing.How can I tell the difference between period flu and early pregnancy?Not to further complicate things, but symptoms of early pregnancy can also be similar to symptoms of period flu, Dr. Wider says. “Tender breasts, nausea, fatigue, and back pain are just a few of the overlapping symptoms,” she says. Naturally, if you’re trying to get pregnant or have been iffy on your birth control lately, this might be more of a possibility than if you’re using an incredibly effective method of birth control or haven’t had sex lately.The best way to figure out what’s happening here is—again—take a test. “If you think you might be pregnant, the best way to distinguish between the two is with a pregnancy test,” Dr. Wider says. If I do feel like crap around my period, how can I find some relief?These are the best cures for those pesky flu-like symptoms:Pop a NSAID. These are technically known as prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. "They block the making of more prostaglandins," Dr. Minkin says. "So the key there is taking them early when you start feeling achy and fluish." These pills include aspirin, Motrin, and Advil. Move around. Exercise helps everything (but you already knew that, right?). "Exercise has been shown over and over again to help with menstrual cramps and PMS symptoms overall," Dr. Dweck says. Aerobic exercise will bring you right back to life by also reducing water retention and excess fluid in your joints.Talk to your doc about birth control. Your estrogen levels decline when you get your period, as you learned. So taking birth control can be a huge help. "Birth control pills keep your hormone levels steady throughout the month by preventing ovulation," Dr. Dweck says.Monitor your diet. Instead of upping your caffeine intake to stay awake or eating more junk food (because: cravings), which can create inflammation that leads to flu-like joint pain, try drinking tea (it’s naturally anti-inflammatory). And next time you want to go in on that entire bag of potato chips, try a snack lower in sodium instead.If no intervention is really working for you and you keep feeling horrible when flow is comin' to town, speak with your gynecologist. They can do a proper workup and help you feel A-okay when your period comes your way.Alexis JonesAssistant EditorAlexis Jones is an assistant editor at Women's Health where she writes across several verticals on WomensHealthmag.com, including life, health, sex and love, relationships and fitness, while also contributing to the print magazine.
