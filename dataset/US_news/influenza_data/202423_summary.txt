CDC's Global Influenza Program aims to improve global capacity to prevent and respond to seasonal and pandemic influenza.
The program works with global partners to establish and maintain flu surveillance and laboratory capacity, develop pandemic plans and prevention policies, and conduct research projects.
CDC serves as a WHO Collaborating Center for monitoring seasonal flu and detecting novel flu strains.
The program has supported activities in over 125 countries and has published over 989 staff publications since 2004.
Program priorities include optimizing surveillance and response activities, generating evidence for flu vaccines and antiviral use, strengthening vaccine policies and programs, and enhancing pandemic preparedness.
Seasonal flu surveillance is essential for global health security and supports pandemic preparedness.
Information on global flu activity can be found on the CDC's website.
