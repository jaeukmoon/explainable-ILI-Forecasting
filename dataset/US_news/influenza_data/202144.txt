The limited genetic information of pre-pandemic seasonal IAVs in Chile has made it difficult to accurately reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of these viruses within the country. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile. We sequenced the complete genome of 42 historic IAV obtained between 1996 and 2007. The phylogeny was determined using HA sequences and complemented using other segments. Time-scale phylogenetic analyses revealed that the diversity of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile was influenced by continuous introductions of new A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 lineages and constant viral exchange between Chile and other countries every year. These results provide important knowledge about genetic diversity and evolutionary patterns of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile, which can help design optimal surveillance systems and prevention strategies. However, future studies with current sequences should be conducted.

The last influenza pandemic was caused by a novel lineage of Influenza A/H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09), causing more than 123,000 global deaths from March to December 20092. This strain displaced the previous human seasonal IAV A/H1N1 subtype that was circulating before the pandemic3. Today, A/H1N1pdm09 is co-circulating seasonally with A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses3, and its viral dynamic is well known due to surveillance efforts and novel sequencing platforms4,5. Before the A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic, information about IAV genetic diversity was scarce, and only the HA gene was commonly sequenced. The viral dynamic of IAV circulating before the 2009 pandemic is still unknown in most of the world, especially in developing and least-developed countries.The viral circulation is important to maintain seasonal IAV strains. Seasonal IAV is driven by introducing new lineages from other countries rather than a local persistence of lineages circulating from previous epidemics6,7,8,9. For example, studies suggest that A/H3N2 viruses originate from an ecological source located in East and Southeast Asia, and from there, spread to other regions of the world9,10. On the contrary, Asian regions play a limited role in disseminating new lineages of A/H1N1 viruses3,10. Also, a recently published complex metapopulation model of the spatial spread proposes several geographic areas act as potential sources of new variants3,6,7. In this way, the annual seasonal pattern is characterized by an increase in activity during the winter season in temperate regions11, and during the rainy season in the tropics12.In South America and in general in the southern hemisphere, the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of circulating IAVs have only been partially explored due to the lack of IAV sequences. Some studies indicate that in South America IAV strains do not persist locally between seasons, and genetic diversity is driven by the northern regions of the continent, mainly influenced by North America13,14,15. In Chile, the information about IAV before the A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic is scarce. Only 43 HA sequences are publicly available, and there are no studies on the epidemiology and/or evolutionary dynamics of human IAVs. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the diversity of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile, filling the information gap in the region.ResultsGenetic evolution of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in ChileHuman IAV isolates were genetically characterized to evaluate the diversity and genetic evolution of pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile. Forty-two out of 57 IAV isolates obtained in this study were successfully whole-genome sequenced (GenBank accession numbers MN054079-MN055475). Those viruses were classified as subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. H1N1 viruses were isolated in 1996 (1) and 2000 (11), while H3N2 viruses were obtained in 1996 (11), 2001 (8), 2003 (2), 2004 (5), 2005 (3), and 2007 (1). In public depositories we found two IAV complete genomes, 30 HA, 17 NA, and 13M segments published before 2009, derived from H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes. Fifty-four pre-pandemic IAV Chilean strains were classified as H3N2, 30 as H1N1, and 1 H1N2 subtypes. All Chilean pre-pandemic influenza sequences were incorporated in a table summarizing overall results (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).Table 1 Overall results of Chilean human-origin IAV obtained from 54 H3N2, 30 H1N1 and 1 H1N2 collected between 1994 and 2008.Full size tableTime-scale phylogenetic analyses of the HA1 region were performed to study the H1 and H3 subtypes independently. The phylogeny showed that the H1 Chilean sequences are distributed in 15 different genetic lineages. According to node support (≥ 75% posterior probability), these sequences are related to viruses from different locations, especially from South and North America, and a lesser extent, from Asia (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2), evidencing an extensive global exchange of viruses between different geographic regions (continents). At least three lineages were observed co-circulating in Chile during the same year, especially in 2000, 2006, and 2008 (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). The evolutionary analysis shows that the Chilean HA sequences are the last to appear in their respective genetic lineages, suggesting that Chile is one of the regions with the latest IAV arrival. An inter-seasonal extinction of Chilean H1 lineages was observed, as it is also observed in other geographical regions; however, some viruses were transmitted to other countries after they arrived in Chile in 2000, 2006 and 2008 (genetic lineages B, G, and N) (Fig. 1). The genetic lineages B and G are well supported with 100% posterior probability, but genetic lineage N with only 1% posterior probability. On the other hand, the H1N2 isolate (genetic lineage F) was grouped with viruses of the same subtype that were circulating globally between 2001 and 2003. The mean evolutionary rate for H1 subtype was 3.3 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year (95% highest probability density (HPD): 2.9–3.7 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year).Figure 1Time-scale Bayesian MCC tree of the HA1 portion of IAVs subtype H1 isolated around the world in the period 1990–2008. Branches are shaded by continent of origin. The genetic lineages that Chilean sequences group are highlighted and identified with the letters A-O. The H1N1 human seasonal influenza vaccine strains used in the southern hemisphere between 1999 and 2008 are included. The A/H1N2 genetic lineage is identified. The posterior probabilities are included for key nodes (Supplementary Table 2).Full size imageAccording to the time-scale phylogenetic analysis of the H3 subtype (Fig. 2), the mean evolutionary rate for the HA1 region was 3.9 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year (HPD 95%: 3.5–4.2 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year). As in the results obtained for the H1 subtype, an extensive global exchange of viruses between different geographic regions was identified. An inter-seasonal extinction of the Chilean H3 lineages was also evidenced. The phylogeny revealed that Chilean H3 sequences are distributed in 23 different genetic lineages (A–W) related to viruses from different geographic regions. Unlike the H1 subtype and based on well-supported genetic lineages (≥ 75% posterior probability), these sequences are commonly related to sequences from North America and Asia, and a lesser extent, from South America and Europe (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). A co-circulation of two to five lineages in the same year was observed, specifically in 1996, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Viral interchange from Chile to other geographical regions was evidenced in at least eight opportunities, in 1994, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007 (genetic lineages A, D, F, G, J, L, U, and W) (Fig. 2); however, the only genetic lineages A or U are well supported with 97 and 89% posterior probability. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and related sequences (continent of origin) of Chilean H1 and H3 sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.Figure 2Time-scale Bayesian MCC tree of the HA1 portion of IAVs subtype H3 isolated around the world in the period 1990–2008. Branches are shaded by continent of origin. The genetic lineages that Chilean sequences group are highlighted and identified with the letters A-W. The H3N2 human seasonal influenza vaccine strains used in the southern hemisphere between 1999 and 2008 are included. The posterior probabilities are included for key nodes (Supplementary Table 2).Full size imageThe phylogenetic relationships of the rest of the genes NA, PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS were in concordance with the results observed for the HA trees (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2).Amino acid sequence analysis of human seasonal IAVs in ChileGenetic analyses based on HA1 amino acid sequences were performed to determine the genetic clusters and to predict potential antigenic evolution of worldwide human seasonal IAV sequences (1990–2008). These analyses show that these IAVs were grouped into four genetic clusters for H1 and three genetic clusters for H3 (Figs. 3, 4, respectively). For each subtype, clusters were named according to the year of emergence, with cluster 1 being the first to emerge. All clusters evidence circulation in all geographic regions, including South America and Chile. In general, Asia is the geographic region where IAV strains from each genetic cluster were isolated for the first time, while South America, including Chile, is the region where IAV strains from each genetic cluster were isolated for the last time. This could suggest that this clusters generally originate from Asia and finally reach South America. However, this cannot be confirmed due to limited data. Co-circulation of different IAV clusters of the same subtype in Chile was also observed in 2000, 2006, and 2008 for subtype H1, while for subtype H3 in 2003 (Supplementary Tables 2, 3).Figure 3Genetic analysis of H1 influenza A viruses (IAVs) based on HA1 amino acid sequences.

IAV subtypes A/H1N1, A/H1N2, and A/H3N2 co-circulated in the Chilean population before the 2009 pandemic. The A/H3N2 subtype was the most commonly detected and sequenced in that period. These results are consistent with the global circulation patterns described for seasonal IAVs3,10,16. In general, A/H3N2 has been the dominant subtype since it first emerged in 196817, despite the re-emergence of the H1N1 subtype in 197718. The subtype A/H1N2 identified in this study in 2003 correspond to a reassortant virus that circulated around the world between 2001 and 200319.The average evolution rate estimated for the HA1 region of the H3 subtype is likely higher (3.9 × 10–3; HPD 95%: 3.5–4.2 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year) than that estimated for the H1 subtype (3.3 × 10–3; HPD 95%: 2.9–3.7 × 10–3 substitutions/site/year), which is consistent with previous studies3,10. As expected, phylogenetic analyses for H1 and H3 subtypes showed an extensive viral exchange between Chile and the other regions of the world, evidencing a continuous genetic flow inside and outside Chile, beyond a closed evolutionary system in the country. Pre-pandemic Chilean IAVs are mainly related to sequences from South America, North America, and Asia. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which reported that viruses arriving in South America originate mainly from North America and that there is a continuous viral exchange between South American countries8,14,15. However, A/H3N2 virus introductions would also come from Europe, indicating that the epidemic outbreaks in Chile every year are influenced by viruses from different geographical regions, which may differ antigenically. These results are also supported by the records of arrival of foreign tourists to Chile obtained between 2008 and 2021 by the Chilean Undersecretariat of Tourism, where a total of 48 117 494 tourists came mainly from South American countries (78.3%), Europeans (10.6%), North Americans (6.6%) and Asians (1.5%)20.In general, previous studies have described that A/H3N2 lineages do not persist locally between epidemics, while A/H1N1 lineages can persist for several seasons and show more complex global dynamics3. In this study, a circulation of multiple A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 lineages was evidenced during the same season, which came from different geographic regions and generally disappeared at the end of each outbreak in Chile. This result shows a wide genetic diversity in each flu season in Chile, which is produced by introducing new A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 lineages from other countries rather than the local persistence of lineages from the previous season.All IAV genetic clusters (based on amino acid sequences) determined in this study have circulated worldwide, showing the global distribution of this virus. In general, Asia is the geographic region where IAV strains from each genetic cluster were isolated for the first time. A similar situation occurs in Oceania, Europe, and North America. While Africa and South America, including Chile, are the regions where IAV strains from each genetic cluster were isolated for the last time. However, few sequences from Africa and South America have been published compared to the rest of the continents, and therefore there could be information bias. Although the surveillance was improved after the IAV pandemic in 2009, it is still insufficient in some countries, such as Chile. Previously, it has been shown that Asia plays an important role in transmitting seasonal human IAVs, showing that most lineages ultimately originated from this geographic region3,6,9,21,22.Both sparse and bias sampling of specific geographic areas limit the interpretation of transmission patterns, and very similar IAV gene sequences from the same or different locations do not necessarily imply direct linkage, therefore, not reflecting the exact migration pathways of the virus23. For that reason, it is very important to qualify some interpretations of our phylogenies, such as the origin of the Chilean sequences and the inter-seasonal extinction of the viruses in Chile. In the first case, our phylogenies have an overrepresentation of sequences from North America, Asia, and Europe, and a scarce amount from Africa, Oceania, and South America. On the other hand, oversampling of specific geographic areas can lead to these areas becoming "sinks", where the overrepresentation of a geographic area causes phylogenetic estimates that viruses emerge from that geographic area23. In the second case, we identified that there would be an inter-seasonal extinction of viruses in Chile; however, despite the addition of 42 new IAV genomes, the total number of sequences are still insufficient spatially and temporally to ensure that there would not be a closed evolutionary system in the country from 1 year to another or from a couple of seasons.Notably, the clusters determined by the genetic analysis carried out in this study, based on amino acid sequences, were similar (years of circulation) to the antigenic clusters obtained by previously published antigenic analyses, based on hemagglutination inhibition assay, specifically for the H3 subtype22,24. This result suggests that this method is a good tool to predict IAV antigenic evolution. However, we did not differentiate between some previously described antigenic clusters24, because there are only a few amino acid substitutions in the HA1 domain between the strains representing these clusters. Only one amino acid substitution in the HA1 domain can cause a high antigenic impact25.In conclusion, the results obtained in this study indicate that pre-pandemic human seasonal IAVs in Chile are influenced by continuous introductions of viral variants from other geographic regions and that there is a continuous viral exchange between different countries. Moreover, a wide genetic diversity was observed co-circulating in the same season in Chile. This is the first study on human IAV phylodynamic in Chile, providing important knowledge about genetic diversity and evolutionary patterns of human seasonal IAVs in Chile, which can help design optimal surveillance systems and prevention strategies. A limitation of this study was the small number of IAV sequences (data) published in South American countries, especially Chile. Greater IAV surveillance, sequencing and phylogeographic analyses are necessary to support these results, including post-pandemic IAVs that are currently circulating.Materials and methodsVirusesFifty-seven human IAV pre-pandemic isolates were provided by the Virology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile. These isolates were collected in Santiago, Chile, from suspected patients, other epidemiological data is not available. The samples collection was performed using Vacuum-Assisted Nasopharyngeal Aspirates (NPAs) and the viral isolation attempted in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, which were kindly provided by Dr. Goyal at University of Minnesota. The isolates were obtained from samples collected in 1996 (19 isolates), 2000 (11), 2001 (11), 2003 (3), 2004 (9), 2005 (3), and 2007 (1). The isolated were preserved at – 80 °C until sequencing. Informed consents were obtained from all subjects or their legal guardian(s). All methods and consent forms were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Universidad de Chile, and the Ethics Committee of the North Metropolitan Health Service, Chile (project Fondecyt Nº 194 0527 Apr 1994–Mar 1997; Nº 194 0527; and Fondecyt Nº 198 0892 Apr 1998 – Mar 2007).Virus confirmation and propagationFirst the IAV isolates were tested using real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) to reconfirm the IAV presence. After, isolates were propagated in MDCK cells to yield enough virus to attempt the whole genome sequencing. Briefly, RNA was extracted by TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and tested by rRT-PCR, amplifying a conserved region of the matrix gene26. rRT-PCR positive isolates were propagated in MDCK cells previously cultured using minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic solution27. Confluent MDCK monolayers were washed twice with PBS containing 1 μg/mL of trypsin treated with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, USA), inoculated with each IAV isolate, and incubated for virus absorption for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with PBS to eliminate the unbound virus, and an IAV growth medium (MEM supplemented with 1 μg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic solution) was added. The monolayers were incubated at 37 °C and observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) daily for 5 days. The supernatants of cultures without CPE were re-inoculated in MDCK cells and observed for another 5 days28. Isolates were tested by rRT-PCR and Hemagglutination assay to confirm the presence of IAV28,29. RNA was submitted to the Molecular Virology Laboratory, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile for further steps.Whole genome sequencingThe whole IAV genome was amplified by a multisegment RT-PCR (mRT-PCR)30 and sequenced by Illumina. The mRT-PCR was performed at Molecular Virology Laboratory, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Briefly, RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and PCR amplification with the SuperScript III high-fidelity RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), using the primers Opti1-F1 (5-GT TA CGC GCC AGC AAA AGC AGG), Opti1-F2 (5-GTT ACG CGC CAG CGA AAG CAG G), y Opti1-R1 (5′-GTT ACG CGC CAG TAG AAA CAA GG). A 50 μL total RT-PCR volume containing 25 μL of buffer, 0.35 μL of Opti1-F1, 0,65 of Opti1-F2 and 1 μL of Opti1-R1, 1 μL of Enzyme Mix, 17 μL of water, and 5 μL of RNA was performed. The thermal cycler program consisted of one cycle of 55 °C for 2 min, 42 °C for 60 min and 94 °C for 2 min, five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 44 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3,5 min; 26 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3.5 min, and one cycle of 68 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP 5-ml kit (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and those with ≥ 25 ng/μL of DNA concentration were submitted for sequencing. The purified PCR products were submitted to the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis (CRIP), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York City, NY, USA) for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic analyzes for all IAV segments were performed. Sequence alignments were separately constructed for HA (H1 and H3 subtypes), NA (N1 and N2 subtypes) and each internal gene segment (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS), using MUSCLE v3.8.331. Reference sequences available in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu Database32 were incorporated, including all Chilean sequences available. The CD-HIT program33 was used to cluster the sequences according to each continent’s genetic diversity per year and thus select some representative sequences of each cluster. This allowed us to reduce the data sets for the construction of phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method using IQ-TREE with substitution model selection (ModelFinder implememted in IQ-TREE) option and 1000 bootstraps34.Additionally, for the HA segment, the encoded HA1 domain was analyzed using time-scaled Bayesian analyses. The HA1 domain is the most variable region of the virus35,36,37,38; therefore, it is selected for the time scaled tree14. The number of sequences by geographic origin in the H1 subtype database was as follows (number in parentheses indicate number of sequences): Chile (31), South America (53), North America (119), Europe (89), Africa (39), Asia (145) and Oceania (34); and for H3 subtype was as follow: Chile (50), South America (47), North America (147), Europe (141), Africa (32), Asia (238) and Oceania (80). Phylogenetic relationships of the HA from subtypes H1 (510) and H3 (735) were inferred for each data set separately using the time-scaled Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods available via the BEAST v1.10.4 package39. Two clock models including strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) relaxed clocks, and four demographic models (constant size, exponential growth, logistic growth and expansion growth) were tested independently. The best molecular clock model was tested by marginal likelihood estimation (MLE)40. An UCLN molecular clock was used, with a general-time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with a gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. For the H1 subtype, we used an expansion growth demographic model, while for the H3 subtype, we used a logistic population size model. The MCMC was run for at least 200 million iterations, with sub-sampling every 10,000 iterations for each data set. The BEAGLE library was used to improve computational performance41. All parameters reached convergence, as assessed visually using Tracer v1.6 (http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/softwareracer/), with statistical uncertainty reflected by values of the 95% highest posterior density (HDP). The initial 10% of the chain was removed as burn-in, and maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.8.042. Chilean sequences that are grouped into genetic lineages that are supported by a ≥ 75% posterior probability will be considered for inferring the main results from the phylogenies.Amino acid sequence analysisWe analyzed amino acid sequences, deduced from nucleotide sequences, encoding the HA1 domain (327 amino acids for subtype H1 and 329 amino acids for subtype H3). The sequence alignment was done with MUSCLE v3.8.331. We computed pairwise distances between amino acid sequences to construct a dissimilarity matrix, using the method p-distance in MEGA software (version 7.0.26)43. Genetic clusters were defined by Ward’s method based on the Euclidean distances among strains, and a 3-dimensional (3D) genetic map was constructed with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) method, using the XLSTAT software (version 2020.1.2)25. Worldwide human seasonal IAV sequences, between 1990 and 2008, were included in the analyses. Reference sequences were obtained from GISAID EpiFlu Database32. ReferencesIuliano, A. D. et al.

Magor1,2*1Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada2Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada3Division of Virology, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United StatesDucks are the natural host and reservoir of influenza A virus (IAV), and as such are permissive to viral replication while being unharmed by most strains. It is not known which mechanisms of viral control are globally regulated during infection, and which are specific to tissues during infection. Here we compare transcript expression from tissues from Pekin ducks infected with a recombinant H5N1 strain A/Vietnam 1203/04 (VN1203) or an H5N2 strain A/British Columbia 500/05 using RNA-sequencing analysis and aligning reads to the NCBI assembly ZJU1.0 of the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos) genome. Highly pathogenic VN1203 replicated in lungs and showed systemic dissemination, while BC500, like most low pathogenic strains, replicated in the intestines. VN1203 infection induced robust differential expression of genes all three days post infection, while BC500 induced the greatest number of differentially expressed genes on day 2 post infection. While there were many genes globally upregulated in response to either VN1203 or BC500, tissue specific gene expression differences were observed. Lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 and intestines of birds infected with BC500, tissues important in influenza replication, showed highest upregulation of pattern recognition receptors and interferon stimulated genes early in the response. These tissues also appear to have specific downregulation of inflammatory components, with downregulation of distinct sets of proinflammatory cytokines in lung, and downregulation of key components of leukocyte recruitment and complement pathways in intestine. Our results suggest that global and tissue specific regulation patterns help the duck control viral replication as well as limit some inflammatory responses in tissues involved in replication to avoid damage.IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV) causes disease in both humans and animals, resulting in periodic epidemics and potentially global pandemics. Mallard ducks (Anas playrhynchos) are the natural host and reservoir IAV, and as such are highly resistant to viral pathology or mortality while still being permissive to viral replication (1–3). In birds, the virus is categorized as either highly or low-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI or LPAI, respectively) depending on the outcome of infection in chicken (4, 5). Ducks are resistant to both HPAI and LPAI viral strains of IAV, although it is of note that some H5 strains can cause severe pathology or even mass die offs in ducks (6–8). HPAI strains replicate in the lungs of infected ducks and chickens causing more pathology to infected animals, and these strains can also cause systemic dissemination of viral particles (7, 9). LPAI strains replicate in the intestines of ducks to high titers without causing serious lesions (1, 10). This adaption allows the virus to be spread in excrement, and transferred through shared waterways, or when ducks fly over poultry farms, giving the ducks the moniker of the “Trojan horses” of infection (11). In particular, H5Ny strains of influenza continue to be enzootic in ducks and remain of concern for their pandemic potential (12).The duck mounts a robust immune response to IAV, involving key viral detectors and effectors, as recently reviewed (13–15). Key to the duck’s innate defense is the cytoplasmic sensor DExD/H-Box Helicase 58etinoic acid-inducible gene I (DDX58/RIG-I) which detects IAV, and the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signaling pathway. Notably, components of this pathway differ between ducks and chickens (5, 16–22). We have postulated that RIG-I being absent in chickens is one of the main reasons why chickens are so susceptible to IAV when compared to ducks (17).While there are significant differences in basal expression of duck innate receptors and downstream effectors between tissues (15), it is still unknown how different tissues contribute to resistance to IAV and yet control damage from IAV infection despite high viral load. As ducks share a long evolutionary history with IAV (2) it is likely that global changes, not just the immune response, contribute to protection. Additionally, due to constant selective pressures from the virus, the duck may have unique antiviral effectors or splice isoforms. By comparing immune responses in tissues during replication we may discern differences in global response to avian influenza in ducks that are key to surviving highly pathogenic viruses that replicate systemically, while also permitting replication of harmless strains in intestine.Several groups have examined gene expression in duck tissues following challenge with H5N1 strains of influenza. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on Shaoxin ducks infected with high and low pathogenic H5N1 strains (23), but this study was limited to lung tissues. Kumar and colleagues examined genome wide gene expression patterns to high and low pathogenic H5N1 viruses in ducks, and compared lung transcriptomes at 5 days post-infection (24). Smith and colleagues sequenced RNA from domestic Gray mallards and chickens infected with high and low pathogenic H5 strains (25) and focus on gene expression contributing to species differences in IAV susceptibility. However, these studies did not compare differences in gene expression between duck tissues involved in viral infection.In our previous study comparing duck responses to highly and low pathogenic viruses, ducks infected with rgA/Vietnam 1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/British Columbia 500/2005 (H5N2) upregulated key innate immune genes, and although we characterized only a limited number of genes using qPCR, the ducks rapidly cleared both viruses with robust early responses (26). Our aim is to extend this study by aligning pair-ended RNA-seq data to the current Pekin duck genome assembly (ZJU1.0) to analyze the global differential expression patterns in tissues involved in viral replication (lungs or intestine) and the lymphatic response (spleen) and identify novel candidate genes for future exploration.Here we obtain transcriptome information from polyadenylated RNA of ducks infected with a reverse genetics version of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain rgA/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203) and the low pathogenic H5N2 strain A/mallard/BC/500/05 (BC500). We look at the global differential expression (DE) in lung and spleen of Pekin ducks infected with VN1203; and lung, spleen and intestines of ducks infected with BC500. We have highlighted differences and similarities in differential expression of transcripts and identified sets of genes that have arisen by duplication and may contribute to host specific resistance. Our results suggest that tissue specific regulation mechanisms may play an integral role in both providing protection against IAV replication while limiting inflammatory responses.MethodsViral Infection and RNA CollectionViral infection and tissue collection were described previously (17, 27). Briefly, the VN1203 strain A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) was recreated using reverse genetics (28), while the BC500 strain A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) was collected during routine surveillance of wild ducks in British Columbia, Canada. Outbred 6 week old Pekin ducks from Metzer Farm or Ideal Poultry were used for this study. Ducks were mock treated with PBS or infected with 106 of 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) of VN1203 or BC500 using the natural route of infection by dripping virus in nares, eyes and trachea. Viral replication was tracked by taking tracheal and cloacal swabs from some ducks, and reported previously (27). For BC500, cloacal swabs were positive at 2 and 3 days post-infection (dpi), and tracheal swabs were negative. For VN1203, tracheal swabs were positive at 3 dpi, while cloacal swabs were negative. Influenza RNA quantification showed M gene was highly expressed in lung and spleen for all three days in VN1203 infected ducks (26). At 1, 2 or 3 dpi, ducks were euthanized, tissues were harvested and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were DNAse treated and stored at -80°C. Lung, spleen and intestine samples from mock treated animals were collected from 3 ducks at each time point (1, 2 and 3 dpi), however due to RNA quality, only 1 duck from mock infected animals on 2 dpi was used. RNA samples from lung and spleen from VN1203 infected ducks were used from 4 ducks at each time point, while RNA samples from lung, spleen and intestines from BC500 infected ducks were from 3 ducks at each time point. The sex of each duck was determined from raw read counts of the SWIM6 gene (LOC101797738) in each RNA sample. SWIM6 is located on the W chromosome found in WZ females, but not ZZ males, and was established as a valid determinant of avian embryo sex by He and colleagues (29). A table of each sample name and corresponding sex of the duck can be found in Supplementary File 1.Library Construction and SequencingLibrary preparation and poly-adenylated RNA sequencing were performed by LC Sciences (https://www.lcsciences.com/). Briefly, RNA-seq paired end libraries were created using Illumina’s TruSeq-stranded-mRNA sample preparation protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Integrity of RNA was checked using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Two rounds of purification of poly(A) containing mRNAs were performed using oligo-dT magnetic beads. cDNA libraries were made and quality was assessed using Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Chip. Paired-ended sequencing of the cDNA libraries was performed using llumina’s NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. The sequencing resulted in paired 150 bp reads with approximately 6GB of data per run, resulting in a sequencing depth of approximately 40 million reads per sample.Sequence data was submitted to NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) under the BioProject ID PRJNA767080.Sequence Analysis and Differential ExpressionLC Sciences used CutAdapt (30) to remove adaptors and low-quality bases and then verified for quality using FastQC (Available online at: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). We used Trimmomatic (31) on these reads to further separate paired end reads and remove unpaired reads from the data. RNA sequence reads were aligned to the NCBI genome of the mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos, assembly ZJU1.0) using HISAT2 version 2.20 (32). Reads were counted and sorted using FeatureCounts version 2.0.0 (33). Due to the overall rate of unassessed gene duplications in the genome, multi-mapped reads were counted and fractionally assigned to features. Reads were sorted by “feature” for differential expression between exons, and “Meta-feature” for differential expression between transcripts.Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed in the R studio environment version 4.0.0 using EdgeR (34). Library sizes were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM). Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the number of DE genes of infected tissues compared to their internal control samples. Genes were considered DE if FDR<0.05 and fold change (FC) >2 and were used in downstream analysis. All DE genes for both VN1203 and BC500 experiments can be found in Supplementary File 2. Venn diagrams comparing expressed genes were made using DiVenn (35) or Venny 2.1 (36).The EdgeR function diffspliceDGE was used to assess alternative splicing events during infection. All alternatively spliced genes for both VN1203 and BC500 experiments can be found in Supplementary File 3.Enrichment and STRING AnalysisDifferentially expressed genes were combined for all three days of infection in each different tissue, infected with VN1203 or BC500. These genes were subjected to over-representation analysis (ORA) for gene ontology biological process (GO BP) terms, with the noRedundant filter added to reduce redundant enrichment terms on WebGestalt (37).Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) diagrams were made using Cytoscape version 3.8.0 (38). Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in Cytoscape using the STRING app for STRING diagrams and enrichment (39). Due to the relative incompleteness of avian enrichment and interaction databases, all gene names were changed to the human equivalent and searched against the human database.Gene Annotation and IdentificationMany of the annotations in the NCBI file had only numerical descriptions, and not annotated gene names. To assign names to those with significant hits from the DEG lists, we searched on NCBI and if available from the description, the gene name was manually assigned. Gene names were changed using a find and replace macro in excel (Supplementary File 4) written by www.extendedoffice.com (https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/1873-excel-find-and-replace-multiple-values-at-once.html). Any genes flagged in the datasets named with location numbers only were submitted to NCBI BLAST to search against both the bird and mammalian databases. For genes without significant BLAST orthologs, the location number identifier was not changed. Genes flagged as significant which had the same gene name as others in the list were investigated to determine if this was a genome mis-assembly, paralogous gene or misidentification through BLAST, using protein alignments, and chromosomal locations.To differentiate genes in our results we applied certain rules to naming related genes. Genes with the “pseudogene” designation in NCBI were assigned a “-pseu” suffix. Likewise, genes classified as noncoding RNA (ncRNA) were given a “-ncRNA” suffix. Genes which were identified as “like” another gene on NCBI were given the “-L” suffix. In cases where multiple genes in one dataset were classified with the same name with the “-L” suffix, the genes were numbered as “-L#”, with the lowest number being closest in chromosomal location to the presumed ortholog or the annotated gene on NCBI. Genes which shared identical names, that could not be clarified by the above methods kept their gene names but were given a numerical suffix in the order of the genes on their respective chromosomes (i.e. “PARP14.1, PARP14.2).ResultsRNA Sequencing Reads From Ducks Infected With VN1203 or BC500 Align to Genome and Cluster by Tissue and Virus InfectionTo determine the quality of our RNA reads and amount of coverage over the duck genome, we aligned our RNA-seq data to the NCBI Anas platyrhynchos genome assembly ZJU1.0. The average alignment rate of RNA sequencing reads to genome was 92%. Counted and sorted reads were successfully assigned to features at an average rate of 75%, indicating good coverage and sequencing depth of samples. The counted and assigned reads for each sample when graphed using multidimensional scaling (MDS) clustered with similar tissue (Figure 1A) and virus type (Figure 1B). Samples from lung and spleen tissues from VN1203 infected ducks were very distinct from tissues from BC500 infected and mock treated ducks, while tissues from infected ducks were distinct from mock treated samples. As intestine samples were taken only from ducks infected with BC500, we expanded our MDS analysis to include day post infection (dpi), where 1 and 3 dpi clustered more closely than 2 dpi. One mock treated intestine sample (MI1) was an outlier in this group, however as it clustered with other intestine samples, and did not significantly change the overall analysis when removed (data not shown), we kept it in in the data set for further analysis. Sex of ducks is indicated by color coding of samples (Figure 1B). Of note, control birds were a mix of male versus female ducks (4:3). Ratios of male to female ducks infected with LPAI were 1:2, 2:1, and 2:1 on 1, 2 and 3 dpi respectively. Ratios of male to female ducks infected with HPAI were 3:1, 3:1 and 2:2 on 1, 2 and 3 dpi. The MDS plot suggests some segregation of samples according to sex.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot of normalized individual RNA-sequencing experiments. MDS plots were made in the EdgeR program comparing the top 200 logFC results between each sample. Individual samples and their relative similarity and differences were compared using dimensions 1 and 2 (A) and dimensions 1 and 4 (B). Individual plot points were named by treatment (VN, VN1203; BC, BC500 and M, Mock), tissue (L, Lung; S, Spleen and I, intestine) and dpi (1, 2 and 3). Ex: Spleen from mock treated duck 1 dpi = MS1. Individual male ducks are identified by a blue dot and females by a red dot.VN1203 Infected Ducks Have More Differential Gene Expression Than Those Infected With BC500To evaluate the number of genes differentially expressed in lungs, spleens and intestines of ducks infected with VN1203 or BC500, we used Fisher’s exact test to compare infected tissues to control on 1, 2 and 3 dpi. Lung and spleen samples from VN1203 infected ducks had the most statistically significant (FDR<0.05) DEGs on all three days of infection, while BC500 infected ducks had much less DE in lungs and spleen (Table 1). We have previously reported much higher transcript levels following VN1203 than BC500 infection when analyzing expression of individual immune genes (26). In contrast to other tissues sampled in BC500 challenged ducks, the intestines had more DEGs, although most were below the threshold for fold change cutoff (Table 1).TABLE 1 Table 1 Differentially expressed genes in tissues from ducks infected with VN1203 or BC500.To determine how many genes were similarly upregulated or downregulated on all three days of infection, genes were filtered by FDR (>0.05) and log2(FC). Although each tissue had a number of unique altered genes there was considerable overlap of DE genes in lung and spleen on each day post infection (Figure 2A). At 1 dpi with VN1203, 852 DE genes are common between lung and spleen, with most genes upregulated. However, at 3 dpi the number of DEGs unique to lung are greatly increased.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Venn diagrams showing overlap of gene expression on 1, 2 and 3 dpi in VN1203 infected ducks. Differentially expressed genes were assigned up or down regulated based on log2(FC) (upregulated>1, downregulated<-1) and overlap of DEGs was compared between tissues using DiVenn (A). Overlap of up or downregulated gene populations specific to each tissue in ducks infected with VN1203 in lung (B) or spleen (C) created using Venny 2.1.To determine if the same subsets of genes were either up or down regulated on all days of VN1203 infection, we created VENN diagrams to compare gene regulation within each tissue. Genes that were up or downregulated during VN1203 infection in lung (Figure 2B) or spleen (Figure 2C) were analyzed to see how many were expressed during all 3 dpi, and how many changed expression depending on day. In the lung only 20% of upregulated genes were upregulated on all days of infection. This is similar in the spleen, where 18% of genes were upregulated on all days of infection. In both lung and spleen, the most DE specific to day of infection happens on 1 dpi (36% in lung, 31% in spleen), while 2 dpi has the lowest number of genes specific to that day differentially expressed (5% in lung, 6% in spleen). A similar pattern emerges for the downregulated genes, as only 13% of the downregulated DEGs were downregulated all days of infection in both lung and spleen. Once again, 2 dpi had the lowest number of downregulated DEG specific to that day (8% in lung, 6% in spleen).GO Biological Process Enrichment Analyses Find Commonalities and Dissimilarities Between VN1203 and BC500 InfectionTo determine which pathways were enriched in each tissue during infection with VN1203 or BC500, we submitted DE genes to the WebGestalt server. All DE genes were clustered together to allow for analysis of enriched GO terms on all three days post infection, and the top 10 statistically significant (FDR<0.05) hits were reported in Figure 3. Results were separated into terms in common (GO terms enriched in all tissues sampled) or unique to tissue (spleen and lung in VN1203 infection, spleen, lung, and intestine for BC500 infection). During VN1203 infection, most of the commonly enriched pathways represented by upregulated DEGs were involved in immune responses (Figure 3A). Both innate and adaptive immune terms were enriched (GO:0045088 and GO:0002250). Likewise, response to virus was also highly enriched (GO:0009615). Pathways that were enriched by unique upregulated DEGs in spleen included many terms involved in protein folding, and misfolded protein responses (GO:0034976, GO:0035966, GO:0032527 and GO:0018196). Likely, these pathways and those involved in cell motility (GO:2000147) are enriched due to immune cell accumulation and activation. The lung of VN1203 infected ducks was enriched with terms involving actin and cytoskeleton rearrangement (GO:0031532 and GO:0043062), and cell surface signaling pathways (GO:0007186).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Gene ontology (GO) analysis of common and uniquely differentially expressed transcripts between VN1203 and BC500 infected ducks Differentially expressed genes were assigned up or down regulated based on log2(FC) (upregulated>1, downregulated<-1) lists and were arranged as “similar between tissues”, “unique to spleen”, “unique to lung” or “unique to intestine”. For ducks infected with VN1203, the top 10 most highly enriched terms in the GO biological function category were graphed for upregulated genes (A) and downregulated genes (B). For ducks infected with BC500, the top 10 most highly enriched terms derived from upregulated genes (C) or downregulated genes (D) were identified and enrichment ratio for each term is graphed.GO term enrichment resulting from downregulated DEGs found common terms in cell adhesion (GO:0031589) and cell growth (GO:0016049) (Figure 3B). Interestingly, bone mineralization or ossification terms were also enriched in the common downregulated DEG population (GO:0060348, GO:0001503 and GO:0060348). GO terms enriched in spleens of VN1203 infected ducks due to downregulation were mostly involved in neuronal signaling and cell development, while terms enriched by downregulated DEGs in lungs were comprised of pathways involved in muscle development (GO:0060537, GO:0042692, GO:0007517 and GO:0003012) and cell cycle progression (GO:0007059, GO:0061641 and GO:0051383).DEGs upregulated during BC500 infection enriched similar pathways as those found in VN1203, however BC500 enriched the type I interferon pathway the most (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, upregulated DEG in the intestine enriched many pathways involving not only cell cycle progression, but RNA processing. Due to the overall low number of DEGs in lungs infected with BC500, there were not enough uniquely expressed DEGs to properly analyze enrichment. Upregulated genes in BC500 infected spleens only enriched five pathways and all of those were involved in immunity. There were not enough total down regulated DEGs to analyze common enrichment or unique enrichment for spleens and lungs (Figure 3D). The intestines did have unique enrichment of many pathways involved in metabolic processing of glycerolipids and fatty acids (GO:0046486 and GO:0006631) among the downregulated DEGs.VN1203 Infection Greatly Increases Alternative Splicing Events in LungTo determine if IAV infection alters alternative splicing (AS) events in lung, spleen and intestine of infected ducks, we analyzed alternative splicing events by counting differences in reads mapped to individual exons between infected and control samples. As with total DE expression, VN1203 infected lungs and spleens had many more AS events than BC500 infected tissues (Table 2), with infected lungs having the most AS events on all 3 days post infection. Lungs from ducks infected with VN1203 had 456, 50, and 267 AS events at 1, 2 and 3 dpi. Spleens from VN1203 infected ducks had 70, 57, and 106 AS events on 1, 2 and 3 dpi respectively. Interestingly, while intestine tissues from BC500 infected ducks had a much greater amount of total DE genes than other tissues infected with the same virus, intestines only had 7, 37 and 9 AS events detected on 1, 2 and 3 dpi (respectively). As IAV proteins, such as NS1, can influence AS events in the cell (40), it is possible that VN1203 infection itself is responsible for this dramatic increase in AS events.TABLE 2 Table 2 Counts of alternatively spliced (AS) transcripts in tissues of ducks infected with VN1203 or BC500.To determine the GO terminology associated with these AS events, all significant (FDR < 0.05) AS genes were submitted to the WebGestalt server. Only VN1203 infected ducks had enough genes to produce statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) GO results (Supplementary Figure 1). Lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 at 1 dpi have AS events in genes associated with muscle cell proliferation and migration (GO:0033002 and GO:0014812) (Supplementary Figure 1A). Curiously, respiratory system terms are also enriched by these AS genes (GO:0060541 and GO:0030323). Both spleens and lungs of VN1203 ducks had statistically significant enrichment of GO terms on 3 dpi (Supplementary Figure 1B). There were distinct subsets of GO terms enriched in each tissue, with lung AS genes enriching more general terms associated with actin organization (GO:0007015), protein signal transduction (GO:0051056 and GO:0007265) and general cellular and tissue growth processes. AS events in the spleen however, enriched terms involving inflammatory responses (GO:0002526 and GO:0050727), platelets (GO:0002576), humoral immune responses (GO:0006959) and migration of leukocytes (GO:0050900).The lack of statistically significant GO terms on other days in lung and spleen is likely due to the relatively low number of genes associated with AS events as well as the various functions of these genes. Repeating the RNA-sequencing with a greater sequencing depth would likely result in a more accurate sampling of AS events in these tissues.VN1203 and BC500 Infections Upregulate Shared Sets Of Genes In Spleens, Lungs, and IntestinesTo determine which genes were shared in response to virus in all three tissues sampled, we inspected the lists of DEGs on 1, 2 and 3 dpi for each tissue infected with either VN1203 or BC500 for genes in common. Between the VN1203 and BC500 infected ducks, there were 65 upregulated shared genes (Figure 4A). We subjected this set of genes to Reactome enrichment analysis using Cytoscape STRING app (Figure 4A). The largest group of genes enriched the “Reactome: Immune system” pathway. The expression patterns of genes in this group are different between VN1203 and BC500 infection (Figure 4A). VN1203 caused highest gene expression at 1 dpi while BC500 infected ducks had highest expression of most of these immune genes at 2 dpi. Indeed, when looking at statistical significance of these genes, the FDR is < 0.05 for most of these genes at 2 dpi in spleen, lung and intestine (Supplementary File 1), however this is not the case for most genes 1 and 3 dpi. The large increase of DEGs in ducks infected with BC500 at 2 dpi corresponds to viral titers, as we previously reported that these ducks had cloacal swabs negative for virus on 1 dpi, with significant viral titers on 2 and 3 dpi (27).FIGURE 4 Figure 4 VN1203 and BC500 upregulate genes shared between all tissues sampled. Lists of statistically significant (FDR<0.05) genes were compared for similarity in expression (Log2(FC)>1) and clustered together if they were expressed in (A) all tissues in VN1203 and BC500 infected ducks or (B) spleens and lungs of VN1203 infected ducks. STRING diagrams depict predicted protein-protein interactions between the products of each gene, while colour coding is based on term enrichment of Reactome pathways. No colour means that the genes did not enrich any of the Reactome terms. Reactome terms were considered significant if FDR<0.05. Enrichment and STRING diagram was created using the STRINGTIE app in Cytoscape.To determine which highly upregulated genes were in common between different tissues in VN1203 infected ducks, we filtered significant DEGs by log2(FC)>1.5. Genes that reached these parameters on 1, 2 or 3 dpi were kept, combined into a list for each tissue, then compared. We removed the 65 genes found upregulated in all tissues during both VN1203 and BC500 infection to reduce redundancy in the datasets. Repeat non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and pseudogenes were also removed. A heatmap of most upregulated DEGs in VN1203 infection was plotted showing genes corresponding to different Reactome pathways placed together (Figure 4B). The resulting STRING diagram demonstrates that most of the protein products of these genes have predicted interactions (Figure 4B). Out of the 67 total genes shared between tissues in VN1203 infection, 44 were associated with the “Reactome: Immune system” pathway. The genes enriched in the classical complement pathway have slightly different expression patterns between lung and spleen. In lungs many of these genes were upregulated 1 dpi, whereas in spleen the expression of these complement genes was sustained through all 3 days. Genes which enriched the “Reactome: Signaling by interleukins” pathway were predominantly upregulated 1 dpi. Proinflammatory interleukins IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18 are all upregulated 1 dpi, consistent with our previous qPCR analyses (41). Genes that enriched both the IFNα/β and IFNγ signaling pathways were mostly upregulated in both tissues 1 dpi. Some, such as IFNB and IFITM1 show sustained expression on all 3 days pi.Ducks infected with both VN1203 and BC500 upregulate 65 genes in common, most of which produce proteins that respond to interferons or have immune function. VN1203 strongly upregulates a different subset of genes, including genes involved in the complement cascade, proinflammatory cytokines and interleukins and various other genes involved in immune responses. While VN1203 upregulates most immune genes on 1 dpi, BC500 upregulates these genes on 2 dpi, the delay likely due to the time needed for virus to reach the intestine for replication.Unfortunately, there were no available enrichment databases that accurately placed all genes in enrichment categories. Many genes that are involved in immunity, antiviral defense or are interferon inducible are not yet added to the Reactome databases or without enough additional terms to be considered enriched in this dataset. Genes such as IFIT5 (42–45), DDX60 (46, 47), SAMD9 (48) and SAMD9L (49) are potentially involved in innate immunity or antiviral defense, yet are unclassified in this dataset.VN1203 Infection Preferentially Upregulates PRR and Signal Transduction Genes in the Lung and Interleukins in the Spleen of Infected DucksTo determine which highly upregulated genes were uniquely expressed in lung or spleen of ducks infected with VN1203, we filtered significant DEGs by log2(FC)>1.5 for all three days post infection. Genes which were found in both tissues were removed from the dataset. We removed the 65 genes found upregulated in all tissues during both VN1203 and BC500 infection, as well as repeat ncRNA and pseudogenes, as described previously.Many of the genes upregulated in lung have immune functions, however, only 20 out the total 54 “unique to lung” genes were found enriched in the “Reactome: Immune system” dataset (Figure 5A). Within this cluster there is significant overlap between accessory genes in both the “Reactome: Cytokine signaling in the immune system” and “Reactome: Signaling by interleukins” category. These genes are all upregulated on 1 dpi, with the notable exception of IFNG. IFNG is primarily upregulated in lungs and has increased expression on both 1 and 3 dpi, but curiously not on 2 dpi. Lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 also see unique expression of many PPRs, including TLR1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 4. All of these TLRs have the highest expression on 1 dpi. The other primary enrichment pathway in lungs is the “Reactome: Signal transduction” which includes “Reactome: Class A/1 (Rhodopsin-like receptors)”. The expression of these pathways is more varied, with some having highest expression at 1 dpi while others at 3 dpi.FIGURE 5 Figure 5 Genes uniquely upregulated in lungs or spleens of VN1203 infected ducks. Lists of statistically significant (FDR<0.05) genes were compared for similarity in expression (Log2(FC)>1.5) and clustered together if they were uniquely upregulated in (A) lungs of VN1203 infected or (B) spleens of VN1203 infected ducks. STRING diagrams depict predicted protein-protein interactions between the products of each gene, while colour coding is based on term enrichment of Reactome pathways. No colour means that the genes did not enrich any of the Reactome terms. Reactome terms were considered significant if FDR<0.05. Enrichment and STRING diagram was created using the STRINGTIE app in Cytoscape.Among the genes uniquely expressed in the spleen of VN1203 infected ducks, almost half enrich the “Reactome: Immune system” pathway (Figure 5B). As the spleen is secondary lymphatic tissue, it is perhaps not surprising that genes that enriched the “Reactome: MHC II antigen presentation” pathway were preferentially upregulated here. A subset of these genes also enriched the “Reactome: Cytokine signaling in the immune system” pathway, however unlike in the lung, most of these genes code for interleukins and not accessory proteins. A good proportion of the interleukin genes flagged here enriched the “Reactome Interleukin-20 family signaling” pathway. These genes have peak upregulation on 1 dpi, and interestingly, many are also greatly downregulated in lungs.VN1203 infection causes upregulation of different and specific subsets of immune genes in the lung and spleen. In lung, more genes involved in pathogen recognition and signal transduction were upregulated, while in spleen gene upregulation is centred around pro-inflammatory interleukins and peptide processing.BC500 Infection Causes Up or Downregulation of Distinct Subsets of Genes in the IntestinesTo determine which highly upregulated genes were uniquely expressed in spleen, lung or intestine of BC500 infected ducks, we filtered significant DEGs by log2(FC)>1.5 for all three days post infection (Figure 6). Genes which were found in 2 out of 3 tissues were included in this dataset (Figure 6A). For this analysis, we removed the 65 genes expressed in all tissues identified in Figure 4A. Out of the 64 genes highlighted in this dataset, 22 enriched the “Reactome: Immune system” pathway. While most genes found in this dataset in lung or spleens are also upregulated in VN1203 infection, CRISP3 is upregulated by BC500 in the lung on all 3 dpi, but not at all in VN1203 infection. Many of these genes enrich the term “Reactome: Cytokine signaling in the immune system”. These are mostly specific to spleen and intestines of BC500 infected ducks and peak at 2 dpi. This is also true for a smaller number of genes which enriched the “Reactome: Signaling by interleukins” pathway. A subset of genes enriches the “Reactome: Regulation of genes in early pancreatic cells” pathway. These genes are all transcription factors and are primarily upregulated in intestines at 2 dpi. A group of solute carrier (SLC) family member genes enriched the “Reactome: SLC-mediated membrane transport” term uniquely in intestines from BC500 ducks. These SLC genes are upregulated starting at 2 dpi. Components of the complement pathway enriched the “Reactome: Regulation of complement cascade”, similar to what is seen in VN1203 infection (Figure 5B). All three of these genes are upregulated 2 dpi in intestines, while their expression is variable in spleen and lung. It is of note that many of the highly upregulated genes specific to intestine during BC500 infection are not characterized in infection. As with the previous datasets, some genes in this dataset such as CCL28 (50) are involved in immune cell responses and others such as LY6E (51), are interferon stimulated genes (ISGs).FIGURE 6 Figure 6 Genes up or downregulated following BC500 infection of ducks. Lists of statistically significant (FDR<0.05) genes were compared for similarity in expression (Log2(FC)>1.5) and clustered together if they were uniquely upregulated in at least 2 out of 3 tissues in BC500 infected ducks (A). Lists of statistically significant (FDR<0.05) downregulated (Log2(FC)<-1) in intestine of BC500 ducks were compared to other tissues of both VN1203 and BC500 infected ducks to determine uniquely downregulated genes in intestine (B). STRING diagrams depict predicted protein-protein interactions between the products of each gene, while colour coding is based on term enrichment of Reactome pathways. No colour means that the genes did not enrich any of the Reactome terms. Reactome terms were considered significant if FDR<0.05. Enrichment and STRING diagram was created using the STRINGTIE app in Cytoscape.As IAV can replicate in the intestines to high titres without causing significant damage or pathology, we investigated the differences in downregulated genes in the intestines compared to all other tissues to see if downregulation of specific genes might minimize pathology. DEGs in the intestines were filtered by significance (FDR<0.05) and log2(FC) (<-1). From this list, we manually compared genes of interest to infection in lung and spleen of VN1203 and BC500 infected ducks. Genes which were highly downregulated in intestines that may play a role in either immune responses or viral restriction were examined in each tissue and visualized using a heatmap (Figure 6B). Many of the genes in this dataset of downregulated genes enrich the Reactome pathway “Reactome: Immune System”. These genes also enrich the “Reactome: Cytokine signaling in the immune system” and “Reactome: Signaling by interleukins”. The downregulation of these genes predominantly happens on 2 dpi, the time point when many other immune genes are upregulated in the intestines of BC500 infected ducks. The Reactome pathway “Reactome: Regulation of complement cascade” is also enriched by a subset of these downregulated genes, however unlike in Figure 6A, the genes that enrich this term also enrich the “Reactome: Activation of C3 and C5” pathway. While BC500 infection in the duck causes less DE than VN1203, there are many genes unique to the intestinal response to this virus. Many of these genes are uncharacterized in viral infection and warrant further study.Interferon and Cytokine Responses Peak at 1 dpi With VN1203, and ISGs Peak at 2 dpi With BC500To identify the genes contributing to the peak immune response in the sites of replication, we examined gene expression patterns in infected ducks. Because many important immune genes were upregulated in the lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 on 1 dpi, and most gene regulation in intestines of ducks infected with BC500 was at 2 dpi, we filtered all statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) genes on these days by expression levels and compiled lists of the top 100 most up or downregulated genes. We removed genes designated on NCBI as ncRNA or pseudogenes to limit the lists to genes that presumably code for protein. VN1203 induces a much more robust response than BC500 (Figure 7), with half of the top upregulated genes being upregulated by as much as log2(FC) of 4.5 or more, while only the top 13 genes in the BC500 dataset are above a log2(FC) of 4. Many of the top upregulated genes of the VN1203 infected lungs are cytokines (For example: IFNA, IFNB and IL12A) or interferon inducible genes (for example IFIT5, OASL and Mx). The top upregulated genes in BC500 however, are lacking high cytokine gene expression, but still have high expression of some interferon inducible genes (notably Mx).FIGURE 7 Figure 7 Top 100 upregulated genes in lungs of VN1203 and intestines of BC500 infected ducks. Lists of statistically significant (FDR<0.05) genes were filtered for the top 100 genes expressed in lungs of VN1203 infected ducks on 1 dpi, and intestines of BC500 infected ducks on 2 dpi. Redundant genes, pseudo genes and genes denoted as ncRNA in NCBI were manually removed from lists.We also expanded this analysis to the top 100 genes most downregulated on 1 dpi in VN1203 infected ducks, and on 2 dpi in BC500 infected ducks (Supplementary Figure 2). While initially it appears that downregulation is less robust in the lungs of VN1203 infected ducks, this is only on 1 dpi. Inspection of the data reveals that more significant downregulation of genes in the lungs of ducks infected with VN1203 happens at 2 and 3 dpi.DiscussionHere we compare global changes in gene expression of ducks infected with the IAV strains VN1203 or BC500 using RNA-seq analysis. We compared RNA profiles of tissues sampled to identify genes which were similarly upregulated in all infected tissues as well as genes which were uniquely upregulated in specific sites. This enabled us to delineate specific responses in sites of virus replication (lungs for VN1203, intestines for BC500) compared to lymphoid tissues (spleen). Ducks respond to VN1203 infection with a high interferon signature at 1 dpi in lung, yet soon down regulate key proinflammatory cytokines. BC500 infection stimulates the highest gene upregulation at 2 dpi in intestine together with downregulation of leukocyte recruitment cytokines. A global picture emerges of a robust and rapid interferon response to VN1203 in lung, and a significant response to BC500 in intestine, yet both responses were tempered to limit damage. As part of the sequencing effort for the Anas platyrhynchos genome, Huang and consortium performed transcriptomic analysis of Shaoxin lung tissues following infection with H5N1 strains (23). They saw a similarly robust interferon response early in infection and elaborated on cytokine and defensin expression. Our work builds on this by investigating the global regulation of genes in lung, spleen and intestine using the most current version of the Pekin duck genome (November 15 2020). Smith and colleagues sequenced lung and intestine RNA from domestic Gray mallards infected with similar viruses, but used single-stranded reads at a lower sequencing depth on 1 and 3 dpi only (25). The Gray mallard ducks also had a much more robust response to VN1203 infection than they did to BC500 infection on 1 and 3 dpi. Many of the highly expressed genes are in common with our results, however the additional depth of sequencing reveals less abundant genes and allows us to analyze alternate splicing in the sampled tissues.Overall, we found that there were 65 upregulated genes common to all tissues following infection with both viruses, while lungs, spleens and intestines had many genes uniquely differentially expressed. Of these 65 similarly upregulated genes, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which can detect RNA viruses were highly upregulated in all tissues. This includes RIG-I and the related interferon induced with helicase C domain 1/melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (IFIH1/MDA5) and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). VN1203 infection induces a much more rapid and robust response of IFN inducible genes (such as RSAD2/Viperin and IFIT5) in the duck than BC500 infection does. The interferon response peaks at 1 dpi for VN1203, while the response to BC500 peaks at 2 dpi. The expression of genes in the RIG-I pathway from the RNAseq data mostly match their expression profiles we previously determined using qPCR (20, 26, 41), with highest expression of DDX58/RIG-I, IFIH1/MDA5, RNF135/RIPLET, OASL, IFITM3 and IRF7 on 1 dpi in ducks infected with VN1203. Exceptions include IFNB expression and tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) expression in VN1203 infected ducks. In our previous studies, the qPCR results suggested these two genes were robustly expressed on 1 dpi, and rapidly dropped to basal levels by 3 dpi, while our RNA-seq analysis suggests these genes exhibit sustained expression across all 3 dpi. Likely these discrepancies are due to the different techniques of normalization used between the two studies, with the qPCR experiments normalized to a single gene (GAPDH) and the RNA-seq data normalized using TMM and library size. Additionally, RNA-sequencing data will still count splice variants in its read counts, while qPCR may miss some of these variants due to primer design and placement. Some of the changes in gene expression seen in tissues are likely due to infiltrating immune cells responding to infection. We previously reported aggregates of leukocytes in lung tissues and leukocyte depletion of spleen tissues in VN1203 infected ducks (26). Others have also noted infiltration of immune cells to lung, spleen and intestine following influenza infection (52, 53). We previously showed upregulation of CCL19 and CCL21 chemokines, responsible for homing of dendritic cells and naïve lymphocytes (54), in VN1203 infected lung (55). In this study, we see upregulation of these transcripts on all days following VN1203 infection in both lung and spleen, but only in spleens of BC500 infected ducks. Indeed, CCL19 is one of the most upregulated genes. Higher expression of CCL19 and other ISGs was seen in genotyped Ri chicken lines that were more resistant to H5N1 infection (56).Infection with BC500 induces the most DEGs on 2 dpi. This is especially evident in the site of BC500 replication, the intestine. This is not surprising, given that cloacal swabs from these ducks were negative for virus on 1 dpi, but they were shedding high titres of virus on days 2 and 3 (27). It seems that the virus replicates in intestine at 2 dpi, and the host tissue responds accordingly. Tracheal swabs from BC500 ducks were also negative and this is consistent with our result of relatively low changes in DEGs in the lung. While this virus produces no observable symptoms in the duck, it replicates to high titres and as such can disseminate into the environment. Since we do not see abundant viral transcripts in the intestinal tissues, either the tissue collection missed the major sites of replication, or the cells actively producing virus are present only transiently or rapidly destroyed. The 2 dpi timepoint was not examined by Smith and colleagues in their RNA sequencing data, however comparable to our data, they found similar genes upregulated at 1 dpi in the ileum of BC500 infected mallards, including IFIT5, ESPTI1, MX, OASL, DHX58 and SAMD9L (25).We see many PRR and IFN-inducible genes upregulated in tissues infected with either VN1203 or BC500. We had previously looked at expression of both ring finger protein 135 (RNF135/Riplet) and TRIM25 (26), which both augment RIG-I signaling during viral infection. Here we see that RNF135 is upregulated by infection with either BC500 or VN1203 in all tissues, while TRIM25 is upregulated in both lung and spleen during VN1203 infection. We also see DExD/H-Box Helicase 60 (DDX60) upregulated by both VN1203 and BC500 in all tissues sampled. In mammals, DDX60 binds RIG-I and promotes RNA binding and downstream type I IFN production during viral infection (47) but has not been studied in birds. We also see strong upregulation of IFN inducible genes such as radical SAM domain-containing 2 (RSAD2 or Viperin), 2′5′-oligoadenylate snythetase-like (OASL), interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5 and IFIT5-L, a likely mistake in genome assembly) and Mx. RSAD2, OASL and Mx are all highly upregulated by VN1203 and BC500 in all tissues sampled. Recent experiments establish the antiviral function of these duck homologues. Overexpression of duck IFIT5 reduces viral titre at early timepoints but appears to inhibit innate immunity later (57). Duck OASL activates the OAS/RNaseL pathway (58). Similarly, overexpression of duck Viperin reduces viral replication (59).Although upregulated, some genes may not be functional. For example, Mx is highly upregulated at 2 dpi in intestines of BC500 infected ducks, while many other PRR and IFN-inducible genes were only slightly upregulated in that tissue. The function of duck Mx has long been in question, as two alleles showed no antiviral activity in vitro (60). Similarly, two members of the interferon induced transmembrane protein family IFITM1 and IFITM2, small proteins capable of preventing viral hemi-fusion of membranes preventing entry, have highly upregulated transcripts in intestine, but we previously showed that neither restricts influenza viruses in vitro (18). IFITM1 is mis-targeted to plasma membrane, rather than the endosomal compartment due to a unique insertion in ducks, not seen in chickens. Only IFITM3 restricts influenza viruses, and its expression is high in lung, spleen and intestine. Influenza viruses may exploit these adaptations to preferentially replicate in duck intestines.Alternative splicing events are prevalent in lungs of ducks infected with VN1203, and rare in tissues of ducks infected with BC500. IAV modifies AS events through many mechanisms (61, 62). Some alternative transcripts may have specific antiviral activity. For example, a short isoform of human nuclear receptor co-activator 7 (NCOA7) was induced by interferon and able to inhibit IAV entry through endosomal fusion (63). The short isoform of NCOA7 was also identified in VN1203 infected lungs and spleens, and BC500 infected lungs. The presence of this NCOA7 isoform in ducks suggests it may have a conserved function of viral restriction in vertebrates. The high number of AS events in VN1203 infected tissues may be due to viral subversion of host response, as well as IFN induction of AS events. Interestingly, when subjected to GO analysis, many of the AS events in the lungs of VN1203 infected ducks enriched terms involved with physiology, rather than immunological responses. AS events in spleens of ducks infected with VN1203 found more enrichment in terms associated with humoral and inflammatory responses. These differences may be due to the abundance of each transcript type in each tissue, as there may be more inflammatory cells activated in the spleen during an infection. Human lung epithelial cells infected with the A/WSN/1933 strain of H1N1 also demonstrated an increase in AS events (61). Thompson and colleagues demonstrated through siRNA screening that some of the alternatively spliced genes also were actively enhancing viral replication, and thus knocking these genes out reduced viral titer in infected cells. Of note, some of these genes are also present in our AS analysis in duck tissues, including: RAB11F1P3, PAXBP1, IP6K2 and TNRC6A. These genes only show as AS in lungs of ducks infected with VN1203. As little is known about AS responses to infection in birds, future research should involve both sequencing infected duck tissues at a greater depth to capture more AS events and investigating these alternate transcripts in duck cells to determine which aid or restrict IAV replication.We found gene duplications unique to ducks particularly interesting, especially if the mammalian homologue has known antiviral activity. The poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family of genes is largely understudied but is often associated with DNA repair and transcription. We found members of this family upregulated by both VN1203 and BC500 infection in ducks (PARP9, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14). Of interest, PARP12 can inhibit replication of RNA viruses (64). We found two presumed orthologs of human PARP12 in ducks (LOC101802866 and LOC101796889, with the former being named PARP12-L for this paper). The shorter gene, PARP12-L is only significantly upregulated in lungs of VN1203 infected ducks, suggesting it may play a tissue specific role in viral inhibition. PARP12 was also upregulated in a previous study in both lungs and ileums of VN1203 and BC500 infected Gray mallard ducks (25). Neither of these genes (PARP12 or PARP12-L) has yet been characterized in birds, and it is unknown if either can restrict RNA viral replication. PARP14 appears to be duplicated in the duck, with two forms of PARP14 sharing equal percent identities to human PARP14 (~43%), but only 52% identity to each other (data not shown). PARP14 deletion reduces proinflammatory responses in murine macrophages (65), and in another study PARP14 deletion was found to reduce IFN-β and ISG response (66). Both duck PARP14 genes also have a predicted RNA binding domain, which is not present in the human PARP14. PARP14.1 (LOC101789908) is upregulated by both BC500 and VN1203 infection in ducks, while PARP14.2 (LOC101798744) is only upregulated by VN1203 in lungs and spleens of infected ducks. Members of the PARP gene family appear to be expanded in the duck, making them interesting candidates for further study of proteins which may play lineage specific roles in immune responses to IAV in the duck.We postulate that specific responses to the virus that limit damage from infection may have been selected in ducks. Notably, lung tissues in VN1203 infected ducks show downregulation of some proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17 and IL-8. In humans, IL-17 is elevated in patients who were infected with the 2009 S-OIV H1N1 IAV (67). Mice infected with the 2009 S-OIV H1N1 had a significant increase in survival when treated with anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we see a large increase of IL17A expression in spleens but not lungs of VN1203 infected ducks. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in expression of this gene, especially on 2 and 3 dpi, in the lungs of these infected ducks. This response may help lessen damage in the lungs from infection. We see a similar pattern in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, of which ducks have two presumed orthologous genes, IL8 (LOC101804010) and IL8-L (LOC101803817). Both genes show strong upregulation in the spleen, particularly on 1 dpi. However, in lungs there is significant downregulation on 2 and 3 dpi of both IL8 and IL8-L. In humans, IL8 is secreted by alveolar epithelial cells infected by IAV (68). As IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (68–70), decreasing the expression of the IL8 gene in the site of VN1203 replication may reduce bystander damage to the tissues from excessive neutrophil accumulation. Interestingly, the downregulation of IL17A, IL8 and IL8-L in lungs seems to be unique to our experiment. Huang et al. also investigated cytokine expression in lungs of Shaoxin ducks infected with DK/49, a HPAI H5N1 and GS/65 a LPAI H5N1 (23). In these experiments, IL17A was upregulated in the lungs of ducks infected with DK/49 on all three days, while it was downregulated in ducks infected with GS/65 on 1 dpi and increased in expression on 2 and 3 dpi (23). A similar pattern is seen in this data when comparing IL8 and IL8-L expression. This is likely due to the viral strains used as well as the differences in breeds of duck. In our experiments all ducks infected with VN1203 survived. While Huang et al. do not specifically mention survival rates of the ducks used, Song et al. demonstrated that DK/49 killed all infected Shaoxin ducks with viral titres as low as 103 EID50 (71). They also noted that GS/65 did not cause any mortality in infected ducks, yet it spread systemically in infected birds. Additionally, while Shaoxin ducks and Pekin ducks did originate from the same lineage, they have been selectively bred for eggs or meat (respectively) and inhabit separate clades in phylogenetic analyses (72, 73). It is also likely that this selective breeding has resulted in differences in immune responses.As the intestine tissue both permits BC500 to reproduce to high titres, yet ultimately clears infection, we looked at both uniquely upregulated and downregulated gene expression, in comparison to other tissues. In intestines of BC500 ducks, we see upregulation of complement components C1S and C4A and strong downregulation of C3 and C5 as well as the complement receptor gene CR1 and the C5 receptor CD88. The C3 protein acts as a point of convergence to activate the classical, alternative and lectin pathways of complement activation [as reviewed by (74)]. Mice with C3 and CR1 genes knocked out were deficient in forming long term memory to IAV (75) while C5 activation is associated with lung damage during IAV infection in mice (76). Activated C5 is split into C5a, which is a potent chemoattractant of neutrophils (77) and monocytes (78). Limiting not only the key component of the complement cascade (C3) but also a potent activator of inflammatory cell subsets (C5) and their receptors likely decreases the inflammation in the intestine. Similarly, damage may be ameliorated by downregulation of C3 and C5 seen in lungs, but not spleens, of VN1203 infected ducks.Because ducks are permissive to IAV replication while being resistant to pathology from replicating virus, we searched our data for genes that might assist in increased viral replication. In a recent review, Shaw and Stertz listed many genes that assisted in IAV replication in mammalian hosts (79), however many of these genes were not differentially expressed in ducks above physiologically relevant thresholds. Indeed, some of the differentially expressed genes that would allow for increased entry/endosome trafficking were downregulated in both intestines of BC500 ducks and lungs of VN1203 infected ducks. For example, DYNLT2, ACTG2, ACTA1, ACTN2 and ACTC1 were all downregulated in lungs of VN1203 ducks. Both actin and dynein proteins can aid in endosomal trafficking of IAV during early stages of infection (80). Several genes which encode chemoattractant proteins were specifically downregulated in intestines including Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin-2 (LECT2), a chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages (81, 82), CCL26 a chemoattractant for eosinophils and basophils (83) and IL15, which has various functions in inflammatory responses and promoting immune cell maturation and proliferation (84). We did not take intestine samples from VN1203 infected ducks because the cloacal swabs of these ducks were negative. However, future research and analysis should include samples from tissues without virus present, to further elucidate which DEGs are from interferons and non-specific inflammatory responses, and which are caused by the presence of replicating virus.Sex differences in immunity have evolved in all species from sea urchins to mammals, and where examined, innate and adaptive immunity is typically greater in females than males (85). Our study sampled a mix of male and female Pekin ducks in both our controls and infected birds. We observe some separation of samples according to sex in our MDS plot, thus it is possible that sex contributes to the differences in expression patterns seen, however this is mostly obscured by variation in response between genetically diverse individuals. Due to our relatively small sample size on each day of infection, we do not have enough male and female animals to compare immune responses by sex. Previously, we did not find differences in viral load between male and female ducks infected with rgVN1203 (26). In wild ducks, most studies show males carry more IAV (86–88), while one showed more female ducks infected (89), and one found differences in viral load between male and female ducks depending on geographic location (90). In the wild, host ecology contributes to prevalence of IAV infection in mallards including dabbling in infected water, flock density and migration (91).Our results highlight the incredible complexity of tissue responses to both highly pathogenic and low pathogenic strains of IAV. Ducks are well equipped to control IAV replication, demonstrated by the shared expression of key IAV detectors and innate effectors in all tissues, notably the RIG-I pathway and interferon stimulated genes. The early timing of this robust early interferon response to VN1203 at 1 dpi may also be protective, while peak ISG responses are seen at 2 dpi for low pathogenic avian influenza. Many genes uniquely upregulated have as yet unknown roles in the physiological changes or immune response during infection, as thorough literature searches fail to link these genes to inflammatory modulators or viral restriction. It is suspected that recruitment of leukocytes contributes to DE of genes, but the responding cell types are not known. Ducks also have tissue-specific mechanisms in place to prevent damage and out-of-control inflammation, including downregulation of complement components C3 and C5. The downregulation of certain proinflammatory genes, with the upregulation of other proinflammatory genes in the same tissues suggests the protection is from a dampening, rather than an all-out inhibition of the inflammatory response.Data Availability StatementThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

Back to Healio Year after year, experts say the best defense against seasonal influenza is getting vaccinated. However, overall seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness has reached only 60% once in the past 10 years and is often less than 40%. As National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, said earlier this year, “the world badly needs improved flu vaccines.” Michael T. Osterholm “The Holy Grail, the universal flu vaccine, has to be one that protects against all strains of influenza — including those that have not yet emerged — and has long-lasting protection, meaning that it's not an annual vaccine, but one that could last many years,” Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, said in an interview. “That's the goal. I think people will take even less than that.” Former CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, said an effective vaccine for tuberculosis or HIV would save more lives than an improved influenza vaccine, and a more effective vaccine against malaria “would save many more children’s lives.” Tom Frieden “But a more effective influenza vaccine would have major health and economic benefits and may be closer to reality than highly effective vaccines against other leading killers,” Frieden, now the President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, told Healio. We spoke with Osterholm, Frieden and other experts about efforts to develop a universal influenza vaccine that can protect against pandemic and seasonal influenza and which technologies may hold the most promise. “Vaccines are one of the greatest inventions of science, and it’s essential that we continue and increase our investment in a balanced portfolio: vaccine research and stronger systems to get vaccines to all people for whom they are indicated,” Frieden said. Early studies show promise According to an initiative spearheaded by WHO and CIDRAP, there are 114 novel influenza vaccine candidates under development by 105 developers, including 22 in clinical trials. The initiative published the Influenza Vaccine Research & Development Roadmap in September. “Our group has been very actively involved in flu vaccine research and development for some time,” Osterholm said. “We wrote a very important report that came out in 2012 which actually raised questions about how well the seasonal flu vaccines work. Traditional wisdom back then was that they work 70% to 90% of the time and we, of course, found that just wasn’t the case.” Additionally, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated that the vaccines developed for that virus “were far too late to have any major impact,” Osterholm said. “While many promising universal influenza vaccine candidates are under study, clinical development requires overcoming a variety of significant technical and logistical challenges such as conducting clinical trials over multiple seasons with different circulating viruses,” the roadmap’s executive summary says. The 114 vaccines in the roadmap’s tracker use six different vaccine platforms. According to Peter Palese, PhD, the Horace W. Goldsmith Professor and Chair of the department of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, the technologies have different targets. “It is unlikely that one single technology will be the panacea,” he told Healio. Osterholm and Palese said there have been many advances in just the last 5 years. Peter Palese “We understand the structure of the virus and hemagglutinin” — the surface protein targeted by current vaccines — “in much greater detail, and we have a much greater insight into the immunology of the human host following infection by influenza viruses and following the administration of influenza virus vaccines,” Palese said. At the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center, two nanoparticle influenza vaccine candidates have shown promise in early animal studies and advanced to human trials, according to NIAID allergist-immunologist Alicia T. Widge, MD. One of the vaccines removes the head of the hemagglutinin entirely — the part of the protein that mutates frequently and makes it necessary to update influenza vaccines. Alicia T. Widge “Your body basically just sees the stem,” Widge said. “Our goal is to make an immune response to the stem that’s more conserved between the different subtypes.” In essence, researchers are targeting a part of the hemagglutinin that is less likely to change from year to year. Scientists at the NIAID developed the vaccine, called H1ssF_3928. “It uses the iron storage protein ferritin,” Widge explained. “It basically self-assembles into these kind of nano particles that display the stem on its surface.” The vaccine protected animals against several strains of influenza in challenge models, Widge said. The human trial, which was launched in April 2019, enrolled 52 healthy adults aged 18 to 70 years who received the vaccine in one of two doses: either a single 20 µg intramuscular injection or two 60 µg injections spaced 16 weeks apart. Widge said they are still analyzing the results. “We're really kind of hopeful that it's a big step toward creating a universal flu vaccine platform,” she said. “Now, it's sort of one step that by itself may not be a universal vaccine, but these are the steps we take to create one.” A second NIH trial began earlier this year and is assessing a mosaic nanoparticle vaccine called FluMos-v1. According to NIH, the vaccine candidate was first tested in mice, ferrets and monkeys. Researchers compared the immune responses with those elicited by a commercially available influenza vaccine. Widge said the results were so promising that the project has moved on to a phase 1 human trial, with the first healthy volunteer receiving the vaccine at the end of May. Widge and colleagues will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine among healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years. They aim to enroll 35 participants — 15 will receive a licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccine and five will receive one 20 µg dose of the FluMos-v1. If there are no safety concerns, the remaining 15 volunteers will receive one 60 µg dose of the investigational vaccine. “We kind of designed it in a different way,” Widge said. “This is a nanoparticle that displays all four of those hemagglutinins on its surface simultaneously. What we think this could do is sort of teach our immune system to respond to different subtypes of the flu and, again, hopefully create that stem-directed response that could protect against different strains.” Widge said there are other labs all over the country studying universal influenza vaccine options. “Some of them have kind of a similar approach, looking at directing the immune response toward the stem, but there are also a lot of creative approaches being taken all over,” she said. Palese and a group of researchers at Mount Sinai, including microbiologists Florian Krammer, PhD, and Adolfo García-Sastre, PhD, developed a universal influenza vaccine candidate that also targets the hemagglutinin stalk, rather than its head. “This is achieved by immunizing with chimeric hemagglutinin constructs” — mix-and-match head and stalks — “which induce long-lasting protective immune responses,” Palese explained. They tested the safety and immunogenicity of these chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines in a phase 1 trial of healthy U.S. adults aged 18 to 39 years and published the results in Nature Medicine. “We found that vaccination with adjuvanted, inactivated [chimeric hemagglutinin] vaccines induced remarkably high anti-stalk antibody titers, even after a single administration,” they wrote. “The titers achieved after one vaccination exceeded anti-stalk titer levels at which protection from pandemic H1N1 virus infection was observed in a Nicaraguan family cohort study.” Palese and colleagues said the results suggest that “chimeric hemagglutinins have the potential to be developed as universal vaccines that protect broadly against influenza viruses.” According to Palese, phase 1/2 trials of the vaccines are underway. ‘Time will tell’ Widge said the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to increase pandemic preparedness for influenza. “I think we’ll see high levels of activity in the flu field in the creation of better, more universal vaccines,” she said. The pandemic also has contributed what experts agree could be an important technology for a universal influenza vaccine ⎼⎼ messenger RNA, which is used by two of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. Frieden called mRNA vaccines “our pathway out of this pandemic.” In the shadow of the pandemic, Moderna and Sanofi Pasteur have both begun testing mRNA vaccines for influenza. “Messenger RNA vaccines are an extremely promising technology that has been in the works for nearly 2 decades and can possibly be used to prevent and treat future infectious diseases and outbreaks — including, potentially, seasonal influenza,” Frieden said. “They also serve as a blueprint for vaccine production more broadly [by showing that the] creation of vaccine production hubs and transferring technology can create the capacity to rapidly produce millions of vaccine doses.” Palese concurred, calling mRNA technology “revolutionary.” “The mRNA technology is able to induce excellent immune responses against the protein, which is expressed from the mRNA,” he said. “Whether the mRNA technology is successful for universal influenza virus vaccines will depend on the constructs being used in the approach. If the latter is inducing protective immune responses, it should be successful. However, the jury is still out. Time will tell.” Widge noted that mRNA vaccines can be manufactured quickly, are safe, and generate strong immune responses. “One of the big advantages of mRNA vaccines, and one of the reasons we knew they would be exceptionally useful for pandemics, is you can really tailor the mRNA to express any proteins,” Widge said. “So, in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, they're expressing the spike protein, but you can very easily engineer mRNA to express a flu protein — whether that be the stem of the flu or other proteins as well.” Osterholm said it is too early to say which technologies hold the most promise for universal influenza vaccine research, although he noted there are several outside of mRNA vaccines. “The good news is that we have the opportunities at this point to really explore the landscape,” he said. According to Frieden, investments to develop vaccines against two coronaviruses — SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome — “dried up” after the outbreaks faded. “Subsequent progress after those health threats were controlled was not as robust as it could have been if the interest in strengthening public health and more sustainable funding had been maintained,” he said. “This is our now-or-never moment in public health. We need to maintain the funding, momentum and interest in protecting ourselves against the next health threat, and not squander the gains we have made.” Numerous institutions have received millions in federal funding for universal influenza vaccine projects, including Duke’s Human Vaccine Institute and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. Duke’s three separate contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases could be worth $400 million alone if they are extended over the entirety of the 7-year project, the university reported in 2019, the same year President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order directing the federal government to “modernize” influenza vaccines. Palese declined to predict when a universal influenza vaccine would be available to patients but indicated a lot of it has to do with funding. “If we would spend as much money for flu as we have allocated for COVID-19, we would be there already, in my opinion,” he said. Osterholm also could not say when a universal influenza vaccine might be available, but he hopes it will be sooner rather than later. “We just have to keep pushing because we know that not only is the seasonal flu a challenge, we have to deal with the potential for pandemic influenza,” he said. “I think that’s a very important point to keep in mind.” References: CDC.

It starts in the fall and continues into the spring. Flu is a potentially serious illness that can lead to a few days of feeling bad and missing work, or it may result in more serious health complications. What is the flu? The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. How does the flu spread? People who have the flu can spread the virus by coughing or sneezing. Droplets released when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or talks can land in the mouths of noses or people who are nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. People may also catch the flu by touching their mouth or nose after touching something with the virus on it, such as doorknobs, tables, or an infected person’s dirty hand. Flu germs can linger on surfaces for up to 8 hours. Why should people get vaccinated against flu? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination as the best way to protect against the flu. Vaccination has been shown to have many benefits including reducing the risk of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and flu-related deaths. How do flu vaccines work? Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with circulating influenza viruses. Why do I need a flu vaccine every year? A flu vaccine is needed every year for two reasons. First, a person’s immune protection from vaccination declines over time, so an annual flu vaccine is needed for optimal protection. Second, because flu viruses are constantly changing, the composition of flu vaccines is reviewed annually and vaccines are updated to protect against the viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming flu season. Will a flu vaccine protect me against COVID-19? No, flu vaccines are not designed to protect against COVID-19. Flu and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. Also, according to the CDC, a person can receive a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same visit. Where can I get a flu vaccine? Influenza vaccinations for all military members are a mandatory requirement, and available through each installation’s Medical Group or at any participating Tricare eligible pharmacies. Tricare beneficiaries are also eligible for flu shots through immunization clinics on base, or at no cost at Tricare eligible pharmacies. For the civilian workforce, all Federal Employee Health Benefit plans cover flu shots at no cost for members and are available at local retail pharmacies. What are everyday preventive actions that are recommended to reduce the spread of flu? Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses that cause flu. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. If you sick with flu-like symptoms, the CDC recommends that people stay home for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone except to get medical care or other necessities. Fever should be gone without the need to use fever-reducing medicine. If you want your immune system to be in good enough shape to fight off the flu and other germs, you need to practice healthy lifestyle habits. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night, exercise at least 4 days a week, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious foods.

Public-health officials asked people to wear face masks, employ social distancing, wash their hands regularly, stay at home, keep children out of schools and reduce their travel on public transport. These actions to slow the spread of covid-19 had a subsidiary effect, reducing the spread of other respiratory viruses such as influenza. The World Health Organisation reported that less than 0.2% of the respiratory swab specimens tested from people around the world between September 2020 and January 2021 were positive for influenza viruses (see chart). In contrast, the average during the same reporting period of the three previous seasons (2017-2020) was 17%.

'I'm concerned'Christopher Cann and Dejania Oliver | Tallahassee DemocratShow Caption Hide Caption Brace for an aggressive flu season after a COVID-focused yearAs an eager vaccine rollout journey’s us to a COVID-cured world, experts warn an aggressive influenza season may be upon us.Buzz60, Buzz60Tallahassee higher education campuses and hospitals are seeing large numbers of students and others suffering from influenza.Experts, many of whom have warned about a severe flu season for months, say this is the result of a return to normalcy and lessening of safety precautions taken while COVID-19 numbers were at its highest. At Florida State University, the school's health center is full of sick students."Case numbers have skyrocketed and our University Health Center is overwhelmed with caring for ill students," said an internal email from FSU Provost Sally McRorie to faculty obtained by the Democrat.More flu coverage, powered by USA TODAY:Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 cases: 'We face the same threat this year'More than 40% of Americans may not get a flu shot this year. That could spell trouble during COVID.You're feeling sick. Try not to panic. How to combat COVID, flu anxiety this winterIs it safe to get a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time? Experts explainThe email asks professors not to send students to the health center for a medical excuse for absences or delayed work – a request that was first introduced because of COVID-19. An FSU professor, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Democrat Wednesday he "had 40% of one class missing today."Amy Magnuson, director of FSU’s Health Services, says they have over 20 new cases a day – a number that is steadily increasing, but is likely much less than the actual total.Meanwhile, at FAMU there were 102 positive flu cases reported from the university's community site on Wednesday alone, according to FAMU Director of Health Services Tanya Tatum."We are seeing a lot of cases of the flu," Tatum said. "I'm concerned."Beginning Monday, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare started treating 50-60 people a day, in addition to the emergency department’s hospital’s usual volume, said Dr. Sam Ashoo, an emergency medicine doctor who has been working directly on flu patients.The hospital's various urgent care centers went from treating about 100-120 people a day, to around 140-150 patients daily. These increases, Ashoo says, are directly linked to flu infections among young people. “Currently, it’s pretty severe,” he said. “We’re seeing a very large number of people in their late teens and early 20s with influenza for the past few days.”Dr. Nectar Aintablian, a pediatric infectious disease expert at TMH, urged people to get their flu vaccine to protect them from getting sick, especially those in high-risk categories. She added that those feeling flu-like symptoms – including a cough, high fever, runny nose and fatigue – should stay home and isolate themselves. "I have fear (the flu) may come back with a vengeance this year, because we had such low numbers last year as people were very careful with going out, wearing masks," she said."Please don't wait to get your flu shot." Capital Regional Medical Center is also experiencing the rise in flu cases, said Spokesperson Rachel Stiles, who did not provide any statistics. Alan Cox, the assistant superintendent of Leon County Schools, said the district is expecting an uptick in flu cases but, as of Friday morning, there has not yet been an increase. This recent spike in flu cases comes only three years after Tallahassee's hospitals – along with the rest of the country – struggled to keep up with the worst flu season in a decade. From 2018: Tallahassee hospitals grappling with worst flu season in 10 yearsAthletics and long wait times at FSUThis year, the flu already seems to be back with a vengeance, affecting athletes while potentially spreading in classrooms and dorms. Several athletes across Florida State University's athletics program are, and have been, dealing with flu-like symptoms.Maya Anderson, an FSU freshman, noticed a cough Monday and by the following day she was running a 102.4 fever and vomiting. She went to Patients First, a clinic, on Lake Ella and was able to walk-in and out in under an hour. "There's several people on my floor that are sick," she said about her Magnolia Hall dorm. "Most of my friends are sick."The next day Anderson checked the website of the same clinic she sought care and was met with a 655 minute wait time – nearly 11 hours. A reporter called the university's health services line for appointment wait-times Thursday morning and found it was "at capacity" for the day. For those looking for a flu shot, the university recently started a mobile vaccine unit called Flu-ber that meets students wherever they are on campus.On Health Services’ Twitter and Instagram, updates on Flu-Ber’s location are posted periodically. “It's important for everybody to get a flu shot, but especially anybody with underlying health conditions,” Magnuson said. “I think as far as prevention goes, face coverings or at least covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze can help prevent the spread of flu and of course COVID.”Vaccine hesitancy at FAMUThe spike in flu infections on FAMU connects to an overarching problem that, according to Tatum, has been with the university for the last year – vaccine hesitancy. The school has put aside $1 million for cash prizes in order to incentivize vaccination for students. However, Tatum says most of that money has not been given out because students just aren’t willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine or flu shot.“Our campus population for the most part isn't great about getting shots at all. I couldn't give away 150 doses of flu vaccine last year, and this year we haven't given away 100 doses yet,” Tatum said. “We have a lot of individuals who say 'I've never had the flu, I'm not getting a vaccination...' ""There's just a real aversion to getting immunizations.”Tatum echoes Magnuson and encourages everyone to get tested for the flu and consider the vaccine. “Right now is a really critical time. It’s before your Thanksgiving break and then you come back and there's finals. I think the loss of that time in your academic program is... at a really critical point."National flu warningsDuring an early October White House briefing, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned that the United States was at risk for a severe flu season heading into the fall and winter months this year.CDC leader: Flu shot 'doubly important' this yearThe message is clear: Get your flu vaccine. The U.S. is gearing up in case of a bad flu season on top of the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Public health experts pleaded Thursday for Americans to get vaccinated against both. (Oct. 7)APShe linked this, like Aintablian, to a reduced immunity against influenza as cases plummeted to an all-time low last flu season. She also echoed warnings of a "twindemic," adding that the flu could also increase demand on healthcare facilities nationwide, which could cause an avalanche effect if another COVID wave arrives. More: Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 cases: 'We face the same threat this year'“The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and the risk of both flu and COVID-19 circulating could put additional strain on hospitals and frontline health care professionals,” she said. Where to get a flu shotThere are many places Tallahasseeans can go for a free flu shot like CVS and Walgreens, the country’s two largest retail pharmacies, which offer co-administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Popular supermarket chains like Publix, Walmart and Winn Dixie are also administering flu vaccines in addition to walk-in clinics and family physicians. "It's free and you can get the flu shot at the same time as the COVID vaccine," TMH's Dr. Aintablian said. "Don't postpone it, protect yourself and others."Contact Christopher Cann at ccann@tallahassee.com and follow @ChrisCannFL on Twitter.Never miss a story: Subscribe to the Tallahassee Democrat using the link at the top of the page.

A nationwide COVID-19 cohort database was collected by the Korea National Health Insurance Corporation. A total of 8,070 COVID-19 patients (1 January 2020 through 4 June 2020) were matched with 32,280 control participants. Severe COVID-19 morbidity was defined based on the treatment histories of the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death. The susceptibility/morbidity/mortality associated with prior histories of 1–14, 1–30, 1–90, 15–45, 15–90, and 31–90 days before COVID-19 onset were analyzed using conditional/unconditional logistic regression. Prior influenza infection was related to increased susceptibility to COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 3.07 [1.61–5.85] for 1–14 days and 1.91 [1.54–2.37] for 1–90 days). Prior URI was also associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19 (6.95 [6.38–7.58] for 1–14 days, 4.99 [4.64–5.37] for 1–30 days, and 2.70 [2.55–2.86] for 1–90 days). COVID-19 morbidity was positively associated with influenza (3.64 [1.55–9.21] and 3.59 [1.42–9.05]) and URI (1.40 [1.11–1.78] and 1.28 [1.02–1.61]) at 1–14 days and 1–30 days, respectively. Overall, previous influenza/URI did not show an association with COVID-19 mortality. Previous influenza/URI histories were associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility and morbidity. Our findings indicate why controlling influenza/URI is important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Another infectious viral disease, influenza, was approximated to have a mortality rate of 2.9–44.0 per 100,000 people/year2. In addition, elderly patients and patients with other medical morbidities are more susceptible to COVID-19 as well as influenza/URI3,4. Thus, there have been growing concerns about aggravated COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in patients with influenza or URI5,6.Recent studies have suggested the effects of influenza infection on the disease course of COVID-197,8. They reported severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with coinfection with influenza7,8,9. Patients coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza were reportedly more prone to severe inflammation and organ injury, which could induce cytokine storms7. Coinfected patients demonstrated a higher risk of death, ventilator care, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission than influenza or SARS-CoV-2 single-infected patients8. In contrast, other studies reported a lower or similar rate of fatality of COVID-19 in coinfected patients with influenza than in single SARS-CoV-2-infected patients10,11. Moreover, the recent infection histories of endemic coronavirus infection were suggested to be associated with a milder clinical course of COVID-1912. The findings of this study suggested that the preexisting viral immune response might be effective in evading SARS-CoV-2 infection12. Owing to the limited number of study populations and unconcerned confounders, the impacts of influenza infection on COVID-19 are still controversial.We hypothesized that recent infection histories of influenza/URI might be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality. Because recent viral infections may transiently boost the immune response to another viral pathogen (SARS-CoV-2), vulnerability to viral infection could render certain patients highly susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections3,4. Because URIs commonly originate from viral infections, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, we also analyzed URIs and influenza. Because patients with influenza infection/URI are not quarantined, the possibility of recent previous influenza/URI infection could exist. On the other hand, the opposite case might be rare because of quarantine in the case of COVID-19. Therefore, we analyzed the associations of previous influenza/URI with COVID-19. The primary object of this study was to evaluate the association between previous influenza/URI and susceptibility of COVID-19 patients compared to that of non-COVID-19 participants. The secondary objective was to estimate the relation between previous influenza/URI and morbidity/mortality in COVID-19 patients.Materials and methodsStudy population and participant selectionThe ethics committee of Hallym University permitted this study (IRB: 2020–07-022) and waived written informed consent. All analyses adhered to the guidelines and regulations of the ethics committee of Hallym University.We used Korea National Health Insurance Database Coronavirus Disease 2019 (NHID-COVID) medical claim code data from 2015 through 2020, which covers the entire country without any exception13,14. The NHID-COVID provided data of individuals who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing using real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal swabs, in accordance with the WHO guideline, and control participants were proportionally sampled, stratifying with age and sex, from the NHID. A 15-fold number of control participants who were matched with COVID-19 patients for age and sex were provided.Confirmed COVID-19 patients (ICD-10: B342, B972, U071, U072) were included from 1 January 2020 through 4 June 2020, and all of them finished treatment or died as of 4 June 2020 (n = 8,070). Non-COVID-19 participants (control) were extracted, with 15-fold more confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 121,050). We matched COVID-19 patients with control participants at a 1:4 ratio in terms of age, sex, and income. Among the control participants, we excluded participants with a lack of income records (n = 2,136). To avoid selection bias, control participants were selected randomly using clustered sampling. The index date was defined as the date of COVID-19 confirmation. Each index date of control participants was selected randomly from 1 January 2020 to 4 June 2020. As a consequence, the 8,070 COVID-19 participants were matched 1:4 with 32,280 control participants. The data of previous histories of influenza/URI were merged for the COVID-19 and control participants. The COVID-19 patients were divided by morbidity into mild (n = 569) and severe groups (n = 7,501). They were also divided into dead (n = 237) and surviving (n = 7,833) participants (Fig. 1).Figure 1A schematic illustration of the participant selection process that was used in the present study. Of a total of 129,120 participants, 8,070 COVID-19 participants were matched with 32,280 control participants for age, sex, and income.Full size imageExposuresInfluenza was defined if the participant was prescribed baloxavir, oseltamivir, peremivir, or zanamivir. In Korea, these medications can be prescribed only after confirmation of influenza (type A or B) using rapid chromatographic immunoassay or real-time RT-PCR. We checked whether the participants had influenza in the previous periods of 1–14, 1–30, 1–90, 15–45, 15–90 and 31–90 days before the index dates. In addition, the total number of prescriptions 1–365 days before the index date was counted as the continuous variable.URI was defined using the diagnosis codes (ICD-10) J00 (acute nasopharyngitis) through J06 (acute upper respiratory infections of multiple and unspecified sites). We checked if the participant had a URI in the previous periods of 1–14, 1–30, 1–90, 15–45, 15–90 and 31–90 days before the index dates. In addition, the total number of diagnoses 1–365 days before the index date was counted as the continuous variable.OutcomesLaboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as the primary outcome.The secondary outcomes were morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Morbidity was defined as severe compared to mild morbidity. Severe morbidity was defined as admission to the ICU, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death. Mild morbidity was defined as other cases.CovariatesAge groups were divided into 10-year intervals: 0–9, 10–19, 20–29,…, and 80 + years old (total of nine age groups). Eleven income groups were reclassified into three classes (low income, middle income, and high income). Missing income [n = 127 (0.31%)] was replaced by middle income groups. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) has been used widely to measure disease burden, using 17 comorbidities as the continuous variable (0 [no comorbidities] through 29 [multiple comorbidities]) without respiratory diseases. Regarding influenza and URI, asthma (ICD-10 codes: J45 and J46) and chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD, ICD-10 codes: J42 to J44, except J430) were additionally assigned if participants were treated ≥ two times and prescribed related medications, following our previous study15. In addition, hypertension (ICD-10 codes: I10 and I15) was additionally assigned if participants were treated ≥ two times, as this was not included in the CCI score.Statistical analysesThe general characteristics between the COVID-19 group and control group and between the severe morbidity group and mild morbidity group were compared using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and using the independent t test for continuous variables.To estimate the susceptibility of COVID-19 patients compared to that of control participants, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of influenza/URI were calculated using a crude model (simple model), model 1 (adjusted for CCI score, asthma, COPD, and hypertension), and model 2 (adjusted for model 1 plus influenza and URI) with conditional logistic regression. In these analyses, age, sex, and income were stratified. To estimate morbidity/mortality in COVID-19 patients by influenza/URI, unconditional logistic regression was used for the unmatched analyses. Conditional logistic regression was used as this allows for micro adjustment of covariates and to address the unequal sizes in the matched pairs after the exclusion of patients missing demographic information (age, sex, income, and region).To estimate the effects of the unmeasured confounders, the E-values of influenza and URI for COVID-19 infection and mortality of COVID-19 were calculated16. If the E-value was higher than the relations with unmeasured confounders, the association of influenza/URI with infection/mortality of COVID-19 could be valid16.For the subgroup analyses, we divided participants by age (< 50 years old and ≥ 50 years old), sex, income (low, middle, and high), CCI scores (one score, two scores, and ≥ two scores), asthma, COPD, and hypertension history.For statistical analyses, SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used. We performed two-tailed analyses, and significance was defined as P values less than 0.05.ResultsCOVID-19 susceptibilityHistories of influenza infections and URI in the previous 1–14 days, 1–30 days, and 1–90 days were more common in the COVID-19 patients than in the control participants (all P < 0.001, Table 1). Previous histories of influenza infection and URI were associated with increased positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 2). The histories of influenza infections were related to 3.07-fold (1.61–5.85) and 1.91-fold (1.54–2.37) higher rates of COVID-19 in the previous 1–14 days and 1–90 days, respectively. A history of URI was associated with higher rates of COVID-19 in the previous 1–14 days (6.95, [6.37–7.58]), 1–30 days (4.99 [4.64–5.37]), and 1–90 days (2.70 [2.55–2.86]). The COVID-19 susceptibility associated with previous histories of influenza infection or URI was consistent in all subgroups according to age, sex, income, CCI score, and histories of asthma, COPD, and hypertension (Figs. 2A–C, 3A–C, and Table S1).Table 1 General characteristics of participants.Full size tableTable 2 Crude and adjusted odds ratios of influenza and URI (previous 1–14, 1–30, and 1–90 days) for COVID-19 infection in all participants.Full size tableFigure 2Subgroup analyses of the participants with COVID-19 by previous histories of influenza regarding (A) susceptibility for 1–14 days, (B) 1–30 days (C), and 1–90 days; (D) morbidity for 1–14 days, (E) 1–30 days, (F) and 1–90 days; and (G) mortality for 1–14 days, (H) 1–30 days, and (I) 1–90 days.Full size imageFigure 3Subgroup analyses of the participants for COVID-19 susceptibility/morbidity/mortality by previous histories of URI regarding (A) susceptibility for 1–14 days, (B) 1–30 days (C), and 1–90 days; (D) morbidity for 1–14 days, (E) 1–30 days, (F) and 1–90 days; and (G) mortality for 1–14 days, (H) 1–30 days, and (I) 1–90 days.Full size imageTo assess possible coinfection, additional analyses were conducted for COVID-19 susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality associated with influenza/URI in the previous 15–45 days, 15–90 days, and 31–90 days (Table S2). The previous histories of influenza and URI for all of these periods demonstrated positive associations with susceptibility to COVID-19 (Table S3). The COVID-19 patients showed an increased number of medical visits for influenza/URI during the previous 1–365 days. These associations of previous influenza/URI with susceptibility to COVID-19 were valid in all subgroups according to age, sex, income, and past medical histories (Table S4).COVID-19 morbidityThe severe COVID-19 patients were older, more likely to be male, and in lower income groups than mild COVID-19 patients (all P < 0.001) (Table 1). The rates of high CCI score, asthma, COPD, and hypertension were higher in the severe COVID-19 patients than in the mild COVID-19 patients (all P < 0.001). The severe COVID-19 patients showed a higher rate of history of influenza infections for the previous 1–14 days and previous 1–30 days (P = 0.003 and P = 0.006, respectively).A history of influenza/URI was associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity (Table 3). The history of influenza infection was related to 3.64-fold (1.55–9.21) and 3.59-fold (1.42–9.05) higher rates of morbidity for the previous 1–14 days and 1–30 days, respectively. URI history was associated with 1.40-fold (1.11–1.78) and 3.59-fold (1.02–1.61) higher rates of morbidity for the previous 1–14 days and 1–30 days, respectively. The association of previous histories of influenza/URI with COVID-19 morbidity was solid in the ≥ 50-year-old subgroups, low- and middle-income subgroups, no past medical history subgroup (CCI score = 0), and no past medical histories of asthma and COPD subgroups (Figs. 2D–F, 3D–F, and Table S5).Table 3 Crude and adjusted odds ratios of influenza and URI (previous 1–14, 1–30, and 1–90 days) for morbidity in COVID-19 participants.Full size tableHistories of influenza/URI in the previous 15–45 days, 15–90 days, and 31–90 days were not associated with severe COVID-19 (Table S6). The number of medical visits for the previous 1–365 days for influenza/URI was not related to severe COVID-19. The ≥ 50-year-old subgroup and the subgroups with CCI scores ≥ 2 and hypertension showed positive associations of the number of medical visits for influenza during the previous 1–365 days with COVID-19 morbidity (Table S7).COVID-19 mortalityOverall, COVID-19 mortality did not show an association with previous histories of influenza/URI for 1–14 days, 1–30 days, and 1–90 days (Table 4). The histories of influenza/URI in previous 15–45 days, 15–90 days, and 31–90 days and the number of medical visits for influenza/URI during the previous 1–365 days were not related to COVID-19 mortality (Table S8).Table 4 Crude and adjusted odds ratios of influenza and URI (previous 1–14, 1–30, and 1–90 days) for mortality in COVID-19 participants.Full size tableHowever, the OR of mortality was increased in some subgroups (Figs. 2G–I, 3G–I, Table S9, and Table S10). The subgroups of men (6.63 [1.08–40.61]), low income (15.40 [1.46–162.97]), and hypertension history (11.39 [1.07–121.50]) showed positive associations between influenza in the previous 1–14 days and COVID-19 (Table S9).DiscussionA previous history of influenza/URI was associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity in this study. These positive associations were valid up to the previous periods of 1–90 days before COVID-19 onset. Severe COVID-19 morbidity was also associated with recent histories of influenza/URI. On the other hand, COVID-19 mortality was not related overall, but it was linked in some subgroups. Furthermore, this study evaluated the morbidity/mortality of subsequent COVID-19 infection after influenza infection or URI for the first time, while previous studies reported the increased morbidity/mortality of coinfected patients with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza7,8,11.The COVID-19 susceptibility rate was increased in the patients with previous histories of influenza/URI in the present study. This result was contrary to previous studies that estimated a lower rate of COVID-19 in conditions with other viral pathogens8,17,18. These previous studies mainly investigated the effects of the positivity of other pathogens8,18 or the positivity of influenza-specific IgM19 on the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2. However, a serum antibody test study demonstrated that although approximately 23% of COVID-19 patients had SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies during the prepandemic period, these antibodies were not neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and were not related to reducing COVID-19 susceptibility and hospitalization20. A cross-sectional study reported different contracting patterns of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-221. There were no coinfected cases in their study, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in elderly individuals, while influenza virus infection was more prevalent in children less than 5 years old21. Furthermore, the antiinfection effects of nonpharmacologic interventions, such as wearing face masks, social distancing, restrictions on movement and health behaviors of infected patients, could mediate the decreased COVID-19 incidence in patients with influenza/URI22,23,24.The higher susceptibility might be partially attributed to the underlying immune capability or environmental factors that could promote susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza/URI. A compromised immune response may increase susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses are able to block interferon activation and signaling25. Mucociliary clearance dysfunction by respiratory viruses could contribute to coinfection with other viruses26. Lymphopenia or T cell exhaustion induced by influenza virus25 may be the cause of higher susceptibility to COVID-19. In addition, low socioeconomic status and poor hygiene could support high susceptibility to respiratory viral infections27. Occupation, residence, and social activity factors could also influence the opportunity for contact with viral pathogens28.Severe COVID-19 morbidity was associated with previous histories of influenza/URI in this study. The incompetency of immune responses to viral infections could be linked with COVID-19 severity in patients with previous influenza/URI histories. A meta-analysis demonstrated that increased white blood cell counts, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, elevated biomarkers for inflammation, cardiac and muscle injury, liver and kidney dysfunction, and coagulation dysfunction were related to severe COVID-1929. These biomarkers for severe COVID-19 were also associated with increased vulnerability to influenza/URI30. The incomplete recovery of immune and inflammatory responses due to the recent histories of influenza/URI could impose a more severe clinical presentation for subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as the more remote infection histories of influenza/URI were not related to the more severe morbidity of COVID-19 in this study (Table S3). A retrospective cohort study reported higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-2R (IL-2L), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α, in coinfected patients with influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 than in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection only31.Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the current results. Ethnic and regional differences might exist for the association of previous influenza/URI with susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-1932,33. The diagnosis of URI did not include laboratory results and could not differentiate viral or bacterial etiologies. For influenza infection, patients who were prescribed anti-influenza medications without health insurance coverage could not be included in this study. However, all Koreans are legally registered to the national health insurance system, and the proportion of uninsured prescriptions might be rare. Because of the relatively low number of deaths from COVID-19 in Korea, this aspect could not be concluded by the low statistical power. Finally, although we analyzed six periods to minimize the effects of coinfections, the possible impacts of coinfections could not be totally excluded in this study.In summary, previous influenza/URI histories were associated with elevated COVID-19 susceptibility and morbidity in Korea. This study provides insight into why controlling influenza/URI could also be important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution regarding the potential risk of COVID-19 associated with previous influenza/URI infection might be an important infection prevention and control strategy.

(Image credit: Jose Luis Pelaez/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) Health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older, with a few exceptions, get a flu shot each year. Yet, the flu vaccine is far from foolproof, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If that's the case, why should you get it? On average, people who get the flu shot are between 40% and 60% less likely to catch the virus than unvaccinated individuals. So, although the flu shot may not prevent all cases of influenza, it helps protect you from severe infection and death and can help reduce the spread of the virus in communities. Each year from 2010 to 2020, between 12,000 and 52,000 people in the U.S. died of flu, and between 140,000 and 710,000 were hospitalized, according to the CDC. The CDC says that 80% of children who die from the flu are unvaccinated, though there isn’t data on vaccination status of adults who die from the flu. "Only about half of Americans get an annual flu vaccine," Katherina Grusich, a spokesperson for the CDC, told Live Science. "Many more people could be protected from flu if more people got vaccinated."Related: It's safe to follow the vaccine schedule for babies. Here's why.How does the flu shot work?The flu vaccine prompts the body to create antibodies against influenza, which primes the immune system to fight the virus the next time it sees it. The flu vaccine is available in several forms, some of which work better for specific populations. For example, most flu shots are given as inactivated vaccines, which contain dead virus. The nasal spray vaccine, though, contains a weakened version of a live flu virus, according to the CDC."All current flu vaccines in the United States are 'quadrivalent' vaccines, which means they protect against four different flu viruses: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses," Grusich said. "Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection."Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The four flu strains included in the seasonal flu vaccine are chosen based on those that are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere during their seasonal flu outbreaks, according to the CDC.How effective is the flu shot?When researchers study vaccines, they're looking for several types of data that can reveal how well these vaccines work. Efficacy is how well a vaccine works in a controlled clinical trial, looking at how many people who got the vaccine ended up getting sick, compared with those who didn't get the vaccine. If a vaccine has an 80% efficacy at preventing illness, 80% fewer people in the flu-shot group of the clinical trial will get sick. Effectiveness is how well the virus works in the real world, usually analyzed through observational studies after a given season is over. Real-world populations are much larger and more variable than those included in clinical trials. If a vaccine has an 80% effectiveness at preventing illness, 80% fewer of the people who get the vaccine will have gotten sick that year.The average effectiveness at preventing laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza between the 2009-2010 season and 2019-2020 season was about 43%, meaning that people who got the flu vaccine over those years were on average 43% less likely to get sick enough with the flu to go to their doctor and get tested. Why should you get the flu shot?Even though the flu shot isn't the most effective vaccine, it still provides some protection against infection, especially for healthy people. And most importantly, even at its modest effectiveness, the flu vaccine helps to protect against the worst effects of a flu infection: hospitalization or death.A 2021 review published in the journal Vaccine found that adults who got a flu vaccine but still got sick were 26% less likely to require intensive care, and vaccinated patients who ended up in the hospital were 31% less likely to die from the flu, compared with people who were not vaccinated. RELATED MYSTERIES—Is it safe to stand in front of microwave ovens?—Are non-stick pans safe?—Why do people sneeze in threes?The CDC also recommends that people get the flu shot during pregnancy, which changes the immune system, heart and lungs in ways that increase susceptibility to influenza. Between 2010 and 2016, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant person's risk of being hospitalized with flu by about 40% compared with unvaccinated pregnant people, according to a 2018 study in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. Other studies cited by the CDC suggest that getting a flu shot during pregnancy can also protect the newborn from catching the flu. Flu vaccines are also important for children. Between 2010 and 2014, flu shots reduced a healthy child's risk of dying from the flu by 65%, according to a 2017 study in the journal Pediatrics.Overall, CDC data estimates that during the 2019-2020 flu season in the U.S., the vaccine prevented 7.5 million people from getting sick with the flu, saved 3.7 million people visits to the doctor for the flu, prevented 105,000 people from being hospitalized with the flu, and prevented 6,300 flu-related deaths.In the United States, flu season usually lasts from December to February, although significant activity can continue until May, according to the CDC. To plan for this, people should get their flu shots by the end of October, Grusich said. Originally published on Live Science.

Some of them have gained the capability to transmit into human from the avian reservoir. Understanding the molecular events and the involved factors in breaking the cross-species barrier holds important implication for the surveillance and prevention of potential influenza outbreaks. In this review, we summarize recent progresses, including several ground-breaking findings, in how the interaction between host and viral factors, exemplified by the PB2 subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase co-opting host ANP32 protein to facilitate transcription and replication of the viral genome, shapes the evolution of IAVs from host specificity to cross-species infection. Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major pathogen that greatly impacts human health and the poultry industry with a broad host tropism, capable of infecting various hosts, including wildfowl, swine, bat, and humans being. IAV is a negative-stranded RNA virus comprising eight segments. Two major surface proteins of IAV are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are used for classifying IAV subtypes based on sequence similarity. Up to date, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been discovered, with H17, H18, N10, and N11 being only found in bats (Tong et al., 2013). Besides HA and NA, the IAV genome encodes at least 16 additional viral proteins, among which PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1, and NS2 proteins have been extensively characterized with relatively clear function while PB2-S1, PB1-F2, PB1-N40, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, M42, and NS3 protein represent more recently discovered proteins (Vasin et al., 2014) and their functions remain largely unknown. Birds are the major, if not the only, natural reservoir of IAV. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) can be divided into low-pathogenic (LPAIV) and highly pathogenic (HPAIV) strains, as determined by the presence of different types of the proteolytic cleavage site in HA (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005). The genetic diversity of IAVs is driven by an error-prone replication machinery, in addition to genetic reassortment events where viruses co-infecting the same cell exchange segments. As a result, a cross-species spillover can occasionally occur as an AIV mutant acquires the ability to transmit into aquatic (dolphins, seals, whales) or terrestrial mammals (pigs, horses, mink). Recent reports on human infection of AIV can be traced back to the year of 1997, when the contraction of H5N1 AIV killed 6 people in Hong Kong (Wong and Yuen, 2006). In 2003, an H7N7 AIV outbreak was reported in Netherlands, infecting 84 people with one death (Wong and Yuen, 2006). The threats of transmission of AIV to humans appear to continue growing: local outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV occurred in many Asia countries until 2004 (Stegeman et al., 2004); a total of 1,568 human infection H7N9 AIV has been reported, responsible for at least 617 deaths; the human spillover of H10N8 and H5N6 AIV were also observed (Chen et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015). These indicate that, although breaking the cross-species barrier is difficult, there is always a likelihood of it happening with an expanding reservoir of AIV. Thus, exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the host specificity of IAV and the events leading to their breach is an important step toward improving the preparedness of future influenza pandemics by instructing the development of enhanced surveillance of potential risk of avian-to-human transmission; identifying hidden virus–host interfaces as new targets for antivirals. This review will summarize recent advances that start to unfold the complexity of species-specific virus–host interactions underpinning the host range of IAVs. Viral Determinants of IAV Host Specificity A clear announcement of host specificity of IAV is made because avian viruses generally show poor replication in mammalian cells, and vice versa. The host restriction of IAV has been linked to the difference between host of factors governing viral entry and multiple intracellular steps required for viral replication. Consequently, only AIVs with adaptive mutations, which account for a small portion of the virus pool that emerged from the natural reservoir, gain the ability to infect mammalian cells. These mutations are discussed in details per involved viral proteins. The Viral HA Protein The entry of IAV into host cells, representing the first species barrier to overcome, is mediated by viral surface hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Although all HA proteins have a general cell receptor in sialic acids (SA), a diverse family of sugar units terminally attached to glycans decorating surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, they show an origin-dependent preference for sialic acid-galactose linkage. HAs from human influenza viruses preferably recognize α-2,6 linked SA (α-2,6 receptor) while those of avian origin showed a higher binding affinity with α-2,3-linked SA (α-2,3 receptor; Matrosovich et al., 1997, 2000). The correlation of this recognition pattern with SA distribution in human tissues explains why avian IAV normally cannot infect humans. In humans, α-2,6 receptors are mainly expressed on cells of the ciliated epithelium along the upper respiratory tract (URT), while α-2,3 receptors are primarily found in the lower respiratory tract (LRT; Shinya et al., 2006). In contrast, pig trachea presents both α-2,3 and α-2,6 receptors and is thus susceptible to infection of both human and avian virus, making pig a mixing vessel where new viruses can be generated through reassortment from parental virus of different origins. Extensive structural studies have revealed the modes of interactions between HA and their corresponding SA receptor (Long et al., 2019). A wider receptor binding site (RBS) has been posited to form the basis of human-adapted HA accommodating α-2,6 SA linkage, which appears bulkier than the α-2,3 SA linkage. Several adaptive mutations in RBS of avian HAs have been shown to cause a switch of binding specificity, exemplified by E190D/G225D and A138S in H1 HA and Q226L/G228S in the HAs of H2 and H3 subtypes (Shi et al., 2014). These mutations increase binding affinity to the human receptor while reducing the binding to the avian receptor. The HA proteins of recently emerged H7N9 AIV that showed high pathogenicity in human infections appear to acquire some ability to bind to human receptor despite maintaining the preference for the avian receptor (Xu et al., 2013). This change was particularly exhibited by the Anhui-H7N9 virus, which harbors four mutations in RBS, namely S138A, G186V, T221P, and Q226L, accounting for the shift of receptor binding preference (Shi et al., 2013). As for the H5N1 virus, those causing human infections retain preference for avian receptor but such specificity can be skewed to human side by HA mutations in position 226 and 228, which are also required for airborne transmissibility (Stevens et al., 2008). Overall, typical AIV strains have not yet shown acquisition of transmissibility among humans until now. Despite the odds, the possibility of AIV breaking such a barrier cannot be ruled out, especially considering that multiple types of HA can attain airborne transmission ability in mammalian model systems (Kuchipudi et al., 2021). The Viral NA Protein As another major viral surface protein alongside HA, NA possesses sialidase activity and is responsible for cleaving SA from the cell surface to facilitate the release of the progeny virus particle (Schrauwen et al., 2014). Strong evidence supporting the adaptation of NA to host came from the short-stalk NA favored by poultry IAV, which is speculated to match short length of glycan linked to SA receptor (Li et al., 2010). However, this type of NA does not support airborne transmission in ferrets, likely due to ineffective cleavage with longer glycan and the resultant virus clumping. Thus, it has been proposed that a functional balance between the SA binding of HA and NA sialidase activity is a critical element involved in the host fitness of IAV (Lakdawala et al., 2015). Interestingly, a second HA binding site was found on some NAs, contributing to their hemadsorption (Hd) activity. Such Hd site was originally thought to regulate the catalytic activity of NA positively, but the recent characterization of NA protein from the H7N9 virus indicated that its existence might allow enhanced receptor binding, particularly to human-like α2,6-linked sialic acid (Benton et al., 2017). It remains to be determined whether the Hd site contributes to the ability of the H7N9 virus to infect humans infection. The Viral Polymerase Proteins The transcription and replication of the viral genome, carried out by the viral RNA polymerase, are central to viral growth and consequently become a critical barrier to overcome during the adaptation of IAV to a new host. The tripartite RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IAV consists of polymerase protein basic 1 (PB1), polymerase protein basic 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA). Inside the virus, all the eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments are coated by nucleoprotein (NP) with RdRp binding to the conserved 5′ and 3′ ends to form viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes (Nilsson et al., 2017). Once transported into the nucleus in infected cells, RdRp first transcribes vRNA into mRNA for viral protein production, a process initiated by a cap snatching mechanism wherein a nucleotide sequence of 10–20nt length is cleaved from the 5′ end of host mRNAs by a sequential action of PB2 and PA and subsequently serve as the primer for viral mRNA synthesis (Dias et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2009). The replication of the viral genome ensues after accumulation and nuclear transport of newly synthesized RdRp proteins. In contrast to transcription, the RdRp-mediated replication is primer independent and involves cRNA as an intermediate product. Additionally, NP is required for replication while dispensable for transcription. Recent studies also suggest that the catalytic activity of RdRp in vRNA replication requires dimer formation between an RNA-bound RdRp and free RdRp, which acts as a relay station to synthesize vRNA from cRNA (Nilsson et al., 2017). The central domain of RdRp is composed of PB1, the C-terminal domain of PA, the N-terminal one-third of PB2 encompassing the N terminus, the lid domain, and the N1 and N2 linkers (Nilsson et al., 2017). The host adaptation of IAV RdRp is best displayed on PB2, which is responsible for cap-binding and participates in NP binding via regions in its N- and C-terminals. Several mutations in PB2 have been identified to be important for promoting adaptation of avian IAV to mammalian, epitomized by Glu-to-Lys substitution at position 627 (E627K) and Asp-to-Asn substitution at position 701 (D701N; Gabriel and Fodor, 2014). Subbarao et al. first reported the identity of amino acid at position 627 as a dividing line between avian and human influenza virus with respective E and K dominance (Subbarao et al., 1993). Importantly, a single change of E to K at position 627 was sufficient for restoring the ability of a PB2 single gene reassortant to replicate effectively in canine (MDCK) cells (Subbarao et al., 1993). Further analysis revealed that PB2 E627K mutation could remarkably raise the RdRp activity in mammalian but not avian cells, leading to an increased virulence in mammalian hosts’ pathogenicity (Subbarao et al., 1993; Hatta et al., 2001; Gabriel et al., 2005). Indeed, 627K is commonly shared by a wide spectrum of human pathogenic IAVs, including H5N1, H7N9, H10N8, and H5N6 subtypes (Gao et al., 2013; Garcia-Sastre and Schmolke, 2014; Yang et al., 2015). D701N as a mammalian-like signature was first identified by Li et al. through analyzing the genetic determinant underlying the ability of a duck H5N1 IAV to replicate in mice (Li et al., 2005). More recently, some H9N2 viruses isolated from minks were reported to contain the PB2 701N mutation and consequently showed enhanced virulence in mice compared to those without such mutation, supporting the potential of mink as a mixing vessel or intermediate host for H9N2 virus and possibly other IAVs (Xue et al., 2018). Interestingly, other PB2 mutations, though less frequent than 627K or 701N, can also promote human adaption. For example, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus harbors neither PB2 627K nor PB2 701N signatures (Mehle and Doudna, 2009). Instead, its mammalian adaptation was supported by PB2 G590S/G591R polymorphisms, which also conveyed enhanced RdRp activity in human cells (Mehle and Doudna, 2009). PB2-Q591K and K526R are two other mutations shown in H9N2 virus and H7N9/H5N1 viruses capable of conferring effective replication in mammalian cells in the absence of 627K and 701N (Song et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). The combinatorial effects of different adaptive mutations have also been studied. H7N9 virus bearing both 627K and 526R replicates more efficiently in mammalian cells than those carrying the individual mutation, consistent with greater mortality in mice (Song et al., 2014). Mechanistically, the combination of 526R with 627K appeared to optimize the interaction between PB2 and nuclear export protein (NEP), thereby promoting higher polymerase activity. A similar synergistic effect between PB2-526R and 701N was also documented. In contrast, the co-existence of PB2 E627K and D701N mutations has not yet been detected in naturally occurring virus isolates, suggesting potential functional redundancy of the two mutations (Steel et al., 2009; Gabriel and Fodor, 2014). Adaptive mutations of other components of IAV replication machinery were also identified, despite being less frequent than what was seen with PB2. A divergency at the position of PB1 protein of human influenza A/H1N1 viruses was recently identified: This position was predominantly occupied by the avian-associated serine residue before switching to mammalian-associated glycine residue near the onset of the 2009 pandemic (Lin et al., 2019). Subsequent studies showed that PB1-216G was a lower RdRp fidelity variant than PB1-216S, thereby allowing the H1N1 virus to yield adaptive mutations at higher rates and promoting viral epidemiological fitness (Lin et al., 2019). Multiple studies revealed the role of PA in the human adaptation of AIV. It was found that, in avian H9N2 background, a single replacement of PA segment from 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus resulted in enhanced viral polymerase activity, leading to a higher pathogenicity in infected mice (Sun et al., 2011). A systematic comparison of a panel of reassortant viruses between a duck-derived H5N1 and a highly transmissible human-infective H1N1 virus showed that PA and nonstructural gene are the major H1N1 determinants of droplet-mediated transmission between guinea pigs (Zhang et al., 2013). A couple of human adaptive PA mutations were identified, including E349G and PA 97I, with a positive impact on viral polymerase activity in mammalian cells (Song et al., 2009). Evidence supports the concerted action between mutations of different RdRp subunits and NP protein in enhancing human adaptation. Gabriel et al. reported that mutations in PB2, PA, and NP, namely PB2 701N and 714R, PA 615N, and NP 319K, cooperatively enhance AIV SC35 (H7N7) polymerase activity and consequently enable an effective replication in mammalian cells (Gabriel et al., 2005). The coupling between PB2 D701N and NP D319K mutation was confirmed in other studies (Gabriel et al., 2011). The molecular mechanism(s) underpinning synergy between these mutations in enhancing mammalian fitness of AIV has yet to be fully delineated, though some studies, as described below, suggested the involvement of importin-α. NS1A and Other Viral Proteins The interferon (IFN)-centered innate immune response represents the first-line defense against viral infection. Accordingly, IAV develops several viral countermeasures epitomized by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 protein is produced by the co-linear transcript of RNA segment 8, which also encodes NS2 (NEP) through alternative splicing (Liu et al., 1997). NS1A comprises an RNA binding domain (RBD) and an effector domain (ED); both domains contribute to the ability of NS1A to use multiple rather than single tactics to evade the IFN antiviral response (Yin et al., 2007; Bornholdt and Prasad, 2008). Two main mechanisms have been proposed for the IFN countering the action of NS1A, namely blocking the activation of RIG-I, the major pattern recognition receptor responsible for sensing the incoming IAV genome, and inhibiting the activity of CPSF30 (Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30kDa subunit) from suppressing the maturation and consequently the nuclear export of IFN mRNA (Cho et al., 2020; Rosário-Ferreira et al., 2020). The RNA-binding of NS1, once thought to sequester dsRNA produced by viral replication from host dsRNA sensor, was shown to primarily function as a competitor of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) to suppress the RNaseL antiviral pathway (Min and Krug, 2006). NS1A is also engaged in interactions with various host factors without known roles in innate immune response, implicating additional regulatory roles in other aspects of the viral cycle (Rosário-Ferreira et al., 2020). The wide spectrum of host protein interactions by NS1A has been proposed as a result of the ready-for-exploitation nature of its ED (Cho et al., 2020) and/or a double-stranded RNA platform that strengthens the weak interactions NS1A with certain host factors (Chen et al., 2020). Several naturally occurring mutations of NS1 have been linked to enhanced viral replication and pathogenicity, including D92E, P42S, and deletion of 80-84 residues (del80-84). As expected, these mutations were often associated with increased virus resistance to interferon (Seo et al., 2002). It is a bit of surprise that the CPSF30 binding site of NS1A is not conserved across IAVs: Although the majority of NS1A proteins bind to CPSF30, those from pandemic H1N1 2009 virus and human-infective H5N1 1997 virus cannot (Long et al., 2019), which leads to a hypothesis that gain or loss of CPSF binding of NS1A may be a viral means to balance between viral replication and interferon antagonism on the road toward mammalian adaptation. Sequence analyses also pinpoint several amino changes that could associate with the adaptation of AIV to mammalian host, such as the alteration of last amino acids from ESEV to RSKV (Zielecki et al., 2010), and the D125G substitution introducing an extra splice site into the NS gene (Selman et al., 2012). However, whether and how these changes may influence the host range of AIV remained to be determined. Overall, a link between NS1 mutations and cross-species transmission of AIVs is still elusive. Apart from NS1A, the human adaptation of AIV may be facilitated by mutating viral accessory proteins that were recently discovered, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X. PB1-F2 is an 87-amino acid small protein produced from PB1 encoding sequence through +1 frameshift and has been shown to antagonize antiviral innate immunity possibly via interaction with components of the RIG-I/MAVS system, particularly the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein (Mazur et al., 2008). Interaction between PB1-F2 and PB1 has also been documented and is in line with the enhancing effect of PB1-F2 on the RdRp activity (Mazur et al., 2008). The role of PB1-F2 in the viral pathogenesis was highlighted by the finding that a single amino acid substitution in PB1-F2, namely N66S, is associated with increased virulence of the 1997 human H5N1 virus is also conserved in the 1918 pandemic virus (Conenello et al., 2007). However, the ORF of PB1-F2 is often truncated or lost in swine or human IAVs, raising the speculation that PB1-F2 is not essential for IAV mammalian adaptation or a compensatory mechanism has been acquired (Long et al., 2019). PA-X is the product of +1 ribosomal frameshifting during translation of PA protein, retaining the 191-aa long N-terminal endonuclease domain while acquiring a unique C-terminal region known as X-ORF, commonly encoding 61 aa (Jagger et al., 2012). PA-X is known to facilitate viral growth by coordinating the virus-mediated shutoff of host gene expression (Gaucherand et al., 2019). Interestingly, some IAV strains possess early stop codon in the X-ORF, resulting in a truncated PA-X protein 41 aa in length (Sun et al., 2020). Avian, equine, and human seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses generally encode full-length X-ORF while truncated X-ORF is characteristic of the 2009 pandemic H1N1, swine and canine viruses (Sun et al., 2020). In terms of swine influenza viruses (SIVs), the majority of early isolates were found to express a full-length PA-X until 1985, from when isolates featuring truncated PA-X gradually increased to become the dominant species, implicating a selection favoring truncated PA-X in pigs (Xu et al., 2016). Indeed, Xu et al. demonstrated that, in the background of a “triple-reassortment” H1N2 SIV, mutating X-ORF to express a full-length PA-X resulted in attenuated viral replication and transmission in pigs (Xu et al., 2017). By contrast, an investigation based on the 2009 pandemic H1N1 revealed that full-length PA-X protein supported increased virulence in mice relative to the truncated form (Gao et al., 2015). Thus, PA-X is a likely contributing factor to the host specificity of IAV. The notion was further strengthened by the finding that single human-specific amino acid substitutions in PA-X, particularly the R195K mutation, might underpin the animal-to-human jump of H7N9, H5N6, and H1N1/2009 viruses (Sun et al., 2020). Intracellular Host Factors Underlying the Host Specificity of IAV: Importin-α and ANP32A Take the Lead A major recent advance in understanding the host specificity of IAV is identifying the related intracellular host factors, best represented by importin-α and ANP32 proteins. Importin-α In uninfected cells, importin-α functions as an adaptor protein involved in the nuclear transportation of host proteins possessing nuclear localization signal (NLS; Stewart, 2007). IAV-infected cells are usurped by the virus to transport incoming vRNPs into the nucleus and are also responsible for nuclear importation of newly synthesized PB2 and NP proteins following primary transcription, which is a requisite for sustained viral replication (Stewart, 2007). Avian and human IAVs appear to engage different importin-α isoforms for effective viral replication as revealed using importin-α-silenced cells and importin-α-knockout mice: Avian virus depends on importin-α3, whereas human virus displays a switch to importin-α7 dependency; the 2009 H1N1 pandemic IAV instead showed a dual dependency of both importin-α3 and importin-α7, suggesting ongoing viral adaptation (Gabriel et al., 2011; Pumroy et al., 2015). Consistent with the viral replication data, avian- and human-like PB2 were found to bind preferentially to importin-α3 and importin-α7, respectively (Gabriel et al., 2011). Further evidence that differential importin-α recognition is a mechanism of IAV host specificity came from binding studies that D701N mutation enhances the interaction between PB2 and importin-α7, so does D319K for NP (Gabriel et al., 2011). Given the proximity of 701 to the NLS of PB2, it has been speculated that the D701N mutation might induce a conformation change that facilitates a stronger binding to importin-α (Tarendeau et al., 2007; Sediri et al., 2015). Interestingly, a most recent study identified a correlation between PB2-D701N/NP-D319K mutations and reduced expression of importin-α3 in the respiratory tract of IAV-infected humans and mice. As importin-α3 mediates the nuclear import of NF-κb and is thus required for induction of various antiviral genes in IAV-infected cells, its downregulation complements the virus’s capability to access importin-α7 in ensuring that virus can gain replicative fitness in the human lung (Gabriel et al., 2008; Thiele et al., 2020). ANP32 Proteins Once in the nucleus, the IAV viral polymerase needs to utilize host machinery for effective transcription and genome replication, and this represents another major barrier that AIV needs to surpass upon avian-mammalian adaptation. The original clue for this barrier came from the observation that the poor activity of avian IAV polymerase in mammalian cells could be rescued by fusion with avian cells to form heterokaryons, which can be explained by the absence of a supportive avian host factor in mammalian cells. Long et al. first discovered this longed-for host factor as chicken ANP32A. Surprisingly, there is a human homolog of chicken ANP32A (chANP32A); the major difference between chicken and human ANP32A is that the former possesses an additional 33 amino acids between the shared leucine-rich repeats and carboxy-terminal low-complexity acidic region domains owing to exon duplication (Long et al., 2016; Figure 1). Importantly, the 33-aa insertion was responsible for the superiority of chicken ANP32A over human ANP32A in supporting the activity of avian PB2-627E viral polymerase in mammalian cells (Long et al., 2016; Domingues and Hale, 2017). In this regard, the PB2 E627K mutation was selected to meet the viral need to co-opt the mammalian ANP32A for effective viral replication. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Schematic illustration of chicken (A) and human ANP32A (B). The avian-specific 33-amino acid insertion is highlighted in red with the containing SUMO binding motif being indicated by an arrow. Subsequent studies further revealed deep connections between ANP32 family proteins and human adaption of IAV polymerase. The activity of ANP32A appears to be regulated by alternative splicing in avian cells, resulting in variants containing essential no (human-like), partial, or full 33aa-insertion (Baker et al., 2018). More interestingly, the usage of ANP32A splicing sites varies across different bird species, and some species predominantly express human-like ANP32A, most pronounced in swan goose (>70%) and ostrich (close to 100%; Domingues et al., 2019). It is thus proposed that the differential ANP32A splicing inherent to natural avian hosts may provide a pre-adaptation mechanism that shapes the evolution of PB2 to facilitate cross-species transmission (Domingues et al., 2019). A recent finding further strengthened the view of ANP32A as a facilitator of IAV evolution. Swine ANP32A is capable of supporting avian-type IAV polymerase activity, although to a less extent as compared with avian ANP32A, consistent with the pig as an important intermediate host for zoonotic IAVs (Zhang et al., 2020a). This unique feature of swine ANP32A was attributed to 106V, which exhibits positive epistasis with 156S and has not been found in other studied vertebrate species (Zhang et al., 2020a). Recent studies also revealed another member of ANP32 family, ANP32B, in regulating IAV polymerase activity. This revelation was made using human ANP32A and ANP32B single- and double-knockout cells as only in the latter cells was the viral polymerase activity abrogated (Zhang et al., 2019). The analysis also indicated that human ANP32B is a more potent pro-viral factor than human ANP32A. In contrast, the viral polymerase supporting activity was lost in chicken ANP32B, and further dissection pinpointed residue 129 and 130 as the critical determinant of ANP32B activity: Avian ANP32B possesses isoleucine and asparagine at the two positions, whereas in human ANP32A and ANP32B, as well as avian ANP32A, they are filled with asparagine and aspartate (Zhang et al., 2019). The precise mechanism by which ANP32 regulates the activity of IAV RNA polymerase remains unclear. ANP32A or ANP32B was associated with the trimeric viral polymerase in infected cells or when they were simultaneously expressed by co-transfection (Zhang et al., 2019). The failure of ANP32A to bind to free PB2 in co-expressed cells indicated that such association requires the formation of a viral polymerase complex. On the other hand, in vitro binding assay employing purified protein revealed a direct interaction between ANP32A and the 627 domain of PB2. However, the binding of human or chicken ANP32A to viral polymerase appears to be independent of PB2-627 identity (Domingues and Hale, 2017). Following the finding that chicken ANP32A binds to PB2 stronger than human ANP32A, Domingues et al. discovered a sumo interaction motif (SIM) in the first four residues of the avian-specific 33-aa insertion and suggested it might account for increased binding of chicken ANP32A to PB2 (Domingues and Hale, 2017). However, a natural splicing variant of chicken ANP32A with SIM deletion can support viral polymerase activity, though less effective than that with a complete 33-aa insertion (Domingues and Hale, 2017). Recently, Baker et al. provided experimental evidences linking ANP32A to a specific form of the viral polymerase (Baker et al., 2018). The binding of ANP32A to viral polymerase in co-transfected cells was enhanced in the presence of viral genomic RNA. It was known that the low activity of PB2 627E viral polymerase can be trans-complemented by mutations at positions 3 and 5 of 3′ vRNA promoter. When assayed on reporter bearing such mutant vRNA promoter, chANP32A showed a little enhancing effect, implying the same or similar mechanism shared by a mutant promoter and chANP32A (Baker et al., 2018). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ANP32A facilitates the assembly of either cRNP, vRNP, or both. Structural approaches have also searched the molecular basis for recognition of ANP32A by PB2. Using a combination of NMR and quantitative ensemble analysis, Camacho-Zarco et al. conducted a comparative analysis of complex formed between human ANP32A and human-adapted PB2-627-NLS domain (K627 form) versus that comprising avian ANP32A and avian adapted PB2-627-NLS domain (Camacho-Zarco et al., 2020). Although both complexes were highly dynamic, they were found to display two different modes of interaction: Human ANP32A utilizes a track of positively charged residues including K627 to maximize interaction with highly acidic IDD domain (alternative name of LCAR to highlight its low complexity); with such positive charged surface being interrupted by E627, avian ANP32A can compensate this loss by broadening the sampling of IDD domain to exploit more expanded interaction surface, particularly involving a hexapeptide motif present in the avian-specific 33-aa insertion (Camacho-Zarco et al., 2020). Despite providing the first structural insight into host-specific ANP32A-PB2 interaction, the study from Camacho-Zarco et al. could not interpret the previous observation that chicken ANP32A binds to PB2 more strongly than its human ortholog. Instead, it would predict a higher binding affinity between human ANP32A and 627K type PB2. More recently, Carrique et al. reported cryo-EM structures of influenza C virus polymerase (FluPolC) in complex with human or avian ANP32A (Carrique et al., 2020). In both structures, two FluPolC molecules, one bound to a 47-nt long vRNA and one staying free, formed an asymmetric dimer that ANP32A bridges through its LRR domain (Carrique et al., 2020). The LCAR domain of ANP32A further stabilizes the complex formation in the FluPolC-chicken ANP32A structure with the avian-specific 33-aa insertion directly interacting with the two juxtaposed 627 domains of PB2 (Carrique et al., 2020). The authors thus proposed that ANP32A-FluPol dimer functions as a platform for viral genome replication, where a vRNA-bound FluPolR and a free FluPolE act sequentially in cRNA synthesis and the ensued vRNP assembly (Carrique et al., 2020). However, chicken ANP32A, unlike human ANP32A/B, has limited ability to support the viral polymerase of the influenza B virus (Zhang et al., 2020b), whether such platform is shared by IAV viral polymerase remains to be determined. Conclusion The host specificity of the IAV is underpinned by complex interactions between viral proteins and host factors. This complexity is translated to the requirement of a constellation of mutations for the virus to adapt to a new host. Although recent studies begin to reveal the molecular basis of several human adaptive mutations, exemplified by PB2 627K, many questions remain to be addressed. For example, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the exact mechanism by which ANP32A is co-opted to enhance viral polymerase activity in a species-specific manner. To answer this, we might need a structure of ANP32A in complex with the matched viral polymerase of IAV. It is also unclear when the human adaptive mutations are selected in the human cells after transmission or preexisted in the animal side. In the case of PB2 627K, the presence of human-like ANP32A in some bird species and the ability of swine ANP32B to support a certain degree of PB2 627K viral polymerase activity would suggest the second possibility. Identifying PB1–216G, which lowers the viral polymerase activity, reminds us that changing the intrinsic property of viral polymerase may lead to adaptive mutations. Developing an effective countermeasure against innate immunity of new host is another essential stepstone for AIV to cross the species barrier. It is recognized that the outstanding ability of chicken cells to support AIV growth is at least partially ascribed to a compromised type I IFN system, i.e., lacking of a functional RIG-I homolog (Barber et al., 2010). In addition, the chicken version of Mx protein, which is a major IFN-induced anti-influenza effector molecule in mammal setting, is not capable of restricting influenza virus replication (Benfield et al., 2008). NS1A is the most likely viral candidate taking the assignment to cope with the challenge of more powerful innate immunity in mammal cells. Elucidating the relationship between the evolution of NS1A and adaptation of AIV to mammalian hosts and the underlying mechanism warrant future investigation. It should also be noticed that environmental and physiological factors, which we have not discussed here, also play an important role in the host restriction of IAV, particularly the transmissibility, which adds more constraints to inter-species transmission. A critical hidden constraint is recently revealed by an elegant study of Soh et al., demonstrating that the architecture of genome code makes some potential human adaption mutations impossible because they are inaccessible to single nucleotide substitution (Soh et al., 2019). Extension of the comprehensive, active search for potential human adaption mutations to other viral proteins might provide us a map of risk spots on viral proteins that we need to be aware of when evaluating the cross-species transmission potential of avian viruses. Finally, further exploration of mechanisms underlying the host specificity and cross-species infection is expected to help dissect the complicated network of host factors usurped by IAVs, thus providing new targets for developing therapeutics and antiviral drugs.

In addition to getting a flu shot from their primary care provider, walk-in appointments are available for students, faculty and staff through WVU Medicine Student Health and WVU Medicine Urgent Care. Walk-in appointments at WVU Medicine Student Health are offered during regular business hours (Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). The WVU Medicine Urgent Care location in Evansdale offers walk-in appointments Monday through Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 9:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Suncrest Town Centre location is open daily from 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. Operating hours for other WVU Medicine Urgent Care locations may vary. WVU Medicine requires all staff, providers, residents, students and volunteers to have a flu vaccination unless they have an approved medical or religious exemption. This includes WVU faculty and staff (state employees) whose job duties bring them into contact with patients as well as those whose work requires them to enter patient care areas intermittently, even if their main work location is elsewhere. Individuals who are uncertain if this requirement applies to them should ask their supervisor for clarification. Proof of immunization must be provided to the employee’s department supervisor. Both the WVU Medicine Student Health and WVU Medicine Urgent Care clinics also offer COVID-19 vaccination opportunities. First, second and booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine are available at these clinics, and individuals may choose to get their flu shot at the same time as their COVID-19 vaccine. Flu shots are a fully covered under PEIA and The Health Plan for insured employees, spouses and dependent family members. Flu shots also are covered for students under the Aetna Student Health insurance plan. Those not insured through these providers also may bill their insurance. Note: A $30 cash payment option also is available for the flu vaccine; however, most insurance providers fully cover the cost. The COVID-19 vaccine is offered free of charge. Visit the Talent and Culture or WVU Medicine Student Health websites for more information. Students should contact Student Health at 304-285-7200 with any questions.

Meanwhile, scientists are working on a way to combine them in a single jab.In the future, protection from COVID-19 and the flu might be combined in a single shot, experts sayCBC Radio · Posted: Oct 31, 2021 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: October 31, 2021A student pharmacist prepares a flu shot in Los Angeles last October. Canada's flu and respiratory virus season tends to start in November. (Damian Dovarganes/The Associated Press)Social SharingThe Dose21:56What's the latest in flu vaccines?Some experts fear this year's flu season will be severe - especially with the pandemic still raging in many parts of Canada. Dr. Brian Goldman speaks with Dr. Susy Hota, Medical Director for Infection Prevention and Control at University Health Network in Toronto, about the latest developments in flu vaccines.With flu season fast approaching, people who haven't been vaccinated against COVID-19 or qualify for a third dose can safely get shots to protect them against both illnesses in the same visit, say health experts.They anticipate that in the future, by applying the latest advances in mRNA technology, it may be possible to vaccinate a person against COVID-19 and the seasonal flu with a single vaccine. That's because vaccine developers have been working on developing influenza vaccines using mRNA technology, the kind used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, since before the pandemic, said Susy Hota, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University Health Network in Toronto. Several are already at the clinical trial stage.No COVID-19 and flu combo vaccine is that far along. Hota says it would be incredibly convenient to leverage mRNA technology to better protect people against the flu. "What the future may hold is having one single, combined vaccine that addresses multiple infections that circulate at the same time. So that could be COVID-19 and influenza," she told Dr. Brian Goldman, host of CBC Radio's The Dose podcast."We're not there yet. But wouldn't that be nice, coming in for your one respiratory virus injection that will cover you for that season?" People get flu shots in Calgary last October. The vaccinations are available at pharmacies and primary care offices. (Leah Hennel/Alberta Health Services)Flu viruses mutate frequently as they circulate around the world, Hota said. By the time scientists see what strains are taking off in the Southern Hemisphere and predict what to put in flu vaccines for people in the Northern Hemisphere, there could be mismatches.On average, flu vaccines are about 40 to 60 per cent effective in protecting you from infection, Hota said. Since people infected with flu are at higher risk for having heart attacks and other cardiac problems than the general population, flu vaccinations save lives, she said."If we were to see too many COVID-19 and influenza patients coming to our hospitals, that could paralyze the system," she said.Speed is of the essence to beat fluVaccine makers are trying to catch up with the mutating virus so that what's in their vials better matches the flu strains we might encounter from others who are coughing or perhaps talking a bit too close. That's where mRNA technology comes in. Experts say perhaps they could observe flu activity worldwide for a longer period and then take advantage of the speed of mRNA vaccine manufacturing to add circulating flu strains to vaccines in time to better protect the public.Dr. Susy Hota says getting two jabs at the same time to protect against COVID-19 and the flu is well worth it. (Craig Chivers/CBC)Scott Halperin, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, leads clinical trials for influenza and other vaccines at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology. He says mRNA technology could likely accelerate the manufacturing of flu vaccines compared with the time-consuming approach of growing the virus in chicken eggs that's used today.At least three companies say they're starting Phase 1 human safety trials of mRNA flu-only vaccines to check if the side-effects mirror those from conventional flu vaccines, such as a sore arm or fever. To eventually combine COVID-19 and flu protection in one jab, researchers first need to test that mRNA technology can be applied safely and effectively to influenza viruses. New technology brings better immunityModerna and Pfizer's mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 include the genetic instructions to make a modified spike protein from the virus. Once the vaccine is injected into the body, human cells use the instructions to make copies of the spike protein for the immune system to learn to recognize.WATCH | Flu shots recommended amid COVID's 4th wave:Doctors urging flu shots to prevent further health-care strain3 years agoDuration 3:30Canadians are being urged to get flu shots as soon as possible because doctors expect the flu season to be much worse than last year, when there were very few cases. They want to avoid further strain on the health-care system already struggling with COVID-19.For the three mRNA seasonal influenza vaccines in clinical trials now, companies need to show that combining flu strains this way doesn't lessen the effectiveness of the immune response before regulators like Health Canada consider approval.Alyson Kelvin, a scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan, has spent years studying different influenza vaccines and also works on COVID-19 vaccine candidates.Moderna, Novavax developing combined COVID-19, flu shotsWhen the next pandemic hits, scientists aim to have a vaccine already. Here's how"It seems that we do have this nice, broader immunity from mRNA vaccine technology," Kelvin said. "Could you somehow target more than one influenza strain at once?"Even if the answer is yes, Kelvin said, it's a leap to go from using one spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, to also covering four circulating influenza virus strains, as the current flu shots do, with a single shot."It's exciting, but I think that we need to really complete the investigation," Kelvin said. The all-in-one flu and COVID-19 vaccination studies haven't reached clinical trials in humans, which normally take years to complete.Researchers recognize that better strategies are needed to vaccinate against flu to achieve more protective responses, she said. Until then, public health officials hope people will continue wearing masks where necessary and washing their hands to protect against all of the pathogens that sicken people of all ages during respiratory virus season.Written by CBC's Amina ZafarRelated Stories Moderna, Novavax developing combined COVID-19, flu shots When the next pandemic hits, scientists aim to have a vaccine already.

Modelling by the Actuaries Institute, a professional body, predicted 1,600 deaths for the same period if the Covid pandemic had not occurred.Jennifer Lang, chair of the Actuaries Institute’s working group on Covid, said pandemic-related public health measures were likely the cause of the drop.“It’s the fact that we’ve taken steps to avoid infection from Covid, which has helped us to avoid being affected by a whole lot of other respiratory diseases,” she said.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search "Full Story" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s impossible to be absolutely certain because this is one of those statistical things that might just have happened, but certainly this has been the lowest level of respiratory death in the time that we’ve looked at.”Lang said flu cases have been down worldwide. “It’s been all of the different measures that people are taking to avoid mixing which has reduced the level of flu in circulation worldwide. A lot of health professionals are watching carefully to see what happens as people start mixing again.”A recent study led by Doherty Institute researchers, published in Nature Reviews Microbiology, has suggested that the “suppressive conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic” may have either strongly suppressed or completely wiped out a lineage of influenza B virus.Known as B/Yamagata, the lineage is one of two that usually results in seasonal illness, but it has not been definitively detected since April 2020.The study’s authors noted that pandemic-related behavioural changes such as social distancing, mask wearing, and travel restrictions were major factors contributing to a global drop in influenza incidence.The Doherty Institute’s Prof Ian Barr, the co-author of another influenza paper currently under review, said B/Yamagata’s extinction “may well reduce the amount of influenza B that circulates”.View image in fullscreenA woman wears exercises by the Yarra river in Melbourne during lockdown.

Last summer, Australian hospitals noted unseasonably high rates of respiratory syncytial virus in children.“With influenza, we had a big year in 2019,” Barr said. “That started very early in the year – February or March – and so that is a possibility to happen again.”Barr noted, however, that because influenza cases were down globally, it could also take time for infections to rise in Australia.“People should consider influenza vaccination in 2022 even if they didn’t get it in 2021, because of the increased risk.”The four-component seasonal flu vaccine selected for use in the 2022 southern hemisphere flu season will include B/Yamagata.But if the lineage is truly extinct, flu vaccines in future could be simplified down to three components, to protect against two strains of influenza A and a lineage of influenza B known as B/Victoria.“That may make the [vaccine] quicker and easier to make, and cheaper,” Barr said.Explore more on these topicsFluCoronavirusInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A: We are examining if the antiviral medication baloxavir (Xofluza) is non-inferior to, i.e., at least as good as, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to limit outbreaks of influenza. Each nursing home will be given a kit containing baloxavir or oseltamivir. When an index case of influenza-like illness occurs, the home will ‘activate’ the kit and administer it to all residents in that ward or facility, at the discretion of the facility. The primary outcome will be the number of lab-confirmed influenza cases. In other words, does using baloxavir early in an outbreak prevent at least as many subsequent cases of influenza as using oseltamivir? Q:How could the results influence future patient care? A: If nursing homes suspect an outbreak of influenza … the typical response is to administer oseltamivir prophylactically to all residents. Oseltamivir must be given every day for up to two weeks and requires monitoring renal function. Baloxavir, if effective for prophylaxis, only needs a single dose and has simpler dosing recommendations. If we show baloxavir is non-inferior but more convenient to use, it may become an attractive alternative. Q:Is enrollment ongoing? A: Our study timeline goes until the end of 2023, but we hope to complete enrollment before the next influenza season.

The prognostic value of NLR in other respiratory viral infections, such as Influenza, has not hitherto been extensively studied. We aimed to compare the prognostic value of NLR in COVID-19, Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection (RSV). A retrospective cohort of COVID-19, Influenza and RSV patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center from January 2010 to October 2020 was analyzed. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical parameters were collected. Two way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the association between NLR values and poor outcomes among the three groups. ROC curve analyses for each virus was applied to test the discrimination ability of NLR. 722 COVID-19, 2213 influenza and 482 RSV patients were included. Above the age of 50, NLR at admission was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). NLR was associated with poor clinical outcome only in the COVID-19 group. ROC curve analysis was performed; the area under curve of poor outcomes for COVID-19 was 0.68, compared with 0.57 and 0.58 for Influenza and RSV respectively. In the COVID-19 group, multivariate logistic regression identified a high NLR (defined as a value above 6.82) to be a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome, after adjusting for age, sex and Charlson comorbidity score (odds ratio of 2.9, P < 0.001). NLR at admission is lower and has more prognostic value in COVID-19 patients, when compared to Influenza and RSV.

Increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) have been found in patients with severe COVID-19, compared with individuals with mild disease, suggesting a possible role for a hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-191,2.Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a parameter used to assess the inflammatory status of a subject. It can easily be calculated from a complete blood count, a commonly used blood test3. NLR has previously been shown to predict outcomes in a variety of conditions including different types of malignancies, as well as in cardiovascular and rheumatic diseases4,5,6,7,8,9. Studies have also shown NLR to be useful in predicting outcomes of different types of infections, including community acquired pneumonia, bacteremia and endocarditis10,11,12. NLR has been studied and proved to be useful in differentiating between patients hospitalized with fever due to infection and those with fever due to non-infectious causes13,14.Focusing on viral infections (non COVID-19), the application of NLR has rarely been reported. One study showed the prognostic value of NLR in patients infected with avian influenza15. A number of recently published studies have found NLR to have a sensitivity of 70–86% in detecting influenza virus (A and B) infection in both elderly and pediatric populations16,17,18. However, these studies were small scale, including up to 100 patients in the case group, and up to 225 patients in the control group.Many studies have recognized increased NLR as an independent prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, especially in those older than 50. Four meta-analyses have demonstrated that an increased NLR can serve as an early warning signal of severe COVID-191,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. The criteria for severe disease varied between each study, but most studies considered the illness to be severe if a patient presented with one of the following: Respiratory distress, with a respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 30 breaths/min; Oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 93% in the resting state; Arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) (PF ratio) ≤ 300 mmHg22. Furthermore, NLR was found to be a prognostic factor for endotracheal intubation upon hospital admission and an independent predictor for risk of all-cause mortality during hospitalization20,29. The proposed optimum cut-off values to distinguish high NLR from low NLR ranged from 3 to 625.One recently published very small scale study from Taiwan investigated NLR as a marker for likelihood of COVID-19, in order to distinguish the disease from other upper respiratory infections (URI) in the early phase32. However, in their analysis, NLR elevation showed no difference between COVID-19 and URI.Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus are the two major viral pathogens associated with acute lower respiratory infection33. Several reports have described the global seasonality of these viruses. In these studies, both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus circulation peaks were well aligned with winter months in temperate regions34,35,36,37. Therefore, during the upcoming winter, clinicians worldwide will need to make fast and evidence-based decisions regarding further evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with flu-like symptoms.Thus, in the current study, we aim to compare the levels and prognostic value of NLR in COVID-19 with two other common respiratory viruses: Influenza virus (A and B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).MethodsStudy designWe conducted a retrospective observational study at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a tertiary-level 1200-bed academic hospital. For data collection purposes, we searched the microbiology laboratory database for positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasal swabs for Influenza (A and B), RSV and SARS-CoV-2 from 2010 through 2020. Patient’s data were extracted from electronic medical charts. The STROBE checklist was followed for all study procedures38. The study was reviewed and approved by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center institutional review board. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The institutional review board that approved the study also waived the need for informed consent due to the retrospective observational nature of the study.PatientsPatients were selected according to the following criteria: 1. Positive viral PCR for SARS-CoV-2, influenza (A or B) or RSV; 2. Hospital admission from 1.1.2010 to 7.10.2020; 3. Documented complete blood count (CBC). We did not include patients with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 or influenza (A or B) or RSV. Only patients over the age of 18 were included.Data collectionData were extracted from patient’s electronic health records. Baseline patient information included age, sex, and comorbidities, summarized using the Charlson comorbidity index39. For each patient, vital signs at admission (body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation), laboratory data (white blood cell and differential blood counts, C-reactive protein, ferritin, triglycerides) were retrieved. NLR values were calculated by dividing neutrophil count by lymphocyte count at admission. The primary outcome measure was a composite score of poor outcomes consisting of mortality, defined as death at 30 days and need for mechanical ventilation.MicrobiologyThe diagnosis of viral respiratory infection was done by PCR. Samples were collected by combined pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs that were inoculated into UTM tubes and immediately transported to the laboratory. RNA extraction was done using the easyMAG® system (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was done by RT-PCR using mostly the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene). The diagnosis of Influenza A&B and RSV was done using the Simplexa™ Flu A/B & RSV kit (DiaSorin) or the Seeplex® RV7 kit (Seegene).Statistical analysesThe characteristics of patients with influenza, RSV or COVID-19 were summarized as medians and interquartile ranges for continues variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Kruskal–Wallis and Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to compare between the three respiratory infections. For comparison between NLR values, adverse outcomes and their interaction among the three infection groups, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Since the distribution of NLR was highly skewed, log transformation was applied to create normally distributed data. The predictive values of NLR for poor clinical outcome were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. For COVID-19, the optimal cutoff value of NLR was determines using Youden’s Index. Multivariate logistic regression was further performed to obtain the odds ratio (OR) of NLR and additional factors. Statistical calculations were performed using the SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).ResultsWe found 722 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 2213 confirmed cases of Influenza (A and B), and 482 confirmed cases of RSV infection. All were identified using nasal swab reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score and vital signs at admission were compared between the three groups (Table 1). Age and sex were different between the groups with the patients in the RSV group being significantly older (mean 79 years, P < 0.001), and with significantly more men in the COVID-19 group (57.62%, P < 0.001). Comorbidities were presented by the Charlson score, which was significantly higher among the RSV patients (mean 5.0, P < 0.001). Regarding vital signs, body temperature was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group with a mean of 37.4 degrees Celsius (P < 0.001). Oxygen saturation at presentation was similar between the three groups.Table 1 Characteristics of patients presenting with viral infections.Full size tableA comparison of inflammatory markers at presentation including NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and triglycerides is displayed in Table 2. The Influenza patient’s median NLR was significantly higher (7.54, P < 0.001), than that of the RSV (median of 6.83) and COVID-19 patients (median of 4.5). The CRP levels did not differ between the groups, but the ferritin and triglycerides levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (median of 434.35 ng/mL and 123 mg/dL respectively, P < 0.001 for both). As NLR levels are age-dependent, we stratified NLR levels by age groups (18–30, 30–50, 50–70, and 70–110). Across all ages the NLR of COVID-19 patients was lower than that of Influenza patients; above the age of 50, NLR of COVID-19 patients was lower than that of both Influenza and RSV patients (Fig. 1).Table 2 Inflammatory markers of patients presenting with viral infections.Full size tableFigure 1NLR levels stratified by age groups.

Mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 and RSV groups compared with the influenza group (16.1%, 13.48% and 8.8% respectively, P < 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of patients required mechanical ventilation in the COVID-19 group compared to the influenza and RSV groups (9.6%, 6.6% and 8.1% respectively; P < 0.03).Table 3 Components of adverse outcomes score of patients presenting with viral infections.Full size tableFor purposes of analysis, a poor outcome was defined as the presence of any of the two above—mentioned endpoints. Among the three viruses, the COVID-19 patients had the highest composite score of poor clinical outcomes, when compared to influenza and RSV patients (19.5%, 12.5%, 18.9% respectively P < 0.001).We compared the association between NLR values and adverse outcomes among the three groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using log-transformed NLR levels as the dependent variable. A main effect was found for virus type: lower levels of NLR in COVID-19 in comparison to influenza and RSV (P < 0.001). Simple main effects analysis showed that in the COVID-19 group, poor clinical outcome was associated with higher NLR levels (P < 0.001), but no such association was apparent in the influenza and RSV groups (Fig. 2).Figure 2Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using log-transformed NLR levels as the dependent variable, comparing the association between NLR values and adverse outcomes among COVID-19, Influenza and RSV patients.

The area under curve (AUC) of poor outcomes for COVID-19, Influenza and RSV was 0.68, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively. The optimal cutoff of NLR for COVID-19 was obtained from Youden’s index: NLR of 6.82. We did not further analyze the other group’s ROC curves because of the low AUCs.Figure 3Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses for predicting poor outcomes for COVID-19, Influenza and RSV patients.

Results showed an odds ratio (OR) of 2.88 for NLR > 6.82 (P < 0.001) and a total AUC of 0.79 (Fig. 4). In this model age had an OR of 1.039 (P < 0.001) and sex was found to be non-significant in predicting a poor outcome among the COVID-19 patients (P = 0.66). Similar to high NLR, Charlson score was found to be a prognostic factor for adverse outcomes with an OR of 1.17 (P < 0.005).Figure 4Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for logistic regression model used to test the discrimination ability of NLR (above or below 6.82) as a prognostic factor of poor clinical outcome adjusted to age, sex and Charlson comorbidity index among COVID-19 patients.

The immune dysregulation that characterizes COVID-19 has been implicated as a possible explanation for its strong predictive value31. Anticipating the winter and influenza season, we set out to compere the predictive value of NLR across three respiratory viruses; SARS-CoV-2 (The causative agent of the infection named COVID-19), Influenza (A and B) and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).We compared the demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristics between these three respiratory viruses. RSV patients were significantly older (mean 79 years) with more comorbidities (expressed in a mean Charlson score of 5.0) (Table 1). Differences in mean body temperature were found to be statistically significant, with slightly higher values for COVID-19 patients, but the difference was not clinically meaningful. Interestingly, oxygen saturation at presentation was similar between the three groups. COVID-19 patients had a unique inflammatory profile, with significantly lower NLR values at presentation but with higher ferritin and triglycerides. CRP levels at presentation showed no significant difference across viruses. COVID-19 patients had higher 30-day mortality rates and a larger proportion of patients required mechanical ventilation.Reviewing the literature we found few small—scale studies comparing laboratory parameters of adult patients with COVID-19 and Influenza32,42,43 and none compared with RSV. Only two studies investigated the NLR levels in COVID-19 compared to Influenza. One found no difference, and the other found that NLR was significantly lower in the COVID-19 patients (median of 2.6), as was described in our report32,44. In all reports, as in ours, CRP levels at admission were similar across the viruses.Focusing on the prognostic value of NLR, we directly compared the association between NLR and a composite adverse outcome score between the three viruses. Only in the COVID-19 group poor clinical outcome was associated with higher NLR. Furthermore, when performing ROC analysis, only in the COVID-19 group NLR had a discrimination ability between patients with poor and favorable outcomes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NLR is a more valuable prognostic marker in COVID-19 compared to Influenza and RSV. This is opposed to former reports, which identified the role of NLR as a predictor of poor prognosis in Influenza patients15,16,17,18.The application of NLR as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 has been extensively studied. A high NLR implies an aberrant immune response, with increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes31. Neutrophil production can be triggered by virus-related inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and interferon-γ. Lymphopenia is common in COVID-19, as a result of direct cytokine—induced inhibition45. The massive over—production of these cytokines, or "cytokine storm", can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the hallmark of severe cases of COVID-1946. In one cohort, all COVID-19 patients with ARDS had an aberrant immune response [either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or "immune paralysis" (depletion of HLA-DR expression)]47. These patients had a sustained production of IL-6 and TNF-α, which was unique when compared to a retrospective cohort of influenza H1N1 2009 patients. Moreover, in vitro, higher levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL1-β were released from monocytes derived from COVID-19 patients compared to H1N1 2009 patients.In contrast to previous reports, our results did not demonstrate a prognostic value for NLR in influenza patients. This discrepancy may possibly be attributed to the small number of patients reported in previous studies.In RSV infection, NLR has not been hitherto studied. Current understanding of the immune response to RSV infection holds that severe cases are initially associated with neutrophilia and lymphopenia and thus would be expected to be associated with a high NLR.Following the neutrophilic response, RSV infection is associated with a pulmonary CD8 T-cell response and lymphocytes levels rise, coinciding with viral clearance48. Thus, theoretically, a low NLR would be expected to imply a favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, in our real-life, large cohort of RSV patients, NLR at admission did not have prognostic value.In order to determine the applicable threshold for high NLR we used a ROC curve. The optimal NLR threshold at 6.82 had the highest sensitivity and specificity for differentiating favorable and poor outcome. This result is in concordance with previous studies, in which the proposed optimum cutoff values ranged from 3 to 6. Two studies stratified the prognostic capacity of NLR by age21,49. In our study, a logistic regression model was used in order to test the discrimination ability of NLR (above or below 6.82) in predicting clinical outcomes adjusted to age, sex and Charlson comorbidity score. Our results show an OR of 2.882 for NLR and a total AUC of 0.79 (Fig. 4). This reinforces the conclusion that NLR is a valuable prognostic marker in COVID-19 patients, even after stratification according to sex, age and comorbidities.Our study has several limitations. First, since it is a retrospective observational study, subject selection bias was unavoidable. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the referral of patients with minimal upper respiratory symptoms and general good health to the ER. Thus, the COVID-19 cohort included a large subset of relatively healthy subjects, with a mild disease, skewing NLR levels towards a lower baseline. RSV and influenza patients with a correspondingly mild disease severity were probably treated in the community (in which case their data is absent) or alternatively presented to the ER later in the course of their disease, at a worse clinical stage. Notably, such later presentations may have created an additional limitation, the timing of the first complete blood count, which was performed at an earlier stage among COVID-19 patients.Previous research has raised the possible utility of the cycle threshold (CT) value as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients50. While this data was not available in the current study, future investigation comparing, and possibly combining, the NLR with the CT values may prove useful in fine-tuning the prognostic evaluation of COVID-19 patients.In conclusion, we present the first large scale study to compare laboratory markers and outcome between COVID-19, influenza and RSV. We show that COVID-19 patients had a lower NLR at admission. We calculated a NLR cutoff of 6.82 which was able to differentiate between poor and favorable outcome. Finally, when comparing the three viruses, only in COVID-19 NLR had a prognostic value. Thus, during the upcoming winter months, physicians faced with the daunting challenge of treating and triaging patients presenting with acute respiratory infections, may benefit from the correct implementation of this readily accessible tool in their clinical decision-making in COVID-19 patients.

And while getting shots is likely not your child’s favorite activity, they are necessary to keep children safe and healthy. Here’s how parents and caregivers can help prepare kids for getting these important vaccinations. Between their busy immunization schedules, seasonal flu shots and now COVID-19 vaccines, many children will be getting at least one, and possibly several, shots in the near future. Vaccinations don’t have to be scary or intimidating for a child. There are several ways parents and caregivers can help kids feel comfortable and prepared ahead of time. Let’s Talk About Shots Most children receive numerous vaccines to help prevent the spread of deadly diseases such as polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps, and chicken pox. As children get older, they may receive an annual seasonal flu (influenza) vaccine as well. Many children are also vaccinated against HPV. According to John Licata, MD, pediatrician at Atrium Health Levine Children’s Charlotte Pediatric Clinic - Steele Creek, vaccines – including the COVID-19 vaccine – have a long history of safety and efficacy. “I encourage parents to review the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine specifically,” he says. Dr. Licata stresses that “the FDA would not approve a vaccine if the benefits did not outweigh the risks, and there’s a lot of data and research that goes into FDA approval of vaccines for children.” Benefits of vaccines “Both the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine will reduce the severity of the illness if a child does contract the virus,” says Dr. Licata. “Neither vaccine can guarantee that a person won’t get infected, but if a vaccinated child contracts the flu or COVID-19, the resulting illness will be much milder.” Parents who vaccinate their children will be able to rest easier when sending their children to school, allowing them to play sports, interacting in social situations, or being out in public. Vaccine myths, busted Despite the fact that vaccines have been widely and successfully used in the U.S. for decades, some myths still persist when it comes to getting vaccinated. “The myth that the flu vaccine gives someone the flu isn’t true,” says Dr. Licata. “Likewise, the COVID-19 vaccine can’t give a person COVID-19. There can be some mild side effects with vaccines, but they’re not related to the person actually becoming infected with the flu or COVID-19 virus.” As for myths about other vaccines, such as certain vaccines being linked to autism, “The original case series that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has been retracted, and multiple studies since then have proven that claim to be false. In addition, hundreds of thousands of children have been just fine after receiving the routine vaccines on the recommended vaccination schedule without spacing them out or altering the schedule,” says Dr. Licata. What to expect during, and after, getting vaccinated With most vaccines, children – just like adults – can expect some pain at the injection site and some soreness in the area after getting a shot. Most side effects, if they occur, can be easily managed at home with remedies like over-the-counter pain relievers. When it comes to getting a COVID-19 vaccine, “it shouldn’t be any more painful than the other shots most children have received from the time they were babies,” explains Dr. Licata. As for side effects, “there tend to be limited side effects with the first dose, and perhaps some more prominent but short-term side effects from the second dose or booster shot,” he says. Side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine may include soreness, swelling, headache, fever, or chills. These are all normal and should reside within a few days. Lessening the pain – mentally and physically There are a number of things parents and caregivers can do to ensure vaccinations go as smoothly as possible. Don’t: Don’t panic if your child panics. Keep calm, provide a distraction, and offer positive reinforcement. Don’t force a child physically. You can support your child with a hug or holding hands and letting them squeeze your hand. Don’t scold your child if he or she is afraid. Instead, explain the benefits of the vaccine and offer a reward. Do: Explain to children that the benefits of vaccines – including COVID-19 and flu vaccines – far outweigh any risks or side effects. Let kids know that a brief moment of pain is normal (“you may feel a pinch” or “you may feel a little sting”), but it’s minimal and temporary. Normalize vaccines as a part of a well child visit. Prepare the child ahead of time by letting them know they can expect a vaccine, and that it’s to be expected. Keep a calm demeanor during vaccinations. Provide distraction – like having kids count down, blow hard, or do deep breathing – if a child is worried, anxious or fidgeting during the vaccination. Offer a reward, like stickers, toys, books, or even a treat (like that old classic, the lollipop) to provide positive reinforcement after getting vaccinated. Give your child a dose of over-the-counter pain reliever after shots if necessary to relieve any lingering soreness at the injection site. Make sure the child drinks plenty of fluids after receiving a vaccination. Model good behavior by getting your annual flu shot and other necessary vaccines.

Wednesday 3 November 2021 23:01, UK Image: UK health agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low Why you can trust Sky News A bird flu prevention zone has been declared across the UK to stop the spread of the disease among poultry and other birds, chief veterinary officers have said.From 5pm on Wednesday, it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks. People with more than 500 birds inside the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) must restrict access for non-essential people, change clothing and footwear before entering enclosures, and vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected regularly.Even "backyard owners" with a small number of birds, including chicken, ducks and geese, are advised to take action to limit the risk and keep watch for signs of disease, said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).Avian influenza circulates naturally among wild birds and can be spread to poultry and other captive birds when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe in winter. The NHS says in rare cases it can affect humans if people touch infected birds, their droppings or bedding, or while preparing infected poultry for cooking.However, UK health agencies and food standards agencies say the risk to public health from the virus is very low.

Advertisement In a joint statement, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said: "Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, you are now legally required to introduce higher biosecurity standards on your farm or small holding."It is in your interests to do so in order to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease."The UK health agencies have confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and UK food standards agencies advise that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers."Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.The chief veterinary officers said the order does not yet include a requirement for birds to be housed, but it is "being kept under constant review".Defra is urging poultry keepers and members of the public to report dead wild birds to its national dead wild bird helpline on 03459 33 55 77 - but warns people not to touch them.Keepers should also report suspicion of disease on 03000 200 301.

Dr. Hanadi Al Hamad, Qatar's National Health Strategy 2018-2022 Lead for Healthy Ageing and Medical Director of Rumailah Hospital and Qatar Rehabilitation Institute at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) said people over the age of 50 years are at greater risk of serious complications from the flu because human immune defenses become weaker with age - lowering the ability to fight off viruses and bounce back after illness. "As the weather begins to change and the cooler winter months set in, we see an increase in the number of patients with the common cold, influenza, and other viral infections of the respiratory tract. As people age, they are at a higher risk of complications from influenza and for this reason, it is strongly recommended that those over the age of 50 years get the influenza vaccine," Dr. Al Hamad said. Dr. Al Hamad said this year, with COVID-19 still a threat to our health, it's more important than ever that we take every possible step to protect ourselves from the seasonal flu. "It takes about two weeks to build immunity to the influenza virus after being vaccinated, so it's important for those aged over 50 years to get the vaccine as early as possible. A flu vaccine is the best and most effective way to protect yourself, your family and your friends from influenza," added Dr. Al Hamad. To ensure as many people as possible are vaccinated this year, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), HMC, and the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) are again offering the flu vaccine to all members of the public free at 27 Health Centers and more than 45 private clinics. Dr. Al Hamad has also stressed the importance of older people ensuring they are protected this flu season, noting that they may be more susceptible to complications such as pneumonia and the worsening of existing chronic medical conditions like congestive heart failure, asthma, and diabetes. "The benefits of the flu shot for older people are clear and overwhelming. This group in our community are especially vulnerable to serious complications from the flu. It is more important than ever that they be protected against the flu," said Dr. Al Hamad. She said people can get their COVID-19 booster shots at the same time since the flu and COVID-19 are two different viruses. "Clinical studies have shown that it is safe and effective to get both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time," Dr. Al Hamad said. "You can safely receive your booster dose and the annual flu vaccine at the same appointment. "While the flu and COVID-19 are two different viruses, it is important to ensure you are protected against the seasonal flu this year. Getting a flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19; however, the flu vaccination has many other important benefits it is shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death."

Jeff Turl/BayToday. Listen to this article 00:01:32 The North Bay-Parry Sound District Health Unit will be offering free community flu shot clinics throughout the first two weeks of November. "Individuals six months and older are encouraged to get their flu shot," the Health Unit stated in a release Monday. Those who are not able to attend a clinic can visit a local pharmacy, make an appointment with their primary health care provider or call the Health Unit at 1-844-478-1400 to book an appointment. “Last year we saw a historically low number of influenza cases, which was likely related to measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This year, due to increased social interactions and gatherings we expect to see an increase in the flu compared to last year,” explains Elizabeth Mete, Public Health Nurse. “The flu shot is free and is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting the flu.” The clinics will take place at the following locations: Wednesday, Nov. 3, 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Magnetawan Municipal Office Friday, Nov. 5, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Sundridge Strong Joly (SSJ) Arena Sunday, Nov. 7, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Stockey Centre in Parry Sound Monday, Nov. 8, 2 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the Mattawa Golden Age Club Wednesday, Nov.10, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Marcel Noël Hall in Sturgeon Falls Saturday, Nov. 13, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Elks Lodge in North Bay Visit myhealthunit.ca for more information on the flu and the flu vaccine.

There are many potentially fatal infections, such as the new coronavirus infection and the flu, but because humans are protected by the immune system, not all people with the infection die. Regarding such an immune system, the educational YouTube channel Kurzgesagt explains 'Why the immune system can respond to many pathogens'. You Are Immune Against Every Disease-YouTube In order for humans to proliferate, a process of 'fertilizing an egg into an egg, dividing the fertilized egg, and proliferating somatic cells to be born as a newborn baby' is required, and this process takes months. In addition, it takes years for the newborn to reach a proliferative age. Bacteria, on the other hand, can make a copy of themselves and grow in about 30 minutes. Viruses can also produce hundreds of copies within hours and billions of copies within days. For this reason, bacteria and viruses multiply rapidly in the body and repeat mutations. These characteristics make it difficult for the human body to fight bacteria and viruses. The human immune system is capable of combating the vast variety of rapidly mutating pathogens mentioned above. According to Kurzgesagt, the immune system is the second most complex biological system after the brain. There are two types of immune system: innate immunity, which is inherently possessed, and acquired immunity, which is acquired in the process of growth. The innate immune system contains immune cells and proteins such as neutrophils , macrophages , complements, and dendritic cells, and is compatible with a wide range of foreign enemies, but its ability is relatively low. On the other hand, in the acquired immune system, different immune cells respond to each foreign enemy, so it is possible to deal strongly with foreign enemies. The immune response of this acquired immunity is achieved by the immune system remembering foreign enemies that have invaded in the past. Kurzgesagt explains how the immune system remembers foreign enemies as follows: First, foreign enemies such as bacteria and viruses are made up of a combination of proteins. The immune cells then recognize the surrounding protein at the receptor to see if it should attack that protein. At this time, if the protein is memorized by the immune system, it can be judged 'whether or not it should be attacked', but if it is a protein that is not memorized, it cannot be judged normally. Therefore, the immune system needs to remember as many proteins as possible. However, proteins are combined like pieces of a 3D puzzle, and there are billions of combinations of proteins around the world. In addition, as mentioned above, bacteria and viruses mutate rapidly, making it seem impossible to memorize all proteins. To solve this problem, immune cells obtain a lot of protein information by combining a small amount of genetic information in various combinations. Kurzgesagt describes this 'how to combine genes' as 'it's like making billions of recipes with 100 different ingredients.' By this method, immune cells have less genetic information ... It generates a lot of protein information and produces the corresponding immune cells. However, when various types of protein information are generated by combining genetic information in this way, there is a possibility that some proteins in the human body will be generated and recognized as 'foreign enemies'. To prevent such a situation, the human body selects immune cells in an organ called the thymus , which is about the size of a wing. The immune cells produced by the above method pass through the thymus sorting system ... Immune cells that react to proteins needed for survival are broken down in the thymus. According to Kurzgesagt, only 2% of all immune cells survive thymic selection. For this reason, Kurzgesagt describes the thymus as a 'university with rigorous selection.' In this way, the acquired immune system produces immune cells corresponding to many proteins, and only the immune cells that do not affect the human body remain in the immune system, so that the human body can secure resistance to many pathogens. That's why. But if the immune system was really working as described above, millions of people would not have died from the new coronavirus infection. Kurzgesagt said, 'Immune is a very complex system, and pathogens also have mechanisms to deceive immunity. Those mechanisms cannot be explained in this movie.' If you want to know more about immunity, Kurzgesagt We encourage you to read the book 'IMMUNE ' written by CEO Philipp Dettmer. At the time of writing the article, the book 'IMMUNE' introduced in the movie is sold on Amazon.co.jp for 2132 yen including tax for the Kindle version and 4171 yen including tax for the hardcover version.
