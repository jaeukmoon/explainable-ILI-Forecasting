Generation of a universal influenza virus vaccine with the potential to elicit long-lasting, broadly cross-reactive immune responses is a necessity for reducing influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Here we focus on the development of a universal influenza B virus vaccine based on the lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) platform. We evaluate vaccine candidates based on different target antigens that afford protection against challenge with ancestral and recent influenza B viruses from both antigenic lineages. A pentavalent vaccine combining all tested antigens protects mice from morbidity at a very low dose of 50 ng per antigen after a single vaccination. These findings support the further advancement of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs expressing multiple conserved antigens as universal influenza virus vaccine candidates.

The larger proportion of human influenza virus infections attributed to IAVs, the pandemic potential of IAVs, and the long-held misconceptions regarding the severity and impact of infections caused by IBVs have contributed to establishing a historical trend towards research focusing on IAVs. Recently, however, many studies have conclusively demonstrated the significant burden of IBV infections as a global health concern1,2. Further complicating IBV infections is the separation of IBVs into two distinct lineages (B/Yamagata/16/1988-like and B/Victoria/2/1987-like), with delineation based on the sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA), the immunodominant surface glycoprotein of influenza viruses. In addition, the B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineage (Y) recently split into multiple clades and B/Victoria/2/1987-like lineage (V) viruses with amino acid deletions have emerged3, adding to antigenic diversity.Current quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines (QIVs) include representative strains from both IBV lineages. These vaccines are focused on eliciting an antibody response towards the HA. Despite the availability of QIVs that include both IBV lineages, QIVs continue to constitute a minority of the influenza virus vaccines administered globally as countries consider the cost-effectiveness and fiduciary impact of increasing vaccine valency not covered in trivalent vaccines (where only one IBV lineage is included)2,4. In addition, antigenic drift of the HA of circulating viruses can render vaccine-induced antibodies ineffective, significantly undermining vaccine effectiveness. As such, IAV and IBV strains to be included in seasonal vaccines need to be updated annually based on surveillance and predictions. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains can still occur and result in decreased vaccine effectiveness, creating an urgent need for new vaccines and treatment options that can provide broader and more durable protection against the ever-evolving influenza viruses.The development of vaccination regimens that target multiple, conserved epitopes of IBVs has mostly been limited to assessing combinations of HA and neuraminidase (NA)5,6,7. Conserved regions within these IBV antigens can act as targets for the induction of broadly protective humoral responses. The HA has been the object of much attention due to its ability to induce protection via hemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization, and Fc effector functions7. The IBV NA has also raised considerable interest after antibodies to this protein were found to provide protection across all influenza B lineages in mice and broadly reactive influenza virus NA-specific antibodies have been isolated from human donors5,8,9. Two highly conserved IBV proteins, the matrix-2 (M2) ion channel protein and nucleoprotein (NP) of the IBVs have been understudied when compared to IAV antigens. Targeting these antigens in IAV vaccination studies has been relatively successful as these antigens can induce broadly protective immune responses through antibody Fc-mediated mechanisms and cellular responses in the context of M2 vaccinations, and cellular responses following NP vaccination10,11,12.Our previous work with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines demonstrated that simultaneous targeting of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H1N1 HA using a headless HA construct, a membrane-bound A/Michigan/45/2015 NA, A/Michigan/45/2015 NP and A/Michigan/45/2015 M2 with a quadrivalent formulation provided broadly protective immunity in mice13. In a follow-up study we showed that certain antigen modifications yielded more potent and less reactogenic mRNA-LNP influenza virus vaccines14. Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines proved to be safe and very effective in humans, we believe that this platform should be further assessed for its potential to generate a potent, broadly protective influenza virus vaccine for humans15,16. In the studies presented here, we again harnessed the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP technology to effectively deliver a pentavalent influenza B vaccine candidate that targets a combination of antigens (B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineage HA, B/Victoria/2/1987-like lineage HA, NA, NP, and M2) and provides broad protection in mice after administration of a single, low dose.ResultsSelection of IBV vaccine antigens and cell transfection studiesIBVs are classified into two lineages (B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (Y) and B/Victoria/2/1987-like (V)) based on the antigenic properties of the HA glycoprotein. NA, NP, and M2 are fairly conserved in these strains. Therefore, we utilized mRNA-encoded HAs from both lineages (B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) and B/Colorado/06/2017 (V)) and NA, NP, and M2 from the B/Colorado/06/2017 strain. Before the mRNA-LNP vaccines were made, protein production from mRNA vaccine antigens was confirmed in cell transfection studies. HEK293T cells were transfected with B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Phu) HA, B/Colorado/06/17 (B/Col) HA, B/Col NA, and B/Col NP antigens and expression was assessed via flow cytometry or Western blotting. Binding of CR8033 and CR8059 anti-HA antibodies was observed for B/Phu HA- and B/Col HA-transfected HEK293T cells, respectively, via flow cytometry (Fig. 1a, b). We also observed binding of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1G05, an anti-NA active site antibody9, to B/Col NA-transfected cells via flow cytometry (Fig. 1c). Assessment of B/Col NP expression in HEK293T transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1d). B/Col M2 expression was not assessed because no influenza B virus anti-M2 antibody was commercially available.Fig. 1: Characterization of antigen-encoding mRNAs by flow cytometry or Western blot.HEK 293 T cells were transfected with HA-, NA- or luciferase control-encoding mRNAs and protein production from each influenza virus antigen-encoding mRNA was assessed via flow cytometry. Positive binding of the antibodies specific for B/Phu HA (a), B/Col HA (b), and B/Col NA (c) relative to luciferase control. HEK 293 T cells were transfected with B/Col NP- or luciferase-encoding mRNAs and protein production from NP-encoding mRNA was assessed via Western blotting. All experiments were performed once.

Mice were vaccinated intradermally (I.D.) with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs encoding different IBV antigens (monovalent or pentavalent formulation) or an irrelevant formulation encoding firefly luciferase. Antibody titers determined in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) following a prime-only or prime-boost immunizations indicated that the vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibodies, with similar results observed when most of the constructs were administered individually or in combination (Fig. 3). Antibody responses were amplified after two immunizations compared to the administration of a single vaccine dose. When assessing the antibody titers to the NP, we noted that the individual NP mRNA-LNP construct elicited more robust antibody responses in both the prime-only and prime-boost sera compared to the pentavalent formulation (Fig. 3e). Our results also demonstrate minimal differences in ELISA titers between the pentavalent groups, where mice were given 5 or 1 µg of each antigen.Fig. 2: Experimental plan: vaccines, immunizations, serology and challenge studies.Mice received a single I.D. immunization with 5 µg monovalent mRNA-LNP vaccine or 5 µg (1 µg from each component) or 25 µg (5 µg from each component) of the pentavalent mRNA-LNP vaccine. Animals in the negative control group received 5 µg luciferase mRNA-LNP. Four weeks after vaccination, mice were intranasally (I.N.) infected with influenza virus containing 1x or 5x the mLD50. Additionally, mice were bled for serological analysis (ELISA, MNT, NAI, and ADCC reporter assay) at this timepoint (a). For prime-boost vaccination studies mice were vaccinated twice as described with a 4-week interval between vaccinations. Four weeks after the boost, mice were I.N. challenged with 5mLD50 of B/Malaysia/2506/2004 virus. Additionally, mice were bled for serological analysis (ELISA, MNT, NAI, and ADCC reporter assay) at this time point (b).Full size imageFig. 3: Serum reactivity to different IBV antigens.Mice were vaccinated with a prime only or prime-boost vaccination regimen (28 days apart) I.D. with 5 μg of monovalent mRNA-LNPs or with 5 μg/antigen or 1 μg/antigen of the pentavalent mRNA-LNP formulation. Control animals received 5 μg of luciferase mRNA-LNP. Sera were collected on day 28 post prime and post boost and binding of antibodies to influenza antigens was measured by ELISA.

The dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageTo further assess the vaccine-elicited antibodies, a multicycle neutralization assay was performed using B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) (Fig. 4a–c) or B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) (Fig. 4d–f) virus. The lineage-matched HA and pentavalent formulations were found to elicit high neutralizing titers in the prime-only sera (Fig. 4a, d). Sera from B/Col NA-vaccinated mice were only found to neutralize the B/Victoria/2/1987-like virus (Fig. 4a), not the B/Yamagata/16/1988-like virus (Fig. 4d). Sera from the B/Col NP, B/Col M2, and non-lineage matched HA vaccination groups did not show neutralization in the multicycle neutralization assay (Fig. 4a, d). After determining that sera from B/Col NA-vaccinated mice failed to neutralize the B/Yamagata/16/1988-like virus, we were interested in establishing if this translated to inhibition of a B/Yamagata/16/1988-like NA. Here, NA-inhibiting antibodies were enumerated in sera from mice vaccinated once against a B/Victoria/2/1987-like (B/Colorado/06/2017) and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (B/Phuket /3073/2013) virus. Our data indicated that mice vaccinated with B/Col NA had strong inhibition of the B/Colorado/06/2017 NA (Fig. 4b), but not the B/Phuket/3073/2013 NA (Fig. 4e). Our data also showed that mice vaccinated with formulations that contained the lineage-matched HA were able to exhibit NA inhibition (NAI). This could be due to steric hindrance mediated by anti-HA antibodies17 or by anti-carbohydrate antibodies18. To assess the ability of serum antibodies to elicit Fc-mediated effector functions, a murine antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assay was performed using a B/Victoria/2/1987-like (B/Colorado/06/2017) and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (B/Phuket/3073/2013) virus. Sera from mice vaccinated with all formulations, except the B/Col NP and B/Col M2, displayed strong activity in the ADCC reporter assays at the prime-only time point against B/Colorado/06/2017 (Fig. 4c) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Fig. 4f).Fig. 4: Functional characterization of antibodies against B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y).Mice were vaccinated and sera were collected as described in Fig. 2. Functional characterization of antibodies in the prime-only and prime-boost sera of mice vaccinated with mRNA-LNPs was performed in microneutralization (MNT) (n = 5) (p-values left to right <0.0001, 0.0047, <0.0001, 0.0011, <0.0001, 0.0154) (a), NAI (n = 3) (b), or ADCC reporter (n = 5) (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) (c) assay against B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) influenza virus. Functional characterization of antibodies in the prime-only and prime-boost sera of mice vaccinated with mRNA-LNPs was performed in MNT (n = 5) (p-values left to right <0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001) (d), NAI (n = 3) (e), or ADCC reporter (n = 5) (p-values left to right 0.0059, 0.0006, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.0017, 0.0002, <0.0001, 0.0001) (f) assay against B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) influenza virus. In b and e, solid lines show NAI values obtained from prime-only sera, dashed lines show NAI values obtained from prime-boost sera. Sera from 3 to 5 randomly selected animals from each vaccination group was assessed in each assay. For a, c, and f the dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. For a, c, d and f, significance was assessed using a one-way ANOVA and groups were compared to the luciferase control group at the prime-only or prime-boost time point. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. For a, c, d and f, bars represent the group mean and error bars represent SD. Each symbol represents an individual animal. For b and e, data are presented as group mean at each sera dilution and error bars represent SD. Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageWe also assessed functional antibody responses following prime-boost vaccination. Our results indicate increases in neutralization titer for vaccinated mice that were found to neutralize B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) (Fig. 4a) or B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) (Fig. 4d) following a prime-only immunization. Increased NAI titers were also observed for B/Colorado/06/2017 (Fig. 4b) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Fig. 4e) viruses. We also observed NAI from the sera of B/Col HA- and B/Col NA-vaccinated mice against B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) (Fig. 4e), which was not observed at the prime-only time point. Mice from all vaccination groups, except the luciferase control group, were found to have Fc effector reporter activity against B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) at the prime-boost time point when assessed in an ADCC reporter assay (Fig. 4c, f).Overall, the antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified influenza B virus antigen-encoding mRNA-LNP vaccines were antigen-specific and showed functionality in multiple assays.Nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination elicits antigen-specific cellular immune responsesTo investigate the induction of cellular immune responses elicited by vaccination with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs encoding IBV antigens, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated. In line with our previous studies13,19, we found that the B/Phu HA, B/Col HA, NA and NP monovalent vaccines were able to elicit both antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice 10 days after a single I.D. immunization with 5 µg mRNA-LNPs (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Of note, NP-specific IFN-γ+CD8+ T cell responses were particularly robust raising the possibility that these T cells may contribute to vaccine-induced protective immune responses.Fig. 5: Cellular immune responses induced by IBV mRNA-LNP vaccines.Mice were vaccinated I.D. with a single dose of 5 μg of NP, NA, HA or control luciferase mRNA-LNPs. Splenocytes collected from immunized animals 10 days after immunization were stimulated with NP or NA or HA overlapping peptide pools, and cytokine production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was assessed by flow cytometry (a). Percentages of B/Col NP- (p-values left to right 0.0023, <0.0001, 0.028, <0.0001, 0.0004, 0.0478) (b), B/Col NA- (p-values left to right <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.0014, <0.0001, 0.0001, 0.2702) (c), B/Col HA- (p-values left to right 0.1794, 0.0002, 0.0047, 0.0037, 0.0023, 0.1322) (d) and B/Phu HA- (p-values left to right 0.026, <0.0001, 0.0031, 0.0006, 0.0003, 0.5177) (e) specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α are shown. Each symbol represents one animal and error is shown as SEM (n = 8 mice per group for B/Col NP and n = 7 for B/Col NA, B/Col HA, B/Phu HA and luciferase).

IBV strains were selected to represent ancestral (B/Lee/1940), B/Yamagata/16/1988-like (B/Florida/04/2006 and B/New York City/PV00094/2017) and B/Victoria/2/1987-like (B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/New York City/PV01181/2018) IBVs (Fig. 2a). The amino acid similarity for vaccine antigens and challenge strains are detailed in Table 1. Mice were challenged with 5mLD50 of each respective virus and weight loss was monitored for morbidity and mortality over a 14-day time course (Fig. 6). Our results indicate that mice vaccinated with the B/Phu HA, B/Col HA, or B/Col NA monovalent formulations and pentavalent formulations were protected from challenge with minimal morbidity observed. Unsurprisingly, challenge with B/Victoria/2/1987-like viruses resulted in more morbidity in B/Phu HA (a B/Yamagata/16/1988-like HA) vaccinated mice when compared to mice vaccinated with the B/Col HA (a B/Victoria/2/1987-like HA). The reverse was observed upon challenge with B/Yamagata/16/1988-like viruses. Mice vaccinated with the B/Col NP lost a significant amount of body weight, but these mice were mostly protected from challenge against all IBVs tested, except the B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) IBV where almost all B/Col NP-vaccinated mice succumbed to infection (Fig. 6e, j). Mice vaccinated with the B/Col M2 or the luciferase control mRNA-LNP formulations were susceptible to challenge with all IBVs.Table 1 Amino acid similarity (%) between vaccine antigens and challenge strainsFull size tableFig. 6: Morbidity and survival graphs for mRNA-LNP-vaccinated mice following I.N. challenge with ancestral through recent IBV strains.Morbidity of mice vaccinated with a single dose of mRNA-LNPs containing monovalent or pentavalent formulations following I.N. challenge with 5mLD50 of B/Lee/1940 (n = 5) (a) B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) (n = 5) (b), B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V) (n = 5 for all groups except M2 where one mouse was found dead on day 1) (c), B/Florida/04/2006 (Y) (n = 5) (d), or B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) (n = 4) (e) influenza viruses 4 weeks after immunization. Data are shown as the group mean and error bars represent SD.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageFollowing these studies, we compared the performance of our IBV mRNA-LNP vaccines with a conventional vaccine platform (trivalent influenza virus vaccine, TIV, Fluzone, 2006–2007) in a prime-only vaccination regimen (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that the pentavalent mRNA-LNPs, either at the 5 μg or the 1 μg dose, outperformed the TIV. High antibody titers were detected against B/Phu HA (Y), B/Col HA (V), or B/Col NA following administration of the pentavalent formulations, while TIV only induced detectable antibodies against B/Col HA (V) (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d). Four weeks after immunization, animals were I.N. challenged with the B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) strain, one of the components of the TIV vaccine (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). In line with our previous observations (Fig. 6), luciferase controls and M2-immunized mice displayed severe morbidity and succumbed to infection, while mice in all the other groups survived challenge. Notably, TIV-vaccinated mice survived challenge (Supplementary Fig. 2f), but displayed marked weight loss and did not return to their starting weights by the end of the observation period (Supplementary Fig. 2e).We also investigated protection against B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) challenge in prime-boost vaccinated mice to assess for further improvements in the prime-only vaccination regimen (Fig. 2b). Similar to the prime-only challenge studies, we found that mice vaccinated with B/Col HA, B/Col NA, and the pentavalent formulations were protected from challenge, with minimal weight loss observed (Supplementary Fig. 3). We also observed improvements in weight loss in mice vaccinated with the B/Col NP, and B/Col M2 mRNA-LNPs when compared to the prime-only vaccination. No improvements in weight loss in mice vaccinated with the B/Phu HA mRNA-LNP were observed when compared to the prime-only vaccination. All mice vaccinated with the luciferase control mRNA-LNP succumbed to infection.Next, we assessed control of virus titers mediated by these vaccines, as some formulations induced neutralizing antibody responses whereas others did not. We infected vaccinated mice with 1mLD50 of B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V) (Fig. 7a) or B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) (Fig. 7b) viruses and harvested lungs at 3 or 6 days post infection (dpi) and measured viral titers in the lung homogenates. We observed that mice vaccinated with B/Col HA, B/Col NA, and the pentavalent formulations had reduced or no measurable virus titers following challenge with B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V) at 3 dpi, and no virus was detected at 6 dpi (Fig. 7a). In contrast, mice vaccinated with B/Phu HA, B/Col NP, B/Col M2, and luciferase control had measurable virus titers at 3 and 6 dpi. Mice vaccinated with B/Phu HA and the pentavalent formulations had reduced virus titers following challenge with B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) at 3 dpi, and no virus was detected at 6 dpi (Fig. 7b). Mice vaccinated with B/Col HA and B/Col NA had quantifiable virus titers at 3 dpi but no detectable titers at 6 dpi. Mice vaccinated with B/Col NP, B/Col M2, and luciferase control had measurable titers at both 3 and 6 dpi. Our results highlight that 1 µg of the pentavalent formulation resulted in sterilizing protection when compared to the monovalent formulations. These data also suggest that neutralizing antibodies are required for complete control of virus replication.Fig. 7: A single immunization with IBV pentavalent mRNA-LNP vaccine prevents virus replication.Mice were I.D. vaccinated once with 5 μg of monovalent mRNA-LNPs or with 5 μg/antigen or 1 μg/antigen of the pentavalent mRNA-LNP formulation.

Mice were vaccinated with 10-fold decreasing doses of the influenza B virus pentavalent formulation or the luciferase control. Twenty-eight days after vaccine administration, mice were bled, and sera were analyzed by ELISA against cells infected with B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) (Fig. 8a). Measurable antibody responses were detected for mice vaccinated with 5 µg, 0.5 µg, or 0.05 µg of each antigen in the pentavalent formulation. Limited to no antibody responses were detected in mice vaccinated with 0.005 µg or 0.0005 µg of the pentavalent formulation. Mice were then challenged with 5mLD50 of B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) virus and weight loss and survival were monitored for 14 days post challenge (Fig. 8b, c). All vaccinated mice were protected from infection at the 5, 0.5, and 0.05 µg doses, with limited morbidity and no mortality observed. All mice vaccinated with 0.005 or 0.0005 µg of the pentavalent vaccine or the luciferase control vaccine succumbed to infection. In summary, vaccination with a single low dose of 0.05 µg/antigen of the pentavalent mRNA-LNP formulation can protect animals from morbidity and mortality against lethal viral challenge.Fig. 8: A single immunization with the pentavalent IBV mRNA-LNP vaccine protects mice in the nanogram dose range.Mice were I.D. vaccinated once with 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, or 0.0005 µg of each antigen in the pentavalent mRNA-LNP formulation. Four weeks later sera were collected and antibody responses towards B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) influenza virus-infected cells were assessed (p-values from left to right <0.0001, <0.0001) (a). Each symbol represents one animal, and the bar represents the mean. Mice were then I.N. infected with 5mLD50 of B/Malaysia/2506/04 (V) influenza virus and morbidity (b) and survival (c) were monitored for 14 dpi. Data are shown as individual data points and the group average presented as the group mean (n = 5 per group). Significance was assessed using a one-way ANOVA and groups were compared to the luciferase control group at each time point. The dotted line in b indicates the maximum body weight loss (25%) for the experiment. Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageAntibodies that target the influenza virus surface glycoproteins reduce morbidity upon serum passive transfer challenge studiesTo determine if antibodies induced by mRNA-LNP vaccination could reduce morbidity following IBV infection, a passive transfer experiment was conducted. Mice were vaccinated twice with 5 µg of mRNA-LNP vaccines (monovalent and pentavalent formulations) with 28-day intervals between administrations to generate strong immune responses. Four weeks after the boost, a terminal bleed was performed to collect sera. Sera from the terminal bleeds were tested against B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) virus-infected cells by ELISA and showed that sera from mice vaccinated with monovalent and pentavalent formulations were highly reactive in this assay (Fig. 9a). This serum was then pooled within groups and transferred into naive mice through intraperitoneal administration. Two hours after transfer, sera from recipient mice were harvested and subsequently tested against B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) virus-infected cells by cell-based ELISA (Fig. 9b). The post-transfer sera reacted similarly to the pre-transfer sera, although an expected reduced reactivity was observed. Animals were then challenged with 5mLD50 of B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V) virus and weight loss was monitored for 14 days post challenge. Animals that received serum from mice vaccinated with the pentavalent formulations, the B/Col HA, or the B/Col NA were protected from challenge with no weight loss (Fig. 9c). Animals that received serum from mice vaccinated with the B/Phu HA were also protected from challenge, although a maximum loss of 8.5% of the original body weight was observed. Mice that received sera from B/Col NP-, B/Col M2-, or luciferase control-immunized donors showed severe morbidity (Fig. 9c), with this data suggesting that only antibodies that target the surface glycoproteins prevent morbidity in a passive transfer experiment.Fig. 9: Humoral protection from IBV challenge is afforded by antibodies that target glycoproteins.Mice were vaccinated twice (with a 4-week interval) I.D. with 5 µg of mRNA-LNPs. Sera were collected from vaccinated animals 4 weeks after the boost and then assessed for antibody reactivity towards B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) influenza virus-infected cells (n = 10 mice/group) (a). Sera from vaccinated mice were transferred into naïve mice. Two hours after the transfer, sera from naïve recipients of passive sera were assessed for antibody reactivity towards B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) influenza virus-infected cells (n = 5 mice/group) (b). For a and b bars represent the mean of each group and each point represents an individual animal. Error bars are representative of SD. One mouse was excluded from the NP group due to failed serum transfer. Naïve mice were then I.N. challenged with 5mLD50 of B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V) influenza virus and weight loss was monitored for 14 days. Data are shown as mean and error bars represent SD (n = 5 per group) (c). The dotted line in c indicates the maximum body weight loss (25%) for the experiment. Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageDiscussionNucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines have emerged as a powerful vaccine platform for the control of infectious diseases20. Our previous works investigating the use of the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccine platform for the development of a broadly protective influenza virus vaccine were successful. In those studies we used mRNA-encoded influenza virus immunogens (A/Brisbane/59/2007 H1 headless HA construct, a membrane-bound A/Michigan/45/2015 N1 NA, A/Michigan/45/2015 NP and A/Michigan/45/2015 M2) to provide broad protection against group 1 challenge viruses (based on the HA)13. In a subsequent study we demonstrated that introduction of modifications into the mRNA-encoded influenza virus antigens could improve the safety and immunogenicity of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines14. In this current work, we aimed to develop a broadly protective IBV vaccine that targeted multiple antigens. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of singular mRNA-LNP constructs encoding HA of the B/Victoria/2/1987-like or B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineage, NA, NP, or M2 from the B/Victoria/2/1987-like lineage to a pentavalent mRNA-LNP formulation, which encoded all 5 IBV antigens in mice. Our study proves that the pentavalent mRNA-LNP vaccine induces broadly protective immune responses and outperforms the monovalent constructs providing the basis for further investigation of this vaccination regimen. Of note, here we used naïve mice to evaluate our vaccine formulations. As prior exposure to influenza virus alters vaccine-induced immune responses in humans21, future studies should investigate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the pentavalent mRNA-LNP vaccine in influenza-exposed animal models to mimic pre-existing immunity present in humans.In this work we vaccinated mice with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs containing 5 µg of B/Phu HA or 5 µg of B/Col HA, NA, NP, or M2. We found that most of these monovalent mRNA-LNP vaccine formulations protected mice from challenge with all or most IBVs after administration of a single vaccine dose. Moreover, we demonstrated that a pentavalent IBV mRNA-LNP formulation outperformed all individual components. Minimal to no weight loss was observed in mice vaccinated with 5 µg or 1 µg of each antigen in the pentavalent formulations upon challenge with each IBV when compared to the monovalent formulations. Impressively, no virus was detected in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the pentavalent formulation following challenge with the mismatched IBV lineage when compared to the monovalent components. The pentavalent formulation was also able to protect mice from challenge with B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) when mice were vaccinated with only 50 ng of each antigen. Fifty µg of HA mRNA-LNPs was recently described by Moderna to induce neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated humans and the dose we used in our study may be comparable to this study22. The only difference we found between the pentavalent and monovalent formulations was a reduction in the amount of anti-NP antibodies in the pentavalent formulations when compared to the monovalent formulations, a reduction that did not impact any of the functional assays performed in this study. When we assessed the antibody responses in mice vaccinated with the pentavalent formulations, we found modest improvements in functional antibody responses in the assays that we tested (MNT, NAI, or ADCC reporter assay), suggesting that vaccine-induced antibody functionality is not affected by the number of antigens in the pentavalent mRNA-LNPs. The modest improvement we observed in the pentavalent formulations may be attributed to the combined multiantigen-targeted immune response as described below for each antigen.Numerous studies have indicated that broadly protective responses against IAVs have been successful by utilizing vaccination regimens that target the conserved HA stalk domain23,24,25,26. Headless HA constructs for group 1 and group 2 IAVs have allowed the direct targeting of the immuno-subdominant HA stalk27,28,29; however, headless HA constructs have not been developed or described for IBV HAs (although mosaic HA constructs, which redirect the immune response towards the immuno-subdominant conserved epitopes of the HA via sequential immunization are being developed7,30,31). Therefore, in our studies, we used full-length HA constructs from either a B/Yamagata/16/1988-like or B/Victoria/2/1987-like virus, like in current QIVs. We showed that vaccination with a HA of either lineage resulted in protection against challenge with either a B/Yamagata/16/88-like or B/Victoria/2/87-like virus, although increased morbidity was observed when mice were vaccinated with non-lineage matched HAs. Interestingly, we showed that non-lineage matched anti-HA antibodies were non-neutralizing and did not aid in the control of virus titers (although virus titers were somewhat reduced). The protection afforded by non-lineage matched antibodies is mostly mediated through effector functions. Cross-lineage protection has previously been observed in non-lineage matched anti-HA mAbs that bound the HA stalk of IBVs and induced Fc-effector functions32. Indeed, both IBV HA mRNA-LNPs induced cross-protection, suggesting that vaccine-induced HA stalk-specific antibodies contributed to the protective immune responses. Of note, cross-protection could potentially be achieved by utilizing a single mosaic IBV HA construct, where the antigenic sites in the immune-dominant HA head are replaced by exotic IAV sequences7.Unlike IBV HAs, IBV NAs have not separated into distinct lineages, although recent antigenic analysis has shown that the NA of B/Yamagata/16/88-like viruses is under greater antigenic selection3. In line with previous studies5, our work shows that vaccination with a B/Victoria/2/87-like NA from B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) leads to protection against challenge with both B/Yamagata/16/88-like and B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses. Similarly to the HA monovalent mRNA-LNP formulations, we found that neutralizing antibodies, NA-inhibiting antibodies, and reduced virus titers were only observed in NA-vaccinated mice in the context of B/Victoria/2/1987-like viruses. The use of a B/Yamagata/16/1988-like virus resulted in no measurable NAI activity and detectable virus titers in the lung upon challenge in mice vaccinated only once (although the virus titers were reduced). Despite this finding, Fc effector functions were detected against both viruses in the ADCC reporter assay. The lack of antibodies with cross-lineage NAI activity is interesting, as previous vaccination studies have identified such antibodies5. In this study we only assessed one mismatched virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y)), and these observations may not be true for all B/Yamagata/16/1988-like viruses. Of note, these experiments utilized a prime-boost vaccination regimen. Whilst we mostly performed prime-only experiments, the use of a prime-boost vaccination regimen resulted in only minimal amount of NA-inhibiting antibodies, and perhaps antigenic differentiation of recent IBV NAs is leading to reduced targeting of the NA active site3.The use of NP and M2 IBV proteins as vaccine antigens is limited and most previous work has focused on assessing NP and M2 IAV proteins11,12,13,33,34,35,36. These studies showed that NP vaccination led to protection via cellular immunity and conserved epitopes in M2 could induce heterosubtypic immunity. One study showed that intranasal vaccination with an adenovirus vector expressing an IBV NP resulted in robust cellular immunity and cross-lineage protection37. Our work indicates that vaccination with an IBV NP leads to robust antibody responses and NP-vaccinated mice are mostly protected from influenza virus challenge, although weight loss was observed in animals after infection with each challenge virus. As expected, vaccination with the NP antigen did not result in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, although we observed low functioning antibody responses in the ADCC reporter assay in sera taken after 2 immunizations. The transient expression of NP on the surface of influenza virus-infected cells has been observed previously and this transient expression may be sufficient for the generation of effector antibodies38. It is also possible that the NP protein made from the mRNA inside the cells is released upon cell death and is then able to induce an antibody response. NP-specific antibodies isolated from influenza-infected patients have been recently associated with Fc effector functions39. However, passive transfer of these antibodies into a murine influenza challenge model resulted in no protection, complementing our passive transfer studies. Overall, these data suggest that the protection afforded by targeting the NP is not provided by antibodies. NP contains many epitopes targeted by T cells, and targeting these epitopes can be highly protective in the mouse model40,41 and both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses correlate with reduced infection in humans42,43. Here, we found that the B/Col NP mRNA-LNP vaccine induced both antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses after administration of a single dose. Particularly, IFN-γ+CD8+ T cell responses were robust and it is highly likely that the protection observed in NP mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals was afforded by T cell-mediated immunity, although this was not directly investigated in our experiments.The IBV M2 provided no protection in the prime-only-vaccinated mice and measurable antibody responses were only observed in sera from prime-boost-vaccinated mice. However, some protection was observed in animals that received two vaccine doses. The IBV M2 is lined with polar residues that are believed to reduce the hydrophobic interactions of adamantanes44,45, an antiviral drug against IAVs. These polar residues may prevent antibody binding and may be the reason we observe a blunted response in IBV M2-vaccinated mice.Taken together, our work supports the development of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines for the control of influenza virus, and importantly those that target IBVs. As IBVs lack an animal reservoir, vaccines that target IBV infections could, with sufficient vaccine uptake, limit virus spread of IBVs in the human population and could ultimately lead to the eradication of IBVs. These data encourage further exploration of multivalent mRNA-based influenza virus vaccines that induce broadly protective immune responses through targeting multiple antigens.MethodsEthics statementThe investigators faithfully adhered to the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” by the Committee on Care of Laboratory Animal Resources Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. Mouse studies were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). All animals were housed and cared for according to local, state, and federal policies in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-accredited facility.Viruses & cellsSf9 cells (CRL-1711, ATCC) for baculovirus rescue were grown in Trichoplusia ni medium-formulation Hink insect cell medium (TNM-FH, Gemini Bioproducts) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 μg/mL) solution (Gibco). BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High Five) (B85502; ThermoFisher) cells for protein expression were grown in serum-free SFX medium (HyClone) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 μg/mL) solution. Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) (CCL-34, ATCC) and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 T (CRL-3216, ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin (100 U/mL)-streptomycin (100 μg/mL) solution. Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) were grown in Expi293TM Expression Medium (Gibco) in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks (Corning) at 37 °C and 125 RPM in a humidified incubator with 8% CO2.The IBV strains B/Colorado/06/2017 (V), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y), B/Lee/1940, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V), B/Florida/04/2006 (Y), B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V), and B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) were grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River) for 72 h at 33 °C. Eggs were then cooled overnight (O/N) at 4 °C before allantoic fluid was harvested. Harvested allantoic fluid was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet debris. Virus stocks were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C prior to determining stock titers via plaque assay.Protein productionRecombinant HAs and NAs from B/Colorado/06/2017 and B/Phuket/3073/2013 were expressed in High Five insect cells as previously described46. Recombinant NP from B/Colorado/06/2017 was expressed in HEK293F cells as previously described13,47. Proteins were purified from the cell culture supernatant via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography46,47,48.mRNA-LNP productionmRNA-LNP vaccines were produced as previously described13,14. Briefly, codon-optimized firefly luciferase, B/Phuket/3073/2013 HA (B/Phu HA), B/Colorado/06/2017 HA (B/Col HA), B/Colorado/06/2017 NA (B/Col NA), B/Colorado/06/2017 NP (B/Col NP), and B/Colorado/06/2017 M2 (B/Col M2) were synthesized (Genscript). Constructs were ligated into mRNA production vectors, vectors were linearized, and a T7-driven in vitro transcription reaction (Megascript, Ambion) was performed to generate mRNA with 101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tails. Capping of mRNA was performed in concert with transcription through addition of a trinucleotide cap1 analog, CleanCap (TriLink), and m1Ψ-5’-triphosphate (TriLink) was incorporated into the reaction instead of UTP. Cellulose-based purification of mRNA was performed as described49. mRNAs were then assessed on an agarose gel before storing at −20 °C.Purified mRNAs were encapsulated into lipid nanoparticle using a self-assembly process where an ethanolic lipid mixture of an ionizable cationic lipid, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol-lipid was rapidly combined with an aqueous solution containing mRNA at acidic pH as previously described50. The ionizable cationic lipid (pKa in the range of 6.0-6.5, proprietary to Acuitas Therapeutics) and LNP composition are described in the patent application WO 2017/004143. The average hydrodynamic diameter was ~80 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.02-0.06 as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) and an encapsulation efficiency of ~95% as determined using a Ribogreen assay.Cell transfectionsTransfection of HEK 293 T cells was performed with TransIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions: mRNA (0.3 µg) was combined with TransIT-mRNA Reagent (0.34 µL) and Boost Reagent (0.22 µL) in 17 µL of serum-free medium, and the complex was added to 6 × 104 cells in 183 µL complete medium.Western blot analysisCell lysates of luciferase or B/Col NP mRNA-transfected and non-transfected HEK 293 T cells were used. Cells were lysed for 1 h on ice in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer (Sigma) 24 h after transfection. Samples were combined with 355 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad) containing 4X Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and were boiled for 5 min and spun at 18000 g for 5 min at room temperature (RT). The samples were separated on a 4–15% precast polyacrylamide Criterion TGX gel (Bio-Rad) for 45 min at 200 V. Transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (ThermoFisher) was performed using a semi-dry apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 10 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk powder-TBST (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 + 0.1% Tween-20) for 1.5 h, and then, the membrane was incubated with the anti-NP (mouse monoclonal, 1:10.000, ThermoFisher, #MA5-35900) and anti-GAPDH (rabbit monoclonal, 1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology, #14C10) primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with 1X TBST for 30 min and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit (goat polyclonal, 1:10.000, ThermoFisher, #65-6120) or anti-mouse (donkey polyclonal, 1:10.000, Jackson Immuno, #715-035-150) secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. After washing three times for 20 min with 1X TBST at RT, the signal was developed with the HRP Substrate solution (GE Healthcare, Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents) and imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS + machine (BioRad).Staining and flow cytometric analyses of mRNA-transfected cells and mouse splenocytesLuciferase, B/Phu HA, B/Col HA, or B/Col NA mRNA-transfected HEK 293 T cells were collected 24 h after transfection and were washed once with 1% FBS (HyClone) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Corning, DPBS 1X (without calcium and magnesium)). Next, cells were incubated with 7.5 μg/ml anti-NA (1G059) or 7.5 μg/ml anti-HA (CR8033 for B/Phu HA and CR8059 for B/Col HA) antibodies in V-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing with 1% FBS in PBS cells were incubated with anti-human AlexaFluor-647 (goat polyclonal, 1:300, ThermoFisher, #A21445) secondary antibody at 4 °C for 30 min in dark. The samples were washed and re-suspended in FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS). Flow cytometric data were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. At least 50,000 events for each sample were recorded and data were analyzed with the FlowJo 10 software.Spleen single-cell suspensions were made in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (ATCC). 3 × 106 cells per sample were stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, in the presence of overlapping NP (BEI Resources, NR-19254), NA (BEI Resources, NR-19254) or HA (BEI Resources, NR-18972) peptide pools at 2.5 µg/mL per peptide. GolgiPlug (5 mg/mL; brefeldin A; BD Biosciences) and GolgiStop (10 mg/mL; monensin; BD Biosciences) were added to each sample after 1 h of stimulation. Unstimulated samples for each animal were included. A phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (10 mg/mL; Sigma) and ionomycin (200 ng/mL; Sigma)-stimulated sample was included as a positive control. After stimulation, cells were washed with PBS and stained for 10 min in dark at 25 °C with the LIVE/DEAD fixable aqua dead cell stain kit (Life Technologies). Samples were incubated in the Fc blocker (Purified Rat Anti-Mouse CD16/CD32) for 10 min in dark at 4 °C and then surface-stained with the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD4 PerCP/Cy5.5 (BioLegend) and anti-CD8 Pacific Blue (BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C. After surface staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Cells were intracellularly stained with anti-CD3 APC-Cy7 (BD Biosciences), anti-TNF-α PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences) anti-IFN-γ AF700 (BD Biosciences), and anti-IL-2 BV711 (BioLegend) mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, the cells were washed twice with the permeabilization buffer (BD Biosciences), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Splenocytes were analyzed on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 200,000-500,000 events were collected per specimen. Data were analyzed with the FlowJo 10 program. Data were expressed by subtracting the percentages of the unstimulated stained cells from the percentages of the peptide pool-stimulated stained samples.Vaccination and virus challengeFemale BALB/c mice (aged 6–8 weeks, The Jackson Laboratory for the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Charles River Laboratories for the University of Pennsylvania) were anesthetized and shaved to expose the skin of the back. mRNA-LNP vaccines diluted to 5 µg per 100 µL (or 25 µg per 100 µL for the 5 µg pentavalent formulation) in PBS were injected intradermally (I.D.) into two sites distant from one another on the back to a total volume of 100 µL using a 31 G Ultra-Fine insulin syringe (BD). Mice vaccinated with TIV received 1 µg of the B/Malaysia/2506/2004 HA in 50 µL of PBS intramuscularly (I.M.) using a 28 G insulin syringe (BD). Four weeks after vaccination, mice were anesthetized and intranasally infected with 50 µL of influenza virus containing 1x or 5x the 50% mouse lethal dose (mLD50). Additionally, mice were bled for serological analysis at this time point. Weight loss was monitored for 14 days after challenge, and mice that lost >25% of their initial body weight were humanely euthanized. For prime-boost studies mice were vaccinated twice as described above with an intervening interval of 4 weeks. Four weeks after the boost, mice were intranasally challenged with 5mLD50 of B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V).For the duration of the experiment, mice were housed in individually ventilated cages on a 12 h dark/light cycle. The room was kept at 20 °C, 50% relative humidity. Food and water were provided ad libitum.Serum collectionBlood was collected via submandibular bleeding using 25-27 gauge needles (BD Biosciences) and 1.5 mL microtubes (Eppendorf) without anticoagulants. Blood was incubated at RT for 1 h and centrifuged at 2500 × g. Serum was separated from pellet and stored at 4 °C until used.Passive transfer of seraFemale BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks underwent a prime-boost regimen with 5 µg of mRNA vaccine per mouse with 4-week intervals between both vaccinations and subsequent whole blood harvest. Mice were anesthetized and then a cardiac puncture was performed to gather whole blood. The blood was allowed to coagulate at RT for 1 h before being placed at 4 °C for 30 min. Blood was then spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and sera were separated from remaining blood components and stored at 4 °C until further use. Naïve mice were intraperitoneally injected with 200 µL of sera 2 h prior to influenza virus challenge with 5mLD50 of B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V). Mice were bled post-transfer, and sera were tested against the appropriate antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to ensure successful transfer.ELISAImmulon plates (Immulon 4HBX; Thermo Scientific) were coated with 2 μg/mL recombinant protein (50 μL per well) in PBS at 4 °C O/N. The following day, the plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked-in blocking solution (3% goat serum, 0.5% milk in PBS-T) for 1 h at RT. After blocking, pre-diluted serum was added to the first well to a final concentration of 1:100 in blocking solution. Serum was then serially diluted 1:3 in blocking solution and incubated at RT for 2 h. Plates were then washed three times with PBS-T before adding goat anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (Rockland) in blocking solution. The plates were incubated for 1 h at RT before being washed 4x with PBS-T with shaking. To develop the plates, 100 μL of O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate (SigmaFast OPD; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 3 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to each well. The optical density at 490 nm (OD490) was measured on a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek). A cut-off value of the average of the OD values of blank wells plus 3 standard deviations (SD) was established for each plate and used for calculating the area under the curve (AUC), which was the readout for this assay. The limit of detection of the assay was a titer of 1:100. Samples that did not reach this titer were assigned a value of 1:50.For cell-based ELISAs, 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) were seeded with 100 µL/well of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL and incubated O/N at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and infected with 100 µL of B/Colorado/06/2017 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 20 h at 33 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. The subsequent day, plates were washed, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS and incubated for 15 min at RT; the cells were then washed twice with PBS and the remainder of the cell-based ELISA was performed as described above.For M2 ELISAs, 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) were seeded with 100 µL/well of HEK293T cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/mL and incubated O/N at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following day, cells were washed with PBS and transfected (TransIT-LT1, MirusBio) with 0.1 µg of plasmid DNA encoding B/Colorado/06/2017 M2 as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Fisher Scientific) and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. The subsequent day, plates were washed, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS and incubated for 15 min at RT; the cells were then washed twice with PBS and the remainder of the cell-based ELISA was performed as described above.Microneutralization (MNT) assayMDCK cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL with a total volume of 100 µL in each well and incubated O/N at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The following day, receptor destroying enzyme (RDE)-treated sera was serially diluted 2-fold across the plate in infection media (1x minimum essential media (MEM) (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 3.2% NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MP Biomedicals) supplemented with 1 µg/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) -treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Next, 60 µL of 100 × 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of virus in infection medium and 60 µL of serially diluted sera were incubated on a shaker for 1 h at RT. Before the end of the incubation time, MDCK cells were washed once with 200 µL PBS and then 100 µL of the incubated sera-virus mixture was added to the plates for 1 h at 33 °C with 5% CO2. Afterwards, the virus inoculum was aspirated and MDCK cells were again washed with 200 µL PBS and incubated with 100 µL of the serially diluted sera for 72 h at 33 °C and 5% CO2. Following the 3-day incubation, hemagglutination was assessed. In brief, 50 µL of cell supernatant was first added to V-bottom 96-well plates (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 50 µL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories) diluted in PBS. The plates were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. Data are displayed as the endpoint titer and this value represents the lowest dilution at which no hemagglutination could be detected.Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assayADCC reporter activity within the sera was tested by performing in vitro ADCC bioreporter assays as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). Briefly, 2 × 105 MDCK cells/mL were cultured O/N at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in white, flat-bottom, 96-well cell culture plates (Corning). The following day the cells were washed with 200 µL PBS and infected with B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) or B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) at an MOI of 5. The plates were then incubated O/N at 33 °C with 5% CO2. The next day sera were serially diluted 2-fold in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) and ADCC Bioassay effector cells were diluted to 3 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 media. Media was then aspirated from the cell plates and the cells were washed once with 100 µL/well PBS; 25 µL/well of assay buffer, 25 µL/well of serially diluted sera and 25 µL/well of ADCC effector cells (Promega) were then added. ADCC effector cells are genetically engineered to express mouse FcỿRIV receptor, the predominant receptor involved in ADCC in mice, and a luciferase reporter. Plates were incubated for 6 h at 33 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, followed by temperature equilibration for 15 min at RT and subsequent addition of 75 µL/well Bio-GloTM Luciferase assay reagent for 10 min in the dark at RT. After incubation, luminescence was assessed as a measure of luciferase expression using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). A cut-off value of the average of the OD values of blank wells plus 5 SDs was established for each plate and used for calculating the AUC, which was the readout for this assay. The limit of detection of the assay was a titer of 1:10. Samples that did not reach this titer were assigned a value of 1:5 for graphing purposes.NA and NI assayTo determine NA activity, samples were tested on flat-bottom Immulon 4BX 96-well plates coated O/N at 4 °C with 100 μL of fetuin (Sigma) at 25 μg/mL in PBS. Fetuin-coated plates were then washed 3x with PBS-T. On a separate plate, viruses were serially diluted 2-fold in sample diluent (PBS (Gibco) with 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (MP Biomedicals) and 0.5% Tween 20 (Fisher Scientific)); 100 μL of pre-diluted virus samples were added to the washed fetuin-coated plates. The fetuin-coated plates were then incubated for 18 h at 33 °C. Plates were then washed 3x with PBS-T and 100 μL/well of HRP-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) in PBS were added to the plates. The plates were incubated for 2 h at RT before being washed 4x with PBS-T with shaking. To develop the plates, 100 μL of OPD substrate was added to each well. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 3 M HCl to each well. The OD490 was measured on a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek). The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was determined using GraphPad Prism.To measure NI, heat-treated sera (56 °C for 1 h) were diluted serially by 2-fold in sample diluent with a starting dilution of 1:100 and incubated for 18 h at 33 °C with an equal volume (50 µL) of the respective virus dilution in the fetuin-coated plates. The remainder of the assay was performed as described above. One column on the plate contained sample diluent without antibody and served as a positive (virus-only) control. Another column contained sample diluent only (no virus) and served as a negative (background) control. Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.Plaque assaysVirus titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cell monolayers in 12-well plates (Corning). Allantoic fluid and lung homogenates were serially diluted by 10-fold in PBS and incubated on MDCK cells for 1 h before the addition of an agarose overlay containing a final concentration of 0.64% agarose (Oxoid), 1 x minimum essential medium (MEM) (10% 10xMEM (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1% of sodium bicarbonate (wt/vol; Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin–100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.2% BSA, 1 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, and 0.1% (wt/vol) DEAE (diethylaminoethyl)-dextran was added to the cells. The cells were then incubated for 72 h at 33 °C, and visible plaques were counted after fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS and visualization with a crystal violet counterstain (Sigma-Aldrich). All virus titers are presented as the log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL. The limit of detection for these assays was 50 PFU/mL. The AUC values for virus titers over the time course of infection were calculated using the log10 PFU/mL, and the AUC value was calculated using GraphPad Prism 8 software.Determination of amino acid similarityThe HA, NA, NP and M2 sequences from B/Colorado/06/2017 (V) (EPI_ISL_277231), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y) (EPI_ISL_517766), B/Lee/1940 (NIGSP_BUCB_00001), B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (V) (EPI_ISL_29398), B/Florida/04/2006 (Y) (EPI_ISL_142731), B/New York City/PV01181/2018 (V), and B/New York City/PV00094/2017 (Y) (OFL_ISL_214386) were assessed using the Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool51.Statistics and reproducibilityFor line graphs data are expressed as means. For bar graphs data are expressed as individual values and the average presented as the mean. Error are represented by SD or standard error of the mean (SEM). Significance between antibody responses were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison test. A two-tailed unpaired t-test was applied to determine statistical significance in T cell assays. Groups were compared to the luciferase control group. Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.Experiments were conducted with sufficient power (n = 5 mice/group) to ensure distinct differences between the groups to be detected.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

An egg culture-based quadrivalent inactivated nonadjuvanted subunit influenza vaccine was found to be safe and noninferior to the split-virion influenza vaccine, according to results of a randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled phase 3 trial, published in Vaccine. Participants (N=3000) included in this study were enrolled between April 2020 and August 2021 at 2 sites in China. Researchers evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an influenza subunit vs split-virion vaccine. Both vaccines were formulated using antigens from influenza vaccine strains recommended by the World Health Organization for the 2019 to 2020 influenza season, and both were egg culture-based quadrivalent inactivated nonadjuvanted vaccines. Participants were stratified into 4 groups by age, and those in each group were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to receive either the subunit (n=1499) or split-virion (n=1498) influenza vaccine. Participants aged between 3 and 8 years received a 2-dose vaccine series, and the remaining participants received a single vaccine dose. Among the 4 groups, participants in group 1 (n=799) were aged 3 to 8 years, those in group 2 (n=700) were 9 to 17 years, those in group 3 (n=700) were 18 to 64 years, and those in group 4 (n=800) were 65 years and older. Baseline characteristics among participants in each group were similar between those assigned to the subunit vaccine and those assigned to the split-virion vaccine. No significant differences between the subunit and split-virion vaccines were noted in regard to safety profiles. Among all participants, adverse events (AEs) occurred among 227 (15.13%) and 216 (14.40%) of those who received the subunit and split-virion vaccines, respectively (P >.999). For all participants, the most common local AE was injection site pain, and the most common systemic AE was fever. Among participants in group 1, the rate of fever following receipt of the second vaccine dose was significantly decreased among those who received the subunit vaccine vs those who received the split-virion vaccine (0.51% vs 2.53%; P =.021). Preexisting immune responses, defined as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers of 10 or more were observed at baseline among 80.73%, 91.93%, 36.57%, and 90.40% of all participants for the H1N1, H3N2, BV, and BY influenza virus strains, respectively. No significant differences in preexisting immunity responses were observed on the basis of age among participants in groups 1, 3, and 4. However, the number of participants with resistance to H1N1 at baseline vs postvaccination was increased among those in group 2 (62.45% vs 52.93%; P =.012). Further analysis between the subunit vs split-virion vaccines showed that the subunit vaccine elicited stronger immune responses to the H1N1 (geometric mean titers [GMTs], 400.39 vs 333.46; P <.001), H3N2 (GMTs, 436.71 vs 384.13; P =.041), BV (GMTs, 77.80 vs 67.90; P =.001), and BY (GMTs, 267.60 vs 180.63; P <.001) strains. In addition, geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) values were increased among participants who received the subunit vaccine for all 4 influenza strains. With the exception of the H3N2 strain, seroconversion rates (SCRs) among participants who received the subunit vaccine were significantly increased vs those who received the split-virion vaccine for the H1N1 (SCR, 82.71% vs 78.65%; P =.005), BV (SCR, 84.96% vs 81.08%; P =.005), and BY (SCR, 88.36% vs 81.96%; P <.001) strains. This study was limited as the researchers did not assess participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza, nor did they assess cell-mediated immune responses following vaccination, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. In addition, some participants had preexisting antibody responses. In addition to demonstrating immunologic noninferiority to the split-virion vaccine, the subunit influenza vaccine was found to be “safe and well-tolerated” among individuals 3 years and older, the researchers concluded.

The aim of this study was to detect any clinically significant change in the frequency or severity of expected reactogenicity of the quadrivalent inactivated split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4) during routine immunisation in Finland for the 2020/21 season. The primary objective was to investigate the frequency of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurring within 7 days following vaccination.MethodsEnhanced passive safety surveillance of individuals vaccinated with IIV4 was conducted from October 9, 2020 to November 30, 2020 across seven sites in Finland. The vaccinee reporting rate and ADR reporting rate were calculated and compared with known or expected safety data in order to identify any clinically significant changes.ResultsData were collected from 1008 individuals with 29 vaccinees reporting 82 suspected ADRs. Of these, 28 people reported 79 suspected ADRs within 7 days following vaccination, corresponding to a vaccinee reporting rate of 2.78% (95% CI: 1.85, 3.99) (ADR reporting rate, 7.84% [95% CI: 6.25, 9.67%]). The most frequently reported ADRs were injection site reactions (vaccination site pain, vaccination site erythema and vaccination site swelling) (n = 46, 2.28%), myalgia (n = 9, 0.89%) and headache (n = 8, 0.79%). No serious suspected adverse events were reported at any point post-vaccination and ADR reporting rates were in general lower compared to those reported for IIV4 in the 2019/20 surveillance study.ConclusionNo clinically significant changes in what is known or expected for IIV4 were reported for the 2020/21 season which supports the safety profile of this vaccine and will help maintain public confidence in influenza vaccination. Peer Review reports BackgroundSeasonal influenza epidemics are estimated to cause between 291,243 and 645,832 deaths annually with an excess mortality rate of 0.1–6.4 per 100,000 individuals for those < 65 years of age and 17.9–223.5 per 100 000 for those older than 75 years [1].Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is the primary strategy used globally to limit the burden of seasonal influenza [2, 3]. Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for high-risk groups including pregnant women, children aged < 5 years, the elderly, and individuals with chronic health conditions [4, 5]. However, current influenza vaccines generally induce strain-specific immunity. As influenza virus strains continuously evolve through antigenic drift resulting in new variants or strains [2], vaccines need to be frequently updated to match the strains most likely to be circulating during the upcoming season [2]. This leads to specific challenges for the continued monitoring of vaccine safety.Since 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has required manufacturers of seasonal influenza vaccines to conduct annual enhanced safety surveillance, replacing previous requirements based on data from small-scale safety and immunogenicity clinical trials [6, 7]. Specific guidance has been produced by the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) for enhanced safety surveillance [6]. The purpose of this surveillance is to rapidly detect and evaluate potential new safety concerns before the peak immunisation period of the vaccine in any particular year. Increased rates of reactogenicity or allergic events compared to those expected or reported following vaccination during the the previous season may signal new safety concerns and may indicate a potential for increased severity with increased vaccine exposure [6]. The use of enhanced safety surveillance to monitor adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is recommended by the EMA for the purpose of regulatory submission and review [6]. Using a passive surveillance system based on individual and healthcare professional (HCP) reporting of ADRs has been shown to improve the rates of adverse event (AE) reporting in comparison to previous years where passive surveillance systems relied on ADR reporting by HCPs alone [8, 9].In 2016, a quadrivalent inactivated split-virion influenza vaccine (IIV4; Vaxigrip Tetra®, Sanofi), which offers broad protection against influenza through the inclusion of two influenza A and two influenza B virus strains, was approved in Europe [10]. IIV4 is indicated for use in adults and children from 6 months of age [11].Several adjustments have been made to methods of enhanced passive safety surveillance (EPSS) reporting which have been used for for IIV4 surveillance over previous years, with the aim of improving both the quality of the data and the reporting stimulus. The introduction of a combination of a paper reporting method, using a pre-paid envelope, and phone reporting to replace email reporting, during the 2019/20 EPSS for individuals vaccinated with IIV4 provided better quality reporting. This was demonstrated by the higher than expected rates of spontaneous reporting (6.0%) in comparison to the method of email reporting alone that was used during the northern hemisphere 2018/19 EPSS for IIV4 [4, 12].Here we report an EPSS for individuals vaccinated with IIV4 during the northern hemisphere (NH) 2020/21 season, in which we used electronic reporting via an electronic data capture system (EDC), rather than email or mail, in addition to the standard reporting method by telephone.The overall aim of this study was to detect any clinically significant change in the frequency or severity of expected reactogenicity, compared with what is known or expected with the vaccine as defined by the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). We also described the estimated reporting rates of suspected ADRs occurring within 7 days following routine vaccination with IIV4 and compared them with previous data for the EPSS 2019/20 influenza season and with expected frequencies as per the SmPC.MethodsStudy design, population and settingBetween October 9, 2020 and November 30, 2020, an EPSS was conducted to examine ADRs associated with IIV4 vaccination within seven participating sites (private clinics) in Finland. This EPSS included individuals aged 6 months and older who had received IIV4 from their HCP within 4 to 6 weeks following the start of seasonal influenza vaccination. Vaccines were administered as per routine clinical practice in accordance with the product labelling (indication).The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Epidemiological Practice, and the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance. Informed consent was not required because the EPSS relied on routine pharmacovigilance and voluntary spontaneous reporting.Vaccine formulationThe IIV4 vaccine contained 15 μg haemagglutinin per strain of A/Guangdong Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1) pdm09-like strain (A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019, CNIC-1909), A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like strain (A/Hong Kong/2671/2019, IVR-208), B/Washington/02/2019-like strain (B/Washington/02/2019, wild type) and B/Phuket/3073/2013-like strain (B/Phuket/3073/2013, wild type) within a 0.5 mL dose. All strains were propagated in fertilised hens' eggs from healthy chicken flocks [13].EndpointsThe primary endpoint was the occurrence of suspected ADRs within 7 days following routine vaccination with IIV4 during the NH influenza season 2020/21. Secondary endpoints included the occurrence of suspected ADRs occurring within 7 days following routine vaccination with IIV4 according to pre-defined age groups (≥ 6 months to < 6 years, ≥ 6 to < 13 years, ≥ 13 to < 18 years, ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years and > 65 years); the occurrence of serious suspected ADRs after vaccination with IIV4 at any time following vaccination; and vaccinee reporting rates of suspected ADRs observed during the NH influenza season 2020/21 compared with vaccinee reporting rates of suspected ADRs observed during the NH influenza season 2019/20, or compared with the frequencies documented in the SmPC. Serious suspected ADRs were defined as ADRs that result in death or are life threatening, or that require inpatient hospitalization or the prolongation of existing hospitalization, or result in the persistence of significant disability or incapacity.Study conduct and data collectionFollowing vaccination with IIV4, the HCPs informed each vaccinee or vaccinee’s parents/legal guardians on the importance of reporting suspected ADRs, especially those occurring within the first 7 days, and instructed them on how to use the EDC system (Viedoc 4.60), which was set up using vaccinee-specific accounts, to report any ADRs directly in ‘real-time’. Alternatively, vaccinees or vaccinee’s parents/legal guardians could report ADRs by phone to the Finnish Sanofi Medical Information & Pharmacovigilance Call Centre and the ADRs reported to this centre were integrated into the pharmacovigilance database. The ADRs recognized as being of particular interest by the PRAC were analysed separately and classified as PRAC ADRs of interest. The following were defined by the PRAC as ADRs of interest: systemic reactions (fever [≥ 38 °C], nausea, vomiting, malaise, headache, decreased appetite, myalgia and/or arthralgia, irritability/prolonged crying [for children under 5 years of age]), injection-site reactions (pain, erythema and swelling) and events indicative of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash and ocular symptoms.Vaccination cards (VC) were provided to the vaccinee or vaccinee’s parents/legal guardians to facilitate data collection. A copy of the VC was retained at the site so that the details could be transcribed into the EDC (including the unique patient identifier automatically generated using the EDC, batch number of vaccine, vaccination date and vaccinee age group). All data were extracted from the PV (pharmacovigilance) database for the statistical analyses of the safety data.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics were used to summarise the data, including the vaccinee reporting rate and ADR reporting rate, with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI). The vaccinee reporting rate was calculated using the number of vaccinees who reported at least one suspected ADR divided by the total number of VCs distributed; and the ADR reporting rate was calculated using the number of suspected ADRs divided by the total number of VCs distributed. The ADR reporting rate 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact CI while the vaccinee reporting rate 95% CIs were calculated using the normal approximation method of binomial CI (Wald asymptotic CI) or using the Clopper-Pearson exact CI where applicable.The EPSS current interim guidance [6] for seasonal influenza vaccines in the EU (EMA/PRAC/222346/2014) requires the system to be able to detect ADRs considered to be common, i.e. expected to occur with a reporting rate of ≥ 1%. To meet this requirement, 1000 individuals were targeted to be vaccinated within 4 to 6 weeks following the start of the influenza vaccination season across the participating sites. This population size provides a > 99% probability of collecting ≥ 1 report of a common AE. Data were summarised cumulatively by pre-defined age group, by ADRs occurring ≤ 7 or > 7 days after vaccination or missing, by seriousness and by severity.The previous reporting rates obtained in the EPSS NH influenza season 2019/20 were used as a comparator for the reporting rates observed in the current EPSS NH influenza season 2020/21 in addition to SmPC, in order to evaluate any potential increase in reactogenicity. Any reports received outside the EPSS period were handled as routine spontaneous reports but were not included in the analysis.ResultsA total of 1008 participants were included; most (99.8%) were ≥ 18 years old. In total, 29 reports were received for 82 suspected ADRs. The time to ADR onset was known for 79 (79/82; 96.3%) ADRs, all of which occurred within the first 7 days of vaccination. Of these, the majority (70/79; 88.61%) occurred on the same day or the following day after vaccination.For the primary endpoint, 28 participants who received the IIV4 vaccine reported 79 suspected ADRs within 7 days following vaccination, corresponding to a vaccinee reporting rate of 2.78% (95% CI: 1.85, 3.99) (ADR reporting rate, 7.84% [95% CI: 6.25, 9.67%]) (Table 1). Among older participants (> 65 years), the vaccinee reporting rate was 6.25% (95% CI: 0.77, 20.81), while those aged 18–65 years had a vaccinee reporting rate of 2.67% (95% CI: 1.73, 3.91) (ADR reporting rates of 15.63% [95% CI: 5.28, 32.79] and 7.58% [95% CI: 5.97, 9.46], respectively). No ADRs were reported by those aged 13–18 years (number of VCs distributed, n = 4) and of only two participants in the 6–13 years age group, one reported 3 ADRs (Table 1). Seventy-two PRAC ADRs of interest occurred in 27 vaccinees within 7 days following vaccination with IIV4, corresponding to a vaccinee reporting rate of 2.68% (95% CI: 1.77, 3.87%) (PRAC ADR reporting rate: 7.14% [95% CI: 5.63, 8.91%]) (Table 1).Table 1 Adverse drug reaction rates stratified by age, reported within 7 days of vaccinationFull size tableReporting rates for all ADRs (including those without known time to onset) did not differ substantially from those known to have occurred within the first 7 days (Table 2). The most frequently reported ADRs were injection site reactions (vaccination site pain, vaccination site erythema and vaccination site swelling; n = 46, 2.28%), myalgia (n = 9, 0.89%) and headache (n = 8, 0.79%) (Table 3). No serious suspected ADRs were reported at any point post-vaccination. However, two ADRs (vaccination site swelling and headache) were of severe intensity; these were both PRAC ADRs of interest.Table 2 Comparison of reporting rates of suspected ADRs between NH influenza Season 2019/20 and NH influenza Season 2020/21Full size tableTable 3 Vaccinee reporting rate by PRAC adverse drug reactions occurring within 7 days after vaccinationFull size tableThe total vaccinee reporting rates and ADR reporting rates tended to be lower in the current season (2020/21) than in the previous season (2019/20), for suspected ADRs occurring ≤ 7 days post vaccination (Table 2).A number of PRAC ADRs of interest reported in the current EPSS were not observed in the previous year. These included 11 reports of vaccination site swelling reported by 11 vaccinees (vaccinee reporting rate, 1.09% [95% CI: 0.55, 1.94]): 1 in the ≥ 6 to < 13 years age group, 9 in the ≥ 18 to ≤ 65 years age group and 1 aged > 65 years. This was in line with the expected frequency stated in the SmPC, which lists vaccination site swelling as common (1% to 10%) in adults and the elderly and very common (≥ 10%) among children aged 6 to 13 years. The other PRAC ADRs of interest were reported in both previous and current seasons.DiscussionIn this EPSS conducted in Finland during the NH 2020/21 influenza season, 2.78% of the vaccinees reported 79 suspected ADRs within 7 days following vaccination with IIV4. These findings were favourable compared with those reported in the EPSS from the previous year in Finland (overall vaccinee reporting rate for the previous year (2019/20), 5.96% [95% CI: 4.45, 7.48%] and ADR reporting rate, 17.36% [95% CI: 14.99, 19.94%]) [12]. Furthermore, the safety profile was comparable to that described in the SmPC [13]. For the primary objective, no safety concerns were observed during the surveillance period, in line with findings from EPSS studies conducted in previous influenza seasons [4, 12, 14]. Over half of the events reported during the current EPSS were of mild intensity and 2.5% of ADRs reported were of severe intensity (vaccination site swelling and headache). For the current season, we implemented electronic reporting via the EDC using vaccinee-specific accounts in addition to the standard phone reporting method. While this digital reporting strategy provided the expected good quality of reporting, reporting rates were surprisingly lower versus the paper reporting method (pre-paid envelope) used in the 2019/20 season. Possible reasons for this include the inherent risks associated with using a digital solution, such as technical issues in accessing the EDC in time or a lack of vaccinee adherence to the EDC solution, thereby possibly hindering ADR reporting. This is however unlikely as reporting via telephone was provided as a back-up solution. Additionally, only one vaccinee reported facing technical difficulties with the EDC. Overall, the EDC solution was found to be well accepted by the vaccinees, with no negative feedback during follow-ups by the sites/ local PV. The current disruption to health-seeking behaviour and staffingoutines in clinics and to surveillance priorities and capacities as a result of the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a decrease in influenza information sharing globally [15]. Such disruptions during the 2020/21 influenza season could be one explanation for the lower reporting rates observed in this study. It is also possible that confidence in flu vaccines has increased over time, with IIV4 being on the market for at least three seasons. The vaccinee reporting rate reported here for IIV4 is in line with published reporting rates of spontaneous ADR reports after vaccination with other seasonal influenza vaccines, ranging from 20 to 90 reports per 1,000,000 people vaccinated [16,17,18,19,20]. The ability of EPSS to improve reporting rates following vaccination has been previously demonstrated in a number of studies [8, 14, 16, 21, 22]. In an Australian investigation, the introduction of EPSS increased the reporting rates for vaccines administered in the state of Victoria from 2.6 reports per 100,000 in 2003 to 13.5 reports per 100,000 people vaccinated per annum in 2009 [21], while in an Italian study reporting rates for the seasonal influenza vaccine increased from 55 reports per 1,000,000 for the period 2009-2012 to approximately 140 reports per 1,000,000 doses in 2014 following the introduction of EPSS [8]. The surveillance carried out in this study enabled near real-time reporting of ADRs after vaccine exposure through the collection of data within a short time period at the start of the seasonal influenza vaccination. This was important to mitigate potential risks before the peak period of the influenza season. Spontaneous reporting was stimulated by HCPs informing vaccinees or vaccinees’ parents/legal guardians about the importance of reporting ADRs and was further facilitated using VCs and enabling the vaccinees or the parents/legal guardians to report the ADRs directly using the EDC system. The customised reporting form containing predefined ADRs and focused questions enabled the collection of accurate and complete information for case processing and follow-up by local PV.In this EPSS, both younger and older age groups were under-represented. The study included individuals from private clinics, whereas influenza vaccines were distributed for free at public health clinics in Finland. Therefore, there may have been a lack of economic incentive for parents to bring their children or for older adults to attend private clinics to receive the vaccine. Although the enrollment was low in these age groups, considering the descriptive nature of the analyses, it is unlikely that this would have significantly impacted the findings of the EPSS.It should also be noted that all cases were self-reported by vaccinees or their legal guardians and were not medically confirmed. However, all cases were non serious and it is unlikely that they would have triggered a medical visit; thus confirmation by an HCP would not have been obtained for most ADRs reported. As is inherent in passive surveillance, and to avoid bias in the collection of safety data, there was no possibility to follow-up with individuals at the site level. The interpretation of our findings should take into account the possibility of both under-reporting (where only a fraction of the total number of ADRs actually occurring after vaccination are reported) and differential reporting (where ADRs and ADRs with shorter time to onset after vaccination are more likely to be reported during the surveillance period than ADRs with longer time to onset). ConclusionsIn conclusion, the 2020/21 EPSS results did not suggest any clinically significant change in what is known or expected in terms of the safety of IIV4. The analysis of suspected ADRs did not identify any reporting pattern by type, frequency or severity, supporting the established acceptable safety profile of this vaccine. These findings will help to maintain public confidence in influenza vaccination.

A new H7N9 virus of avian origin crossed the species barrier to infect humans, causing high mortality and emerged as a potential pandemic threat. The mechanisms underlying the virulence and pathogenicity of H7N9 virus remains elusive. H7N9 virus originated from a genetic assortment that involved the avian H9N2 virus, which was the donor of the six internal genes. Unlike the H7N9 virus, the H9N2 virus caused only mild phenotype in infected mice. In this study, we used the mouse infection model to dissect the difference in the host response between the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. Through analyzing transcriptomics of infected lungs, we surprisingly found that the H9N2 infection elicited an earlier induction of innate immunity than H7N9 infection. This finding was further corroborated by an immunohistochemical study demonstrating earlier recruitment of macrophage to the H9N2-infected lung than the H7N9-infected lung, which could occur as early as 6 hours post infection. In contrast, H7N9 infection was characterized by a late, strong lung CD8+ T cell response that is more robust than H9N2 infection. The different pattern of immune response may underlie more severe lung pathology caused by H7N9 infection compared to H9N2 infection. Finally, we could show that co-infection of the H9N2 virus protected mice from the challenge of both H7N9 and PR8 viruses, thereby strengthening the importance of the induction of an early innate immunity in the host’s defense against influenza infection. Collectively, our study unraveled a previously unidentified difference in host response between H7N9 and H9N2 infection and shed new insight on how virus-host interaction shapes the in vivo outcome of influenza infection.IntroductionSince the first virus strain was identified in 1930s, influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to pose a threat to humans. The IAV challenge, at least in part, stems from the fact that multiple hosts exist, including a variety of avian species, pigs, and humans, and new viruses can emerge from reassortment when two or more viruses infect the same cell. Normally the species barriers would prevent IAV’s spillover from animal to human. However, such a barrier could be broken, resulting in human exposure to new viruses to which they do not have immunity, and consequently can lead to high mortality and even a pandemic if the virus evolves into acquiring human-to-human transmission ability. Most recently, a case was found in a novel avian IAV of H7N9 subtype (abbreviated as H7N9 throughout this paper), which was first reported to cause severe human respiratory infection with high fatality rate in Shanghai and Anhui Province, China, in March 2013 (Gao et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that H7N9 is a reassortment virus having hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes derived from Eurasian avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and six internal genes from avian H9N2 genotypes (Ku et al., 2014). The death rate of H7N9-infected patients is as high as 40% (Wang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020), whereas H9N2 infections only cause mild symptoms in humans (Song and Qin, 2020). Recent research has also indicated a high level of genetic compatibility between H9N2 and H7N9 viruses, raising the likelihood that there could be continuous reassortment between H7N9 and H9N2 viruses co-circulated in poultry and that internal gene replacement could convert the H9N2 virus into a new threat to public health (Pu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020).The immune response of the host, comprised of two arms, innate immunity and adaptive immunity, is crucial in determining disease pathogenesis caused by viral infection and is the basis for the development of control strategies (Koutsakos et al., 2019). While a potent immune response is essential for effective viral inhibition, it must be fine-tuned, as an excessive and/or prolonged inflammatory response has been correlated to exacerbation of tissue damage both in human and animal models. This double-edged effect was clearly demonstrated in the case of H5N1 virus, which like H7N9, is of avian origin and causes severe clinical manifestation with a high mortality rate. H5N1 infections were associated with dysregulated elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, referred to as a cytokine storm, which is widely regarded as the major cause of widespread pulmonary tissue damage associated with H5N1 infection (Kash et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2020).There have been several published studies on the characterization of H7N9 virus in mice. These studies revealed that H7N9 virus caused more severe phenotype than H9N2 virus and seasonal H3N2 influenza virus, which correlates to increased infectivity and elevated induction of proinflammatory cytokines (Belser et al., 2013; Mok et al., 2013; Meliopoulos et al., 2014; Bi et al., 2015). Of interest, the host response and the outcome of infection also varied with the mouse strain used, as C57BL/6 mice exhibited more severe phenotype than BALB/c mice, which was accompanied by a different profile of proinflammatory cytokines (Zhao et al., 2014). It was found that H7N9 infection induced significant elevation of proinflammatory cytokines at a level higher than the duck-derived H9N2 virus and the H9N2 virus of avian origin, but lower compared to that induced by the H5N1 infection (Mok et al., 2013). Thus, despite causing similar morbidity and mortality in humans, H7N9 and H5N1 may differ in the disease-causing mechanisms.Our group has adopted a comparative approach to understanding the mechanisms underlying mammalian adaptation and pathogenesis of the H7N9 virus using H9N2 as a counterpart. Through performing bulk transcriptomic profiling of lung tissues from virus-infected mice, we recently identified IFN-κ as one of the earliest Type I IFNs induced by the H9N2 infection whereas this early induction was not featured in response to H7N9 infection (He et al., 2020). This finding prompted us to further dissect the difference between the host immune response in the H7N9 infection and the H9N2 infection using the mouse model; the results of such exploration are presented here.Materials and methodsVirusesA/Shanghai/4664T/2013(SH/4664) H7N9 virus (Genbank accession number: KC853225.1-KC853232.1) was conserved at a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) lab at Shanghai Public Clinical Center. A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/98 (CK/F98) H9N2 virus (Genbank accession number: AY253750.1-AY253756.1, AY743216.1) was conserved at Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academic of Agricultural Sciences.Animal studiesEight- to ten-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (B&K Universal Group Limited, Shanghai, China) were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facilities of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. For the animal study comparing virulence of H7N9 versus H9N2, mice were randomly grouped, anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100mg/kg), and then intranasally inoculated with a dose of 1× 106 EID50 (50% egg infectious dose) virus, or PBS in a volume of 50μl. The infected mice, where indicated, were divided into subgroups for different analyses; for the assessment of morbidity and mortality, the mice were monitored for survival and body weight changes over a 14-day observation period. Mice with 30% or more body weight loss were recorded dead and humanely euthanized. For the co-infection experiment, mice were intranasally inoculated with 1x104 TCID50 of H7N9/PR8, or 1.7x107 EID50 of H9N2, or both viruses in a 50µl volume. All the animal-related experiments were carried out in a BSL3 facility at Shanghai Public Clinical Center. This study was performed in accordance with Home Office guidelines and were approved by the Shanghai Public Health Center Local Ethical Committee.Histopathological and immunohistochemical stainingMice were sacrificed at 6 hours, day 1, day 2, day 3, and day 7 after the virus challenge for collection of lung tissues. Lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were cut and stained with H&E. The pathology scores were calculated following a methodology we previously published (He et al., 2020). For immunohistochemical (IHC) assays, paraffin sections of the lung were de-waxed and then subjected to heat treatment in citrate buffer, followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity using 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were blocked for 1 hour (hr) with Fc Receptor Blocker and then incubated overnight at 4°C with F4/80 antibody (CST No.70076, 1:500). Antibody binding was detected using ZSGB System reagents (ZSGB, Beijing). After counterstaining with haematoxylin, the slides were incubated with CD4-specific antibody (Abcam No. ab183685, 1:1000) and CD8-specific antibody (LSBio No.LS-C43572, 1:200), and multiplexed immunofluorescence staining was then performed using Opal 7-color Manual IHC Kit (Akoya,USA). The stained slides were scanned by TissueFAXS 200 (TissueGnostics). The acquired images were analyzed by Strata Quest software to assess the number of F4/80+, CD4+, CD8+ cell and the inflammatory infiltration areas.Extraction of total RNA and microarray analysisEach lung from the H7N9/H9N2 infected mice was mechanically and ultrasonically homogenized at 4°C in 1.2ml RNAzol (MRC, OH, USA). Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The resulting RNA preparations were analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) to ensure quality and integrity. For microarray hybridization, 500ng of RNA were applied to Cy3-labelling reaction using the one-color Quick Amp Labelling protocol and the labeled cDNAs were hybridized to Agilent’s mouse 8 x 60 k microarrays followed by detection using the Agilent Scanner G2505C (Agilent Technologies). The microarray data were analyzed by RBR embedded in Excel and cluster analyses were performed using MEGA5. The microarray data were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE142709.Quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from homogenized lung tissue using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription was performed using oligo (dT) primer and the Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI), and SYBR green-based real-time PCR was performed on the resulting cDNAs using Mastercycler reprealplex real-time PCR system (Eppendorf, Germany). The data were analyzed by the REALPLEX2.2 software. The gene-specific primers used in this study were: mCXCL10: F-5’-GGTCTGAGTCCTCGCTCAAG-3’, R-5’-GTCGCACCTCCACATAGCTT-3’; mIL1β: F-5’-GAAATGCCACCTTTTGACAGTG-3’, R-5’-CTGGATGCTCTCATCAGGACA-3’; mIL6: F-5’-CTGCAAGAGACTTCCATCCAG-3’, R-5’-AGTGGTATAGACAGGTCTGTTGG-3’; mTNFα: F-5’-CATCTTCTCAAAATTCGAGTGACAA-3’, R-5’-TGGGAGTAGACAAGGTACAACCC-3’; mGAPDH: F-5’-TGGCCTTCCGTGTTCC TAC-3’, R-5’-GAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCA-3’.Lung viral titer determination and RNA in situ hybridizationLung viral titer determinations, using 9-day-old embryonated eggs, were performed following our published procedure (Zhang et al., 2020). For analyzing viral RNA expression in the lung section by RNA in situ hybridization, we chose viral nucleoprotein (NP) RNA as target RNA for detection because of its high expression in infected cells and high conservation among different virus strains. An NP-specific probe, namely Probe-NP, is customized to target 236-1367 region of the NP gene of the influenza virus A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (GenBank: KF609528.1). Sequence comparison confirmed that the targeted NP gene sequence is highly conserved in the H9N2 virus. The preparation of slides and RNA in situ hybridization using RNAscope reagents (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were performed as described previously (He et al., 2020).Statistical analysisAll the statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied when comparing more than two groups. A P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significantResultsComparison of the virulence of the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses in C57BL/6 miceWe used a mouse infection model to compare the virulence of the H7N9 virus versus the H9N2 virus. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS (mock) or a dose of 1 × 106 EID50 of either the H7N9 or H9N2 virus, and monitored over a period of 14 days for survival and weight loss. Part of the group was subjected to lung viral load determination at 4-days post infection (dpi) by titration in embryonated eggs. The H7N9 challenged group showed a sustained weight loss starting from 1 dpi, whereas the H9N2 challenged group experienced a moderate weight decrease during the first 7 days and regained weight afterwards (Figure 1A). Accordingly, all the H7N9 infected mice died before 7 dpi whereas the H9N2 group all survived to the end of the observation period (Figure 1B). The average lung viral titer measured at 4 dpi for H9N2 group was approximately 20-fold lower than that of the H7N9 group (8.32 × 104 EID50/g versus 1.78 × 106 EID50/g) (Figure 1C).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 H7N9 virus is more virulent than H9N2 virus in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with a single dose of 106 EID50 of the H7N9 virus or the H9N2 virus. (A) Weight loss during a 14-day observation period.

Each red dot represents a single NP RNA molecule, further indicated by white arrow, with nuclei counterstained by DAPI. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.*P < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA.To further observe the progression of virus infection, we employed RNA in situ hybridization technology (RNAscope) to assess the dynamic distribution of virus-infected cells, indicated by the presence of viral NP RNA, in the lung. Cells positive for NP RNA (NP-positive cells) could be detected in both bronchi and alveoli of the lung section from H7N9 infected mice 6 hours post infection (0.25 dpi) and saw a marked increase in the number over 1-3 dpi, followed by a sharp decline observed at 7 dpi. The number of NP-positive lung cells were significantly lower in samples from the H9N2 group, compared to those of H7N9 group at all time points until becoming undetectable at 7dpi (Figure 1D). Thus, the RANscope data were consistent overall with lung viral titer measurements, confirming higher replication capacity of the H7N9 virus than the H9N2 virus. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the H7N9 virus was more virulent than the H9N2 virus in C57BL/6 mice.Comparative analysis of gene expression dynamics in the lungs of infected miceTo gain insight into host responses against the H7N9 and H9N2 viruses, we performed a microarray-based profiling of RNA extracted from lung tissues collected at a series of time points post virus challenge from H7N9- and H9N2-infected mice. Our initial analysis of this data revealed a significant difference between H9N2 and H7N9 infection in the induction of one type I interferon, namely IFN-κ, which was then demonstrated as a broad inhibitor of influenza replication via the IFNAR-MAPK-Fos-CHD6 axis (He et al., 2020). We further utilized this data to interrogate other aspects of immune response in the lung by focusing on genes indicative of immune status. The analyses revealed that relative to H7N9 infection, H9N2 infection was characterized by an earlier induction of immune response in the lung, as evidenced by prompt induction of interferon-induced genes and proinflammatory cytokines with key roles in the host’s response to influenza infection, including IL-10, IL-12β, MCP1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which occurred as early as 0.25 dpi (Figures 2A, B). Conversely, despite later initiation, the H7N9 infection-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines appeared to be generally more sustainable with higher peak value as compared to that associated with H9N2 infection. These findings were further verified by measurements of representative cytokines/chemokines and ISGs using quantitative RT-PCR (Figures 2C, D). Interestingly, the earlier induction by H9N2 infection did not occur to IFN-β, which rather showed more upregulation in response to H7N9 infection, sharply rising to a peak at 1 dpi from a base level of 0.25 dpi and then dropping precipitously. The uncoupling between IFN-β and ISGs is consistent with the early ISG response to H9N2 infection and may be mediated by IFN-κ (Figure 2B). Thus, even with a lower viral replication, the H9N2 virus was able to induce an antiviral/inflammatory state in the infected lung faster than H7N9 virus, which might contribute to a better host protection.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Comparative analysis of gene expression dynamics in the lungs of infected mice. Total RNA of lung tissues harvested at 0,0.25,1,2,3,7 dpi from H7N9- or H9N2-infected mice were subjected to microarray-based transcriptome analysis. The microarray data were used for analyzing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-viral ISGs, expressed as heatmaps of relative gene expression after normalization to the value of mock-infected mice (A, B). Real-time RT-PCR was performed to validate the microarray analysis (n=3 per time point), with the results shown respectively for cytokines (C) and anti-viral ISGs (D).Comparative analysis of lung pathology and immune cell infiltrationNext, we evaluated the lung pathology and immune cell infiltration during the course of infection. The degree of lung tissue injury was assessed using HE staining. The pulmonary pathological changes of mice infected with H7N9 were severe at 3 dpi and continued to worsen until death; the main injuries were characterized by massive red blood cell exudation and serious bronchial and bronchiolar damage (Figure 3A, upper panel). In contrast, the histopathology changes in the lung of H9N2-infected mice included alveolar wall thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration, which were most evident at 2 dpi. During subsequent days, although the injury of the lung tissue persisted, the inflammatory infiltration was reduced and consequently, the red blood cell exudation was significantly reduced at 7 dpi (Figure 3A). The progression of lung damage was further appraised by a pathological score curve, verifying that additional severe lung pathology was induced by the H7N9 infection compared to H9N2 infection at both 3 dpi and 7 dpi (Figure 3B).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Comparative analysis of lung pathology and immune cell infiltration. (A) Lung tissue harvested at 0,0.25,1,2,3, and 7 dpi. from mice that had been infected H7N9 or H9N2 avian influenza virus was stained with H&E.

(E) Immunofluorescence detection of CD4+ plus CD8+ T cells in the lung sections by sequential staining with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies, with nuclei counterstained by DAPI. Red and green signals indicate detected CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. (F) Summation data of the measurements of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung. n=3 mice for each group per time point. **P < 0.01 by unpaired t test.The immune cell infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, focusing on two important immune cell types, namely macrophage and T cell. Macrophages play multiple functions in antiviral immune responses, including antigen recognition and secretion of interferons. After H7N9 infection, the frequency of lung macrophages moderately increased within 2 dpi before climbing to a peak level at 3 dpi which was significantly higher than the pre-infection (normal) level, and then underwent a sharp decline by 7 dpi (Figures 3C, D). In contrast, a substantial increase in the frequency of lung macrophages was observed after H9N2 infection by 0.25 dpi, which was maintained through 3 dpi before rapidly disappearing by 7 dpi (Figures 3C, D). Thus, H9N2 infection triggers a lung macrophage response more promptly than H7N9 infection, which is in accordance with the above bulky lung transcriptomics analysis revealing very early induction of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines by the H9N2 infection that did not occur with the H7N9 infection.As one of the two arms of the adaptive immunity, T cells are critical for virus clearance. Previous analyses of human H7N9 patients indicated an early robust CD8+ T cell response is closely correlated with rapid recovery (Wang et al., 2015), whereas CD4+ T cells can directly contribute to viral clearance by cytokine secretion and provide help for B cells and CD8+ T cells (Kervevan and Chakrabarti, 2021). Our measurement identified 1dpi as a demarcation point of the two phases according to the difference between H7N9 and H9N2 infections in terms of lung CD8+ T cell response. Before 1 dpi, no significant difference appeared between the H7N9 and H9N2 infection. In fact, H9N2 induced the highest frequency of lung CD8+ T cells at 1 dpi over the course of infection, which was comparable to or even higher than that shown by H7N9 infection at the same time point. After 1 dpi, H7N9 infection was characterized by an elevation of induced CD8+T cell response, which was not observed with H9N2 infection. The CD8+ T cell response induced by H7N9 infection reached a peak level at 2 dpi and then gradually decreased afterwards, with the level at 7 dpi being still higher than the peak level observed with the H9N2 infection. The H7N9 infection was also associated with a generally stronger CD4+ T cell response than the H9N2 infection. Interestingly, this response did not have the dynamic feature of the lung CD8+ T cell response, showing a relatively stable level up to 7 dpi since showing a clear upregulation between 0.25-1 dpi (Figures 3E, F). Collectively, these immuno-histochemical studies highlighted a marked difference between H7N9 and H9N2 infections in eliciting lung macrophage and CD8+ T cell response in terms of both the timing and magnitude.An experimental utilization of H9N2 raised early innate immunity to protect against heterologous influenza challengeTo evaluate the importance of induction of early immune response in host protection, we designed a mouse co-infection study, in which the H9N2-induced early immunity was imposed against lethal H7N9 infection or PR8 infection. To this end, the mice were intranasally challenged with 1 x 104 TCID50 of either H7N9 or PR8 virus, alone or in mixture with 1.7 x 107 EID50 of H9N2 virus, and subsequently monitored for survival and weight loss (Figure 4A). Compared to the animal group with a single H7N9 infection, that all died within 9 days post challenge, a majority of the experimental group receiving the mixed infection survived at the end of the 14-day observation period (Figure 4B). This H9N2-mediated protective effect was also reflected in weight loss curves (Figure 4C). A protection was also observed in the co-administration of PR8 virus with the H9N2 virus for challenging mice; the infected animals exhibited better survival than those infected with PR8 and they also showed significantly better weight gain from 9 dpi, despite displaying more weight loss in the earlier period (Figures 4D, E). Collectively, these results further support our view that early innate immunity, once activated/primed, could afford the host a more effective antiviral defense against invading influenza viruses.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 An experimental utilization of H9N2-raised early innate immunity to protect against heterologous influenza challenge.

We observed that, with the same challenging dose, H7N9 infection caused complete lethality before day 8 while the H9N2-infected group only initially exhibited mild weight loss before regaining normal weights and attaining full recovery by day 7. Such a difference in the outcome of infection was correlated to higher lung viral titers associated with the H7N9 infection compared to the H9N2 infection. Microarray-based analyses of gene expression in the lung surprisingly revealed an early induction of innate immunity by the H9N2 infection relative to the H7N9 infection, evidenced by the upregulation of ISGs, immune cell markers and proinflammatory genes. In accordance with this finding, we further showed that macrophages were recruited to the lung of H9N2-infected mice as early as 6 hrs post infection while the clear enrichment of macrophage in the lung was only observed for H7N9 infection on day 3. The lung macrophage response for both infections were subdued by day 7. In contrast, the H7N9-infected lung exhibited a more robust CD8+ T cell response than the H9N2-infected lung, peaking at day 2 and declining afterwards. The different pattern of immune response may correspond with the H7N9 infection which produced more severe lung pathology than the H9N2 infection. Finally, we could show that co-infection of the H9N2 virus led to an effective protection against both H7N9 and PR8 viruses, thereby strengthening the importance of an early innate immunity in the host’s defense against influenza infection. Collectively, our study unraveled a previously unidentified difference in the host’s response between the H7N9 and H9N2 infections: the H9N2 infection triggered an earlier innate immunity in the lung than the H7N9 infection. We proposed that such early engagement of host innate immunity, along with intrinsic weak infectivity in mammalian cells, permits an effective control of H9N2 in infected mice. It is tempting to speculate that the H7N9 virus evolves a strategy to avoid triggering early immune response and thus allows more effective virus propagation in the lung until the later arrival of adaptive immunity, which consequently contributes to lung pathogenicity as a collateral effect of viral clearance.The study presented here is distinguished from previous mouse studies on H7N9 infection in that our analyses covered very early time points post infection starting from 6 dpi., which were previously neglected. Such an expanded investigation led us to a surprising finding that, relative to the H7N9 infection, the H9N2 infection triggered an early, while transient, innate immune response in infected lung in terms of both interferon-mediated antiviral signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. We further corroborated this finding by demonstrating earlier recruitment of macrophages in the H9N2-infected lung compared to the H7N9-infected lung. In fact, we have used our microarray data to assess the expression dynamics of two monocyte-expressing chemokine receptors, namely CCR2 and CXCR4, which play key roles in mobilizing monocytes into lung in response to their respective ligand, CCL2 (MCP-1) and CXCL12. The analyses revealed that, compared to the H7N9 infection, the H9N2 infection induced an earlier induction of both CCR2 and CXCR4 transcripts, similar to that of CCL2 (Figure 2A) in the lung (data not shown). Thus, these findings, in line with the notion that the CCL2-CCR2 axis drives the lung migration of monocyte, supported the infiltrated monocytes as one if not the only source of macrophage accumulation in the lung responding to H9N2 infection. A major limitation of this study is that we had not measured the abundance of neutrophiles, which have well documented roles in influenza-induced pathogenicity (Camp and Jonsson, 2017; George et al., 2021), as well as innate immune cells other than macrophage in the H7N9/H9N2-infected lungs and BAL fluids. Our analysis of lung transcriptomics did suggest a potential early lung enrichment of neutrophiles in response to H9N2 infection, evidenced by CXCR2, the main receptor mediating the lung migration of neutrophils during influenza infection, and three major neutrophil-attracting chemokines, namely CCL3, CXCL-1, and CXCL2, which all exhibited a pattern consistent with an early induction by H9N2 infection compared to H7N9 infection (data not shown). The illustration of the complete landscape of changes in innate immune response to H9N2 versus H9N2, as well as the dissection of the functional contributions of individual immune cell types to such response, clearly warrant future investigation.We also probed the dynamics of the T cell immune response reacting to H9N2 and H7N9 infections. The results showed a more robust CD8+ T cell response in the lung induced by the H7N9 infection than H9N2 infection. Importantly, for the H7N9 infection, such T cell response showed a pattern of gradual increase with a peak attained on day 2 post infection. Our previous studies of hospitalized H7N9 patients revealed the virus resolution and survival depends on a diversity of response mechanisms, wherein an early prominent H7N9-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses is translated into a shorter discharge time and increased survival. This rapid CD8(+) T cell response is potentially derived from cross-reactive memory T cells deposited by prior influenza exposure (Wang et al., 2015). Utilizing a sequential infection mouse model, we have recently demonstrated that lung-resident influenza-specific CD8+ T cells are promptly activated and secrete IFN-γ in response to influenza re-exposure, thereby establishing a tissue-wide antiviral state for effective viral inhibition (Jiang et al., 2022). In the current study, the mice were naïve to influenza and thus the increased number of CD8+ T cells in the H7N9-infected lung must be due to recruitment of circulating CD8+ T cells. Whether such strong T cell response, which occurred at relatively late time points after infection, functions in viral clearance, contributes to the lung histopathology, or both remains an open question and we speculate the dual effects would be more likely. In this regard, the measurement of the functionality of CD8+ T cells, as well as the assessment of their possible redistribution among different tissue compartments, will be informative to further define the role of a primary T cell response in the anti-H7N9 host immunity. They are definitely worthy of future investigation.Finally, we performed a co-infection experiment to examine our hypothesis that the elicitation of an early innate immunity is critical for protection against influenza virus infection. We could show that co-inoculation of H9N2 did not enhance the lethality and pathogenicity of the host, but rather reduced the pathogenicity of H7N9 infection. An even better protective effect was observed with the PR8 virus. The lesser efficacy of H9N2-mediated protection against H7N9 versus PR8 might be due to a relatively higher replicative capacity of the H7N9 virus. Given that H7N9 and PR8 viruses express very different HA and NA surface proteins, the ability of H9N2 co-infection to protect mice against the challenge of a heterologous influenza virus is consistent with a mechanism primarily mediated by innate immunity, as we proposed. Taken together, we think that the lesser pathogenicity of H9N2 in the mouse model has dual mechanism: first, it is intrinsically attenuated when infecting mammalian cells and our previous study has pinpointed such defect to the lack of mammalian adaptation of its internal genes, most likely its polymerases genes (Zhang et al., 2020); secondly, it triggers an earlier innate immune response in infected lung as compared to H7N9, resulting in more effective viral inhibition.In summary, we presented here a comparative analysis of immune responses to the H7N9 virus versus the H9N2 virus. This analysis, together with a following demonstration of the protection against H7N9 and PR8 challenge by H9N2 co-infection, brings a new perspective to the interaction between host immunity and influenza evasion. That is, the induction of early innate immune response, as seen with in H9N2 infection but absent in H7N9 infection, is the first but also potentially a primary step toward an effective viral inhibition. Without this step, adaptive immunity could be responsible for viral clearance; however, a sustained CD8+ T cell response may leave the host at higher risk of lung immunopathology. There are some important questions warranting future investigation. For example, what is the mechanism mediating H7N9’s escape from trigging an early innate immune response? Is there any specific viral factor involved? An equally important question is to identify the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) pathway(s) responsible for the detection of H9N2 infection. It should be noted that the importance of such a pathway would not be unraveled in the case of H7N9, where a viral evasion mechanism might evolve. Furthermore, is avoiding early innate immunity a general mechanism utilized by other influenza viruses that cause severe diseases? Conversely, a comparative measurement of pulmonary specific compliance and the composition of bronchoalveolar fluid is a worthy effort that has the potential to provide new clues into the H7N9-caused lung pathology and the underlying causes. These future investigations would certainly help us further understand the complex host-influenza interactions, thereby providing a new theoretical basis for development of new therapeutics for treatment of influenza-related human diseases.Data availability statementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

Oil on Canvas 39.3 in x 39.3 in/100.06 cm × 100.06 cm. Museo del Novecento, Milano, Italy. Digital image from Art Resource, New York, New York, USA. “Let us not offend Boccioni with a funeral eulogy,” stated Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the early 20th Century avant-garde Italian Futurist movement, at a retrospective exhibition for Italian painter and sculptor Umberto Boccioni. Despite a life cut short, Boccioni was one of the best known and most influential artists associated with early manifestations of Italian Futurism. Boccioni was born in the coastal Italy city of Reggio Calabria, but his family moved frequently during his childhood. After attending technical college in Catania, Sicily, in 1899 he studied drawing and painting in Rome. In 1906, Boccioni visited Paris to expand his artistic perspectives and then spent a portion of 1907 in Venice learning printmaking before relocating to Milan, where he met Marinetti. Art historian Rosalind McKever noted, “In February 1909, Marinetti published his famous manifesto in the French newspaper Le Figaro, demanding that Italian culture stop looking backward and embrace modernity.” Boccioni and his peers drafted a pair of related manifestos calling on other artists to discard traditional motifs and conventions and to find inspiration from science, technology, and modern urban life. In Boccioni’s words, this artistic response would be “a great synthesis of labor, light, and movement.” A 1911 trip to Paris opened his eyes to the artistic style known as Cubism, and as McKever wrote, “Boccioni integrates the Cubist use of collage-like numerals and straight lines that divide spatial planes into his more expressionistic style… the dissected planes implied dynamism and the straight lines became ‘force-lines’ showing motion.” Boccioni’s painting Elasticity, this month’s cover image, fuses stylistic elements from Cubism with themes from Futurism. Its fractured, chaotic elements also may serve as a visual metaphor calling for collective, focused public health action in response to an array of emerging zoonotic diseases. Art historian Kate Bryan wrote, “Boccioni’s subject matter was not still life, as had been largely the case with Cubism, to which the movement owed a clear stylistic debt, but rather the more impossible endeavour of depicting objects in motion.” Horse and rider frantically gallop across a landscape that is the antithesis of a bucolic, pastoral setting. Jutting electrical towers, rendered as fractured angular black lines and factory chimneys belching smoke, reveal a setting reshaped by human hands. Angular forms and planes representing glimpses of sky and artifacts of industry recede from the horse and rider they surround. The distorted, dynamic image of the horse with its flaring nostrils, sweeping forelock, and rippling muscles, and its forward-leaning rider, wearing a brimmed hat and black boots, trampling across a dusty road, transfixes the viewer’s attention toward the center of the painting. Artist and writer Marcus Bunyan commented that in Elasticity, Boccioni depicted “the pure energy of a horse, captured with intense chromaticism.” As is already clear, Boccioni did not have a long career or life. In 1915, he volunteered for military service in the first World War. Although not a casualty of combat, Boccioni succumbed to severe injuries after being thrown from his horse startled by a passing lorry in August 1916. McKever noted, “Throughout his career Boccioni had painted horses and it is a cruel irony that, having named his steed Vermiglia after the flaming red beast in the centre of The City Rises (1910), his fall would imitate the scene of what has become his most famous painting.” Many of Boccioni’s generation also died during World War I, including his Futurist colleague Antonio Sant’Elia and artists Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Franz Marc. Overlapping that global conflict was the 1918 influenza pandemic, caused by what would later be categorized as an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin, which eventually infected one third of the world’s population. Of that pandemic, Taubenberger and Morens wrote, “Many questions about its origins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered.” Among the human-mediated factors that drove the high rates of death and illness associated with that pandemic were wartime conditions, marshalling of military operations, mass transportation by ship and rail, and growing urbanization, which would have been celebrated by Futurists as transformative forces. More than a century later, the web of interrelated factors contributing to the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic infectious diseases has become more complicated and intertwined. Efforts to mitigate this complex global problem, if fragmented like the myriad shapes and shards in Boccioni’s Elasticity, are unlikely to succeed. As Ghai et al. noted, “Effectively preventing and controlling zoonotic diseases requires a One Health approach that involves collaboration across human health, animal health, and environmental sectors, as well as other partners. This framework provides a structure for using a One Health approach in zoonotic disease programs and can help build capacity for preventing and controlling zoonotic diseases at the local, sub-national, national, regional, or international level.” The urgency encapsulated in Boccioni’s notion of “a great synthesis of labor, light, and movement” is needed to drive this unified public health framework to prevent, prepare for, and respond to emerging zoonotic diseases.

Here we describe the cellular complexity of human alveolar and tracheobronchial air liquid interface (ALI) tissue models during SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Our results showed that both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV effectively infect these ALI tissues, with SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting a slower replication peaking at later time-points compared to IAV. We detected tissue-specific chemokine and cytokine storms in response to viral infection, including well-defined biomarkers in severe SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections such as CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-10. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed similar findings to that found in vivo for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including dampened IFN response, increased chemokine induction, and inhibition of MHC Class I presentation not observed for IAV infected tissues. Finally, we demonstrate the pharmacological validity of these ALI tissue models as antiviral drug screening assay platforms, with the potential to be easily adapted to include other cell types and increase the throughput to test relevant pathogens.

Two years after the initial discovery of the novel SARS-CoV-21,2, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a public health problem. While global vaccination efforts are being implemented, they are challenged by the emergence of new viral variants of concern (VoC) that can potentially escape immunity3,4,5,6. Due to immune escape as well as the potential for newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 VoC, and in spite of recent FDA drug approvals and emergency use authorizations for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs7,8,9, there remains a critical need to develop effective drug treatments10.Several established cell lines permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro are used for high-throughput antiviral drug screening (HTS), including the African green monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, human hepatoma Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells, colon carcinoma Caco2 cells, lung adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cells, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) overexpressing adenocarcinoma A549 cells, HEK293T cells, and several other non-human cell lines4,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. While these cell lines are important tools for viral research, there is now evidence that many of the antiviral drug activities discovered are limited to the cells used for screening. For example, while hydroxychloroquine potently blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 and Huh7 cells4,19, it is inactive in human Calu-3 lung cells12,20, and in both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in either rhesus macaque or golden Syrian hamster models21,22,23. Indeed, hydroxychloroquine is also ineffective in randomized COVID-19 human clinical trials24,25. Animal models have been developed for pre-clinical drug development of COVID-19, but the low-throughput of high biocontainment in vivo models limits their use for drug screening. There remains therefore a critical need for in vitro pre-clinical assays that are highly predictive of clinical drug efficacy, which can be used to prioritize compound selection for animal testing.Air-liquid interface (ALI) lung tissues provide a bridge between cultured cell lines and animal models26,27,28,29,30,31,32. In addition to more closely replicating the physiological environment of the human lung epithelium, ALI tissues support the replication of human coronaviruses (HCoV) with limited host cell range, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC4331,33,34,35,36. To address the current shortcomings of traditional antiviral screening models, we investigated the use and predictive efficacy of commercially available ALI tissues modeling two regions of the lower respiratory tract – the tracheobronchial region and the alveolar region – in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Here we demonstrate that both ALI tissues are susceptible to viral infection, with SARS-CoV-2 showing a slower replication rate compared to IAV, mimicking human infection. Further, using phenotypic and genotypic approaches we defined the top modulated pathways involved in induction of tissue-specific cytokine and chemokines in both ALI tissues in response to SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections.We further demonstrated the pharmacological validity of these ALI tissue models as in vitro antiviral drug screening platforms using viral protein immunostaining fluorescence imaging assays, viral RNA quantification, and live virus titration. Importantly, we showed that the in vitro ALI tissues faithfully recapitulated antiviral effects of remdesivir and the lack of antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine, further supporting the use of ALI tissues for antiviral drug validations.ResultsLung epithelial cell expression of known SARS-CoV-2 host entry co-factors in human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissuesWe first assessed that the ALI tissues (which defines both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues in text) had differentiated lung epithelial cells by immunofluorescence and scRNAseq. The ALI tracheobronchial tissues are comprised of ciliated cells (α-tubulin+), goblet or secretory cells (MUC5AC+), and basal cells (KRT5+), as shown in Fig. 1a and c37,38. ALI alveolar tissues are comprised of lung epithelial alveolar type I (AQP5+, not shown) and type II cells (SP-B+), pulmonary fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Fig. 1b, d). Next, we investigated the expression of putative SARS-CoV-2 and IAV cellular receptors39,40,41,42 in the ALI tissues by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Table 1). This included ACE2, a known host entry factor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-240,43 highly expressed in alveolar type II cells (ATII) and also at lower levels in ciliated cells and goblet cells37,38,44, as well as Type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS240,45,46,47,48, and transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP-1)41,42. ACE2 was expressed in the apical epithelium of both tracheobronchial (Fig. 1a, top row) and alveolar ALI tissues (Fig. 1b, top row). We also observed robust TMPRSS2 and NRP-1 expression in both tissues (Fig. 1a, b, second and third rows). In addition, we observed positive co-staining of ACE2, TMPRSS2, or NRP-1 with α-tubulin+ ciliated and MUC5AC + goblet cells in tracheobronchial ALI tissues (Fig. 1a), and SP-B+ cells in alveolar ALI tissues (Fig. 1b). A small fraction of cells that were SP-B negative also expressed SARS-CoV-2 entry cofactors. The scRNAseq analysis of dissociated tissue cultures confirmed the existence of these major cell types in these ALI tissues (Fig. 1c, d). Major cell type groupings, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used for the cell type grouping, and number of cells identified per cell ID can be found in Supplementary Table 2.Fig. 1: Apical expression patterns of known SARS-CoV-2 entry co-factors in tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents.Post-day 21 tissues were stained with antibodies targeting ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP-1, as well as tissue-specific markers. a Representative stained images of tracheobronchial ALI tissues with Hoechst (nuclei marker, blue), MUC5AC (goblet cell marker, white) α -tubulin (ciliated cell marker, green), and ACE2 (top panel, red), TMPRSS2 (middle panel, red) or NRP-1 (bottom panel, red). The overlay image represents the maximum intensity projection of stained markers. The y/z plane cross section taken from the highlighted portion shows the selective apical expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP-1. b Representative stained images of alveolar ALI tissues with Hoechst (nuclei marker, blue), phalloidin (f-actin, white), surfactant protein B (SP-B, ATII/pneumonocyte type II cell marker, green) and co-stained with ACE2 (top panel, red), TMPRSS2 (middle panel, red) or NRP-1 (bottom panel, red). The overlay image represents the maximum intensity projection of stained markers and a y/z plane cross section from the highlighted portion shows the selective apical expression of hACE2, TMPRSS2, or NRP-1 in the tissues, contrasted to phalloidin, which is present throughout the tissue cross-section.

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection plots (UMAP plots) of scRNAseq data of dissociated (c) tracheobronchial or (d) alveolar ALI tissues.Full size imageHuman tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues support productive SARS-CoV-2 or IAV infectionWe next determined whether SARS-CoV-2 and/or IAV can infect human alveolar and tracheobronchial ALI tissues by immunofluorescence and scRNAseq. In IAV-exposed tracheobronchial ALI tissues, we observed viral antigen presence within multiple cell types at 24 h post-infection (hpi), with basal cells (KRT5+) being the dominant infected cell type, followed by ciliated cells (α-tubulin+) and goblet cells (MUC5AC+) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1). Correspondingly, scRNA-seq data showed the highest IAV PR8 transcript levels at 48 hpi in basal cells (basal2 cells, 12.606 avg. expression), followed by ciliated cells (1.3226 avg. expression) and goblet cells (0.133523 avg. expression) (Fig. 2c). In SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial ALI tissues, we observed co-staining of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen with both ciliated (α-tubulin+) and goblet cells (MUC5B) 36 hpi (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 1), in agreement with the location of known SARS-CoV-2 host entry co-factors. We observed detectable (>0.1 average) expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral transcripts in every identified cell type; however, as expected based on antigen staining data, we observed high viral transcript levels in ciliated cells (avg. expression 5.108450), as well as in goblet cells (avg. expression 2.308571), and a subtype of basal cell (Basal4, avg. expression 2.102564) (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, we also identified a small population of a subgroup of suprabasal cells (SupraBC-Club3) that had remarkably high SARS-CoV-2 transcript levels (average expression 72.772950) (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2: IAV and SARS-CoV-2 productively infect tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents.Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were infected with IAV strains pH1N1 or PR8 (1x10e5 TCID50 units), or SARS-CoV-2 (1x10e5 TCID50 units), (n = 3). Infected tissues were fixed at 24 hpi for IAV inoculated tissue, 36 hpi for SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tracheobronchial ALI tissue, or 144 hpi for SARS-CoV-2 inoculated alveolar ALI tissue and stained with antibodies against selected cell markers and virus antigens as indicated: a Tracheobronchial ALI tissues were stained with anti-(IAV) NP (green, top three panels) or anti-SARS-CoV-2 (monoclonal antibody cocktail targeting S and N proteins, green, bottom two panels), anti-α-tubulin (ciliated cell marker, red), anti-MUC5AC or MUC5B (goblet cell markers, white), and anti-keratin 5 (basal cell marker, magenta). b Alveolar tissues were stained with anti-(IAV) NP (green top three panels) or anti-SARS-CoV-2 (green, bottom two panels) as the marker of infected cells as well as anti-surfactant protein B (SP-B, ATII cell marker, red), phalloidin (F-actin, general cell marker, white). Scale bar is 100 μm and 200 μm in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues, respectively. Viral gene expression levels, expressed as log transform mean expression, in identified cell subpopulation types within the human (c) tracheobronchial or (d) alveolar ALI tissues after 48 h of infection with PR8-IAV (left column), or after 72 h of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (right column). Identified viral genes per cell type were averaged and plotted as average log mean expression.Full size imageIn alveolar ALI tissues, the majority of cells infected by IAV or SARS-CoV-2 were positive for SP-B (Fig. 2b). In agreement, scRNAseq analysis revealed the highest IAV or SARS-CoV-2 transcript expression level in ATII cells (Fig. 2d. IAV: ATII 1 and ATII 2, avg. viral gene expression 11.214 and 7.863, correspondingly; SARS-CoV-2 ATII 1, avg. viral gene expression 6.683), indicating primary infection of ATII cells, although another SP-B negative cell subpopulation was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 N antigen (Fig. 2b). We also detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in endothelial cells in the ALI alveolar tissues (Fig. 2d; 1.188 avg. expression); however, we were unable to detect cells co-positive for the endothelial cell marker CD31 and SARS-CoV-2 N antigen at this time point. We also used module-scoring analysis, which subtracts the aggregated expression of randomly selected control feature sets from the average expression level of viral gene clusters on the single cell level, which confirmed dominantly infected cell types (Supplementary Fig. 2).Human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues exhibit slower viral infection kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 compared to IAVUnlike IAV, which has a relatively short clinical incubation period of 1.5-2 days, SARS-CoV-2 has an average incubation period of 5.5 days after initial infection49. In agreement with this clinical observation, our data indicate that the number of IAV PR8 infected cells in both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues rapidly spiked at 24 hpi, followed by a gradual decline in both infected cells (Fig. 3a, b) and in secreted virus (Fig. 3c), in agreement with the robust and rapid replication described in the human host. Infection with IAV pH1N1 (MOI 0.1) resulted in the highest staining of IAV antigen at 48 hpi in both ALI tissues (Fig. 3a, b), followed by a decline in infectious virion production by 144 hpi (Fig. 3c). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 replication in both tissues was slower and of less magnitude when compared to IAV (Fig. 3c), and in agreement with a longer incubation period in humans. Indeed, the number of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen positive cells in both ALI tissues was low at early time points but continued to increase steadily over time in infected ALI tissues independently of the MOI used (0.1 to 1), with tracheobronchial ALI tissues exhibiting peak infection at 72 hpi (Fig. 3a) and alveolar ALI tissues at the latest time point tested (144 hpi) (Fig. 3b). Correspondingly, infectious virion production from SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar ALI tissues peaked at 144 hpi (Fig. 3c). In tracheobronchial ALI tissues, viral production was also dose-dependent, although infection with higher MOIs (3 and 10) resulted in a higher virion production at 24 hpi, followed by a decline at later time points, which may be due to cell death as a result of an initially high viral exposure (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, alveolar ALI tissues seemed to be more susceptible to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection than tracheobronchial ALI tissues, as evidenced by the higher number of infected cells (Fig. 3b) and viral titers (Fig. 3c). Cellular markers for each time-point are shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Thus, both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect lung ALI tissues, though with different kinetics that may contribute to their different clinical incubation periods.Fig. 3: IAV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit different infection kinetics in tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents.Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were infected with IAV pH1N1 or PR8 at approx. MOI of 0.1, and SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of 1 (fixed tissue samples shown) or as indicated in titer plots. Apical washes were collected and tissues fixed at 24, 48, 72 and 144 hpi. a Tracheobronchial and (b) alveolar ALI tissues were stained with anti-(IAV) NP and anti-SARS-CoV-2 to label infected cells (shown in green) as well as the nuclear dye Hoechst (blue). c Production of infectious virus from the apical chamber of tracheobronchial or alveolar ALI tissues after exposure to pH1N1 (MOI of ~0.1), PR8 (MOI of ~0.1), or SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of ~0.1 and ~1 for alveolar tissues; MOIs of ~0.1, ~1, ~3, and ~10 for tracheobronchial tissues) at 24, 48, 72, or 144 hpi. IAV titers were measured using a focus forming unit assay on LLC-MMK2 SIAT1 cells, SARS-CoV-2 was measured using plaque assay on Vero E6 cells and expressed as total FFU (IAV) or PFU (SARS-CoV-2)issue. Scale bar is 100 μm and 200 μm in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues, respectively. Data are represented as M ± SD for a minimum of n = 3 independent experiments/biological replicates except for the data from SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial tissues at 144 hpi MOI = 3 and MOI = 10 that has n = 1.Full size imageAdditionally, to investigate whether we could replicate differences in infectivity and viral production observed in vitro and in vivo between SARS-CoV-2 variants50,51,52, we infected tracheobronchial or alveolar ALI tissue with an approximate MOI of 0.2-0.4 (2 × 105 PFUissue) and then stained fixed tissues for detection of SARS-CoV-2 NP or measured viral production at various time points post-infection. We observed increasing viral NP antigen (Fig. 4a) as well as increased viral production (Fig. 4b) after infection with different VoC, including B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, compared to the WA-1 variant at 72 hpi or 96 hpi in tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues. Results also showed similar cellular tropism by the viral variants studied (Fig. 4c, d).Fig. 4: Infection of alveolar and tracheobronchial ALI tissues with SARS-CoV-2 VoC exhibit enhanced infection.Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were infected with each SARS-CoV-2 VoC at 2×105PFUissue. Apical washes were collected at 72, 96, and 144 hpi and tissues fixed at 72 hpi (tracheobronchial) or 96 hpi (alveolar). a Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 to label infected cells (shown in green) as well as anti-tubulin (red) and anti-MUC5B (white), or anti-SP-B (red) and the nuclear dye Hoechst (blue). Scale bar is 100 μm. b Production of infectious virus from the apical chamber of tracheobronchial or alveolar ALI tissues after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at 72 hpi. SARS-CoV-2 was measured using TCID50 assay on Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, and expressed as total TCID50issue. The 63x confocal images of cryosectioned (10 μm thickness) SARS-CoV-2 VoC infected tracheobronchial (c) or alveolar (d) tissue slices stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 to label infected cells (shown in green) as well as (c) anti-tubulin (red) and anti-MUC5B (white), or (d) anti-SP-B (red) and the nuclear dye Hoechst (blue). Data are represented as M ± SD for a minimum of n = 3 independent experiments/biological replicates. Scale bar is 50 μm.Full size imageHuman tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues exhibit distinct transcriptomic profiles in response to IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infectionWe next sought to elucidate cell-specific and tissue-wide transcriptomic responses to viral infection in the context of the two lower respiratory tract ALI tissue models. To do this, we analyzed single cell gene expression shifts by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection plots (UMAP). Interestingly, while we observed a dramatic, tissue-wide shift in the number of cells in each of the cell type populations for IAV infected tracheobronchial ALI tissues as well as alveolar ALI tissues (Fig. 5a, b, top panels), regardless of actual individual cell infection status, we observed a much more subtle shifts in each cell type in SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues (Fig. 5a, b bottom panels). Volcano plots indicate major (log2fc = 0.7, p value threshold <0.05) gene expression shifts in both ALI tissues (mock infected vs. 48 hpi PR8-IAV or 72 hpi SARS-CoV-2 infected) (Supplementary Fig. 4). Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), an ubiquitin-like protein that plays a multifaceted role in viral infections and viral induced inflammation, was among the most strongly upregulated in all four tested conditions53,54. Of the top 20 upregulated genes upon viral infection (IAV or SARS-CoV2), in both ALI tissues, 11/20 genes were shared (IFI27, ISG15, IFI6, IFIT1, BST2, IFIT2, IFIT3, CXCL10, MX1, OAS1, and IFI44L), with a primary function as defense response to viral infection (DAVID Analysis, GOTERM_BP_DIRECT, GO:0051607: defense response to virus, 10/11 genes, p value 2.9e-17). DEG analysis revealed a higher number of modulated genes in IAV infected ALI tissues (477 and 838 total DEGs in tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, respectively) compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected ALI tissues (76 and 370 total DEGs in tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, respectively). (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary Data 1, tabs 1 and 2). In general, alveolar ALI tissues showed a higher number of DEGs after infection with both viruses.Fig. 5: ScRNAseq UMAP plots of IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infected lung ALI tissues.Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were infected with PR8 IAV (1e5 TCID50 unitsissue, n = 2) for 48 h or SARS-CoV-2 (2e5 PFUissue, n = 2) for 72 h prior to dissociation for scRNAseq. Shown here are UMAP plots of: (a) Tracheobronchial tissues infected with mock media or PR8 IAV for 48 h (top, green), or with mock media or SARS-CoV-2 for 72 h (bottom, purple). b Alveolar tissues infected with mock media or PR8 IAV for 48 h (top, green), or with mock media or SARS-CoV-2 for 72 h (bottom, purple). Venn diagrams showing viral and tissue unique or shared genes with Log2FC values (c) >0.264 or (d) <-0.264 over mock in IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infected airway and alveolar tissues.Full size imageWe observed 60 upregulated genes common to both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, while no shared downregulated genes were observed across both ALI tissues and/or viruses (Fig. 5c, d, Supplementary Data 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed general shared antiviral responses, including upregulated cytokine mediated signaling pathway (GO:0019221), defense response to virus (GO: 0051607), innate immune response (GO:0045087) and the IFN-γ mediated signaling pathway (GO:0060333), part of the top ten enriched pathways in the both tissue types in response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Data 2). Other pathways upregulated in some of the tissues and/or viral infections are adaptive immune responses, cytokine production, response to type I IFN and inflammatory responses. Downregulated pathways include oxidative phosphorylation, cytosolic ribosome and cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrial organization and microtubule movement, among others (Fig. 6a).Fig. 6: Pathway enrichments per ALI tissue per virus.a Heatmap of top 10 up- (red) or down-regulated (blue) pathways by GSEA, expressed as -log10 adjusted p value; (b) heatmap of top 20 differentially regulated pathways between the four conditions by Enrichr analysis, expressed as -log10 adjusted p value.Full size imageWe next compared our four conditions (IAV vs. SARS-CoV-2 in tracheobronchial vs. alveolar ALI tissues) and looked at divergent gene pathway analysis by Enrichr analysis using an absolute log2fc of 0.264 as a cut-off (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Figs. 5–7). Interestingly, MHC protein binding and peptide antigen presentation pathways, both critical for T-cell responses to viral infections55, were highly enriched in IAV infected tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, but mostly downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected ALI tissues (Fig. 6b). For Enrichr identified pathways, we mapped both tissue wide (Supplementary Figs. 6–7) and responding cells by cell identity type and infection status to pathway enrichment in the infected ALI tissues. In general, while we observed differential responses between cell types, both infected and non-infected cells in the virus exposed ALI tissue responded similarly if identified as a similar cell type. Future work will further characterize cell-type specific responses and the role of cell-cell signaling in the viral disease state of each ALI tissue.Human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues exhibit distinct inflammatory cytokine profiles in response to IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infectionTo determine this tissue-specific inflammatory response, we measured secreted proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infected ALI tissues, as well as determined cytokine/chemokine production by specific cell types by scRNAseq of single time point of infection.Tissues infected with IAV showed an earlier and stronger immune response. Chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 was significantly increased in both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues infected with either pH1N1 or PR8 IAV strains, showing an early and robust response (Fig. 7) that correlated with maximum viral production (Fig. 3c). CXCL10/IP-10 was highly expressed in SupraBC-Club, cycling basal and ciliated cells (tracheobronchial ALI tissue) and ATI and ATII cells (alveolar ALI tissue) (Supplementary Fig. 9). Chemokine production after SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be mostly restricted to tracheobronchial ALI tissues, with significantly higher protein production at either early (CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL3/MIP-1α) or later (CXCL-8/IL-8 and CXCL-10/IP-10, both produced mostly by SupraBC-Club and basal cells, Supplementary Fig. 9) time points (Fig. 7a). CXCL-10/IP-10 was the only chemokine induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar ALI tissues (Fig. 7a), correlated with increased infectious viral particles at later time points (Fig. 3c). Elevated chemokine levels observed are in agreement with the chemokine storm observed in severe human COVID-19 cases and different SARS-CoV-2 experimental models56,57, where the role of CXCL-10 has been particularly highlighted in COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as well as in severe influenza58.Fig. 7: Alveolar and tracheobronchial ALI tissues produce tissue-specific chemokines and cytokines in response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.Basal compartment media were collected from tracheobronchial (left two panels) or alveolar (right two panels) ALI tissues at indicated time-points and analyzed for cytokine and chemokine secretion by a custom Luminex assay: (a) Chemokines (CXCL10/IP-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, IL-8); (b) Interferons (IFN-α and IFN-γ); and (c) Other cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-1RA). IAV infected tissues (MOI of ~0.1) are represented in shades of teal, where light teal shows infection with the IAV pH1N1 strain and dark teal shows infection with the IAV PR8 strain, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues are represented in shades of purple, with progressing color from low MOI (~1) to high MOI (~10). All measurements on y axis are in pg/ml. Data are represented as M ± SEM for a minimum of n = 3 independent experiments and/or biological replicates except for the data from SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial tissues at 144 hpi MOI = 10 that has n = 1 and the SARS-CoV-2 set matched Mock alveolar tissues at 72hpi that has n = 2; Student t test of IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues vs. uninfected controls at each timepoint: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.00005.Full size imageWe next examined Th1, Th2, and Th17 immune responses, including type I (IFN-α and IFN-β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III (IFN-λ) interferons. We observed a modest but significant type I (IFN-α) and II (IFN-γ) interferon response in some of the IAV (alveolar and tracheobronchial ALI tissues) and SARS-CoV-2 (tracheobronchial ALI tissue) infected ALI tissues compared to the uninfected controls (Fig. 7b). IFN-β was either not significant (IAV infected ALI tissues) or not detected (SARS-CoV-2 infected ALI tissues), and IL-28A/IFN- λ2 protein levels were also below the limit of detection.In addition, several Th1 (TNF-α, TNF-β), Th2 (IL-18), and Th17 (IL-17) markers were significantly elevated or trended upwards in at least one IAV infected ALI tissue compared to uninfected controls (Supplementary Fig. 8), demonstrating a modest but sustained inflammatory response to influenza, especially in the alveolar ALI tissue. The cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was mostly observed in tracheobronchial ALI tissues (Supplementary Fig. 8). Only TNF-α and IL-18 (Supplementary Fig. 8), the latter produced by different cell types (Supplementary Fig. 9), showed moderate but significant increased levels in alveolar ALI tissues after 72 hpi, in correlation with maximum viral production (Fig. 3c). IL-1β was not detected during SARS-CoV-2 infection.We also measured secreted IL-6, associated with the acute inflammatory response in COVID-19 and influenza, as well as the increased production of anti-inflammatory IL-10, which maintains immune homeostasis59,60,61,62. The presence and ratio of IL-6 and IL-10 may be used as predictors of COVID-19 disease severity. IL-6 was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial ALI tissues at early time points, but only showed an increased trend in IAV infected alveolar ALI tissues. However, IL-10 was higher in both ALI tissues infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (starting at 48 hpi) or IAV (at all time points) (Fig. 7c). In addition, anti-inflammatory IL-1RA (Fig. 7c) was significantly higher at some time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (expressed by IL-1RN gene in SupraBC-Club and basal cells in tracheobronchial ALI tissues, and ATI and ATII cells in alveolar ALI tissues, Supplementary Fig. 9).Lastly, we observed some increased production of other immune markers such as G-CSF (neutrophil development and function), EN-RAGE/S100A12 (migration and recruitment of leukocytes), IL-7, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in response to IAV and/or SARS-CoV-2 up to 72 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 8). These have been found elevated in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients63,64, and are correlated with COVID-19 disease severity. A dot map of the log2fc of other detected chemokine/cytokine genes for each cell type identified by scRNAseq in the tracheobronchial or alveolar ALI tissues before and after infection is presented in Supplementary Fig. 8.Validation of antiviral drugs in lung tissue equivalentsTo evaluate the ability of these physiological relevant ALI tissues to measure antiviral drug activity, we tested a panel of antiviral drugs on either tracheobronchial or alveolar cultures for antiviral activity. We first tested remdesivir, which is granted for emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients65, and type I interferon (IFN-β) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. As expected, both remdesivir and IFN-β robustly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection as seen by qRT-PCR and direct SARS-CoV-2 antigen staining in the tracheobronchial ALI tissues (Fig. 8, Supplementary Fig. 10). Furthermore, we tested two other compounds: cyclosporine, previously identified in a high-throughput screen with anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in both human hepatoma (Huh7.5 cells) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) in a monolayer cell-based model12, as well as hydroxychloroquine. Neither cyclosporine nor hydroxychloroquine reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tracheobronchial lung model (10 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M, Fig. 8a, bottom two rows, Fig. 8c, Supplementary Fig. 10a, c). Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine failed to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral production in the alveolar model (10 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M, Supplementary Fig. 10d). However, when we tested camostat, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, and nelfinavir, an anti-retroviral, currently being tested in clinical trials40,66,67,68,69, both reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tracheobronchial ALI tissue (Fig. 8a, c, Supplementary Fig. 10a, 10 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M) and alveolar ALI tissues (Supplementary Fig. 10b, 10 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M).Fig. 8: Tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents predictively measure antiviral compound response in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections.Selected compounds were added to the basal media chamber (10 μM final concentration) of the tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues for 1 h and then infected with IAV PR8 (MOI of 0.1), and SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.1). IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues were fixed for 24 and 36 hpi, respectively, and stained with antibodies against selected cell markers and viral specific antigens. a, b Tracheobronchial ALI tissues were stained with anti-α-tubulin (ciliated cell marker, white), anti-MUC5AC or anti-MUC5B (goblet cell marker, red), along with anti-N protein (green, right five panels) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 (monoclonal antibody cocktail targeting S and N proteins, green) as the marker of infected cells Scale bar is 100 μm. Image-based quantification of infected cells in compound treated and subsequent (c) SARS-CoV-2 or (d) IAV infected tracheobronchial ALI tissues. Data are represented as M ± SD for a minimum of n = 3 independent experiments and/or biological replicates except for the data from Remdesivir treated IAV infected tissues that has n = 2; Student t test of IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues vs. uninfected controls at each timepoint: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.00005.Full size imageWe next tested whether anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds remdesivir and nelfinavir would also reduce IAV infection in the tracheobronchial (Fig. 8b) or alveolar (Supplementary Fig. 11) ALI tissues. Neither remdesivir nor nelfinavir reduced IAV antigen staining in these tissues. However, clinically approved anti-IAV compounds zanamivir and oseltamivir, as well as the reported anti-IAV drug salinomycin, did inhibit IAV infection using a single dose approach in the tracheobronchial (Fig. 8b, d) ALI tissues at 10 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M. Overall, these findings validate the use of ALI tissues for studying the efficacy of anti-viral drugs.DiscussionWe have shown that both primary human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues in a transwell plate format are relevant 3D in vitro models for studying multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections, in addition to being a valuable platform for antiviral drug testing. We chose to investigate two distinct LRT models, representing the distal airway (tracheobronchial) and proximal airway (alveolar). The tracheobronchial region of the airway is made of a pseudostratified epithelium comprised of ciliated, goblet, columnar club, and basal cells, whereas the alveolar region is comprised of squamous alveolar type I cells and cuboidal alveolar type II cells70. Whereas mucus secretion and mucociliary clearance occurs in the proximal airway, gas exchange primarily occurs in alveoli. Progression of infection from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract, and from the distal to the proximal lung is necessary for both severe COVID-19 and influenza disease. Samples taken from patients with fatal COVID-19 have shown infection in ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, ATIIs, goblet cells, club-like cells, and endothelial cells71,72,73. Similarly, we saw SARS-CoV-2 infection peaking at 3-6 dpi, of both ciliated (α-tubulin+) and goblet (MUC5AC+) cell populations in the tracheobronchial ALI tissues, as well as ATs in the alveolar ALI tissues. We also observed robust SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infectious viral production in both ALI tissues, although apical washes collected from alveolar ALI tissues exhibited slightly higher SARS-CoV-2 titers than tracheobronchial ALI tissues (Fig. 3). In contrast, a previously reported lung-on-chip model, consisting of primary human ATs and human lung microvascular endothelial cells, did not find productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 in ATs74. This may be due to differences in receptor expression in patient cells used for each study, including the absence of ACE2 expression in ATs in the lung-on-chip model compared to robust hACE2 expression in the alveolar ALI tissues in our study. While we did not observe SARS-CoV-2 N antigen in endothelial cells in our alveolar ALI tissue study, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in endothelial cells. In this regard, future studies will need to look at viral infection from different patient-derived epithelial cells and over an extended period to characterize further the full infection dynamics in the tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, in addition to direct exposure of lung endothelial cells to SARS-CoV-2.Comparison of the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 putative receptors confirmed the low levels of expression of hACE2 (~1% of cells) which has been seen in human lung transcriptomics analysis75, which is in contrast with a robust detection hACE2 protein by antibody-based detection. Differences may be explained by long half-lifetime of proteins in the cellular membrane. Detection of viral transcripts in the cells of infected tissues highlighted infectivity that corresponded to that seen in histological samples for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, while we observed shared activation of certain cellular antiviral responses for both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 by scRNA-seq, including inflammatory and interferon-related anti-viral responses upregulated for both viruses and tissues similar to previous reports76, the intensity of the response, as measured by relative gene expression, differed between viruses and tissues, with IAV infection generally correlated with a stronger induction of antiviral related genes at 48 hpi, compared to the 72 hpi time point investigated for SARS-CoV-2. We observed select biological processes like antigen presentation, RAGE pathway activation, and downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis that were differentially modulated by these two viruses. A recent study which utilized RNAseq revealed that MHC class I genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 human nasopharyngeal samples77. Similarly, we observed a significant downregulation of peptide antigen presentation pathway in the ALI airway tissues after infection with SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to an upregulation of peptide antigen presentation related genes and MHC Class I genes in IAV infected airway and alveolar tissues. The difference in antiviral response at the tested timepoints as well as the differential induction of pathways may explain different clinical pathological outcomes caused by the two viral infections.Circulating chemokines, interferons, interleukins, growth factors and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are the main molecules involved in the development of the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 severity. In particular, high levels of IL-6 and TNF are strongly associated with increased mortality, and elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1RA have also been correlated with disease severity and fatal outcome1,59,60,78,79,80. However, circulating cytokines observed in serum may not represent local tissue cytokine levels, which may be key potentiators of the systemic hyperinflammatory response. In this regard, there have been extensive investigation into immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of COVID-1981. In agreement with previous COVID-19 reports, we did find a significant induction of IP-10/CXCL10 levels in both tracheobronchial and alveolar SARS-CoV-2 infected ALI tissues (up to 25-fold increase in alveolar ALI tissues compared to uninfected controls), as well as other important chemokines and growth factors (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CXCL-8/IL-8, G-CSF) that were elevated in tracheobronchial ALI tissues. Interferon (IFN-α and IFN-γ) and Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokine responses were only moderate but significant, and mostly restricted to tracheobronchial ALI tissues. It included pro-inflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-α), and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and IL-1RA) immune modulators, known to have key roles in the pathogenesis associated to COVID-19 disease1,59,60,78,79. The cytokine induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be tissue-dependent in our ALI models. Interestingly, even though alveolar ALI tissues had a more robust infection compared to tracheobronchial ALI tissues (as shown by the higher viral loads reported in Fig. 3), the cytokine and chemokine production was not as strong when compared to the overall response observed in tracheobronchial ALI tissues. Still, both ALI tissues had an overall immune response that corresponded with the infection dynamics, with alveolar ALI tissues showing slight increases in some cytokines at later time points (72 to 144 hpi) compared to earlier responses (24 to 72 hpi) in the tracheobronchial ALI tissues. In addition, scRNAseq analysis confirmed a suppressed IFN mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in both tissues compared to IAV infection, while maintaining an increased chemokine induction. We also observed an inhibition of MHC Class I related peptide presentation in SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues, but not in IAV infected tissues, both supported by previous reports76,77.A major limitation of these models is that we were only able to study the local epithelial-driven response by itself, without the contribution of myeloid cells or lymphocytes, which are important in mounting an appropriate innate immune response against viral infections. Still, we observed that both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues are capable of mounting a local epithelial-driven response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. In addition, the tracheobronchial ALI tissues did not contain pulmonary endothelial cells or pulmonary fibroblasts, unlike the alveolar ALI tissues however, we were able to map the cellular contributions by single cell sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 9). Future work will investigate the cross-talk between these cell types in initiating the epithelial response. Although myeloid cells were not included in this model, we hypothesize that the addition of the myeloid compartment in both tissues will show a more pronounced immune response that may reflect more accurately the different stages of human COVID-19 and severe influenza disease progression. Future studies will address the contribution of the lung epithelium and its role in recruiting additional inflammatory immune cells.While there have been intense high-throughput screening efforts to discover potential antivirals for SARS-CoV-2, relatively few compounds have proven to be effective in clinical settings. Most of the studies published have relied on traditional mono-cellular tissue culture models, which do not allow crosstalk among different cell populations. In some cases, relying on in vitro activity profiles may prove detrimental. This is the case for hydroxychloroquine, initially shown to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro, but later proven ineffective at reducing COVID-19 patient outcome or hospitalization stay24,25. Interestingly, hydroxychloroquine failed to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in our in vitro ALI tissue equivalents, indicating that these 3D models might mimic better human tissue responses than other in vitro systems.A primary human cell-based lung ALI tissue model may be a promising platform for newly emerged viral pathogens. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2/WA/2020, there have been seven lineages of variants identified as VoC, including Alpha (B.1.1.7 and Q lineages), Beta (B.1.351 and descendent lineages), Gamma (P.1 and descendent lineages), Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429), Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages) and Omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA lineages) in the USA. All but Delta and Omicron are categorized as Variants Being Monitored (VBM). It is reported that emerging variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 exhibit enhanced infectivity and viral production in vivo, which has also been confirmed in in vitro cell culture studies56,57,58. We observed similar trends in the ALI tissue cultures. While these models cannot replace critical small animal models for viral research, they may be an important tool for rapid investigation of new viral variants, and can be used as an accessible and physiologically relevant human-based platform on which to prioritize compound selection for animal testing and further pre-clinical evaluation. Also, these models can readily be deployed and utilized in laboratories that do not specialize in animal models, do not require pharmacokinetics studies to be carried out prior to antiviral evaluation, and can be miniaturized to 96 well format and scaled up to include dose-response testing. Indeed, in both the tracheobronchial and the alveolar ALI models, we were able to demonstrate robust antiviral activity of known anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound remdesivir, while also excluding hit compounds from 2D monolayer culture systems. Although we observed similar antiviral activity in both models, it is possible that host targeting antivirals may have different efficacy in the different tissue types. It is also worth noting that viral infection read-out in these tissues requires a whole tissue approach such as RNA quantification, viral titer, or staining and imaging of the entire tissue rather than select areas, due to cellular heterogeneity in the tissues, especially in the tracheobronchial tissues (i.e., patches of high alpha-tubulin regions rather than uniform throughout entire tissue). Whether ALI tissue models can provide more accurate results regarding their efficacy in vivo requires to be further evaluated and must be taken into consideration with a compound’s pharmacokinetic properties.Several other ALI tissue models are described within the last year to assess both IAV and CoV infectivity, including SARS-CoV-2, each with advantages and limitations. Transwell-based URT and LRT ALI models have been shown to be a platform for antiviral drug discovery and support the replication of human coronaviruses (HCoV) with limited host cell range including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC4326,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90. Small airway and alveolar lung-on-chip models have been published or reported in pre-prints, although many of the lung-on-chip systems are currently low throughput, not readily compatible with laboratory automation used in drug screening facilities, and in some cases chips are made of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS, thus limiting its use for drug testing31,83,84,91,92,93. The use of a transwell-based multi-well plate assay platform as described in our study enables a versatile and modular approach for the future biofabrication of tissue ALI models with tailored physiological complexity and disease relevance. As an example, we have reported the use of bioprinting technique to create a vascularized skin tissue94 and the same approach can be applied to recreate a vascularized lung ALI tissue model. Addition of non-lymphocyte immune cells has also been explored using transwell plates with biofabricated tissue equivalents95 which can be applied to the lung ALI assay systems to assess the participation of innate immune cells in infectivity and COVID-19 relevant immune responses.In summary, we have described the characterization of two distinct lower respiratory tract lung epithelial ALI tissue models for studying SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection in relation to complex tissue-related disease. We established differential transcriptomic and inflammatory profiles induced by tracheobronchial vs. alveolar ALI tissues in response to two pandemic respiratory viruses, the recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, including a variant of the 2009 pH1N1. In addition, using known and novel antivirals we demonstrated the pharmacological validity of these two models as antiviral drug screening assay platforms. This characterization will serve as the foundation to bio-fabricate lung ALI tissue models, which may include additional physiological features that are relevant for the infection of respiratory viruses and the disease that they cause.MethodsViral propagationVero E6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1586) and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-Glutamine. SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 viral stocks were generated as previously described12,57,96. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS + 10 mM HEPES buffer for 1 day prior to inoculation with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain (BEI resources, NR-52281) (GenBank MN985325.1) using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001), in order to generate an initial viral seed stock. At 72 hpi, tissue culture supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The virus stock obtained from BEI Resources was a passage 4 (P4) stock and was used to generate a master seed stock (P5, or P0’) and working stock (P6, or P1’). Viral stock titers were determined by standard plaque forming assay (PFU/ml) as described below. Only stocks passaged once after seed stock (P1’) were used for experiments. SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 used for comparison infection studies to SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B1.351, and Delta (B.1.617.2) were prepared by the SARS-CoV-2 Virology Core facility at NIAID. SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1. was obtained from BEI resources and expanded in Vero-TMPRSS2 cell lines as above. All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was carried out in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility following approved protocols.IAV H1N1 strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1) were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 11 days-old embryonated chicken eggs. At 48 hpi, allantoic fluid were collected and aliquots stored at −80 °C.Culturing of human 3D in vitro respiratory tissue modelsHuman tracheobronchial air liquid interface (ALI) cultures (“Epiairway”) and human alveolar ALI cultures (“Epialveolar”) were obtained from MatTek Life Sciences (MA, USA) and cultured according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Epiairway tissues were obtained at day 15 or day 21 post-seeding of primary donor lung cultures. Epiairway tissues obtained at day 15 post-seeding of primary donor lung cultures were further matured in-house in ALI interface for 7 days after receiving with 5 ml basolateral media changes every other day, with mucus washes (400 ml 1X PBS on apical side) every 3-4 days during maturation, prior to infection. Epialveolar tissues were obtained at day 21 post seeding of primary donor lung cultures and reconstituted overnight with 5 ml and 75 μl of Epialveolar media at the basal and apical sides of the tissue, respectively. Medium was changed after overnight recovery, prior to infection. Every other day, 5 ml basolateral media changes (and 75 μl apical media changes for Epialveolar tissues) were performed in both tissues for the duration of the experiments. For all SARS-CoV-2 infection kinetic studies, tissues were infected at day 23.Viral infection of lung tissue equivalents with SARS-CoV-2 or IAVTracheobronchial tissues were infected at day 21–30 of maturation to maximize matured ciliated cell populations at time of infection. Highest infection was observed when tissues were infected at day 27-28. Prior to viral inoculation, mucus was removed by washing twice the apical surface of tissues with 400 µl of TEER buffer (1X PBS with magnesium and calcium). Tissue inserts were inoculated with 1×105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (for 36 h time-points and antiviral drug screening) or MOI of 0.1 and 1 of IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 or A/California/04/2009) or MOI of 0.1, 1, 3, or 10 of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) for 1 h (IAV) or 1-4 h (SARS-CoV-2). Viral inoculum was removed and tissue inserts washed with PBS before continued culture. Inserts were cultured in ALI at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24–36 h for antiviral compound validation or 24, 48, 72, and 144 h for viral kinetics profiling, with basal media changes every other day. Alveolar tissues were infected between day 21-28 with either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV in the manner described above. Highest infection was observed when tissues were infected at day 27-28 for 1 h (Fig. 4b). Multiplicities of infection were calculated based on an average of 600,000 cellsissue insert for alveolar tissues, and 900,000-1e6 cellsissue insert for tracheobronchial tissues. No pre-infection apical washes were carried out for alveolar tissues. Basal media was replaced with fresh media every other day. In alveolar cultures, 75 μl of apical media was exchanged every other day. For both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, mock-infected controls were treated in an identical fashion to viral inoculated controls.Plaque assay or TCID50 assay for SARS-CoV-2 productionAt the corresponding time-points, secreted SARS-CoV-2 was captured by washing the apical tissue with 500 µl or 150 µl of pre-warmed tissue media (for tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, respectively). Plaque assay to determine viral loads of SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue culture supernatants was performed as previously described57,96.Briefly, Vero E6 monolayers in a 96-well plate format (4 × 104 cells/well, performed in duplicate) were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of collected apical supernatants in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 1% PSG). After viral adsorption (1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2), cells were washed with PBS and incubated in post-infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% PSG) containing 1% microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Plates were then inactivated in 10% neutral buffered formalin (ThermoFisher Scientific) for another 24 h prior to removal from the BSL3. For immunostaining, fixed monolayers were washed with PBS three times, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature (RT), and blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA in PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with a SARS-CoV N cross-reactive monoclonal antibody (MAb, at 1 µg/ml), 1C7C7, diluted in 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation with the primary MAb, cells were washed three times with PBS, and developed with the Vectastain ABC kit and DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector Laboratory, Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Viral counts were performed using the C.T.L. Immunospot v7.0.15.0 Professional Analysis DC and calculated as PFUsissue. For TCID50 assay, Vero-TMPRSS2 (BPS Bioscience) monolayers in a 96-well plate format (4 × 104 cells/well, performed in duplicate) were infected with 10-fold serial dilutions of collected apical supernatants in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Wells were then fixed with 4% PFA and stained with 1% crystal violet. TCID50 units were calculated using the Reed–Muench method.Focus forming unit (FFU) assay for IAVAt indicated time-points, secreted IAV was captured by washing the apical side of the tissues with 200 µl of 1X PBS. IAV titers produced from tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were measured by focus forming unit assay. Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cells LLC-MMK2, overexpressing SIAT1 were seeded 1 day prior in black, 96-well, clear bottom plate to reach a confluency of 95-100% at time of FFU assay. Apical washes containing secreted virus from lung tissue equivalents was diluted in 2% FBS containing EMEM media and used to inoculate LLC-MMK2-SIAT1 cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Viral inoculum was removed and replaced with an Avicel-media overlay and cells incubated at 37 C/5%CO2 for 48 h. After 48 h, the overlay was removed, cells washed twice with 1X PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with 1X PBS three times prior to immunostaining for IAV NP protein and counterstain with Hoechst. All plates were imaged on the InCell2200 and FFU quantified using Columbus Analysis software. All antibodies can be found in Supplementary Table 2.Drug treatmentsAll compounds were dissolved in DMSO unless otherwise specified. DMSO or compounds were diluted at indicated concentration directly into the basolateral media chamber of the tissue inserts for one hour prior to viral exposure and remained in the media for duration of experiment (24 h for IAV, 36 h to 72 h for SARS-CoV-2). Hydroxychloroquine was dissolved in water.Immunofluorescence staining and analysisTissue inserts were inactivated according to institute SOP. Tissue inserts were completely submerged in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for a minimum of 1.5 h or 30 min (if analyzed inside the BSL3) in 12- or 24-well plates (for EpiAlveolar and Epiairway tissues, respectively) before removal of PFA and washing with PBS three times. SARS-CoV-2 tissue inserts processed at the NIH were completely submerged in 10% NBF for a minimum of 72 hours to inactivate virus. Tissues were permeabilized in a 0.3–0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS solution for 15 min, followed by blocking in PBTG (1% BSA + 5% goat serum + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min to 1 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then stained directly in inserts or removed from inserts using a scalpel and stained whole or as cut into four equal quarters. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBTG (see Supplementary Table 2) and incubated at 4 °C overnight or for 1 h at 37 °C. Secondary antibodies were also diluted in PBTG (1% BSA + 5% goat serum + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated for 2 h at RT or 1 h at 37 °C followed by three washes with 1X PBS. Hoechst or DAPI were used to stain DNA (nuclei) of tissues infected with IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Tissues were imaged in the transwell insert or mounted in glass-bottom plates in an automated high content confocal microscope (Opera Phenix, Perkin Elmer) or using the Cytation 5 cell imaging multi-mode reader (Biotek) at ×4 magnification, WFOV mode with laser autofocus; whole well images were acquired and analyzed using Gen 5 v3.8.01 software.qRT-PCR for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNATotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNA Clean & Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research). 1 µg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit with Random Primers (Invitrogen). Gene specific primers targeting 18 S RNA (forward:AACCCGTTGAACCCCATT, reverse:CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG) or the SARS-CoV-2 N gene (forward: TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA, reverse: GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used to amplify cellular RNA and viral RNA by QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 N gene was calculated using the standard curve method and normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA as an internal control.Tissue dissociation and scRNAseq and data processingTissues were infected with 1 × 105 TCID50 units PR8 H1N1 IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) for 48 h or of 1xe106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) for 72 hours. Tissues were dissociated by submerging the tissues into 1X PBS with calcium and magnesium for five minutes (apical side of tracheobronchial ALI tissues was previously washed twice with 1x PBS to remove mucus), followed by 5 minutes incubation in 0.1 M EDTA, followed by incubation in 0.25% trypsin for 12 minutes (alveolar ALI tissues) or -20 (tracheobronchial ALI tissues) minutes and pipetted up and down to dissociate the tissue. Cells were then carefully collected in ice cold EMEM media (ATCC), filtered first through a 100 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M strainer to remove cell aggregates, centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 mL of 1X PBS + 0.04% BSA, and finally filtered with 70 \({{{{{\rm{\mu}}}}}}\)M Flowmi filters (Sigma). The cell concentration for each sample was determined using a Countess II automatic cell counter. Single cell suspensions were then processed using the 10X Genomics Platform according to manufacturer instructions with v3 reagent and sequenced on the Illumina NexSeq550 Platform (Illumina). The raw data were demultiplexed and mapped to human reference genome with virus genomes (PR8-IAV, segments 1–8: GenBank accession: NC_002023.1, NC_002021.1, NC_002022.1, NC_002017.1, NC_002019.1, NC_002018.1, NC_002016.1, NC_002020.1; WA1-SARS-CoV2, GenBank accession: MN985325 Version) using CellRanger (10x Genomics) with standard default pipeline parameters. Raw count matrix for each sample was imported into an R pipeline using Seurat v4 package97. Low quality cells (<200 genes, <400 UMI, < 0.8 gene complexity (log10GenesPerUMI) and >0.2 mitochondrial ratio) were filtered out from analysis. Additionally, genes which were expressed in less than 10 cells were excluded from downstream analysis. Doublet cells were further removed by running DoubletFinder R package98. Data from each tissue were then normalized, scaled and log-transformed with Seurat packages using the SCTransform method97.Cell type identificationThe cell types were identified by differential gene expression (DEG) between clusters using Seurat FindAllMarkers and further annotated by using cell-type-specific single-cell signatures from respective cell atlases and curated publications99. Labels were added to the main object as cell-type identities.Differential analysisFor each tissue model, Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analyses were applied by comparing “tissue type”, “type of virus”, “Infection status” with Seurat FindAllMarkers, and FindMarkers functions97. The visualization plots were generated using R packages (EnhancedVolcano and ggplot2)100,101,102,103. The lists of DEGs were saved for further enrichment analysis. The significance cut-off for EnrichR enrichment analysis was Log2FC = 0.264 (~1.2 fold change), and Log2FC = 0.7 for volcano plots with adjusted p-values shown.Enrichment pathway analysisThe enrichment analysis was performed using R package EnrichR (libraries:BioPlanet_2019,KEGG_2021_Human,WikiPathways_2021_Human, MSigDB_Hallmark_2020, GO_Biological_Process_2021, GO_Molecular_Function_2021), fgsea (library c5.ontology gene sets all.v7.4) and clusterprofiler (library Go.db 2.1) packages with selected DEG list from the differential analysis (described above). The combined expression of the genes in each enrichment category was calculated using AddModuleScore function in Seurat package101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111.VisualizationAll plots were generated using Seurat visualization functions, ggplot2, Complexheatmap, and EnhancedVolcano R packages97,100,101,102. Venn diagrams were made with (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/).Cytokine and chemokine quantificationBasal media was collected at different time-points (24, 48, 72, and 144 hpi) from both tracheobronchial and alveolar infected ALI tissues and used to measure TH1/TH2 responses and growth factors with a customized 22-multiplex panel Human Magnetic bead Luminex assay (R&D Systems, MN, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminex assays were performed in the BSL3 and final samples decontaminated by an overnight incubation in 1% formalin solution before readout on a Luminex 100/200 System running on Xponent v4.2, with the following parameters: gate 8000–16,500, 50 μl of sample volume, 50–100 events per bead, sample timeout 60 s, low PMT (LMX100/200: Default). Acquired data were analyzed using Millipore Sigma Belysa™ v1.0.Statistics and reproducibilityStatistical significance was determined using Prism v9.0.1 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test was used for two group comparisons for each time-point and reported as *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.0005, ****p < 0.00005.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The unprecedented levels of mortality seen in some species of seabirds have left conservationists extremely concerned about the disease’s long-term impacts. Share As we emerge from the most devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, another pandemic has been wreaking havoc on wild bird populations throughout the northern hemisphere. A new, deadly and highly pathogenic form of avian influenza (bird flu) is rapidly circulating across a wide range of species, devastating populations and leaving conservationists significantly concerned about its long-term ramifications. Over 400,000 dead non-poultry birds (which includes wild birds) have been recorded over the last year – a vast underestimate given only a fraction of birds are tested – from over 2,600 outbreaks in non-poultry birds, over twice the amount as the previous large waves of avian influenza in 2016-2017 and 2021.An early sign of the devastation occurred when over 300 Demoiselle Cranes were killed in an outbreak of the disease in India in November 2021, while the virus had also been circulating among seabird populations in Southern Africa. The virus soon spread west – likely carried by wild birds migrating to their wintering grounds. In December, 5,000 Common Cranes in Israel were found to have died from the disease, and outbreaks have since been recorded in nearly every European country, leading to widespread deaths across numerous species, including more than 2,000 Near Threatened Dalmatian Pelicans in Greece. The virus was soon recorded in North America – a continent that only recorded its first case of avian influenza in 2014 – and has since been found in over 50 of the continent’s wild species, from Great Horned Owls and Bald Eagles to Northern Gannets and Black-billed Magpies.The virus has also been wreaking havoc on the poultry industry. In desperate attempts to control the spread, over 37 million chickens have been culled in the USA alone, with many European countries also culling poultry and domesticated wildfowl in unprecedented numbers.By Liam HughesHeader image: Seabirds, such as Northern Gannets, have been particularly impacted © Eleanor HamiltonHundreds of dead seabirds are being found washed ashore © Shkiredim / ShutterstockWorrying new strainThe highly pathogenic dominant lineage of avian influenza currently circulating is H5N1. First emerging in 1996 in domestic geese farms in East Asia, the disease spread rapidly across poultry farms. Since then, there have been multiple outbreaks in wild bird populations in Asia – particularly among ducks, geese and swans – which have occasionally spread to Europe when these species migrate. While these outbreaks have had significant localised impacts on populations, they have typically only affected a handful of species before petering out, and in Europe have largely been restricted to the Autumn and Winter months.However, the latest form of H5N1, which is believed to have emerged in 2014, has several concerning characteristics that suggest the virus is becoming better adapted to infecting wild birds. Most worrying is its seemingly higher transmissibility, resulting in a far higher proportion of wild bird populations becoming infected and unfortunately dying. “High percentages of species’ populations are impacted by the active strain of H5N1”, says Willem Van den Bossche, Senior flyways officer for BirdLife. “For example, 40 per cent of the south-east European Dalmatian Pelican population and more than 80 per cent of the UK’s Great Skua population have been affected”.Unlike previous waves in Europe, outbreaks in the last two years have also continued through summer, suggesting Avian flu may now be endemic within the continent’s wild birds. It is also able to infect a much wider range of species than previous forms. “It is extremely worrying that the active strain of H5N1 stays present all year round, in a large number of species and seems to be able to jump quickly from species to species.” Says Van den Bossche. “This change suggests a shift of infection from winter migrants to wild birds that are resident or summer visitors in Europe and the US, including those that breed in colonies.”One such group are seabirds, which have been particularly impacted during this wave. Their densely packed colonies provide ample opportunity for the virus to spread rapidly, and the numbers of reported dead birds is devastating. The Netherlands lost up to 80% of its breeding population of Sandwich Terns in a couple of weeks, and large-scale outbreaks have been recorded across seabird colonies in the UK, a country home to globally important breeding populations of several species. Across many Scottish islands, multiple mass mortality events of seabird colonies have been reported, including the world’s largest population of Northern Gannets at Bass Rock, where preliminary indications suggest a massive breeding failure and a significant impact on the population. Similar mass mortality events have been recorded in North America, with over 8,000 dead Northern Gannets being washed ashore in Canada.Birds of prey and scavengers have also been impacted more than in previous waves, likely catching the virus through feeding on infected birds or carcasses. Nearly all of Western Europe’s birds of prey species have been recorded with the virus, and it has again impacted some populations significantly – for instance, 30% of the Netherlands wintering population of Peregrine Falcons was wiped out in the winter of 2016-17. Worryingly, multiple predatory mammal species have also tested positive for the virus, from otters and seals to foxes and martens.However, unlike previous strains of H5NI, not all infected birds die from the disease, and some species seem to be more severely impacted than others. There have also been some reports of infected birds showing no signs of disease. Researchers are trying to work out the reasons for these differing impacts, as it is likely contributing to the virus’s spread.40 per cent of the south-eastern European population of Dalmation Pelicans died from the disease © Nicram-Sabod / ShutterstockAvian influenza has been recorded in several Great Skua colonies in the UK, a country home to roughly 90 per cent of its global breeding population © Eleanor Hamilton“It is extremely worrying that the active strain of H5N1 stays present all year round, in a large number of species and seems to be able to jump quickly from species to species.”Willem Van den Bossche, Senior flyways officer for BirdLifePreventing the spreadControlling the virus once it has spreading amongst wild birds is extremely challenging and will require coordinated efforts. Increased monitoring of the disease is crucial and would allow us to understand the full scale of its impacts, as well as where and how it is spreading, allowing conservationists to act effectively. Most countries, however, only test a fraction of dead birds, meaning current figures vastly underestimate the wave’s impact. “BirdLife is urging governments to set up monitoring systems to track avian flu across a wide range of species and sites.” Says Van den Bossche. “More capacity is also needed to remove the corpses of birds dying of avian flu as quickly as possible from the environment, as the virus stays active for days or weeks and this risks the disease spreading to other birds in breeding colonies, or to scavenging species.”The challenges of reducing the spread amongst wild birds, however, mean most of our tools to stop the virus spreading are ultimately aimed at its source – poultry farms. Reducing the intensity of poultry farms would significantly reduce the spread of disease, as the thousands of birds packed shoulder to shoulder provides the perfect opportunity for flu to sweep through the flocks. Avian flu can spread through bird faeces and feathers as well as human boots and clothes, so strict biosecurity measures are also essential. In a similar vein, substantially reducing or eliminating the potential for contact between domesticated and wild populations is also important to limit the virus’s spread. This can include bringing domesticated birds indoors, ensuring buildings are properly biosecure, and in the longer-term ensuring farms are located away from areas where large numbers of birds congregate, such as wetlands and other important migratory sites.Vaccinating poultry is another potential tool to reduce the spread. Although currently banned in the EU and USA, largely due to fears they may contribute to the virus develop further worrying mutations, following this unprecedented wave, some European countries are assessing this option. “Vaccines are currently used in poultry farms in South-East Asia and the pros and cons of their use should be explored urgently, as vaccination could be a last resort to try to stop the spread and save some of the tiny and isolated wild bird populations that may be at risk”, says Van den Bossche.These species with small, isolated populations, such as several petrel species, are particularly concerning conservationists, as a single avian flu outbreak could result in devastating impacts. As well as measures to counter avian flu directly, the risks it poses to wild birds are exacerbated by the many other threats impacting them, from habitat loss to overexploitation and climate change. “Effectively conserving the most important sites for nature, particularly Key Biodiversity Areas, restoring degraded habitats, mitigating threats and implementing targeted recovery actions are essential responses to the wider biodiversity crisis, as well as delivering indirect benefits to minimise the impacts of avian influenza,” said Dr Stuart Butchart, BirdLife’s Chief Scientist.Intensive poultry farms provide a perfect environment for the disease to spread © David-Tadevosian / Shutterstock“Effectively conserving the most important sites for nature, particularly Key Biodiversity Areas, restoring degraded habitats, mitigating threats and implementing targeted recovery actions are essential responses to the wider biodiversity crisis, as well as delivering indirect benefits to minimise the impacts of avian influenza,”Dr Stuart Butchart, BirdLife’s Chief Scientist 10 January 2022 Israel and UK facing record-breaking bird flu outbreaks As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread among humans, another virus has re-emerged across Europe and the Middle East – avian influenza.

Poultry farmers in these areas must take special precautions.Pennsylvania Department of AgricultureBy Steve Novak | For lehighvalleylive.comThe detection of extremely infectious bird flu on a Northampton County farm this week is Pennsylvania’s first case in two months and the first in a backyard flock.Because of the case’s proximity to New Jersey, poultry farmers in neighboring Warren County now are instructed to be on alert for highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI.The virus can be fatal for domestic poultry but is not an immediate concern for humans. It spreads through birds’ bodily fluids, which can be picked up by vehicles, equipment or shoes.Signs of infection in birds include respiratory issues, swelling around the eyes, breathing through the mouth, lethargy and death.Pennsylvania’s latest case of highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed Thursday. It’s the first for the Lehigh Valley and the state’s first in a non-commercial flock, per the USDA. It affected 90 birds and was confirmed in test samples from a duck and chickens. The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the...Posted by New Jersey Department of Agriculture on Friday, August 12, 2022The specific farm has not been publicly identified, but the finding requires testing by poultry farmers with a 12-mile radius that extends into southern Monroe and western Warren counties, say the Pennsylvania and New Jersey agriculture departments. Those within 6 miles must test and have permits to transport products. Poultry farms within 2 miles are under quarantine and cannot transport any poultry or products.The ag departments recommend preventing contact between domestic and wild birds, minimizing the number of people who visit the birds, and regularly using and cleaning a dedicated set of shoes and clothes for dealing with poultry.The 2022 avian influenza outbreak has so far affected 40 million birds from 400 flocks in 39 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

People delay or skip getting a flu vaccine for a myriad of reasons.A few common reasons, according to the American Medical Association (AMA), include an aversion to needles, a conviction that it’s better to get the flu than a flu shot, and the belief that they’ll have time later to get a flu vaccine.You may be one of those people who have good intentions, but you just get busy and suddenly flu season has rolled around and you’re wondering if you still have time. But what if you need to get other vaccines too? Here’s what you need to know about the timing of some vaccines that are recommended for most adults, including the flu vaccine and the shingles vaccine.Can you get a flu vaccine right after a shingles vaccine? Experts recommend that everyone at or over the age of 6 months get a seasonal flu vaccine each year, with a few exceptions.Meanwhile, you have to wait until you’re a certain age to get a shingles vaccine. A two-dose shingles vaccine (known as Shingrix) is recommended for adults age 50 and older — or adults age 19 and over if they have a weakened immune system. The second dose is typically given within 2 to 6 months after the first dose.Fortunately, you don’t have to juggle these vaccines if you’re eligible for them. Not only can you get a flu vaccine right after getting a shingles vaccine, but you can actually get them at the same time.Understanding the combined side effectsIt’s safe to get both vaccines at the same time, but you may still experience some side effects afterward. However, it’s important to know where the side effects are coming from.A 2021 study found that people who got both vaccines at once were less likely to get a flu vaccine the following year. Why? The researchers suggested that they may have mistakenly blamed the flu vaccine for the side effects that were actually caused by the zoster vaccine (for shingles). So they skipped their flu shot.The most common side effects from a flu shot are some redness, soreness, or swelling at the injection site, whereas the shingles vaccine is more likely to cause systemic effects, according to the 2021 study.How long do I need to wait after getting another vaccine before getting the COVID-19 vaccine?In many cases, you don’t have to wait at all. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that you can get a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. You can get a shingles vaccine, flu vaccine, and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, too, if that works for you.Can you get a flu shot when you have shingles?You definitely don’t want to get a shingles vaccine when you’re having an acute shingles episode. You’ll need to check with a doctor about the best timing for your vaccination following a shingles infection, but as a general rule, the CDC advises that you wait until the rash from the shingles clears up before you get a shingles vaccination.As for a flu shot, the same basic advice applies: it’s best to wait for the shingles to clear up before you get another vaccine. Let your immune system finish dealing with shingles first before trying to teach it something new.Common side effects of shingles vaccineAccording to the CDC, the shingles vaccine is very effective: it’s more than 90% effective in preventing shingles in adults over 50 years of age with healthy immune systems.However, many people experience temporary side effects for 2 to 3 days after getting a shingles vaccine. The CDC reports that those side effects can include:soreness in the arm where you received the injectionredness and swelling at the injection sitefatiguemuscle painheadachefever and chillsstomach pain and nauseaThe side effects can vary from person to person, although younger people seem more susceptible to them than older people. However, they usually go away within a couple of days.It’s possible to experience more severe side effects from the Shingrix shingles vaccine, but the CDC reports that it’s rare: perhaps one or two people will experience an allergic reaction for every million doses of the vaccine administered. One possible rare adverse reaction is Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a disorder of the nervous system.Talk with doctors about a vaccine scheduleIt may be easier for you to chat with a doctor if you have specific questions about which vaccines you need and the ideal time to get them, especially if you have any other health concerns that might affect your needs.Takeaway It’s all too easy to skip getting vaccines that could help you stay healthier. Even with good intentions, you might put off getting a flu shot until you’ve already come down with the flu. And you may not even be familiar with the shingles vaccine recommendations. In terms of receiving multiple vaccinations, you don’t have much to worry about. It’s safe to get a flu vaccine right after you’ve had a shingles vaccine.

Leadership and Management Techniques For...Next The RCGP: Research and Surveillance Centre Published on: 11 Aug 2022 Category: General practice Although the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is not a research organisation, it acknowledges the importance of research in promoting and advancing the highest quality of care provided to patients. As such, the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) was established in 1957 as an active research and surveillance unit that collects and monitors data from over 1700 practices across England and Wales. It has since grown in size, scope, integration of microbiological testing, as well as data-linkage, making it not only the principal primary care surveillance system in England and Wales, but also the largest of all general practice sentinel networks in Europe. RSC research is conducted in collaboration with the University of Oxford and Public Health England (PHE); the RSC and the Research Group are co-data controllers of the Disease Surveillance Programme. Public Health Data The core surveillance and vaccine effectiveness work are funded by PHE, whilst other disease surveillance and research is conducted in collaboration with a range of UK public health bodies, as well as some based in Europe. The pseudonymised coded data extracted from GP practices encompasses information on: Demographics Diagnoses and symptoms Drug exposure Vaccination history Laboratory tests Referrals to hospital and specialist care The RSC database is freely available, with reports on communicable and respiratory diseases in England and Wales published weekly. These include the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI), other respiratory diseases, environmentally sensitive disorders, as well as water and food-borne diseases. This provides an early warning of changes in the incidence of common illnesses presenting to general practice surgeries, which in turn helps drive national policy and inform national strategy. The RSC particularly focuses on influenza and has devised an Influenza Virology Scheme with approximately 300 practices partaking every year. This involves collecting nasopharyngeal samples from suspected flu patients. The aim is to confirm cases of influenza, as well as assess the impact of other diseases, and characterise vulnerable groups. This data is used by the Chief Medical Officer to know when the virus is circulating each year and also plays a major role in Europe, with the RSC providing weekly reports to the European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC). The combination of clinical and virological data alongside vaccine exposure has furthermore enabled the estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness; the network also partakes in numerous European influenza vaccine research consortia. Additionally, since the outbreak of COVID-19, PHE has commissioned the RCGP RSC to incorporate monitoring of COVID-19 in its virology surveillance scheme. Support for Research Teams The general practice research database can also be used as a resource for research teams to conduct all kinds of surveillance studies. The types of support offered by the RCGP RSC is summarised below (Table 1).

These memory cells play an essential role in protection against reinfection. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells can be generated in situ once attacked by pathogens. TRM cells dominate the defense mechanism during early stages of reinfection and have gradually become one of the most popular focuses in recent years. Here, we mainly reviewed the development and regulation of various TRM cell signaling pathways in the respiratory tract. Moreover, we explored the protective roles of TRM cells in immune response against various respiratory viruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and influenza. The complex roles of TRM cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection are also discussed. Current evidence supports the therapeutic strategies targeting TRM cells, providing more possibilities for treatment. Rational utilization of TRM cells for therapeutics is vital for defense against respiratory viruses.IntroductionBeing exposed to various stimuli, the host forms an immune defense to protect the body for the first viral encounter and preserve immunological memory to prepare for reinfection. Memory T cells are the backbone of this process and are classified as central memory T (TCM) cells and effector memory T (TEM) cells (1). Generally, TCM cells express chemokine receptor CCR7, homing molecule CD62L, and Krupple-Like Factor 2 (KLF2), circulating in the peripheral lymph system for surveillance of secondary lymphoid organs and recalling of proliferative responses. Distribution of TCM cells includes peripheral tissues, immune organs, and lymph nodes (1–3). TEM cells are mainly located in non-lymphocyte tissues and organs, with the expression of CCR7 and CD62L being hardly detected. TEM cells participate in the body circulation and migrate to the peripheral inflammatory tissues to induce rapid effects (1–3). Later, resident and self-sustaining memory T cells surviving in the non-lymphoid tissues, namely TRM cells, were identified by parabiosis and tissue transplantation experiments (4, 5). Despite the shared cell marker CD44+ of memory T cells, TRM cells highly express CD69 and/or CD103 instead of CCR7 and CD62L (6, 7). They are the most abundant subset of memory T cells and reside in the non-lymphoid tissues for a long time, contributing to rapid and critical protective immune responses (8). In addition to proliferation, TRM cells secrete cytokines and pass the signals to other cells like natural killer cells to dominate local memory responses (9, 10) (Table 1; Figure 1).TABLE 1 Table 1 basic traits of effector memory T cells, central memory T cells and resident memory T cells.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 General distribution of TEM, TCM, and TRM cells in the lungs and their main mode of function. TEM and TCM cells migrate in circulation, while TRM cells reside in tissues. When stimulated by antigens again, TCM cells rapidly proliferate and differentiate, while TEM cells secrete effector molecules like granzyme B, similar to CD8+ T cells. TRM cells exert a rapid and critical immune response on local tissues. TCM: central memory T cells. TEM: effector memory T cells. TRM: tissue-resident memory T cells.TRM cells found in both the upper and lower respiratory tract play an important role in the localized defense against respiratory infections. Due to rapid spread through air, respiratory viruses pose a considerable threat to humans. In recent years, respiratory viruses have stood on the stage of global pandemic. Having a deeper understanding of the role of immune cells in protecting the respiratory tract helps curb the spread of respiratory disease, casting light on new strategies. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of TRM cells and their complicated roles during RSV, Influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several potential preventive and therapeutic strategies based on TRM cells are discussed.Development of TRM cells in respiratory TractOnce viruses attack the respiratory tract, DNGR1+ dendritic cells (DCs) preferentially migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs). These DCs activate naïve T cells to differentiate into precursor effector T cells (CD8+ T cells), some of which further migrate to the nasal cavity or lungs and convert into TRM cells (2, 11). Precursor CD4+ T cells can also transform into tissue-resident memory T cells. Generally, the phenotype of pulmonary CD4+ TRM cells is regarded as CD69+CD103-, while the phenotype of CD8+ TRM cells is CD69+CD103+ (2). Other phenotypes of TRM cells in respiratory viruses are summarized in Table 2. Multiple signaling pathways contribute to the initiation and maintenance of TRM cells.TABLE 2 Table 2 phenotypes of CD8+ and CD4+ TRM cells in respiratory viruses, as well as cytokines and transcription factors in the regulation of pulmonary TRM cells.Initiation and generation of TRM cellsThe initiation and generation of TRM cells involves different signaling pathways and transcriptional factors that vary in different tissues. Local antigen stimulation triggers the initiation of TRM cells in various tissues, including the lungs, but not in the nasal cavity (36). Cytokines like TGF-β, interleukin (IL), and TNF-α are also involved in the regulation of TRM cell development. TGF-β has multiple effects in adaptive immunity with complex biological activities (37). Pulmonary CD103 expression by CD8+ TRM cells relies on TGF-β, which is regulated by CD1c+ DCs (38). TGF-β, IL-33, and TNF-α can also inhibit Krupple-Like Factor 2 (KLF2) expression to downregulate the expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1), resulting in elevated CD69 expression in CD8+ TRM cells (39). Furthermore, TGF-β downregulates other transcription factors in the lungs to promote the establishment of pulmonary CD8+ TRM cells, such as T-bet, eomesodermin (Eomes), and transcription factor 1 (40, 41). In mouse experiments, high expression levels of T-bet, Eomes, and transcription factor 1 inhibit CD103 expression (41–43). Expression of CD103 can be stimulated either directly by Runx3 or Blimp1, which has been proven in the development of gut TRM cells (44, 50). Since TGF-β is upstream of Runx3 and Blimp1 in the gut, it might also regulate CD103 in the lungs by the same pathway. Additionally, transcription factor Bhlhe4 can also increase the expression of CD103 directly or indirectly via the recruitment of Runx3 (42, 51).IL-15 reduces T-bet expression to mediate CD8+ TRM cell generation together with TGF-β (40). IL-33 and IL-12 increase Blimp-1 while inhibiting Eomes and TCF-1, promoting the generation of pulmonary CD8+ TRM cells (45). Additionally, IL-15 and IL-2 aid in the formation of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic mouse models (52, 54). In addition to ILs, other regulators shared by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells include low levels of transcription factors T-bet and Eomes and upregulated Notch signaling (40, 42, 55, 56). However, the detailed signaling mechanisms of CD4+ TRM cell generation are still unclear and more relevant studies are necessary.Cell environment in situ can also influence TRM cell formation. Lung macrophages can regulate TRM cell formation, while their effects according to different experiments seem inconsistent. In influenza mouse models, macrophages exert negative effects (46), while human pulmonary macrophages provide costimulatory signals during CD8+ TRM cells generation (21). CD4+ T cells and T regulatory cells expressing T-bet assist in the formation of CD103+ pulmonary CD8+ TRM cells (29, 47).Maintenance of TRM cellsThe distinguishing characteristic of TRM cells is that they can sustain in non-lymphoid tissue for a long time, acting as the assault force in secondary infection. Repair-associated memory depots are the major niche where CD8+ TRM cells are stored in the lungs (48). Transcription factors play vital roles in the survival of TRM cells. Runx3 and Blimp1, which inhibit transcription factor 1, maintain the survival of CD8+ TRM cells by suppressing egress receptors CCR7 and S1PR1 (49, 57). S1PR1 induces the chemotaxis of sphingosinol-1-phosphate, mediating the expulsion of T cells from the tissues (53). Therefore, FTY720, an S1PR1 agonist, is often used in research focused on TRM cells to inhibit peripheral lymphatic circulation (58). KLF2, which promotes S1PR1 expression, is downregulated after CD8+ TRM cells enter non-lymphoid tissues (39). Furthermore, CD8+ TRM cells are sustained in a functional epigenetic state by Bhlhe4 (51). Reduction of T-bet and Eomes also enhances the maintenance of CD8+ TRM cells (40).Additionally, some transcription factors regulating maintenance are common to both CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells. Notch promotes the survival of CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells (42, 55). CD69 antagonizes S1PR1 and inhibits TRM cells excretion (59), and research demonstrates that TRM cells cannot sustain in CD69-/- mice (27). With reference to CD4+ TRM cells, IL-7 is critical for the maintenance of CD4+ TRM cells in the lungs (60). Distinct from CD8+ TRM cells, inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue is the major niche for pulmonary CD4+ TRM cells (61).Evidently, generation, maintenance, and regulation of TRM cells in the lungs is complicated (Figure 2; Figure 3; Table 2) and involves a variety of factors. Additional details are needed regarding the mechanism of TRM cell regulation to understand their traits. Thereafter, we can control the physiological process managed by them to regulate immunological homeostasis.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Development of TRM cells in the lung. On contact with the virus, specific dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes to communicate with naïve T cells and activate the generation of effector T cells. Some effector T cells migrate to the lungs and transform into TRM cells by various signaling pathways. CD8+ TRM cells accumulate in RAMDs and CD4+ TRM cells accumulate in iBALs after formation. To maintain TRM cells in the lungs, many transcription factors coordinate with each other to achieve overall functionality.

Plenty of signaling pathways regulate the development of CD8+ TRM cells. (A) TNF-α, IL-33, TGF-β, and IL-15 promote the development of CD8+ TRM cells by increasing the expression of transcription factors such as Runx3, Blimp1, and Bhlhe4, and decreasing the expression of transcription factors such as Eomes, T-bet, and KLF2. (B) Transcription factors such as Blimp1 and Runx3 inhibit the expression of cell surface receptors CCR7 and S1PR1 to maintain the presence of CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs. Cell surface marker CD69 can also decrease the expression of S1PR1 to sustain CD8+ TRM cells. green icons: inhibitory roles; red icons: facilitating roles. dotted line: possible impact.Basic functions and ‘Workflow’ of TRM cellsAs fundamental components of the immune network, TRM cells monitor local homeostasis (8). Furthermore, they participate in the response to external stimuli and internal abnormalities, maintaining homeostasis (13, 62). TRM cells patrol colonization site, recognize reinfection antigen or tumor-associated antigens, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, and release cytotoxic particles to eliminate these antigens (63). Contrastingly, signals induced by TRM cells break tissue homeostasis with hybrid populations of white blood cells. For instance, independent of circulating immune memory cells, CD4+ TRM cells are considered the primary reactive immune memory cells in the early period of asthma in house dust mite asthmatic mouse model (54). Clearly, functions of TRM cells are diverse under different circumstances.TRM cells work mainly in two steps: the first step is scanning. Long resident memory T cells slowly and randomly migrate to previously infected tissues. In the inflammatory tissue, T cells increase their movement five-fold in the mucosa and bind to fibronectin with integrins CD103 and CD49a, which are important markers of TRM cells in the lungs (64, 65). Local immune surveillance against relapse or reinfection is enhanced by TRM cells scanning the environment (66). On contact with the antigen, TRM cells initiate the second step: clearance. In addition to the direct control of the pathogen, some tissue-specific CD8+ TRM cells sustain constitutive granzyme B expression, mediate extracellular toxicity (67, 68), and eliminate pathogens by non-cytolytic progress (69). Furthermore, they convey this information to neighboring cells, stimulating localized memory responses. TRM cell-dependent parenchymal immunity, including innate and adaptive immune activation, triggers the induction of locally protective antiviral status (9, 10).Overall, TRM cells can settle in a particular niche for a long time, leading to a rapid and critical protective immune response in the local tissues. Through the two steps —scan and clearance — TRM cells are involved in infection protection, tumor control, and monitoring homeostasis to play various roles in different diseases.Role of TRM cells in respiratory virus infectionRespiratory syncytial virusSince it was first isolated in Chimpanzee with respiratory illness in 1957 (70), RSV has evolved as a vast threat to children, adults, and the elderly, especially infants. RSV-associated hospitalization rates are highest in infants younger than six months and almost all children get infected with RSV by the age of two (71). A large systematic study has shown that RSV was responsible for 2.0% and 3.6% of deaths in children aged 0–60 months and 28 days–6 months, respectively, in 2019 (72).In an RSV mouse model, Kinnear et al. observed that TRM cells have a protective effect against RSV (13). Compared with mice infected with RSV for the second and third time, mice infected for the first time had significantly lower body weight, increased viral load, and significantly lower serum anti-RSV immunoglobulin after infection. Mice infected multiple times produced numerous antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells in the respiratory tract. Researchers then transferred cells from the respiratory tract of previously infected mice to the respiratory tract of uninfected mice, which partially rescued the weight loss in uninfected mice. Airway CD8+ TRM cells decreased weight loss, viral load, and increased IFN-γ, suggesting their protective effect against RSV infection. In RSV infected healthy adult volunteers, pulmonary virus-specific CD8+ TRM cells were observed which accumulated extensively during the recovery period (12). During infection, the proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing CD103 was upregulated, peaking on day 10 and decreasing in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as the infection subsided. Enrichment of CD8+ TRM cells in the airway was associated with mitigated respiratory symptoms, virus control, and reduced disease severity. This indicates that CD8+ TRM cells in human lungs defend against severe respiratory viral disease. RSV-specific CD8+ T cells in the BAL of African green monkey were about ten times higher than that in the blood, showing effector memory (CD95+CD28-)issue-resident memory (CD69+CD103+) T cell phenotype (73). The dynamics of RSV-specific CD8+ T cells in blood and BAL were associated with a decrease in the viral titer. Different models have shown that TRM cells protect the host against RSV (Figure 4).FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Roles of TRM cells in RSV, Influenza, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.In the secondary infection, TRM cells rapidly react to protect the host from Influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-1 through secreting important molecules such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2. It may also have the same effect in SARS-CoV-2. On the other side, TRM cells could also arouse pathogenic effects when the host is infected with Influenza, which might also happen in SARS-CoV-2 infection.GZMB: granzyme B. GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. dotted line: possible impact.InfluenzaInfluenza has caused several tragic events in the first half of the twentieth century, killing an estimated 50 million people in the 18 months after the end of World War I (74). It can present diverse conditions, ranging from asymptomatic infections and various respiratory syndromes to fulminant primary viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia, damaging all organs. Pulmonary CD8+ TRM cells reveal unique traits during influenza infection. CD8+ TRM cells are recruited through chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 6/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 CXCR6/CXCL16 from the lungs to the airway to realize ectopic denfence (17). Interestingly, pulmonary virus-induced CD8+ TRM cells can retrogradly migrate from the lungs to medLNs, providing long-term regional memory and recording previous antigen experience to provide protection during secondary virus attack (75).In the medLNs, accumulation of conventional dendritic cells strengthens T cell initiation during the primary infection and the protective heterosubtypic immunity responses of the CD8+ TRM cells (76). Pulmonary TRM cells deposit bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue in the lung parenchyma and provide cross-immune protection against different influenza virus strains (25). Paik et al. (76) demonstrated that mice infected with H3N2 for 3 subsequent weeks could defend against H1N1. These mice displayed decreased virus load and relieved weight loss compared with previously uninfected heterologous mice, suggesting the protective effect of CD8+ TRM cells on influenza. Moreover, the use of FTY720 did not impair the heterologous protection, indicating that the protection is independent of the peripheral circulation and may be mediated by secreting TNF-α and IFN-γ (77). CD4+ TRM cells also mediate remarkable protection. After influenza infection, CD4+ TRM cells isolated from the lungs of mice have been shown to mediate enhanced viral clearance and survival during fatal influenza infections (34, 78).However, the viability of TRM cells in human requires further investigation. Wu et al. (76) found that heterotypic immunity to influenza declined within six to seven months after the initial infection. Nguyende et al. discovered that CD8+ TRM cells were the most susceptible to age among all subsets of T cells and age was inversely correlated with CD8+ TRM cells in adults (14). This may also explain why older adults are more likely to develop severe clinical symptoms after contracting influenza. In essense, the unstability and waning of CD8+ TRM cells is primarly due to apoptosis (79). Nevertheless, the decay may be rescued by repeated antigen exposure. Van et al. clarified that repeated exposure to influenza enhanced the persistence of lung CD8+ TRM cells and prolonged the durability of heterologous (80).Despite these factors, some research has introduced new regulatory mechanisms for CD8+ TRM cell formation in influenza. In mouse models, TRM cells selectively maintain the interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3, a protein with extensive resistance to viral infection. Expression of IFITM3 in CD8+ TRM cells enhances resistance to influenza reinfection and increases CD8+ TRM cell maintenance (24). Furthermore, secretion of IFN-γ and restriction of T-bet expression are required for CD8+ TRM cell expression, which is accomplished by CD4+ T cell (29).In conclusion, TRM cells can migrate to localized areas and provide long-term regional memory to defend against influenza (Figure 4). However, their durability is limited and related to age. Their decline is mainly due to self-apoptosis. Despite IFN-γ secretion by CD4+ T cells to upregulate CD8+ TRM cells, CD4+ TRM cells can reversely contribute to vigorous protection of CD8+ T cells (35). Notably, Goplen et al. (81) disclosed their pathogenic role in aged mice, contradicting the previous recognition of CD8+ TRM cells. Aged mice infected with H1N1 displayed more influenza-specific TRM cells than young mice, accompanied by extremely weakened heterologous immunity, enhanced pulmonary inflammation, and lung fibrosis. These CD8+ TRM cells were unable to secrete IFN-γ and TNF-α. After exhausting CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs, the inflammation and fibrosis were relieved. This unexpected discovery hints to more possibile roles of TRM cells in pulmonary Influenza infection.SARS-CoV-2Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 specific and vaccine-induced T-cell immune protection has become a popular topic of discussion. A previous study showed that SARS-COV-1-specific CD8+ TRM cells can last six years after infection, while memory B cells and viral antibodies cannot be detected in patients recovering from SARS. In addition to reducing viral load, CD8+ TRM cells effectively produce a variety of effector cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, and cytolysate molecules like granzyme B to provide protection (82).However, we cannot simply regard TRM cells as defence against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ TRM cells were found in the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue of children and adults unexposed to COVID-19, which were functionally weaker than EBV-specific CD8+ TRM cells, possibly spearheading an early immune response. Niessl et al. pointed that preexisting CD8+ TRM cells may induce heterologous immune responses against COVID-19 (83). The protective role of lung TRM cells against SARS-CoV-2 has also been observed by a three-dimensional perfusion model of human lung tissue (84, 85). Concerning the paired airway and blood samples, Szabo et al. observed that in patients previously infected with COVID-19, CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells have superiority in the lungs, dominating the airways. Airway T cells expressed upregulation of TRM cell-related gene markers such as CXCR6. More importantly, it upregulated the expression of key cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-γ, suggesting that TRM cells may protect patients with severe COVID-19 (86). These TRM cells produce IFN-γ in response to in vitro stimulation that persist for at least 10 months in the lungs of patients in the covalescent period, highlighting the persistence of TRM cells-related immunity (87). Dai et al. exhibited that CD8+ TRM cells decreased by 2.4 times in patients with severe infection compared to moderate infection with lower expression of CXCR6, which may protect the lungs in previous experiments (88). Moreover, CD8+ TRM cells undergo active expansion in patiens with mild infection, while they perform more naïve funtions in severely infected patients (89). In patients with moderate infection, CD8+ TRM cells alleviate inflammation through CXCR6-mediated virus clearance, while the expression of CD8+ TRM cells is unstable and reduced in patients with severe infection, leading to viral replication (88) (Figure 4). Furthermore, in contrast to influenza, interferon response against SARS-CoV-2 induced by CD8+ TRM cells does not decline with age (14) and nasal CD8+ TRM cells can last at least two months after virus clearance (31), indicating the persistence of TRM cells against SARS-CoV-2.However, other studies have challenged the protective effect of CD8+ TRM cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Roberts et al. (32) elucidated that though lung-resident T cells can be induced by SARS-CoV-2, they cannot provide adequate protection against secondary viral infection. In mice model, transferring T cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice to uninfected mice did not improve survival after reinfection. This prompts the unknown efficiency of TRM cells in protecting patients against SARS-CoV-2 during secondary infection. Additionally, many patients in the convalescent stage of COVID-19 infection still experienced respiratory symptoms for months. Vijayakumar et al. found that compared to healthy individuals, T cell frequencies in these patients were increased, particularly CD8+ TRM cells by immuno-proteomic profiling. The heightened number of CD8+ TRM cells was correlated with increased cell death and indicated persistent airway symptoms, namely decreased forced vital capacity (90).This is evidence that TRM cells predominate during COVID-19 infection. Although some observations of human samples emphasized the possible protective correlation between TRM cells and SARS-CoV-2, studies in mice show that the protection is insufficient. Moreover, exploration of the TRM cells of patients with severe infection and convalescence with respiratory symptoms showed association with ongoing lung injury. Roles of TRM cells in SARS-CoV-2 are complicated. TRM cells at different disease stages and distinct populations may display different effects, being potential pathogenic or protective orchestrators in COVID-19. Furthermore, CD8+ TRM cells regulate CD4+ T cells to influence immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kaneko et al. showed that decline of Bcl-6+ T follicular helper cells was responsible for the loss of germinal centers and accumulation of activated B cells from non-germinal sources, triggering low efficiency and unsustainable humor immune responses during acute and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (91). Transcription factor Bcl-6 is indispensable for the development of T follicular helper cells and mutually antagonizes Blimp1 in the process (92, 93). As mentioned above, formation and maintenance of CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs requires Blimp1. We assume that by upregulation of Blimp1, CD8+ TRM cells inhibit Bcl-6 to impede the generation of T follicular helper cells, affecting humoral immunity in severe COVID-19. More studies are needed to verify this hypothesis and patients with different SARS-CoV-2 infection conditions should also be considered. An update on recognition of long SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity is needed for more research on the absolute roles of TRM cells in SARS-CoV-2.Application in preventive and therapeutic strategiesTill date, there are no drugs that efficiently cure the abovementioned respiratory viruses. Thousands of researchers work on the research and development of treatment. Although B cells eliminate the virus faster in the form of neutralizing antibodies, T cell immunity-related theraputic strategies can maintain long-term protection, and TRM cells largely contribute to immunity in situ.The study and exploration of TRM cells highlights that the site of vaccine injection is critical, and nasal mucosal vaccination may become the trend to curb the replication of respiratory viruses. TRM cells are required for vaccine-induced influenza associated T cell immunity (94). Morabito et al.(95) investigated a murine cytomegalovirus vector vaccine expressing RSV M-protein. Compared with intraperitoneal injection, intranasal inoculation triggered a large amount of CD8+ TRM cells, mediating early viral clearance over time. A similar result was observed during influenza vaccine research (96). Mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract also encourages the application of inhaled vaccine. Aerosol inhalation of two doses of Ad5-nCoV, an aerosolised adenovirus type-5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine, induced production of benign neutralization antibodies with well tolerance and consumed less vaccine dosage than intramuscular injection (97). Inhalation vaccine can both improve compliance to the medication and reduce the cost of vaccination. Enhancement of local mucosal immunity prevents infection and blocks tramsmission at the point of virus invasion, making it safer and more convenient for promotion in population.TRM cells mediate superior protection in heterotypic infection, highlighting their potential as a universal vaccine target. For production of large amounts of TRM cells, Bosnjak et al. utilized a prime-boost protocol on a novel modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-SARS-2-spike vaccine candidate to induce immune responses, which alleviated weight loss, increased clinical score, and decreased viral titers in rodents (98). Furthermore, Lei et al. developed a recombinant RBD vaccine against variants of concern for intranasal administration, which not only induced and maintained high IgG levels, but also enhanced mucosal immunity, including lung TRM cells (99). In particular, humoral immunity and TRM cells attained by intranasally delivered SARS-CoV−2 DNA vaccine efficiently suppresses the wild type and Beta variant, providing persistent protection (100). Remarkably, in the absence or with low expression of virus-neutralizing antibody, systemic or pulmonary CD4+ TRM cells and protective CD8 T cells defended effectively against the Beta variant, without lung immunopathology (101). Vaccines targeted at TRM cells are promising for successful prevention of reinfection.Various combination adjuvants may also improve efficiency by stimulating or maintaining TRM cells. As mentioned above, conventional dendritic cells enhance the protection induced by TRM cells. Wakim et al. developed an antibody targeted inoculation method to present the antigen only to respiratory dendritic cells, facilitating the generation of protective pulmonary TRM cells against influenza (102).Several TRM cells stimulators, such as IL-1β and zymosan, were used in conjugation with with vaccine, which proved to be more effective in influenza mice models. IL-1β was used as an adjuvant in recombinant adenovirus vector encoding hemagglutinin and nuclear protein in mice. Abundant TRM cells were accumulated and weight loss and virus copies in mice were mitigated. IL-1β and local antigen resulted in activation of key checkpoints in TRM cell formation, including epithelial cell activation, expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules, and recruitment of lung-derived CD103+ DCs (103). Without the antigen, only the adjuvant usually cannot drive the generation of TRM cells. Notably, zymosan promoted the differentiation from effector T cells to TRM cells passing by antigen. When used in combination with injectable influenza vaccine, intranasal zymosan significantly increased influenza-specific pulmonary TRM cells (104).However, there are some complications with treatments based on TRM cells. Firstly, the existence of TRM cells is not stable enough to maintain permanent protection. Using an adenovirus expressing influenza nucleoprotein, Uddback et al. demonstrated that CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs could sustain for at least a year post vaccination (105). Other than apoptosis, retrocedent migration into medLNs may also explain why TRM cells decrease overtime as described previously, which hinders protection in the lungs. Apparently, the existence of TRM cells is dynamic. Maintenance of protective TRM cells in situ is worth exploring. Secondly, the balance between protective and pathogenic roles of TRM cells is unknown. The switching point at which TRM cells change from protective to pathogenic is unknown, especially in the elderly.TRM cells have supreme value in the treatment of respiratory viruses. In addition to vaccines, new drugs targeted at TRM cells have also been released. Pretreated FC-fused IL-7 protects mice from fatal influenza infection depending on tissue-resident memory-like T cells in the lungs, and lasts for several weeks (106). Utilizing the unique advantages of TRM cells, such as persistence in tissues and remarkable ability to undertake heterotypic immunity, a portable, and highly protective vaccine inducing TRM cells against multiple pathogens can be developed in the future. Moreover, devotion to clinical administration is a big step for vaccines and drugs based on TRM cells.Concluding remarksTRM cells are persistent in non-lymphoid tissues and act as a sentinel in reinfection immunity, responding to infection more quickly. A variety of signaling pathways regulate the generation of TRM cells. However, little is known about the regulation of CD4+ TRM cells. Regarding the traits, TRM cells are usually limited in situ and migrate localizedly in traditional opinion. As stated above, CD8+ TRM cells move to the airway and medLNs to induce effective protection, breaking the stereotype. Nevertheless, TRM cells perform effector-like functions in many tissues and maintain their state without antigen to provide powerful protection (107, 108). Therefore, they are often regarded as terminal differentiation of effector cells, which is actually a semblance. TRM cells expand in the skin and mucosa on contact with the antigen (109, 110), which is quite different from terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) cells. TEMRA cells also reside in situ, providing steady protection during SARS-CoV-2 infection (111), while TRM cells display more plasticity and instability. A recent study showed that reactivational TRM cells in intestine rejoin the lymphoid circulation and have the potential to differentiate into TCM and TEM cells (112, 113). While the phenomenon has not been observed in the lungs, experiments aimed to reconfirm the unstability of TRM cells are still ongoing.Specifically, TRM cells have different populations. For instance, CD4+ TRM cells have distinct subsets, including Th1, Th2, and Th17 TRM cells (114). Influenza-specific CD4+ TRM cells characterize as Th1-like TRM cells secreting IFN-γ and IL-2 and contribute to enhanced protection against influenza (15, 34, 115). Th1 TRM cells provide protection against influenza reinfection and influenza matrix protein ectodomain (M2e)-specific Th17 TRM cells are stimulated through intranasal immunization with M2e adjuvanted with CTA1-DD, generating strong protection against influenza (15, 116). Conversely, in the BAL collected from patients with severe COVID-19, Th17 TRM cells persisted even after virus clearance. These Th17 TRM cells expressing IL-17A and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are potentially pathogenic cytokines and can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, influencing lung injury (117). Little is known about Th2 TRM cells in respiratory virus infection. Th2 CD4+ TRM cells in the peritoneum mediated protective immunity against helminths in mouse intestinal Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection (118). A key research question that needs to be addressed is whether distinct TRM subsets play different roles in reinfection of the same pathogen.TRM cells exhibit consolidated protection against RSV and influenza, and probable effects on SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, therapeutic strategies targeting TRM cells are good and promising choices to cope with respiratory viruses. This illustrates the bright future of vaccines based on TRM cells in response to respiratory virus. Considering their diverse roles, we may adopt antagonism when TRM cells turn pathogenic. For instance, employing CpG, an agonist of Toll-like receptor, and Il685458, a Notch pathway inhibitor, can ease the airway inflammation caused by formalin-inactivated vaccine, which once failed in prevention of exacerbation of lung disease (119, 120). We believe that insightful application of TRM cells is key to protective mucosal immunity generated by future universal vaccine candidates.Author contributionsMZ and ZJ contributed to the central idea and coordinated the writing of the manuscript.

Kwangdong has been handling the local distribution of Fluarix Tetra since last year. This year, the company plans to expand the vaccine distribution to all clinics and hospitals’ pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, family medicine, and orthopedic departments. Kwangdong Pharmaceutical is to distribute GSK’s four-strain influenza vaccine Fluarix Tetra to prepare for the influenza season in Korea. Kwangdong said it would have Fluarix Tetra ready on the market from September to ensure that Koreans get a smooth flu vaccine supply. Generally, influenza season begins in November, and physicians recommend flu vaccinations from September, considering the time for the vaccine’s effect to emerge. Kwangdong said Fluarix Tetra was the world’s first four-strain influenza vaccine to obtain FDA approval. It is also the nation’s first quadrivalent flu vaccine to win approval from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. Researchers confirmed the safety data of Fluarix Tetra in clinical trials on patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and cerebrovascular diseases. GSK manufactures the vaccine in Germany, France, and Belgium. tweet Kim Chan-hyuk kch@docdocdoc.co.kr See Other Articles Copyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited News That You Haven't Seen Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Falls and trips, primary reasons for older adults’ injuries, while youngsters must be careful about electric scooters 'Stem cell therapy shows potential to improve bladder function in diabetic patients' [Interview] ‘Pediatric care will revive, so don't give up and stay with us’ Potential new cure found for treating glioblastoma resistant to immunotherapy Huons to acquire PanGen Biotech to boost biopharma R&D, CDMO biz Philips Korea to launch digital pathology reference site at Seoul Clinical Laboratories Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Comments Log In 작성자 비밀번호 댓글 내용입력 0 / 400 Submit 댓글 정렬 Newest Recommended Top Comments BEST Comments BEST Comments It is automatically exposed by adding up the number of replies and recommendations. 닫기 More Delete comments Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

This Group Says Not to Release Any Amid Avian Flu Fears The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says the release of more than 55 million farm-raised birds could lead to a "catastrophic spread" of avian influenza in the region By Dac Collins Posted on Aug 11, 2022 5:35 PM EDT Pen-raised pheasants are a vital part of the UK's hunting culture, but some are saying they shouldn't be released in the midst of a bird flu outbreak. ODFW Share Released game birds provide the bulk of opportunities for wing shooters in the UK. In a typical year, governments in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales will release more than 55 million farm-raised pheasants, partridge, and ducks during the lead-up to hunting season. This isn’t a typical year for birds, however, as High Path Avian Influenza has spread across the globe, affecting tens of thousands of wild birds and millions of domesticated birds in recent months. The UK is experiencing its most severe bird flu outbreak in history, with seabirds being hit especially hard by the disease. For this reason, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is calling for an immediate moratorium on game bird releases in 2022. “The urgent call is for governments and the hunting industry to take a fully precautionary approach to the release of potentially infected captive birds, to limit the further catastrophic spread of avian influenza in wild birds,” the RSPB wrote in a press release. The England-based RSPB explained that pheasants raised in commercial facilities in the UK have tested positive for HPAI at least 13 times since 2018. The group says that while the spread of HPAI from farm-raised pheasants to wild birds has not been scientifically proven, a precautionary approach is necessary to protect wild bird populations that are already struggling. They also pointed to a 2014 study from the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency, which found, among other things, that “releasing apparently healthy game birds into the wild poses a risk of [avian flu] transmission to other birds.” Reinforcing the RSPB’s concern is the fact that the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus was first identified in a population of domestic waterfowl in China. It was then passed on to wild birds, many of which are migratory species, contributing to its long-range spread across the globe. The most recent (and ongoing) wave of the virus was first detected in Canadian waterfowl populations last December. The first confirmed case in the United States was discovered the following month in a wigeon that was shot by a South Carolina duck hunter. Since then, HPAI has been detected in 40 states in the US, killing a substantial number of wild ducks and geese in the process. In April, a poultry worker in Colorado tested positive for avian influenza, although the Center for Disease Control says the current risk to the general public remains low. Read Next: Is Bird Flu a Threat to Wild Ducks and Geese? Here’s What All Hunters Need to Know Regardless, states like Texas and Wyoming have already euthanized entire flocks of pen-raised game birds this year in locations where HPAI was detected. And while the elimination of these birds will have a nominal effect on hunting opportunities in these states when compared to the moratorium proposed by the RSPB, both actions were proposed out of an abundance of caution for wild bird and domestic poultry populations. “In recent months we have witnessed an unfolding catastrophe taking place on our wild birds. It has been emotionally tough to witness, but we are not helpless and there are many positive actions that we can take to help them weather this storm and reduce the risk of exacerbating this crisis,” RSPB’s director of policy Jeff Knott said on Wednesday. “We must all now take responsibility and do everything we can to limit the impact in the immediate term.” Hunting Upland Bird Hunting Waterfowl Hunting Summary Due to the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the UK, some conservationists are calling for the immediate ban of game bird releases in the region.

Most cases are from the National Referral Hospital in Honiara and Kilufi in Malaita.Around 194 cases were recorded as of last week from the Health surveillance sentinel sites in Honiara and Malaita. While reports from other provinces are being compiled for submission to the National Surveillance Department of Health, it is likely that it will spread to other provinces due to inter-island travels.Molecular testing for the type of virus causing the increase of flu cases shows multiple respiratory organisms identified to be the cause. These include Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Influenza A (H3), and Adenovirus that are the main causes of the common cold.Testing of COVID-19 was also performed for all samples collected and tested and so far, none of them returned a positive test.All age groups are affected by this however there is an increasing number of young children being admitted at the NRH Emergency Department.As part of its response, our NRH has enhanced the capacity to respond to the ILI at its Emergency Department with the positioning of a paediatrician and 2 registered nurses, and 1 intern for full-time at ED. All children are triaged into a respiratory section of the ED where they are seen and managed together with the ED doctors.Oxygen concentrators and medications including bronchodilators – inhalers and nebulizers are also at the ED. Most children are stabilized and discharged however risks still remain.The public is therefore urged to take the following precautionary or preventative measures similar to that of COVID-19: 1. Avoiding close contact with the person showing flu-like symptoms of running nose, fever, and coughing2. Wear face masks in crowded places or when traveling on public transport and entering public spaces and buildings3. Continuous practice of hand washing with soap and water or hand sanitizer4. And good coughing etiquette (Cough in elbow).5. School children with influenza-like illness (flu) symptoms should not go to the school to avoid spreading it to other children.6. All Honiara residents to visit Honiara City Council clinics first and only present at NRH once referred.Most of the infections caused by these viruses are self-limiting and do not require hospitalization. Children with respiratory diseases, heart problems etc are at increased risk of hospitalization. Adults with co-existing conditions such as heart or respiratory diseases, diabetes and elderly etc are also at increased risk of getting serious infection.There is no treatment for viral infections however supportive care is recommended to treat the symptoms. It includes drinking of plenty fluids, and eating fresh healthy foods.If symptoms such as shortness of breath, continuous high fever, and vomiting persist for a longer period and worsen, please go to the nearest hospital or clinic.– MHMSCategories: News, News - NationalBy Sol Star NewsAugust 11, 2022 Share this post Share on FacebookShare on Facebook Share on XShare on X Pin itShare on Pinterest Share on LinkedInShare on LinkedIn Author: Sol Star News Post navigationPreviousPrevious post:Wale tells gov’t to deal with TRC as it isNextNext post:Minister Kopu praises PRC for support towards governmentRelated postsTwo SIPSP advisors join RSIPFNovember 11, 2024Gold buyers defy orderNovember 11, 2024Girl who dumps baby pleads guiltyNovember 11, 2024China design team visit Malaita PremierNovember 11, 2024JAC F6 students urged to trust GodNovember 11, 2024Govt officers attend training in AustNovember 11, 2024Malaita qualifies again for PCDFNovember 11, 2024Wale lashes out at $199m discretionary exemptionsNovember 10, 2024 NEWS National Business RegionalSPORTS National RegionalVIEWPOINT Letters to the Editor Private View EditorialFEATURES Go to TopBird flu outbreak on Farne Islands ‘could kill up to 50,000 birds’ | The Independent Stay up to date with notifications from The IndependentNotifications can be managed in browser preferences.Not nowYes pleaseJump to contentAsia EditionChangeUK EditionUS EditionEdición en EspañolSign up to our newslettersSubscribe nowLog in / Register IndependentUS electionBlack FridaySubscribeMenuNewsNewsUKUSWorldUK PoliticsBrexitHealthBusinessScienceSpaceNews VideosSportSportFootballParis 2024 OlympicsFormula 1Rugby UnionCricketTennisBoxingUFCCyclingGolfSport VideosVoicesVoicesEditorialsLettersJohn RentoulMary DejevskyAndrew GriceSean O’GradyCultureCultureFilmTV & RadioMusicGamesBooksArtPhotographyTheatre & DanceCulture VideosLifestyleLifestyleShoppingBeauty Fitness & WellbeingTechMoneyFood & DrinkFashionLove & SexWomenHealth & FamiliesRoyal FamilyMotoringElectric Vehicles Car Insurance Deals Lifestyle VideosIndyBestIndyBestAdvisorHome & GardenTechBroadband dealsFashion & BeautyDealsFood & DrinkKidsBooksTravel & OutdoorsSports & FitnessTravelTravelHotel ReviewsNews & AdviceSimon CalderCruisesUKEuropeUSAAsiaAustralia & New ZealandSouth AmericaC.

Read our privacy policyBetween 30,000 and 50,000 birds are likely to have died so far in a crucial island colony in the UK’s worst bird flu epidemic, National Trust chiefs say.The outbreak of avian flu on the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast has been described as an “unprecedented wildlife tragedy”.And experts fear the virus could spread to internationally significant populations of other types of birds coming to the UK.Last month, wardens in white suits collected around 3,000 bird corpses from the islands.Now that number has risen to 5,000 - but the rangers say actual deaths could be 10 times that number, because many carcasses will not yet have been found.RecommendedBird flu arrives in South Wales as RSPB calls for government actionAs species recover, some threaten others in more dire shape‘Immediate ban’ needed on annual release of 50 million pheasants amid bird flu outbreak, says RSPBThe islands, a national nature reserve, are an internationally important habitat for 23 species and home to about 200,000 seabirds, including guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills and shags, as well as Arctic terns and puffins.Gwen Potter from the trust, which cares for the islands, said they had not seen anything like it before and that cliff-nesting birds such as guillemots and kittiwakes were among the worst affected.Half the islands’ sandwich terns have died, she told Radio 4’s PM.And she called for more government resources to investigate bird flu transmission and an action plan for all four UK countries.Fears are rising that bird flu will continue to spread and devastate seabird populations. More than 300 outbreaks have been reported in British colonies so far.The National Trust team of rangers clear deceased birds from Staple Island (PA)Tom Stewart, of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), told The Times: “There is no doubt that this outbreak of avian influenza is the most severe ever recorded among British wild birds.“We have now come to the time of year at which these colonies begin to break up, with birds dispersing around this country and elsewhere.“There is a serious risk that these movements, which we are not able to control, will introduce avian influenza into other bird communities, including the internationally significant populations of wintering waders and wildfowl that have already begun to arrive in the UK.”Some scientists say intensive chicken farms are potential “mixing pots” for new, deadly viruses, and animal charities have blamed factory farming for fomenting bird flu.The RSPB has called for an immediate suspension of the release of gamebirds and wildfowl for shooting in the UK, warning they could spread the disease to even more species.RecommendedScottish island listed for sale for two thirds of the average London house priceBird flu could have a ‘devastating impact’ on UK’s seabirds, RSPB warnsPheasants in the UK have tested positive for bird flu 14 times, the charity says.The death toll will not be known for some time as seabirds are long-lived and slow to reproduce. “Only long-term monitoring will reveal whether they are able to recover,” Mr Stewart said.More aboutBirdsNational TrustNorthumberlandavian fluvirusesJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/2Bird flu outbreak on Farne Islands ‘could kill up to 50,000 birds’Bird flu outbreak on Farne Islands ‘could kill up to 50,000 birds’The National Trust team of rangers clear deceased birds from Staple IslandPABird flu outbreak on Farne Islands ‘could kill up to 50,000 birds’A National Trust ranger clears deceased birds from Staple Island, one of the Outer Group of the Farne Islands, off the coast of Northumberland, where the impact of Avian Influenza is having a devastating effectPA✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rheumatic DiseasesNewsNew Vaccination Guidance Released for People With Rheumatic DiseasesExpanded indications, medication timing around vaccination, and live attenuated vaccines are included in the American College of Rheumatology's update.ByRachael RobertsonMedically ReviewedbyAlexa Meara, MDPublished on August 10, 2022Afraid getting vaccinated may trigger a flare? Talk to your doctor, especially if you’re on immunosuppressive meds.Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesGet ready to roll up your sleeve and get jabbed. People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus, and other rheumatic diseases may find that they are eligible for more vaccinations now that the guidance has been updated.Earlier this month, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) released a summary of new vaccination recommendations for people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD). The new guidelines do not address COVID-19 vaccination, which was the focus of the last ACR update, in 2021. Instead, the new guidelines are focused on risk reduction for flu, pneumonia, and other potentially serious diseases.What’s New About ACR’s 2022 Vaccine Guidance There are expanded indications for some vaccines, tweaks about vaccination timing around other treatments and other vaccines, and more recommendations for live or adjuvanted vaccines.Adjuvanted means that an extra ingredient is added to the vaccine to help boost the body’s immune response. Live vaccines use an attenuated (weakened) form of the germ that causes the disease.“Giving high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended over giving regular-dose influenza vaccination,” says ACR spokesperson Anne R. Bass, MD, professor of clinical medicine at the Hospital for Special Surgery and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.Vaccine Indications Were Broadened (to Include More People With RDM)People, including those under age 65, who are on immunosuppressive medications to treat RMD should receive the adjuvanted flu shot. (Previous advice called for this only for RMD patients over 65.)Despite active disease, treatment with steroids, or use of rituximab, people with RMD should get the seasonal flu shotAdults on immunosuppressive medications for RMD should get the pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine.Vaccine Questions, Concerns Sparked More Direction From ACRWhile doctors have questions regarding how the rheumatic disease itself, or the drugs used to treat it, interferes with vaccine efficacy, people living with RMD may worry that the vaccinations will trigger a flare-up. These guidelines were issued to address the concerns of patients as well as doctors, Bass said in a press statement.Daniel Hernandez, MD, director of medical affairs and Hispanic outreach for the arthritis advocacy and research organization CreakyJoints, says that rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic disease patients have been voicing a lot of questions about vaccines.“ACR is making a strong statement that a seasonal flu vaccine and a pneumococcal vaccine should be two to prioritize in your next discussion with your rheumatologist,” says Dr. Hernandez.Generally speaking, the changes will mean briefer wait times between shots. The new guidance specifies vaccination timing for people on immunosuppressive meds for RMD.Highlights on Timing Recommendations in Updated Vaccination Recommendations Less spacing between meds and vax. The new guidance shortens the interval between the last dose of a biologic DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) and the administration of a live attenuated vaccine.Take more than one vaccine at once. Multiple vaccinations on the same day rather than getting each individual vaccination on a different day is conditionally recommended.New Suggestions Will Start Conversations About Safety, Insurance Coverage While the broadened recommendation for an adjuvanted influenza vaccination is a departure from previous guidance, Bass notes that there haven’t been safety issues in those who have been taking the high-dose flu shot, and while insurance coverage outside of the typical age range remains to be seen, “the guidelines itself will be a useful resource when discussing reimbursement with insurance companies.”Other viruses covered in the new vax guidelines include shingles and human papillomavirus. The full guidelines will be submitted for publication in forthcoming issues of Arthritis and Rheumatology and Arthritis Care and Research, according to the ACR.Consult With Your Doctor, and Aim to Make Vaccination Decisions TogetherTreating autoimmune diseases is complex. Getting vaccinated is important for long-term health and preventing disease. In addition to being at higher risk for severe diseases, being immunocompromised means vaccines can be trickier.Michael Schweitz, MD, a retired rheumatologist in Florida and medical adviser to CreakyJoints, says that this new guidance plays into the complex treatment of autoimmune diseases.“The effects of immunosuppressive medications on vaccine efficiency and risk, as well as the effect of vaccines on disease impact, has continually been a concern,” says Dr. Schweitz. “The American College of Rheumatology guidelines provide important information and guidance for both physicians and patients, to help those with the diseases make rational vaccination decisions.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkAlexa Meara, MDMedical ReviewerAlexa Meara, MD, is an assistant professor of immunology and rheumatology at The Ohio State University.

It has prompted a private hospital to create an H1N1 ward, which is unprecedented. Image used for representative purpose only KOLKATA: Waning of the Covid surge has been followed by a spurt in viral infections that have laid thousands of Kolkatans low, including a spread of the H1N1 virus or the swine flu - a respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract and results in a barking cough, decreased appetite and nasal secretions apart from other symptoms.It has prompted a private hospital to create an H1N1 ward, which is unprecedented.At least three private hospitals have around 25 swine flu patients admitted along with several others suffering from Influenza A, rhinovirus and other undetected viruses that strike routinely during this time of the year. But doctors pointed out that the Covid outbreak had restricted the transmission of other viruses over the last two years. With the pandemic receding, they are now taking over, they said.Woodlands Hospital has set up a swine flu ward, carving out beds from its Covid unit. "We have 14 swine flu/ H1N1 and three H3N1 patients admitted now, which is high even though mid-monsoon marks the start of the influenza season. It is necessary to ensure that these patients are properly isolated in the hospital, which is why we have set up a separate H1N1 unit," said Woodlands CEO Rupali Basu.Peerless Hospital has five swine flu patients admitted even as scores have sought treatment for other viral infections over the last one week. " Since it is highly contagious and often leads to a sudden deterioration, these patients are under round-the-clock screening. We didn't see so many swine flu admissions over the last two years," said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. CMRI has several swine flu admissions other than those afflicted with other viruses. "Over the last two weeks, we have seen a spurt in non-Covid virals that are more likely to be secondary infections like Influenza A, rhinovirus or H1N1," said CMRI pulmonology director Raja Dhar. AMRI has around 15-20 H1N1 patients admitted across its three centres. "There has been a spurt in swine flu cases over the last fortnight," said CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences has a dengue patient and a viral pneumonia patient admitted.Spread of other viruses like H1N1 is a sign that Covid is waning, said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar. "Since we have passed the peak and the wave has declined, the percentage of Covid infections has dropped and other viral infections have taken over," he said.KMC has asked the medical officers to arrange for three types of tests - dengue, malaria and Covid-19 - for patients with fever. "These tests will help to start the treatment at the earliest," said mayor Firhad Hakim.Once a patient is tested positive for dengue, the medical officer would connect with the family over phone inquiring about the health of the patient regularly.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previousâ10 spotted animals and their distinct markingsâLifestyle8 habits to train your brain for peace and happinessLifestyle10 brain-boosting activities based on ancient Indian traditionsLifestyle8 Healthy South Indian dinner ideasFoodâ10 animals that use tools to get work done like humansâLifestyleHow to make perfect Lentil soup (Dal soup) for feverFoodâ10 behavior kids copy directly from their momâLifestyleâ10 birds with names starting with the letter MLifestyle10 health benefits of doing pranayamLifestyle10 healthy breakfasts from different parts of the worldFood Next123 Photostories 5 signs of a master manipulator, as per psychology5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthBigg Boss Kannada 11: Confirmed list of contestants of Kiccha Sudeep hosted show Bigg Boss Kannada 115 body language tips to appear more confident5 sneakers you should stay away from; a Nike shoe is also on the list!Exclusive -

Here are the best ways to avoid getting sick with COVID-19, monkeypox or the fluBy Phoebe HosierTopic:COVID-19Sun 7 Aug 2022Sunday 7 August 2022Sun 7 Aug 2022 at 7:54pmDisplay captionThe Ekka has returned after a two-year hiatus. (ABC News: Alex Papp)abc.net.auews/qld-coronavirus-covid19-influenza-ekka-show-how-to-not-get-sick/101308802Link copiedShareShare articleAs throngs of people flock to the Ekka showgrounds, authorities are concerned about a potential spike in COVID-19 and influenza cases in the Queensland community.A string of illnesses remain in the community with COVID cases still high, the flu season not yet over and cases of monkeypox being reported interstate.With some 1,300 head of cattle at the showgrounds, health authorities have also added a potentially devastating foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak to their list of concerns, though the risk remains low. Back after a two-year COVID-induced hiatus, Ekka crowds have exceeded expectations with people steadily streaming through the gates.Virologist Lara Herrero said the Ekka event would inevitably lead to a spike in transmission of both COVID and the flu."I have absolutely no doubt there will be an increase in transmission for an event like that — it's simple mathematics," she said.Lara Herrero says the Ekka is likely to cause a jump in cases. (Supplied: Griffith University)So how can you safely hit the Ekka to devour a dagwood dog without getting sick?Here are Dr Herrero's five key pieces of advice:1. Don't get slackDr Herrero reminded those heading to the show to stay vigilant by employing all the usual tactics."Monitor for any symptoms at all," she said."Try your best to keep that 1.5 metres of social distancing where you can."Bring your own alcohol wipes and hand sanitiser."Avoid shaking hands and hugging — I would still opt to fist bump or wave."2. Wear a maskQueenslanders at Brisbane's Ekka Show — some masked up and others not. (ABC News: Marton Dobras)You know the drill.Free masks will be available upon entry to the showgrounds. If in doubt, mask up.Queensland Agriculture Minister Mark Furner said he was impressed with the "reasonable amount of people wearing a mask"."Bring your mask along or get one on entry, make sure you're protected and you'll have no issues," he said.Queensland Health has encouraged everyone at the Ekka to wear a face mask, "not only for themselves but for every other person who is there to celebrate safely".Dr Herrero said she had no doubt people who live in the regions that come to the Ekka and return home to regional and rural areas will bring infection back with them."We have more cases in the city because we have more people, we're living in a high-density community with more cases."So by sheer numbers, I have no doubt transmission in the regions will go up."It's a good idea for those people returning to regional and remote areas to wear a mask for 24-48 hours to stop transmission to vulnerable people."3. Stay away if unwell"The Ekka is all about community spirit so if you have any symptoms, no matter how mild, have a bit of community spirit and stay at home," Dr Herrero said.Mr Furner advised anyone feeling under the weather to stay well away from the showgrounds, get tested and isolate."We don't want people coming here spreading illness, whether it be the flu or COVID," he said."Keep away if you're feeling unwell and get tested."4. Wash your shoes and clothes of foreign dirtEkka show visitors should maintain good hand hygiene when playing with theagricultral animals amid fears of a foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak. (ABC News: Marton Dobras)The Ekka show is the largest showing of stud beef in the southern hemisphere with some 1,300 head of cattle at the showgrounds.This has sparked fears of a foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak that could cost the industry an estimated $80 billion.Federal Agriculture Minister Murray Wyatt estimated there was an 11.6 per cent risk of a potentially devastating outbreak occurring which would trigger a 72-hour national livestock standstill and longer-term movement controls on animals.A preventative task force has been established with border security on-site.Dr Herrero strongly advised people who live in agricultural areas to wash their shoes and clothes of dirt or mud from any other agricultural region to avoid an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.5. Get vaccinatedMonkeypox vaccine is not yet available to the Australian public.

Iloilo City Mayor Jerry P. Treñas on Thursday (Aug. 11, 2022) issued Executive Order 43 extending the temporary ban on the entry of live poultry and/or non-poultry, poultry products, and by-products from areas affected by avian influenza in Luzon and Mindanao. The mayor cited the need to protect the city’s poultry industry and the consumers. (PNA file photo) ILOILO CITY – Iloilo City on Thursday declared an indefinite ban on all live birds, chicken, poultry products, and by-products from areas in Luzon and Mindanao where there is still a bird flu outbreak.“The continuing avian influenza outbreak from Luzon and Mindanao and the reported cases prevalent to the regions situated thereto call for the continued implementation of the temporary ban on entry of related products, which may endanger not only our local poultry industry but also for the unknown risks that this outbreak may cause to the consuming public,” according to Executive Order 43 released by Iloilo City Mayor Jerry P. Treñas.The order took effect immediately and extended the ban first declared in EO 6 issued on July 6, 2022.The ban covers all live birds (poultry and non-poultry), including day-old chicks, pullets, hatching eggs, ready-to-lay pullets, semen, fresh eggs, embryonated eggs, manure, ducks, quails, and other poultry products and by-products.Pigeons for racing, flying, training, breeding, and other related activities and gamefowls originating or have traveled to the affected area and intending to return to the city are also prohibited.Live ducks for grazing, and transport or movement of table eggs, salted eggs, quail eggs, ready-to-lay eggs, and embryonated eggs are also prohibited from entering the city.Exempted from the ban, however, is the trans-shipment of imported day-old chicks, day-old pullets, hatching eggs, and imported gamefowls from international airports and seaports.The local government will also allow the entry of poultry meat from Luzon and Mindanao provided that the shipment has a Meat Inspection Certificate for domestic meat products and a Certificate of Meat Inspection for imported meat products issued by the National Meat Inspection Service.The certificates must be accompanied by a shipping permit from the Bureau of Animal Industry.“Strict implementation of quarantine inspections shall be imposed at all ports of entry,” the order indicated.The City Veterinary Office, in coordination with concerned offices of the Department of Agriculture, was also directed to inspect all regulatory requirements of incoming poultry and non-poultry products, as well as conduct surveillance of critical and risk areas and collect samples for avian influenza screening.

By August 5, there were 260 patients.A major reason for the spike, officials said, was overcrowding and large movement of people.The number of suspected cases - people with symptoms such as fever and breathlessness - is currently at 377. As of August 5, 200 people were undergoing treatment for H1N1 infection -35 of them were suspected patients while 165 were confirmed positives.Hospitalisations were at 129 on August 1, when city hospitals had reported eight deaths with about 213 suspected cases. But on Friday (August 5), the number of deaths within PMC limits was at 10 - three of the fatalities were residents of PMC areas.The number of H1N1 patients on ventilator support has also increased, health department data showed. On August 1, there were eight critical patients; by August 5, there were 14.Dr Sanjay Gaikwad, pulmonologist at Sassoon General Hospital and BJ Medical College said, "We are seeing a major rise in the number of H1N1 patients and case severity is also high. Cases are now much higher compared to the last two years." He added that the wari procession may be a key reason for the spike. "Most of the patients we have had attended the wari. So we suspect crowding and mass movement after the procession likely caused the increase in infections," said Dr Gaikwad, adding that cases may go up again during the Ganesh festival and Diwali later this year. "I don't think we'll hit the levels we had during the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic. But it is distressing to see severe cases this year as people are losing their lives. Hospital infrastructure is also burdened," he said.In 2009, a new H1N1 influenza virus emerged, causing the first global flu pandemic in 40 years. It would later be called the Swine Flu pandemic of 2009. That year Pune recorded nearly 144 H1N1 deaths. Between 2009 and 2019, Maharashtra recorded over 3,600 deaths and more than 33,00 cases. The PMC recorded just over 6,800 cases during this period.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previousâ10 spotted animals and their distinct markingsâLifestyle8 habits to train your brain for peace and happinessLifestyle10 brain-boosting activities based on ancient Indian traditionsLifestyle8 Healthy South Indian dinner ideasFoodâ10 animals that use tools to get work done like humansâLifestyleHow to make perfect Lentil soup (Dal soup) for feverFoodâ10 behavior kids copy directly from their momâLifestyleâ10 birds with names starting with the letter MLifestyle10 health benefits of doing pranayamLifestyle10 healthy breakfasts from different parts of the worldFood Next123 Photostories 5 traditional Indian hair oils for hair growthIndian states with the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage SitesHow tall are Trump family membersTirupati Laddu Controversy: Pawan Kalyan, Suriya, Prakash Raj;
