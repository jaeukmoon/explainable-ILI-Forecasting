The vRNP is responsible for transcription and replication of the vRNA. However, the vRNP conformation during RNA synthesis is not well understood. Here, using high-speed atomic force microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy, we investigated the native structure of influenza A vRNPs during RNA synthesis in vitro. Two distinct types of vRNPs were observed in association with newly synthesized RNAs: an intact, helical rod-shaped vRNP connected with a folded RNA and a deformed vRNP associated with a looped RNA. Interestingly, the looped RNA was a double-stranded RNA, which likely comprises a nascent RNA and the template RNA detached from NPs of the vRNP. These results suggest that while some vRNPs keep their helical structures during RNA synthesis, for the repeated cycle of RNA synthesis, others accidentally become structurally deformed, which likely results in failure to commence or continue RNA synthesis. Thus, our findings provide the ultrastructural feature of vRNPs during RNA synthesis.

Transcription and replication of influenza A virus are carried out by ribonucleoprotein complexes called vRNPs in the nucleus of infected cells. A vRNP comprises a vRNA, multiple copies of nucleoprotein (NP) and a heterotrimeric, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex comprising PB2, PB1 and PA subunits1,2,3,4. Each vRNP adopts a helical, rod-shaped structure, in which a single strand of a multiple NP–RNA complex is folded back on itself and coiled, forming a double-stranded helix with a loop structure at one end5,6. The heterotrimeric RNA polymerase is located opposite to the loop end of the helical rod-shaped vRNP7,8,9.Although influenza virus vRNPs conduct both transcription and replication of the vRNAs, mechanisms of the two processes are quite different. During transcription, the PB2 subunit binds to the 5′-terminal methylated cap structure (m7GpppXm) of host pre-mRNAs10,11, and the PA subunit cleaves the pre-mRNA 10–13 nucleotides downstream from the cap with its endonuclease activity12,13,14. The resultant capped RNA fragment is directed to the PB1 active site where it is used as a primer15. After elongation, a poly(A) tail is added to the 3′ end of the transcript by stuttering of the polymerase on the oligo-U stretch of the template vRNA16,17,18. Hence, the 5′-capped and 3′-polyadenylated viral mRNAs are synthesized in a primer-dependent manner. In contrast, genome replication is thought to be primer-independent19. Replication involves generation of positive-sense complementary RNAs (cRNAs), which are replication intermediates that act as templates for vRNA synthesis. Elongation of a nascent cRNA by cis-acting RNA polymerase proceeds concomitantly with sequential binding of free NPs, forming a rod-shaped, double-helical cRNP complex20,21,22. Afterward, trans-acting or trans-activating RNA polymerase generates vRNAs from intermediate cRNAs21,23,24.Great progress has been made in delineating the molecular mechanisms by which the RNA polymerase conducts transcription and replication based on its atomic structure15,18,24,25,26,27,28,29,30. However, it is the vRNP rather than the RNA polymerase that accomplishes viral genome transcription and replication. Recently, Coloma et al. investigated the structure of the vRNP during in vitro transcription using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and concluded that the vRNPs maintain their double-helical structures during transcription31. However, it remains unclear whether the helical vRNPs they observed are the only conformation of vRNPs producing nascent RNA. Here, to further characterize RNA synthesis from an ultrastructural perspective, we analysed virion-derived vRNPs producing nascent RNAs during in vitro RNA synthesis, using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) and cryo-EM. The combination of these two techniques enabled us to clearly visualize and characterize the native structures of vRNPs producing nascent RNAs.ResultsVirion-derived vRNPs produce both mRNA and cRNA in vitroIt has been reported that vRNPs isolated from influenza virions synthesize both mRNA and cRNA in vitro by adding ApG or globin mRNA as a primer32. To investigate the structure of vRNP during RNA synthesis, we purified vRNPs from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virions and performed in vitro RNA synthesis using primers in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. Autoradiography of the RNA products after electrophoresis showed bands corresponding to the eight vRNAs of influenza A virus in a 15-min incubation after the reactions (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Treatment of an influenza virus RNA polymerase inhibitor, 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (T-705RTP)33, decreased the band intensity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b), confirming that RNAs are synthesized from virion-derived vRNPs.Fig. 1: HS-AFM observation of vRNPs during RNA synthesis.a Primer-dependent in vitro RNA synthesis using virion-derived vRNPs. RNA was synthesized in vitro using ApG or globin mRNA as a primer with 30 min incubation. As a negative control, the reaction mixture was used without primer. A mixture of eight influenza A virus vRNA segments (Pols indicates 3 polymerases, PB2, PB1, and PA) transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase was loaded in the leftmost lane (T7) for evaluation of sizes of the newly synthesized RNAs. b Inhibition of in vitro RNA synthesis by T-705RTP. RNA was synthesized in vitro using ApG in the presence of the indicated concentration of T-705RTP. All purified RNA samples were analysed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and detected by autoradiography. Uncropped autoradiograph images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. c As a negative control for the HS-AFM observation, the reaction mixture omitting a primer was used. d–h Virion-derived vRNPs were subjected to in vitro RNA synthesis using ApG as a primer. After incubation for 0 min (d) or 15 min (c, e–h), samples were observed with HS-AFM. Folded and looped RNAs associated with the helical (e, f) and deformed vRNPs (g, h), respectively, were observed as indicated by arrows at the different positions in the same samples. Scale bars on all images represent 50 nm.Full size imageThen, to determine whether vRNPs produce both cRNA and mRNA, we performed strand-specific reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the NP and NA genes34. Although the ApG-primed polyadenylated RNAs are not capped at the 5′ end, in the present study, we defined the RNA product as mRNA. Non-specific amplification was barely detectable (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In the absence of the primers, cRNA and mRNA were hardly detected, except for NP mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). Addition of either ApG or globin mRNA primer resulted in production of 1 × 105 copies μL−1 to 5 × 106 copies μL−1 of cRNA and mRNA of both NP and NA segments (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). These results demonstrated that virion-derived vRNPs produce both cRNA and mRNA in the presence of primers. Since there was no significant difference in the level of RNA production between ApG-primed and globin mRNA-primed samples, we used ApG as a primer in subsequent ultrastructural analysis.During RNA synthesis, vRNPs show two distinctive structuresAlthough vRNPs are helical rod-shaped structures in a static state, it is possible that they may change their conformations during RNA synthesis. To investigate near-native vRNP structures producing nascent RNA, we employed HS-AFM, which can provide topographic images in solution by scanning sample surfaces with a probe tip, without fixation or staining35. After in vitro RNA synthesis using primers in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates, vRNPs were adsorbed onto a mica substrate and were visualized in solution. Without the primer, after in vitro RNA synthesis, vRNPs appeared as rod-shaped structures with helical grooves (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3), which is typical of vRNP structures visualized by negative-staining EM5. The vRNPs visualized by HS-AFM showed a right-handed helical structure (Supplementary Fig. 3). Immediately after adding ApG primer (0 min), vRNPs maintained helical rod-shaped structures (Fig. 1d). However, after a 15-min incubation with ApG primer, vRNPs showed distinctive structures that were associated with potentially nascent RNA. On the basis of their configurations, we classified vRNP–RNA complexes into two groups: helical rod-shaped vRNPs associated with a folded RNA (Fig. 1e, f, Supplementary Fig. 4), and deformed vRNPs associated with a looped RNA (Fig. 1g, h). The configuration of vRNPs bound to the folded RNA appeared similar to those of control vRNPs (Fig. 1c). Their diameters were almost uniform and helical grooves could be observed along entire rod-shaped vRNPs, suggesting no apparent conformational changes. Folded RNAs, which appeared to contain some secondary structures, were associated not only with the tip (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 4a) but also with the bodies of helical rod-shaped vRNPs (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig. 4b). By contrast, the configuration of vRNPs associated with looped RNAs was substantially deformed, such that helical grooves of the vRNPs had disappeared (Fig. 1g, h). The percentages of helical vRNPs with folded RNAs and deformed vRNPs with looped RNAs in all observed vRNPs were 8.40% and 3.63%, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). vRNPs associated with looped RNA comprised 30.2% of all vRNP–RNA complexes (N = 96).To exclude the possibility that vRNPs became physically deformed after being tapped with the AFM probe tip, we observed unstained frozen-hydrated samples of vRNP–RNA complexes using cryo-EM. Both helical rod-shaped vRNPs associated with folded RNA (Fig. 2a) and deformed vRNPs associated with looped RNA (Fig. 2b) appeared similar to those observed with HS-AFM, suggesting that deformation of vRNPs occurs during RNA synthesis. To further investigate the configuration of vRNP–RNA complexes in more detail, we performed low-dose cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to analyse their three-dimensional structure. A vRNP without in vitro RNA synthesis showed a double-helical structure with several grooves (Fig. 2c), consistent with vRNPs reconstructed by single-particle cryo-EM7,8,31. The tomographic reconstruction of a deformed vRNP was able to resolve the continuous RNA loop associated with the deformed vRNP (Fig. 2d), where both ends of the loop structure were located relatively close to each other on the deformed vRNP, suggesting that the viral RNA polymerase exists at the looped-RNA-binding site, although its structure was not resolved. Interestingly, we found that the vRNP partially maintained a double-helical structure at one end, and that only the portion to which both ends of the looped RNA were bound was deformed (Fig. 2d), suggesting that deformation of the helical rod-shaped vRNP likely participates in RNA synthesis. Unfortunately, a folded RNA associated with rod-shaped vRNP could not be technically reconstructed, because the folded RNAs had a pleomorphic structure and were not visible enough for cryo-ET due to the low-contrast images from cryo-EM.Fig. 2: Cryo-EM observation of vRNPs during RNA synthesis.An in vitro RNA-synthesis reaction was performed in the presence of ApG, and was observed with cryo-EM in vitreous ice.

The vRNP and RNA are coloured in blue and red, respectively. Scale bars on all images represent 20 nm.Full size imageBoth folded and looped RNAs associated with vRNPs are viral RNA productsNext, to determine whether the observed folded and looped RNAs are products synthesized by vRNPs, we used a nucleotide analogue, 5-bromo-UTP (Br-UTP), for in vitro RNA synthesis. When Br-UTP was used for in vitro RNA synthesis instead of UTP, both folded and looped RNAs associated with vRNPs were similarly observed (Fig. 3a, b, respectively). Upon incubation with the antibody, which reacts with Br-UTP present only in single-stranded RNA, specific binding of the antibody to the folded RNAs was observed (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 5), whereas the antibody did not react with folded RNAs produced by in vitro RNA synthesis using UTP (Fig. 3e), indicating that the folded RNAs are single-stranded, nascent RNAs synthesized by the associated vRNPs. By contrast, the antibody did not bind to looped RNAs produced during in vitro RNA synthesis using Br-UTP (Fig. 3d) or UTP (Fig. 3f). Because the looped RNA had no secondary structure, we presumed that it might be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). To test this hypothesis, RNase for digesting either single-stranded RNA (RNase A) or dsRNA (RNase III) was added to the looped RNAs and examined in situ using HS-AFM. With RNase A treatment, one end of the looped RNA was often detached from the vRNP and became straight; however, the looped RNA itself was not digested, suggesting that it is double stranded, except at one end (Fig. 4a, Supplementary movie 1). By contrast, RNase III digested looped RNAs (Fig. 4b, Supplementary movie 2). Upon binding, the RNase III molecule immediately digested the RNA, which was further shortened by sequential binding of more RNase III molecules, confirming that the looped RNA was dsRNA. This finding was further verified using anti-dsRNA antibody. The antibodies efficiently recognized the looped RNA associated with vRNPs (Fig. 4c, Supplementary movie 3), while only a few antibody molecules were bound to parts of the folded RNA, probably through stem-loop regions within the single-stranded RNA (Fig. 4d, Supplementary movie 4). We then determined whether influenza viruses generate dsRNA during RNA synthesis. To address this, Vero cells were infected with PR8 virus and subjected to immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using an anti-dsRNA antibody. At 10 h post-infection, dsRNAs were detected in the nucleus of infected cells (Fig. 4e). Although the number of dsRNA-positive virus-infected cells was small (0.16% of infected cells; N = 9153), dsRNA was not detected in mock-infected cells (Fig. 4e), suggesting that influenza viruses produce dsRNA, and that the deformed vRNP structures associating with the looped RNA might also be produced in the infected cells.Fig. 3: Incorporation of Br-UTP into newly synthesized RNAs.a–d Br-UTP was used for in vitro RNA synthesis instead of UTP and HS-AFM images were taken without (a, b) or with (c, d) adding an antibody against Br-UTP. Binding of anti-Br-UTP antibodies was confirmed on folded RNAs (c, arrows) while no binding was observed on looped RNAs (d). Section analysis of the image (c) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. e, f vRNPs were in vitro transcribed using UTP and anti-Br-UTP antibody was added to the mixture. Each of these results was reproduced at least three times. Scale bars, 50 nm.Full size imageFig. 4: Production of a double-stranded RNA by vRNP.a, b Digestion of looped RNAs with RNases. During HS-AFM observation of looped RNA associated with vRNP, RNase A (a) or RNase III (b) was added to the liquid chamber at a final concentration of 0.5 μg mL−1 or 0.02 U μL−1, respectively. Five images were arbitrarily selected from each movie at the indicated times. One end of the looped RNA was detached from vRNP by adding RNase A at the position indicated by arrows (a). By contrast, RNase III digested looped RNA where the RNase bound (b, arrows). Scale bars represent 100 nm. c, d Binding of anti-dsRNA antibodies to RNA associated with the vRNP. Antibodies bound to looped RNA (c) and to folded RNA (d) are indicated by arrows. Results were reproduced at least five times. Scale bars in c, d represent 50 nm. e Detection of dsRNA in virus-infected cells by IFA. Vero cells were infected with influenza virus PR8 strain at MOI of 1. Infected cells were fixed at 10 h post-infection and double-stained with anti-NP and anti-dsRNA antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Scale bars, 20 μm.Full size imageNext, to determine whether double-stranded, looped RNA contains nascent RNA, we used 5-ethynyl-UTP (EUTP) for in vitro RNA synthesis and evaluated its incorporation into looped RNAs using Click chemistry. A Click reaction with biotin-azide was followed by incubation with streptavidin, and specific binding of streptavidin to looped RNAs was confirmed with HS-AFM (Fig. 5a). However, in the absence of streptavidin (Supplementary Fig. 6a) or a Click reaction (Supplementary Fig. 6b), during in vitro RNA synthesis using UTP as a substrate (Fig. 5b), binding of streptavidin to the looped RNAs was not observed, suggesting that double-stranded, looped RNAs encompass nascent RNAs produced by associated vRNPs. Taken together, these results indicate that both folded and double-stranded, looped RNAs associated with vRNPs are RNA products formed during in vitro RNA synthesis.Fig. 5: incorporation of EUTP into looped RNA.a Confirmation of the incorporation of EUTP into looped RNA using Click chemistry. Streptavidin molecules binding to looped RNA are indicated by arrows. b Negative control of the Click reaction. The sample was prepared using UTP instead of EUTP. Each of these results was reproduced at least three times. Scale bars, 50 nm.Full size imagevRNA is partially dissociated from deformed vRNP associated with looped dsRNAGiven that looped dsRNA contains a single-stranded, nascent RNA, it is likely that its counterpart is the template vRNA dissociated from the deformed vRNP during RNA synthesis. Hence, it is expected that deformed vRNPs have lower structural stability than intact vRNPs due to loss of its vRNA as a structural component. To determine whether deformed vRNPs lose vRNA, at least in part, we examined the structural stability of vRNPs by applying force with the cantilever tip during HS-AFM imaging (Fig. 6). Because vRNAs within vRNPs are sensitive to RNase36, vRNPs treated with a low concentration of RNase A were prepared as control vRNPs lacking intact residential vRNA (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although vRNPs treated with RNase A maintained their helical rod-shaped structures, they were easily broken with significantly less force (Fig. 6a, bottom panel) than untreated vRNPs (Fig. 6a, upper panel). vRNPs associated with folded RNA were physically stable, similar to intact vRNPs, whereas vRNPs associated with double-stranded, looped RNA were broken with significantly less force, similar to RNase A-treated vRNPs (Fig. 6a, b). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that at least some parts of template vRNA are detached from NPs of vRNP during RNA synthesis, resulting in formation of double-stranded, looped RNA with nascent RNA and consequent deformation of helical rod-shaped vRNPs.Fig. 6: Deformation of vRNP by releasing the residential vRNA.a Deformation of vRNPs with the AFM probe tip. vRNP without a nascent RNA, with a folded RNA or with a looped RNA was deformed by applying force with the cantilever tip during the HS-AFM observation. As a control for the vRNP lacking its intact vRNA, the vRNP pre-treated with 0.05 μg mL−1 of RNase A was also deformed. When the vRNP was confirmed as deformed (arrows), the force was measured as described in the Methods. Image sets are representative of 5 vRNPs of each sample and average forces required for deforming vRNPs are calculated. b Structural stability of vRNP during RNA synthesis. The force required for deforming the vRNP without nascent RNA was set as 100% and the relative force of each sample is shown. Significance was determined using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test in R software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Error bars represent the standard deviation of five independent measurements.Full size imageDiscussionvRNP is responsible for transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome; however, the details of its structure during RNA synthesis are not fully understood. Here, we employed HS-AFM and cryo-EM to visualize near-native vRNP structures during RNA synthesis. By combining these techniques, we unambiguously demonstrated that two different types of vRNP–RNA complexes are produced during ApG-primed RNA synthesis: helical rod-shaped vRNPs with folded RNA and deformed non-helical vRNPs with looped dsRNA. Our results suggest that some vRNPs likely maintain their helical structures for repetitive transcription and/or replication; however, other vRNPs likely fail repetitive RNA synthesis due to deformation of their helical structures.During in vitro RNA synthesis using the ApG primer, RT-qPCR confirmed that vRNPs produce not only cRNA but also polyadenylated mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2), although a previous study reported no detection of apparent mRNA production from vRNPs using a primer-extension assay32. This discrepancy could be the methodology employed, as RT-qPCR detects polyadenylation of RNA products at the 3′ end with relatively high sensitivity, whereas primer-extension assays detect the addition of ApG nucleotides to the 5′ end of the RNA products. Production of polyadenylated RNA by in vitro RNA synthesis using the ApG primer can also be confirmed by using purified RNA polymerase37. Additionally, we confirmed that ApG-primed productions of cRNA and mRNA were at similar levels to those primed by globin mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 2). Taken together, these findings suggest that virion-derived vRNPs are able to produce both cRNA and mRNA by ApG priming.One of the largest advantages of using HS-AFM is that it allows visualization of dynamic processes of biological molecules under physiological conditions35. To record RNA synthesis of vRNP by HS-AFM, we performed in vitro RNA-synthesis reactions on mica under various conditions; however, vRNPs on the mica substrate did not produce RNA. For HS-AFM observation, samples must be attached on a flat substrate, which often leads to the loss of sample flexibility. Therefore, we speculated that the vRNPs adsorbed on mica cannot change their helical conformation, which would structurally hinder movement of that viral polymerase on the vRNP. In line with this notion, a recent report by Coloma et al.31 showed that vRNPs cannot produce RNA by ApG priming, when treated with nucleozin, which directly binds NPs and blocks vRNP flexibility. Thus, in the present study, we showed ultrastructures of the vRNPs after in vitro RNA synthesis in a microcentrifuge tube.We found that vRNP synthesizing folded RNA was not greatly deformed and maintained its helical rod-shaped structure (Fig. 1e, f). The helical, rod-shaped configuration of vRNP associated with folded RNA was highly similar to that of vRNPs in a static state. However, we speculated that these two structures are essentially different. In vRNPs in a static state, the RNA polymerase complex exists at the tip of the helical, rod-shaped vRNP7,8,9, whereas in vRNPs that synthesize folded RNA, localization of the RNA polymerase is likely not limited to the tip of the helical, rod-shaped vRNP, given that the folded RNA was not only associated with the tip but also with the body of the rod-shaped vRNP (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 4). In support of this observation, Coloma et al.31 recently reported localization of RNA polymerase on the body of helical, rod-shaped vRNP during transcription. Although the nascent RNA structures in their cryo-EM images were not well resolved, the vRNPs observed in that study likely correspond to the vRNPs producing folded RNAs in the present study.Although we could not determine whether folded RNA associated with the helical vRNPs was mRNA or cRNA, the vRNPs with folded RNA are consistent with the progressive helical track-transcription model proposed by Coloma et al.31. Therefore, we propose that helical vRNPs with folded RNA represent the correct RNA-synthesis mode, because maintenance of the helical, rod-shaped vRNP structure is favourable to commencing the next round of RNA synthesis (Fig. 7). Assuming that the folded RNA is an mRNA, the 5′-terminus of vRNA is associated with RNA polymerase throughout transcription25,37. If the 3′ end of vRNA is released from the RNA polymerase during this process, the helical structure of the vRNP would be largely loosened (Supplementary Fig. 8, pattern A). However, such a loosened vRNP structure has never been observed, suggesting that the 3′ end of the vRNA is not detached, which is consistent with a recent finding that the 3′ end of vRNA binds to the secondary binding site of RNA polymerase after transcription18. Therefore, vRNPs associated with folded RNA would represent engagement in transcription (Supplementary Fig. 8, pattern B), as reported by Coloma et al.31.Fig. 7: Model for synthesis of nascent viral RNAs by influenza vRNPs.When folded viral RNA is synthesized, the vRNP keeps its helical rod-shaped structure and the vRNP is used in next round of RNA synthesis (upper). In contrast, when looped dsRNA is produced, the vRNP disrupts its helical rod-shaped structure because it loses the residential vRNA. As a result, such deformed vRNP cannot proceed to the next round of RNA-synthesis cycle (lower).Full size imageBy contrast, the vRNP structure associated with the looped RNA was largely deformed into non-helical structures, likely because the vRNA is at least partially detached from the NPs of the vRNP (Figs. 1, 2). We speculated that the deformed vRNPs associated with looped RNA would be unable to proceed to subsequent rounds of RNA synthesis for the following reasons. First, the looped dsRNA must be unwound; however, such helicase activity has not been reported for influenza virus polymerase. Second, the template vRNA should re-bind to the NPs of the vRNP, and the deformed vRNP must be refolded into its native double-helical structure. Considering these complicated events, it is reasonable to presume that deformed vRNPs associated with looped RNA represent a failure of RNA synthesis (Fig. 7). If deformation of vRNPs sometimes occurs in virus-infected cells, some vRNPs would fail to produce nascent RNAs and the encoded viral proteins, whereas other vRNPs could be successful in RNA synthesis. Indeed, when influenza viruses infect at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), one or more viral proteins are not expressed in some cells38,39. Although further studies are required to determine whether the deformed vRNP is indeed produced in virus-infected cells, deformation of vRNPs during RNA synthesis might be related to such observations.Interestingly, looped RNAs associated with deformed vRNPs were dsRNAs, which likely comprise nascent RNA and template vRNA (Figs. 3–6). Because we performed in vitro RNA synthesis in the absence of free NP, free RNA polymerase, and host factors, such as ANP32A40, all of which are required for vRNA replication and vRNP formation, the looped dsRNA might represent an aberrant product of vRNA replication. Although ~3.6% of ApG-primed vRNPs produced looped dsRNA in vitro, dsRNAs were detected in only 0.16% of virus-infected cells (Fig. 4e), suggesting that such host factors and/or viral proteins would prevent dsRNA formation in virus-infected cells. Although further analysis is needed, this finding suggests that looped dsRNAs observed in vitro might be accidentally produced in virus-infected cells.Measurement of structural stability via the cantilever tip of HS-AFM showed a lower stability of deformed vRNP with looped dsRNA, likely due to the detachment of template vRNA from NPs of vRNPs (Fig. 6). Because the stability of helical vRNPs would be compromised not only by loss of vRNA but also distortion of the helical structure, we cannot exclude the possibility that helical-structure distortion might contribute to the lower stability observed in the deformed vRNPs. However, given that the dsRNA contains newly synthesized progeny RNA (Fig. 5), the dsRNA must comprise the template vRNA complementary to the progeny RNA. Thus, we speculated that the lower stability of deformed vRNPs was caused by vRNA detachment from the vRNPs.In conclusion, by combining HS-AFM and cryo-EM, we identified two morphologically distinct vRNPs during RNA synthesis. Our results suggest that helical structures are prerequisite for successful repetitive RNA synthesis, whereas deformation of helical structures would represent abortive RNA synthesis. There remain numerous unresolved questions. Future investigations should attempt to identify the determinants of looped-RNA formation and folded-RNA synthesis by adding related proteins during in vitro RNA synthesis, given that the in vitro RNA-synthesis approach described here lacks the host factors and viral NPs necessary for the generation of progeny vRNPs. These findings provide novel insights into RNA synthesis along with strong evidence regarding the composition and mechanism of production of viral RNAs.MethodsPurification of vRNPInfluenza A virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), was prepared, as previously reported9. Purified PR8 virions (~5 mg mL−1) were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 2% lysolecithin and 1 U μL−1 RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 1 h at 30 °C. The sample was ultracentrifuged through a 30–70% (w/v) glycerol gradient in Tris-NaCl buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl] at 45,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C in a SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Collected fractions were mixed with 2× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Novex; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 4–15% Mini Protean TGX precast gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).In vitro RNA synthesis using virion-derived RNPsPurified vRNP (1–2 mg mL−1 for cryo-EM and 0.01 mg mL−1 for other experiments) was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 μg mL−1 actinomycin D, 1 mM each of ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP, 1 U μL−1 RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor with a primer, and 1 mM ApG (IBA Lifesciences, Göttingen, Germany). In some experiments, 10 μg mL−1 rabbit globin mRNA (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a primer instead of ApG. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min (for ApG primer) or 30 min (for globin mRNA primer) unless otherwise noted. For detection of newly synthesized RNA by radioisotope, the same reaction mixture was used with the exception that 0.25 μCi μL−1 [α-32P] UTP and 0.05 mM UTP were added. After in vitro RNA synthesis, RNA was purified with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), mixed with an equal volume of 2× RNA loading dye (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and immediately chilled on ice. The sample was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea in 0.5× TBE buffer (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 120 V for 5 h. The gel was dried at 80 °C for 2 h, exposed to an imaging plate (BAS-MS 2025; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) for 12 h to 24 h, and scanned with a Typhoon 3000 Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Labelling of nascent RNA with a nucleotide analogue was also performed in the same reaction mixture using 1 mM Br-UTP (Sigma–Aldrich) or 1 mM EUTP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) instead of UTP. Inhibition of RNA synthesis was evaluated by adding 0.1–100 μM of 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (T-705RTP; kindly provided by Furuta Y., Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd.) to the reaction mixture.Preparation of viral RNA with T7 RNA polymeraseRNA standards for NP and NA segments of PR8 virus were prepared, as described previously34. Templates containing a T7 phage promoter sequence (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) were amplified by PCR using sets of primers listed in Supplementary Table 2 and the pPolI plasmid harbouring the sequence of each segment41. PCR products were purified with a Min Elute gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and transcribed in vitro with RiboMAX large-scale RNA production sysytem-T7 (Promega) according to manufacturer instructions. After RQ1 DNase I (Promega) treatment for 30 min at 37 °C, transcripts were purified using an RNeasy mini kit. The concentration of purified RNA was determined by spectrophotometry, and the copy number was calculated from the molecular weight of each RNA. RNA (1 × 1010 copies) was then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and visualized with silver staining using a Silver Staining II kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Additionally, all eight vRNA segments of influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 strain) were similarly prepared and used as markers for electrophoresis. Template DNAs were amplified with the primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase using 0.25 μCi μL−1 [α-32P] UTP. Transcribed RNAs were purified and mixed before electrophoresis.RT-qPCRRT-qPCR was performed as described by Kawakami et al.34. The RNA standard or in vitro transcribed RNA was mixed with a quarter volume of 10 μM tagged primer (sequence is provided in Supplementary Table 4) and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. After immediately chilling on ice for 5 min, the mixture was pre-heated at 60 °C for 5 min, and then three volumes of the reaction mixture [final concentration: 1× First Strand buffer (Invitrogen), 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dNTP mix, 10 U μL−1 Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 1 U μL−1 RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor prepared with saturated trehalose and pre-heated at 60 °C for 5 min] were added to the RNA solution at 60 °C, and the mixture was further incubated for 1 h at 60 °C. The reaction was stopped by heating at 85 °C for 5 min, and the cDNA solution was stored on ice until use. cDNA solution (diluted 1:50) was mixed with forward and reverse qPCR primers (each at a final concentration of 1 μM; sequences given in Supplementary Table 4), to which an equal volume of Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was added. The qPCR reaction was performed on a Rotor-Gene Q system (Qiagen) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. For absolute quantitation, 10-fold serial dilutions (1 × 109–1 × 104 copies μL−1) of synthetic RNA standards prepared as described were used to generate a standard curve. The copy number was calculated from the standard curve with a strong linear correlation (R2 > 0.99) and amplification efficiency between 95 and 105%. The detection limit was 1 × 104 copies μL−1.HS-AFMIn vitro RNA synthesis was performed in a microcentrifuge tube, with 2 µL of sample dropped onto freshly cleaved mica without surface modification. After incubation for the desired time (~1–5 min) at room temperature, the mica surface was then washed sufficiently with imaging buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT] and immersed in a liquid chamber filled with 80 µL of the imaging buffer for observation at room temperature using an HS-AFM system (Nano Explorer; Research Institute of Biomolecule Metrology Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan). We performed HS-AFM in tapping mode, in which the cantilever was excited to oscillate at its resonant frequency in the vertical direction during lateral and vertical scanning of the cantilever chip in order to allow the tip to intermittently tap the sample surface. Images were collected at two images s−1 using cantilevers with a 0.1 N m−1 spring constant and a resonance frequency in water of 0.6 MHz (BL-AC10DS; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To acquire high-resolution images, the electron-beam-deposited tips were fabricated using phenol or ferrocene powder, as described by Uchihashi et al.42. Incorporation of Br-UTP into nascent RNA was confirmed by incubating in vitro transcripts with 0.1 mg mL−1 monoclonal anti-5-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (SAB4700630; Sigma–Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge tube and imaging the sample with HS-AFM. Production of the dsRNA was examined by adding 1 μg mL−1 J2 antibody (10010200; Scicons; Nordic-MUbio, Susteren, The Netherlands) to the reaction mixture in a microcentrifuge tube, incubating for 2 h at 4 °C, and observing it by HS-AFM. In situ observation of RNA digestion by each RNase was performed by adding a 10% volume of the indicated concentration of RNase A (Epicentre; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) or ShortCut RNase III (New England Biolabs) to the AFM liquid cell during imaging. At least five independent experiments were performed for each RNase, and all HS-AFM images were viewed and analysed with Kodec 4.4.7.3943. A low-pass filter and a flattening filter were applied to individual images to remove spike noise and flatten xy-plane, respectively.Cryo-EMvRNP reaction solution (1 µL) was applied to a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3, Cu 300 mesh; Quantifoil, Jena, Germany) and blotted manually, followed by application of 2 μL of reaction solution, blotting and rapid freezing in liquid ethane on a Vitrobot Mark IV system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Images were recorded close to focus with a Volta phase plate on a Talos Arctica electron microscope equipped with a Falcon III camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in integrating mode. The total dose during a single exposure was ~40 electrons/Å2.For cryo-ET, 2 μL of vRNP reaction solution mixed with colloidal gold (1.9- or 5-nm diameter) were applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (C-Flat CF-MH-2C; Protochips Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA) and rapidly frozen in liquid ethane on a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were recorded on a Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Falcon II camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tilt series were acquired from −60° to 60° with 2° steps using the Leginon System44. The total dose during a single-tilt series was 120 electrons/Å2. Tilt-series data were processed in IMOD45 by using gold particles as fiducial markers for manual image registration after 2× binning (final voxel size: 4.4 Å3). A tomogram of the entire field of view was reconstructed using Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique. Volumes of interest were extracted from the reconstructed 3D tomogram and visualized with IMOD and AMIRA 6.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Consecutive Z-projections were generated using ImageJ46.Modification of RNA using Click chemistryA Click-iT RNA imaging kit was purchased from Invitrogen. After in vitro RNA synthesis with EUTP, the sample was deposited on mica and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The mica surface was then washed with imaging buffer, and the following reactions were all performed on mica without drying the surface. Imaging buffer on the mica surface was replaced with Click-iT reaction cocktail [Click-iT RNA reaction buffer containing 4 mM CuSO4, 0.02 mg mL−1 biotin-azide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.1× Click-iT reaction buffer additive] and incubated for 30 min under light shielding. The mica surface was then washed with imaging buffer, and the buffer was replaced with 0.1 mg mL−1 of streptavidin solution (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the mica surface was washed again with imaging buffer for the HS-AFM observation.IFAVero cells (CCL-81; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM) and seeded on 35-mm glass-bottom dish (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) coated with rat collagen I (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) 1 day before infection. Cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.1 and incubated for 10 h in MEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) containing 0.3% BSA. Infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) for 30 min. After blocking, cells were incubated with anti-NP rabbit polyclonal (1:1000 dilution, GTX125989; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA) and anti-dsRNA mouse monoclonal antibody J2 (1:500 dilution, 10010200; Scicons) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluoro 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:2000 dilution, A11001; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluoro 555-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 dilution, A21428; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS with 10% Blocking One. Section images were recorded and deconvolved using DeltaVision Elite system (GE Healthcare) with a ×60 oil immersion objective on an Olympus IX71 microscope.Force measurement by HS-AFMTo measure the force applied to the sample surface, two types of HS-AFM images were obtained simultaneously: topographic images and amplitude images. By measuring the thermal noise and the inverse optical lever sensitivity (InvOLS) value [nm V−1] of the deflection signal of a cantilever, we determined the spring constant (kc) [pN nm−1] and quality factor (Qc) of the cantilever, as described previously47. Determined kc values were in good agreement with nominal values reported by the manufacturer. During observation, the vRNP was destroyed by gradually lowering the set point. Destruction of the vRNP was determined from the apparent change in the height of the vRNP. After imaging, the amplitude value [V] at the frame in which the vRNP was destroyed was measured from the amplitude image, and the obtained value was converted into Asp [nm] using the InvOLS value. The free cantilever-oscillation amplitude A0 was measured by releasing the cantilever from the sample surface. The average tip–sample-interaction force <Ft> was calculated using the following equation: <Fts> = kc (A02 − Asp2)1/2/ Qc48. For preparation of control vRNP, we treated 0.01 mg mL−1 of vRNP with 0.05 μg mL−1 of RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C. Degradation of the vRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers used to detect the full-length NP segment.Statistics and reproducibilityAll statistical analyses were performed using available R packages (https://www.r-project.org/). P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments performed on the paper were successfully replicated more than three times.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Back to Healio Experts have been optimistic that the science and collaboration that went into developing numerous COVID-19 vaccines in record time may help spur development of vaccines against other long-time targets, like influenza. One such project is now underway: Moderna announced the start of a phase 1/2 study that will evaluate an investigational messenger RNA vaccine for influenza. Moderna started an early-stage trial for an investigational influenza vaccine that uses messenger RNA technology. Source: Adobe Stock. The drug maker said the first participants have been dosed with mRNA-1010, a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate that targets two influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria) viruses. The trial will enroll approximately 180 adults aged 18 years or older. After using the technology to create one of the world’s first approved COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna announced earlier this year that it was expanding its mRNA program to also develop vaccines against HIV, influenza and Nipah virus. Scientists have long sought to improve upon seasonal influenza vaccines, which have not been more than 60% effective in any of the past 11 seasons — although influenza vaccines that are less effective overall still protect against serious outcomes if a person is infected. (The CDC told Healio earlier this year that it would not be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the 2020-2021 influenza vaccines because the season was too mild to produce enough data.) Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said that the company’s goal is to develop “respiratory combination vaccines” that can be administered each fall and protect people against “the most problematic respiratory viruses,” including influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, which surged in recent months amid a decline in COVID-19 mitigation measures. “We expect that our seasonal influenza vaccine candidates will be an important component of our future combination respiratory vaccines,” Bancel said in a news release.

Children (<18 years) with influenza-associated neurological disease were enrolled in the study. Children with indications for CBP and parental consent received CBP (Continuous Blood purification), while others received maximal intensive care treatment because of the absence of parental consent. The outcomes of the CBP and non-CBP groups were compared. Categorical variables were presented as percentage and compared by Chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile ranges) and compared with non-parametric independent sample test. Statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS (version 26.0) and p < 0.05 (2 tailed) was considered to be statistically significant.Results30 children with influenza-associated neurological disease were recruited to the study. 18 received CBP and the other 12 received maximal intensive care. There were no differences between CBP and non-CBP children in age, sex, body weight, type of influenza virus, neurological complications, Glasgow score, PIM-2 score and PCIS at admission (p > 0.05). The inflammatory factors (CRP, PCT and IL-6) of 30 cases were tested at admission and after 3 days of admission. In the CBP group, there was a significant decrease in IL-6 levels at 3 days of admission (p = 0.003) and a decrease in CRP and PCT levels, but no significant difference (p > 0.05). In the non-CBP group, there were no significant difference on levels of CRP, PCT and IL-6 at admission and 3-day of admission (p > 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the CBP group compared with the non-CBP group (11.11% vs. 50%, p = 0.034).ConclusionsCBP definitely reduces IL-6 levels significantly. We did find that the survival rate of patients in the CBP group was improved. But we don’t know if there is a relationship between the reduction of IL-6 levels and the survival rate. Trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx(ChiCTR2000031754). Peer Review reports BackgroundSeasonal influenza epidemics cause between 3–5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 290,000 to 600,000 deaths every year in the world [1]. Most people are susceptible to influenza, which is generally a self-limiting disease. However, individuals in high risk groups, such as infants, can develop severe complications. These complications include pneumonia, neurological complications and even multi-organ dysfunction. Although pneumonia is the most common complication in children, neurological disease is one of the most severe complications [2]. The actual incidence of neurological complications in children with influenza infection is unclear. However, it is more common compared to adults, accounting for 1.7–15% of children hospitalized with influenza infection [3], and the burden of influenza-associated neurological disease (IAND) is higher in the pediatric population. In the United States and the UK series, children account for 73% and 84% of IAND cases, respectively [4]. The most frequently reported complications are as follows: seizures, encephalopathy, Reye syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) and speech or movement disorders [3]. The prognosis of influenza-associated neurological diseases has been reported to vary [5, 6], with encephalopathy and acute necrotizing encephalopathy having the poorest prognosis. among which encephalopathy and acute necrotizing encephalopathy have the worst prognosis. The main cause of death is multiple organ failure, which usually occurs within 2 days of the occurrence of neurological symptoms, with a mortality rate of 31.8% [3]. In addition to supportive treatment, there is no effective treatment for the Influenza-associated neurological disease until now. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome after influenza virus infection has been shown to play an important role for neurological complications [7]. However, CBP can remove inflammatory factors and reduce the level of inflammatory factors in the serum of sepsis patients [8].But, It is unknown whether the outcome and prognosis would be improved, if CBP is applied for removing inflammatory factors in influenza children with neurological complications. The aim of our study was to determine whether CBP has superior outcomes and prognosis in neurological complications in children with influenza compared to non-CBP.MethodsStudy designA single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in Henan, China, from January 2018 to January 2020. A total of 545 pediatric patients (<18 years old) were admitted to PICU of Luoyang Maternal and Child Health Hospital for the diagnosis of influenza. Among these children, the cases with neurological complications were enrolled into this study. The inclusion criteria include:129d-18y; 2 The samples were collected from nasopharynx swabs, and the antigen was detected by colloidal gold method. Among the 30 children, 26 children were positive for influenza antigen, while the other 4 children were negative. These 4 children are in the high epidemic season, and have close contact with influenza-like patients; in addition their clinical symptoms are in line with the performance of influenza. Therefore, 30 children were clearly diagnosed with influenza finally [9]. 3 The emergence or worsening of a neurological symptom, which could not be explained otherwise, in a patient with laboratory proven influenza [3]. 4 Respiratory support by ventilator. Exclusion standard: 1 The children who had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation before admission and had fixed dilated pupils, or unequal pupil size, or low EEG voltage (<5Hz); 2 The children who abandoned treatment within 72 hours of admission for family reasons; 3 There are only frequent convulsions, but no progressive aggravation of consciousness disorder during the course of the disease; 4 There are high risk factors for bacterial purulent meningitis such as rhinorrhea, middle ear deformity or skull base fracture; 5 The children who has basic brain disorders such as metabolic encephalopathy or epileptic encephalopathy.Clinical managementThe routine treatment for all the children included: neuraminidase inhibitors such as Peramivir [9] against influenza virus, ventilator-assisted ventilation, mannitol dehydration to lower intracranial pressure, midazolam and sufentanil for sedation and analgesia to reduce oxygen consumption, nutritional support etc. We treated with gamma globulin, methyprednisolone and plasma exchange for acute necrotizing encephalopathy of children. Elevation of the head of the bed, aspiration of subglottic secretions, control of the colonization of the oropharynx and the digestive tract to avoid ventilator-associated pneumonia. The vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation was monitored, as well as the 24 hours intake and output per day. The children with CBP indications and the parents’ consent received CBP, and the others were treated with routine intensive care due to failure of parents’ consent.The internal jugular vein or femoral vein were selected for catheterization in all children. Blood filters were used according to the children’s weight. The CBP treatment included PE and CVVHDF. On the first day and the second day, the plasma exchange was conducted firstly, with the plasma exchange of 60ml/kg/d. Standard volume CBP (25ml/kg/h) was performed after plasma exchange. The duration of treatment was \(\geqslant \)16 hours per day. Albumin, plasma or saline were selected as priming fluid before treatment according to body weight. For children less than 3kg, suspended red blood cells were selected as the priming fluid. For children with 3–15kg body weight, we selected albumin or plasma as priming fluid and saline for the children greater than 15kg. The right internal jugular vein was implanted with a double-lumen catheter for drainage and the left or right axillary vein with a 22G indwelling needle for blood return due to the limitation of vascular conditions in children under 2 months old. Double lumen catheters were implanted into internal jugular vein and / or femoral vein in children over 2 months old. The type of double lumen catheter was selected according to the diameter of vascular minor axis measured by superficial ultrasound probe. A 5F double lumen catheter was used for vessels with diameter ≤ 0.6cm, 7F double lumen for vessel between 0.6cm and 1.0cm and 11.5F for vessels with diameter over 1cm.OutcomesThe primary outcome was 28-day mortality at admission. Secondary outcomes included ICU stay, Glasgow score, PIM-2, PCIS, ventilator-time, hospitalization costs.Statistical methodsThe outcomes were compared between CBP group and non-CBP group. Categorical variables were presented as percentage and compared by Chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile ranges) and compared with non-parametric independent sample test. Statistical analyses were finished by SPSS (version 26.0) and p < 0.05 (2 tailed) was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsWorking flow and basic information of influenza children in PICU. The study collected 545 children with influenza admitted to PICU from January 2018 to December 2019 for retrospective analysis. 39 of them had Influenza-associated neurological disease. 9 cases did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded. Among these 9 cases, 2 children received cardiopulmonary resuscitation before admission, after admission, the pupils were dilated and fixed or pupils were not large, and the brain voltage was lower than 5 Hz. One child was given up within 72 hours of treatment; 6 children gradually recovered their consciousness after admission and gradually recovered without receiving advanced life support such as ventilator-assisted ventilation.30 children were enrolled in this study. 18 received in CBP group with parents’ consent, and the other 12 were in non-CBP group due to the failure of parents’ consent (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1Workflow process to obtain influenza children with neurological complicationsFull size imageThe demographic characters and clinical information at admission were showed below. There were no differences between CBP and non-CBP children in age, sex, body weight, type of influenza virus, neurological complications, Glasgow score, PIM-2 score and critical ill score and the level of Inflammatory factors at admission (p > 0.05) (see Table 1). Table 1 Demographic characteristics and clinical information at admissionFull size tableInflammatory factors after CBPThe level of CRP, PCT and IL-6 of serum in CPB group were lower than in non-CBP group at 3-day of admission, with no significant difference (p > 0.05). In CBP group, the level of IL-6 was significantly lower at 3-day of admission than at admission (p = 0.003), the level of CRP and PCT also decreased at 3-day of admission, but with no significant difference (p > 0.05). In the non-CBP group, there were no significant difference on levels of CRP, PCT and IL-6 between at admission and 3-day of admission (p > 0.05) (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2Statistical charts of the inflammatory mediators of CBP group and non-CBP group at admission and 3-day of admission. A Compared to 3-day of admission, statistics charts show decreasing of CRP in CBP group, but there was no significant difference (14.35[1.85,23.625], 2.700[1.500,8.968], p = 0.317). There was no difference of CRP in non-CBP group (7.950[3.705,21.475], 7.900[3.050,26.475], p = 1.0). B Compared to 3-day of admission, statistics charts show significantly decreasing of IL-6 in CBP group (0.955[0.423,2.400], 0.120[0.040,0.525], ***p = 0.003). There was no difference of IL-6 in non-CBP group (0.690[0.313,1.325], 0.435[0.123,0.628], p = 0.684). C Compared to 3-day of admission, statistics charts show decreasing of PCT in both in CBP group and non-CBP group, but there was no significant difference (CBP group: 3.400[0.278,20.500], 1.800[0.290,21.775], p = 0.739; non-CBP group: 22.500[5.125,38.750], 9.900[2.825,27.500], p = 0.684).Full size imageOutcomesThe 28-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the CBP group than in the non-CBP group (11.11% vs. 50.00%, p = 0.034). Glasgow score, PIM-2 score and PCIS also significantly improved in the CBP group. At the same time, the length of PICU stay was significantly prolonged, and the hospitalization costs were significantly increased (see Table 2). Two of the CBP-treated children were found to have hypothermia and severe hypophosphatemia, and two children had catheter puncture site bleeding as a result of early DIC during the course of the disease. Table 2 Outcomes of CBP and non-CBP groupsFull size tableDiscussionWe retrospectively analyzed 545 children with influenza in the PICU, 30 of whom developed neurological complications and were included in the study. Influenza infection is a serious threat to the health of children. In 2003–2004 influenza season, the average hospitalization rate was 36/100000 of American children, but up to 80% for children under 5 years of age [10]. A study on influenza-associated neurological diseases from Australia showed that seasonal influenza is an important cause of children’s neurological diseases in Australia. After extensive influenza vaccination, the mortality of children with influenza-associated encephalopathy was significantly reduced [11]. Data of influenza-associated encephalopathy reported through Japan’s National Infectious Disease Epidemiological Surveillance Database from 2010 to 2015 showed a total of 385 patients got with influenza-associated encephalopathy. The average incidence of influenza-associated encephalopathy in children and adults (age \(\geqslant \)18 years) was 2.83 and 0.19 per million, respectively. The median duration of fatal cases from the onset of influenza-associated encephalopathy to death was 1 day [12]. In China, the Beijing Children’s Hospital conducted an analysis of the cause of death of 19 children with influenza virus infection from November 2017 to April 2018, 8 children had flu-associated encephalopathy, and 7 of them died of flu-associated encephalopathy [13].In addition to severe respiratory complications, which can rapidly progress to coma in some children, influenza-associated neurological complications are more severe in children and are the leading cause of influenza death [12, 14, 15]. Until now, the pathogenesis of influenza-associated neurological complications is still unclear. Autopsy of these patients showed necrosis and epithelial hemorrhage of thalamus and posterior cerebral cap of pons, pale myelin sheath in white matter of brain and cerebellum, and no clear obstruction of vascular endothelium and peripheral vascular edema [16]. Due to the acute onset of influenza-associated neurological diseases, severe brain dysfunction can occur quickly. The treatment time window is tight. Before the symptoms of nervous system appear, the children’s respiratory system disorder is not prominent or even no respiratory system performance, and lack of early warning indicators. Although immunization can reduce its incidence to a certain extent [11], most children are not actively vaccinated. Once the patient developed into an Influenza-associated neurological disease, treatment is extremely difficult, and some children develop cardiopulmonary failure within a short period of time. Many children have undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation before admission, and showed pupil light loss or even brain herniation after admission, the brain failure will soon appear even if with active treatment. Even if they survived, some children will still have serious neurological complications. The mortality rate of acute necrotizing encephalopathy is 31.8%, and only 10% of patients make a full recovery, with many more surviving as neurological sequelae. The neurological sequelae recover very slowly and some patients received unacceptable long-term rehabilitation [17]. Therefore, effective treatment of influenza-associated neurological disease, especially acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a problem that we urgently need to solve. In this study, we found that the mortality of children in the CBP group was lower than that of the non-CBP group, and the neurological coma score (Glasgow score), PCIS score and PIM-2 score were improved compared with the non-CBP group. This suggests that CBP is associated with a reduction in mortality.The pathogenesis of influenza-associated neurological disease is unclear. The current view is that influenza virus infection triggers a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, in particular, elevated cytokines (interleukin-6, -8, -10) are involved. The physiological states of IL-6 is knows to have a neuroprotective effect, but abnormal increase of IL-6 is found in serum of IAE patients with severe disability or death with serious adverse prognosis [17, 18]. This is consistent with the fact that IL-6 plays a more obvious role in nervous system diseases related to influenza reported in the literature [4]. Some people that the IL-6 overexpression subsequently induces or contributes to NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity, in pathological states [19]. Therefore, the elevated cytokines (interleukin-6, -8, -10), caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by influenza virus infection, have been hypothesized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological complications [14, 20]. However, there is no effective therapy for the “system cytokine storm” caused by influenza virus. Corticosteroid is the most commonly used and the effect is still controversial. The current treatment for influenza-associated neurological disease is symptomatic treatment and immune regulation. Kawashima [21] reported three children with influenza encephalopathy recovered from influenza after hormone and plasma exchange. The CBP model in this subject includes PE and CVVHDF, which can remove inflammatory factors between 0.5k-60 kDa from serum. IL-6 molecular weight is 24.385kD. In this study, the level of inflammatory factors,including CRP, PCT and IL-6, reduced in the CBP group after blood purification. Among them, the level of IL-6 decreased more significantly.CBP can definitely reduce IL-6 levels significantly, and the survival rate of patients in the CBP group was improved. However, since this study is a retrospective study, all data are dependent on the records in the previous database. What’s more, due to the effective number of samples in this study, we don’t know if there is a relationship between the reduction of IL-6 levels and the survival rate. So, the mechanism and efficacy of CBP therapy in the treatment of Influenza-associated neurological disease require further research and discussion.ConclusionsCBP can definitely reduce IL-6 levels significantly. We did find that the survival rate of patients in the CBP group was improved. But we don’t know if there is a relationship between the reduction of IL-6 levels and the survival rate.

Register ADVERTISEMENT Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106°F). | Photo: Stephanie L. Church/The Horse On June 28, an attending veterinarian in the Regional District of Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, confirmed a weanling Quarter Horse cross filly with equine influenza (EI). The horse, whose vaccination status is unknown, is reported as recovering. The filly’s new owners purchased at auction, and she arrived at her new home with clinical signs, including cough and nasal discharge. She has been isolated, and all other horses on the property appear healthy. About Equine Influenza Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that infects horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus that causes it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with human’s contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment. Health Alert: Equine Influenza (Video) Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106°F); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse’s health at shows by taking his temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread. Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the six months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from. In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse’s chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

We have reached, it seems, a tipping point in the pandemic where rules will be replaced by personal decisions. The mantra now is about living with coronavirus, much as we do with seasonal flu.The pandemic has invited countless comparisons between coronavirus and influenza and the diseases do have some features in common. Both are infectious, potentially lethal respiratory viruses. They can spread through aerosols, droplets and contaminated surfaces. And they share some of the same symptoms in the form of fever, cough, headaches and fatigue. In the winter ahead, one challenge the NHS faces is separating the Covid patients from the flu cases.But there are striking differences between coronavirus and flu that matter for public health. Coronavirus spreads faster than influenza and can cause far more serious illness. The symptoms of coronavirus can take longer to show, and people tend to be infectious for longer, making them more prone to passing it on.Seasonal influenza has been around long enough that previous infection and protection from vaccines bear down on cases and deaths. Analysis of previous influenza outbreaks suggests that the R value for seasonal flu – the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to – averages about 1.28. This means a group of four people with flu might pass the virus on to five more.Coronavirus spreads more easily than that. For the Delta variant now surging around the world, R is estimated at about seven, so in the absence of vaccines and other interventions, a single case would infect on average seven others. As vaccination programmes push on and the virus continues to spread, immunity to coronavirus will drive R down, but how low is a moot point.Coronavirus is more lethal than influenza, largely because vulnerability to the disease rockets in older people. Seasonal influenza killed an estimated 44,505 people in England during the three combined flu seasons from 2015-16 to 2017-18. That number died from Covid in England in the first nine weeks of 2021. A major difference is that the flu figure takes into account the protection of influenza vaccines, where 50% effectiveness is considered good.Coronavirus vaccines should have a greater proportional impact on Covid deaths. So far, the most common Covid vaccines used in the UK – the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech shots – reduce the risk of hospitalisation from Covid by more than 90%. As a result, the vaccination programme has driven Covid deaths down substantially, to fewer than 20 a day in the past week.But the vaccines do much more to prevent death than transmission of the virus, so cases of Covid are expected to rise for some time yet. The larger the epidemic grows, the more chance the virus has of finding vulnerable people who have not had their shots, or are not sufficiently protected by the vaccine. While the vaccines dramatically weaken the link between cases and deaths, they are unlikely to break it entirely.The differences between coronavirus, influenza and the vaccines that target them can easily eclipse a more fundamental issue, though. Learning to live with coronavirus as we live with flu does not mean society can take it in its stride.Every year, a comprehensive global surveillance network detects which variants of influenza are in circulation and most likely to pose a threat in the following season. That information determines which strains go into the annual flu vaccines that are then rolled out in established campaigns. Throughout the flu season, public health authorities issue case counts and if needed, update their advice on medical care.There is no such global system for coronavirus yet. And despite the well-oiled machine that protects the world from flu, the death toll from the virus in a typical year is still substantial. Every winter, flu puts enormous stress on the NHS, at times pushing it to breaking point. For the health service, living with coronavirus means learning to endure a double wave each winter as coronavirus and flu arrive together. This article was amended on 6 July 2021. Seasonal influenza killed an estimated 44,505 people in England during the three combined flu seasons from 2015-16 to 2017-18, not “2015-16 to 2018-19” as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusHealthVaccines and immunisationFluHealth policyPublic services policyanalysisShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Prior to joining Sanofi, Liana was an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and an attending physician at The Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia. She is also a professional photographer whose work is featured in this story.Â In the early days of COVID-19 vaccination, there was much discussion about whether the new vaccines should be used in pregnancy, as they had not specifically been tested in pregnant women. Was the potential benefit worth the potential unknown risks? Traditionally, a new vaccine against any infectious disease is assessed in clinical trials prior to use, but these trials donât normally include pregnant women. When considering the need for vaccination during pregnancy, public health officials assess the risk of the disease to the mother-to-be and/or her infant at birth by looking at the type of vaccine technology used, i.e., usually using a live or inactivated virus; how the vaccine works; and the safety profile. If the health benefits outweigh the potential risks, the health authorities make recommendations for vaccination in pregnancy.1 How vaccines are assessed for use in pregnant women Letâs take influenza as an example: When women are pregnant, their immune systems and several vital organs adapt to carrying the fetus.2Â The changes put the pregnant woman at increased risk of severe influenza,3Â as she is less able to fight off the high fevers and inflammation caused by the disease. One study estimated that pregnant women were seven times more likely to end up in hospital from influenza than non-pregnant women.4Â These high risks drive healthcare providers and the World Health Organization to routinely recommend influenza vaccination in pregnancy.5 Thereâs another example in Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster) vaccination in pregnancy.Â Here, much of the focus is on preventing severe pertussis disease in newborns and infants too young to be vaccinated. Unlike influenza, pertussis is not seasonal but can circulate year round, and can worsen during outbreaks. It is highly contagious, and many infants catch it from family members, before theyâve even ventured outside.6Â The result: 80% of pertussis-related deaths occur in infants younger than three months old.7 How vaccination against pertussis works during pregnancy to help protect the newbornWhen the pregnant woman is vaccinated, her body creates antibodies that are passed to the fetus. These antibodies are present in the newborn at birth and last between two and four months.9Â Studies have shown that Tdap vaccination in pregnancy reduces the risk of pertussis infection by approximately 90% in a newbornâs first two months of life and reduces pertussis-related deaths by 95% in infants of vaccinated mothers.10 During my years in pediatrics, I saw too many young infants in the intensive care unit struggling to breathe due to pertussis. This is something that stays with you.Liana ClarkGlobal Medical Product Lead PPH, Sanofi PasteurWhile vaccination in pregnancy has become routine, some pregnant women still hesitate. It is important for these women to know that influenza and Tdap vaccines have been routinely used during pregnancy for more than a decade in countries worldwide. The safety profile has been favorable with studies showing no serious vaccine-related side effects for the pregnancy or in the infant. With respect to COVID-19, public health authorities noted the good safety profiles of licensed vaccines in clinical trials among the general population and felt it unlikely that the safety profile would be different in pregnant women; especially given that the risk of harm from COVID-19 in pregnant women was too great not to vaccinate them. Thatâs why the authorities now provide unanimously favorable recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.Â Liana Clark, Global Medical Product Lead for PPH Vaccines for Sanofi Pasteur, and her daughter ZaraAs a pediatrician and an epidemiologist, I am a passionate advocate for vaccines. Vaccines save lives, and vaccination in pregnancy is a critical intervention that provides protection to both pregnant women and their infants. My baby was born before most pregnancy vaccination recommendations were put in place, but as a mother and future grandmother, I hope that I will be the one driving my pregnant daughter to her vaccination appointments to ensure that both she and her baby are protected from the risks of infectious diseases.

Moderna has dosed the first participants in a Phase I/II trial of mRNA-1010, the company’s quadrivalent seasonal influenza messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine candidate.The randomised, stratified, observer-blind, dose-ranging study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1010 in approximately 180 healthy adults (aged 18 years and older) in the US. mRNA-1010 is the enterprise’s first seasonal influenza vaccine candidate to enter the clinic. It targets the lineages recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the prevention of influenza, including seasonal influenza A H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B Yamagata and Victoria.“We are pleased to have begun this Phase I/II study of mRNA-1010, our first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine candidate to enter the clinic. We expect that our seasonal influenza vaccine candidates will be an important component of our future combination respiratory vaccines,” commented Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “Respiratory combination vaccines are an important pillar of our overall mRNA vaccine strategy. We believe that the advantages of mRNA vaccines include the ability to combine different antigens to protect against multiple viruses and the ability to rapidly respond to the evolution of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and [respiratory syncytial virus] RSV. Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses. We look forward to advancing our core modality of prophylactic mRNA vaccines so that we can continue to make an impact on global public health.”Every year, seasonal flu (type A and type B) epidemics emerge, varying in severity each year, presenting a significant burden to healthcare systems. The WHO estimates approximately three to five million severe cases of flu occur each year globally and 290,000-650,000 flu-related respiratory deaths. In the US, it is believed that approximately eight percent of the population experiences flu each year, costing the economy roughly $11 billion per year on average.Flu vaccines currently on the market are roughly 40 to 60 percent effective, in part because their formulation is decided six to nine months before the flu season based on predictions of what strains are likely to be circulating. Egg-based vaccine production, the process used for the majority of currently licensed influenza vaccines, also has the potential to cause unintended antigenic change to the vaccine virus. Moderna plans to explore potential combination vaccines against flu, SARS-CoV-2, RSV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).What are the challenges in developing and delivering lipid nanoparticle mRNA-based vaccines?Related topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Development, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, mRNA, Research & Development (R&D), Vaccine Technology, Vaccines, VirusesRelated organisationsModernaRelated drugsmRNA-1010Related peopleStéphane BancelRelated diseases & conditionsInfluenza By Hannah Balfour (European Pharmaceutical Review)8 July 2021No comments yetShares27 Share via Pinterest Reddit Buffer Xing WhatsApp FlipboardRelated topicsBiologics, Clinical Trials, Drug Development, Drug Safety, Drug Targets, Immunisation, mRNA, Research & Development (R&D), Vaccine Technology, Vaccines, VirusesRelated organisationsModernaRelated drugsmRNA-1010Related peopleStéphane BancelRelated diseases & conditionsInfluenza Most popular...First-of-a-kind EU approval granted for eosinophilic esophagitis medicineEncouraging data revealed for schizophrenia long-acting injectablesFinal Chapter text published for early adoptionSingle-use bioreactor market to witness favourable expansion to 2030Innovative static culturing method developed Read the latest issueAll subscriptions include online membership, giving you access to the journal and exclusive content.

Can we make future vaccines even faster? AAMCNews COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time. Can we make future vaccines even faster?By improving surveillance of viral outbreaks among animals, scientists can develop vaccine candidates that could be deployed if a virus spreads to humans, a prominent Mount Sinai researcher says. By Patrick Boyle, Senior Staff Writer July 8, 2021 Florian Krammer, PhD, works in his lab at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Courtesy: Mount Sinai Health System Florian Krammer, PhD, is impressed by how quickly medical science developed vaccines for COVID-19 — but not so impressed that he thinks everyone should be satisfied with bringing a vaccine to the public in just under a year after a viral outbreak. The lab researcher and professor of vaccinology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) in New York contends that by better preparing for future viral pandemics, research institutions can work together to produce safe and effective vaccines in as quickly as three months. Krammer, the principal investigator at the Krammer Laboratory at ISMMS, recently spoke with AAMCNews about ideas to accelerate vaccine development. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. The United States developed vaccines against COVID-19 in record-setting time — and much sooner than experts said we could expect. But you’ve said that still wasn’t fast enough. Why? I don't think we were prepared. We had to basically start to make coronavirus vaccines from scratch. Although things moved very quickly, we had to go through Phase 1 trials, Phase 2 trials, then do large Phase 3 efficacy trials with the vaccines. That takes time. We can do this more quickly if we are well prepared. For influenza virus, we get variants each year. And because there are already influenza virus vaccines with an established safety record and a known correlate of protection [measurable signs that a person is immune], we can just make a strain change to update the vaccine — without the need for lengthy clinical development. If we do our homework, we could have a similar scenario for basically any kind of emerging respiratory virus that could cause a pandemic. [Note: The first COVID-19 vaccines were built on research and testing conducted at academic medical institutions over the past 20 years, but scientists did not have the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 until after the pandemic began. The new vaccines then had to go through the typical three-phase clinical trial process.] Florian Krammer, PhD Courtesy: Mount Sinai Health System What would be the first step? You’ve talked about increasing virus surveillance in animals. You need to know what's out there in order to get prepared. The viruses we are concerned about are zoonotic viruses that may jump from wild or domestic animals into humans. Emerging pandemic viruses typically come from the animal reservoir. We see this with coronaviruses: The coronaviruses that have caused recent outbreaks very likely came from bats originally. SARS-CoV-1 [severe acute respiratory syndrome] likely jumped from bats into civet cats and then into humans. MERS-CoV [Middle East respiratory syndrome] probably originated in bats and jumped from there into camels and then into humans. It is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19] took similar routes. The same is true with influenza: The 2009 H1N1 [swine flu] influenza virus came from pigs. Walk us through animal surveillance. How do you find a virus emerging in animals, and what do you do with what you find? We are especially worried about viruses that cause respiratory infections because they are hard to stop. Because we know which viral families usually contain such viruses, we know what to look for. Doing systematic surveillance in wild and domestic animals — especially where animals and humans come together (like wet markets, farms, and caves that house bats and are frequented by humans) — would help us see what’s out there and could cause trouble in the future. You go through the viruses you see in nature or in domestic animals and say, “This might be a candidate for transmission to humans.” Importantly, most of this surveillance is done by collecting genetic information — the viral sequence, not necessarily viruses themselves. We need to be able to predict from the sequence if a virus is potentially dangerous or not — like how likely a virus is to bind to human cells. This requires a lot of research. What would be done after you find viruses that appear to be potentially dangerous for humans? The idea is to select a few viruses as potentially dangerous and start making vaccine candidates against these viruses. If you make 50 or 100 vaccines, you probably could cover much of what could become dangerous to humans. You start Phase 1 trials with these vaccines and potentially expand that to Phase 2 trials. [Phase 1 and 2 trials are small, involving a few hundred to a few thousand people, and mainly address a vaccine’s safety and the immune response it causes against the virus.] Fortunately, many potentially dangerous animal viruses already have family members that circulate in humans — like common cold coronaviruses, which are related to the COVID-19 virus, among others. While you are developing vaccines, you study what kinds of immune responses already work against the related viruses in humans. That allows you to establish so-called “correlates of protection” — an immune response that tells you if somebody is protected from the related virus. How would you apply this knowledge to a pandemic that emerges in humans? At some point, we will have all these vaccine candidates, and a new pandemic virus will emerge. We identify that virus, then we look: What is the closest related virus that we have made a vaccine for? If we are lucky, we already have that virus in our collection of vaccines — or we have one that is closely related. That is very likely, because we have made 50 or 100, and we know what viruses have been out there. If the new virus is closely related to the ones we developed vaccines for, we do not need to develop a new vaccine from scratch. We just need to change the genetic sequence of the vaccine, similar to what we would do now with annual strain changes with influenza. Then we test the vaccine in a Phase 3 trial, which is larger than the first trials — maybe thousands of individuals. That gives us more data about the immune response in a wide variety of people. And since we already established correlates of protection for those related viruses in humans, the vaccine gets authorized based on how well it produces the immune response that we know protects people from this type of virus. We do not have to do large and lengthy efficacy trials. We just need to assess immune responses in a much smaller number of people, which is much faster. If the immune response is strong enough, the vaccine is licensed and rolled out. Are there other examples where we’ve stockpiled vaccines against a virus that we’re not fighting yet? Yes, for influenza viruses. We have vaccines that are stockpiled for the H5 and H7 subtypes. But maybe not at a large enough scale. The process you suggest could give us up to 100 vaccines sitting ready to go, and we won't need 99 of them because those viruses don’t emerge in humans. How do we convince people that this is worth the time and other resources that would take? I don’t think there is much convincing needed at this point. Also, this is not something that the U.S. needs to do alone. Pandemic preparedness is something that the global community needs, and the cost could be distributed. With a few billion dollars, you could get a preparedness program that would put us in a much better position when it comes to mitigating the impact of emerging pandemic viruses. Maybe we should rethink how we classify that kind of spending. It is a way of getting prepared against an invasion. It is not a foreign country; it is a little piece of RNA that invades us. You almost need to see this as defense spending. We should view pandemic preparedness similar to military spending. A relatively small amount of money, compared to what the economy lost from COVID-19, would go a long way toward getting us prepared. What would be the role of academic medical centers in this kind of preparation for future viral epidemics? There are tons of things that academic researchers can contribute. All the virus characterization, the surveillance, etc. Influenza surveillance is often done by academic laboratories. Figuring out which pathogenicity signatures to look for in a virus is done by academic laboratories. Early vaccine development is done by academic laboratories. Look at the work done by CEIRR [Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, a multi-institution network established by the National Institutes of Health to study the natural history, transmission, and pathogenesis of influenza and provide an international research infrastructure to address outbreaks.] That is basically academic researchers doing surveillance for characterization of potentially dangerous influenza viruses to prepare for coming pandemics. While U.S.-centered, it is a global network. It works really well and could be a model for a larger initiative.

Since antibodies are usually highly specific to individual pathogens, in order to maximize their targeted protective response, this pattern was extremely unusual. Until finally, they realized: The antibodies weren’t responding to the viruses, but rather to something in the biological material in which the viruses had been grown. In every case, the virus had been propagated in chicken eggs — more specifically, in a part of the egg called the allantois. The findings were published on June 15 in mBio. “Growing vaccines in eggs is the old school way of doing things because it’s cheap and you can grow a lot of virus in eggs,” said first author Jenna Guthmiller, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at UChicago. “Now we’re finding that these antibodies bind to this glycan – a sugar molecule – found in eggs, which means that people who are getting vaccinated are producing an antibody response against this egg component that’s not related to the virus at all.” The fact that vaccines grown in eggs can lead to this off-target antibody response is unexpected, but the implications aren’t yet known. It could mean that the immune system diverts resources away from developing protective antiviral antibodies to produce these egg sugar antibodies instead, which could have implications for vaccine effectiveness. It’s important to note that these antibodies do not bind to known egg allergens, indicating that they likely are not the culprits behind egg allergies, Guthmiller said. “It doesn’t seem to be harmful, but it may not be beneficial, and it may be affecting immunity, and that’s the important next step.” It took the team years to determine that the antibodies were linked, not to the viruses they were studying, but rather to the eggs in which they were grown. “No joke, we spent years thinking about this,” said Guthmiller. “But once we figured it out, it was straightforward. And we found that it’s very specific to the flu vaccine grown in this one compartment, in the allantois. This isn’t seen with vaccines grown in other chicken cells.” The antibodies target a sugar molecule, known as a glycan, called N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), with a sulfur modification. LacNAcs are a common glycan in humans, but the specific sulfur modification of LacNAc found in eggs is not known to be expressed in humans. Because of this, humans can produce antibodies against this sulfur-modified glycan. When the researchers dug into past studies on flu antibody responses, they found that this antibody response against LacNAc appears to be fairly common following flu vaccination. However, some people do not seem to develop the anti-egg antibodies, and it doesn’t appear that producing the anti-egg antibodies reduces the immune system’s ability to produce anti-flu antibodies — though it’s not clear whether or not there is an impact on vaccine effectiveness. “There’s a little bit of evidence so far that suggests vaccines prepared by other methods are more effective than those grown in eggs, but the precise reasons aren’t known,” said Guthmiller. “This could be a potential mechanism, but we weren’t able to address that in this study.” So far, there is no evidence that the presence of these antibodies has any negative impact on an individual’s health. “We just really don’t know what function these antibodies have,” said Guthmiller. “So many people get the flu vaccine every year, and adverse events are extremely uncommon, so there’s no reason to suspect that this might cause any problems.” More research is needed to determine what, if anything, these anti-egg antibodies mean for the effectiveness of the flu vaccine. “We don’t know how these antibodies impact our flu-specific response. There may be competition between B cells against the flu and these egg glycans, which could be impacting immunity. And if there is an association between egg antibodies and reduced immunity, we need to look at alternative methods for flu vaccine production. Anything that can improve vaccine production is something that we should be considering seriously.” The study, “An Egg-Derived Sulfated N-Acetyllactosamine Glycan Is an Antigenic Decoy of Influenza Virus Vaccines,” was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (U19AI082724, U19AI109946, U19AI057266, P01 AI097092, R01AI145870-01, HHSN272201400005C, HHSN272201400008C, and 75N93019C00051) and the National Center for Functional Glycomics (R24 GM137763).

Advanced Search Moderna launches phase 1/2 study of mRNA-based flu vaccine Vaccine will target flu lineages currently recommended by the World Health Organization Moderna has announced the launch of a phase 1/2 study of its quadrivalent seasonal flu mRNA vaccine candidate, developed using the same platform used for its COVID-19 jab. As a specialist in the mRNA field, Moderna has already found great success with its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine – mRNA-1273 – which was one of the first vaccines to be approved for the virus in the EU at the beginning of the year. Now, Moderna is looking to extend that success into seasonal flu, while also progressing various studies for potential booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine. The flu vaccine candidate – known as mRNA-1010 – is Moderna’s first seasonal influenza vaccine to enter the clinic. It will target the lineages recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the prevention of flu, including seasonal influenza A H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B Yamagata and Victoria. The US biotech company is aiming to enrol approximately 180 healthy participants aged 18 years and older into the initial phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1010. Currently, flu vaccines are approximately 40-60% effective, and their formulation is decided six to nine months prior to when the vaccines are intended for use. Moderna’s seasonal flu programme is seeking to evaluate a range of candidates, while exploring different antigen combinations against flu viruses in the clinic. The company is also planning to explore potential combination vaccines that protect against flu, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). “Respiratory combination vaccines are an important pillar of our overall mRNA vaccine strategy. We believe that the advantages of mRNA vaccines include the ability to combine different antigens to protect against multiple viruses and the ability to rapidly respond to the evolution of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV,” said Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna. “Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot every autumn for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses. We look forward to advancing our core modality of prophylactic mRNA vaccines so that we can continue to make an impact on global public health,” he added.

Both these vaccines serve different purposes. However, data showed that the flu vaccine may have a protective effect on the course of Covid-19 infection and symptoms in children. Children are less likely to develop symptomatic and severe infections if they receive seasonal influenza vaccination in the current flu season.Why is it necessary to take the flu vaccine this season? Chaos can already be anticipated in the flu season due to the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza with almost similar epidemiologic and clinical features. This situation is called a “twindemic” or “syndemic”.Now, it is a known fact that the growth of one virus can be inhibited by the previous infection or vaccination with another (related or unrelated) virus in the same host through mediators like interferons and others. The phenomenon is called virus interference.Your kids must befriend yoga. Image courtesy: ShutterstockData suggests that the flu vaccine, through “viral interference”, may keep you protected from the flu and also trigger a general immune response. This means that someone vaccinated with the flu shot may be less likely to contract Coronavirus.The flu shot is safe for children as it is tested very extensively by experts and even if one has any after-effects, they would generally be very mild. Experiencing mild fever or any other effects will simply mean that the vaccine is working and will keep the body protected against the flu. A flu vaccine is a safe option for children till the Covid-19 vaccine is approved for children below the age of eighteen. The flu shot is an effective tool that will keep your child safe from the flu and reduce their vulnerability to Coronavirus. With the third wave around the corner, health experts are actively trying to raise awareness amongst parents about the flu shot for their children below the age of eighteen. It can, after all, ensure that the young ones stay protected against Covid-19 to a certain extent. Parents should not be passive in getting their children vaccinated. Getting the young ones vaccinated can actually lead to a reduction in the load and pressure on the healthcare system. So, protect your children from Coronavirus and reduce the pressure on the national healthcare system with a simple flu shot!Get latest updates on health and wellness along with Mom Says Related Topics: CoronavirusCovid-19 vaccineAbout The Author Dr Vikas Satwik Dr Vikas Satwik, Consultant Paediatrician & Neonatologist, Motherhood Hospitals, BangaloreRelated Stories Garlic is an effective home remedy for UTI, says my mom Mom Says 5 signs of Covid-19 XE variant Photo Gallery Honey and lemon for acne can be a magical home remedy – try it!
