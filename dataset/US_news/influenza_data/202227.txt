Here we describe the generation of a live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine using proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) technology to degrade viral proteins via the endogenous ubiquitin–proteasome system of host cells. We engineered the genome of influenza A viruses in stable cell lines engineered for virus production to introduce a conditionally removable proteasome-targeting domain, generating fully infective PROTAC viruses that were live attenuated by the host protein degradation machinery upon infection. In mouse and ferret models, PROTAC viruses were highly attenuated and able to elicit robust and broad humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. PROTAC-mediated attenuation of viruses may be broadly applicable for generating live attenuated vaccines.

However, current attenuation strategies are often accompanied by decrease or loss of safety, efficacy or productivity1,13,14,15,16. In addition, immune escape due to rapid viral evolution poses a further challenge for traditional influenza vaccines1,13. Thus, there is an urgent need for new vaccine approaches that could enable the generation of safer and more effective live vaccines in a simpler way2.ResultsGeneration and characterization of PROTAC influenza virusGiven that virus replication depends on virally encoded proteins17, manipulation of viral protein stability by using the protein degradation machinery of the host cell18,19,20,21,22,23 may represent a potential approach to switch the viral life cycle on and off for vaccine development (Fig. 1a). To this aim, PROTAC viruses were designed by fusing a conditionally removable proteasome-targeting domain (PTD) to influenza viral proteins (Fig. 1a,b). The PTD was designed to contain a proteasome-targeting peptide, ALAPYIP, and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site (TEVcs) linker, ENLYFQG (Fig. 1b). It has been well-characterized that ALAPYIP is recognized by the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL), the substrate recognition component of CRL2VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and, thus, degradation of tagged proteins by proteasome24,25,26,27. The ubiquitous expression of VHL in most normal tissues and cell types could provide a critical basis with respect to the safety of PROTAC vaccines (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2)28,29,30,31. In addition, an in silico homology/identify search of PTD sequence in the human proteome from the UniProt Knowledge Base and in the known peptide major histocompatibility complex (MHC) sequence library from the Immune Epitope Database (http://www.iedb.org/) revealed the lack of peptide with high sequence homology to PTD, eliminating the potential risk of PTD to evoke an autoimmune response. Therefore, the PTD was used to selectively induce proteasomal degradation of viral proteins of interest; however, the TEVcs linker could be selectively cleaved by the tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) to separate the viral proteins from the PTD, sparing them from degradation.Fig. 1: Establishment of the PROTAC virus production system.a, Schematic illustration of the generation of PROTAC viruses that are highly reproductive in TEVp-expressing stable cells but live attenuated by proteasome-mediated viral protein destabilization in conventional cells.

CPE was measured 4–5 days after inoculation by CellTiter-Glo assay. Data are presented as mean ± s.d.; n = 3 biological replicates. f, Characterization of TEVp-dependent replication of M1-PTD by CPE. Cells were infected with M1-PTD or WT virus (MOI = 0.01), and CPE was observed 4 days after infection (n = 3). Scale bar, 200 µm.Source dataFull size imageTo achieve this design, we first generated TEVp-expressing stable cell lines to maintain the reproductive potential of PROTAC viruses during vaccine production. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK.2) cells were transduced with lentivector for stable integration of the TEVp gene into the host genome. The resultant stable cell lines, HEK293T-TEVp and MDCK-TEVp, were selected and verified by the TEVp expression measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (Fig. 1c). The capabilities of the stable cell lines to propagate wild-type (WT) viruses were tested in parallel with the respective parental cell lines by inoculation with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. Plaque formation assay indicated equal viral propagation efficiencies between each stable cell line and its corresponding parental cell line (Fig. 1d).We next selected eight viral proteins (M1, PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M2, NEP and NS1) for the incorporation of PTD (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 3). The resultant PTD-containing viral genes were individually used to generate PROTAC viruses in co-cultured HEK293T-TEVp/MDCK-TEVp cells (Fig. 1a). The putative PROTAC viruses were amplified in MDCK-TEVp cells, and their production and infectivity were verified by the cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by viral infection (Fig. 1e). M1-PTD caused obvious CPE in MDCK-TEVp cells, whereas no CPE was detected for PB2-PTD, PB1-PTD, PA-PTD, NP-PTD, M2-PTD, NEP-PTD or NS1-PTD (Fig. 1e). Quantification of viral titers by the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay and the plaque formation assay indicated that the viral titers of M1-PTD could reach to ~106 plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) after expansion in MDCK-TEVp cells, similar to those of WT virus (106–2 × 106 PFU/mL), suggesting a high propagation efficiency of M1-PTD in MDCK-TEVp cells. Notably, the CPE caused by M1-PTD was observed only in MDCK-TEVp cells and not in the conventional MDCK.2 cells (Fig. 1f), indicating the successful generation of TEVp-dependent M1-PTD. The differences between M1-PTD and other PROTAC viral strains could be partially explained by the conformations of PTD within its tagged viral proteins: the TEVcs is buried inside the other viral proteins while the proteolysis-targeting peptide is exposed (Extended Data Fig. 4), leading to low cleavage efficiency of the TEVcs and high proteolysis efficiency, as shown by protein structure prediction32.The safety of PROTAC viruses as potential vaccines heavily depends on their degrees of attenuation in conventional cells. To quantify the attenuation of M1-PTD, we measured replication kinetics of M1-PTD and WT virus in MDCK-TEVp and MDCK.2 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 (Fig. 2a). M1-PTD exhibited efficient replication only in MDCK-TEVp cells and not in MDCK.2 cells (Fig. 2a). The incorporation of PTD to M1 has minimal effect on endpoint titer of M1-PTD relative to WT virus in MDCK-TEVp cells (Fig. 2a), confirming the high production efficiency of M1-PTD in MDCK-TEVp cells. In contrast, viral titers of progeny M1-PTD expanded in MDCK.2 cells were below the limit of detection, indicating a significant decrease in the replication competence by a factor of >2 × 104 relative to WT virus (Fig. 2a). These data suggest that the conditional destabilization of viral M1 is sufficient to reversibly suppress viral replication, which was verified by plaque formation assay (Fig. 2b) and immunofluorescence staining of viral M1 and NP proteins (Fig. 2c,d), respectively. These results suggest that PROTAC virus M1-PTD may be safer than a CAIV generated by the live attenuated vaccine approach used in FluMist, the replication competence of which was decreased by a factor of only ~100 relative to WT virus at 37 °C6,33. Notably, M1-PTD was genetically stable even over 20 passages (Extended Data Fig. 5).Fig. 2: Characterization of PROTAC virus M1-PTD.a, Multicycle replication kinetic curves of M1-PTD in MDCK-TEVp and conventional MDCK.2 cells.

Green, M1 or NP; blue, nuclei; scale bar, 100 µm. g, PTD-mediated viral M1 protein degradation is dependent on the proteasome. Conventional MDCK.2 cells were infected with M1-PTD or WT viruses (MOI = 0.1) in the absence and presence of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (50 nM) and analyzed for viral M1 protein levels by western blotting at indicated times (n = 3). h, PTD-mediated viral M1 protein degradation is dependent on the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase. Conventional MDCK.2 cells were infected with M1-PTD (MOI = 0.1) in the absence and presence of 200 µM VH298, an inhibitor of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, and analyzed for viral M1 protein levels by western blotting at 48 hours after infection (n = 3).Source dataFull size imageWe then confirmed that the PTD-mediated viral protein degradation and attenuation of PROTAC virus are proteasome dependent by amplifying M1-PTD1 virus in conventional MDCK.2 cells in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132: the inhibition of proteasome by MG-132 restored the viral replication competence (Fig. 2e,f) and M1 protein levels (Fig. 2g) of M1-PTD in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, inhibition of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase by VH298 reduced viral M1 protein degradation in M1-PTD virus-infected MDCK.2 cells (Fig. 2h), confirming the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase dependence of the viral protein degradation of PROTAC virus. Finally, M1-PTD infection did not influence protein levels of HIF-1α, the endogenous substrate of VHL, even at the highest multiplicity of infection (MOI = 1) (Extended Data Fig. 6), eliminating the potential adverse effect due to substrate competition.PROTAC virus is highly attenuated in mice and ferretsWe next evaluated the in vivo safety of M1-PTD by intranasally infecting BALB/c mice and ferrets, the commonly used animal models for influenza studies. The median lethal dose (LD50) of WT virus in mice was 104 PFU, and 10 × LD50 of WT virus caused the death of all mice, accompanied by obvious body weight loss (Fig. 3a). In contrast, no death, weight loss or other indicative clinical symptoms were observed in M1-PTD-infected mice at the same dosages (Fig. 3a). By day 3 after inoculation with 105 PFU of WT or M1-PTD viruses, titers of M1-PTD in mouse turbinate, trachea and lung were 100.81, 101.06 and 101.38 PFU/mL, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of WT virus (~4-log, ~4.1-log and ~4.6-log decrease, respectively) (Fig. 3b). In the ferret model study, we further confirmed the safety of M1-PTD. By day 3 after inoculation, titers of M1-PTD in the nasal wash, trachea and lung of ferrets showed ~2.0-log, ~2.1-log and ~2.9-log decreases compared to those of WT virus, respectively (Fig. 3c). All data from the animal models indicated that influenza virus was greatly attenuated in vivo via the use of the host protein degradation machinery.Fig. 3: Evaluation of the in vivo safety of PROTAC virus M1-PTD in mice and ferrets.a, Survival rates and body weights of mice (n = 10) after intranasal infection with the indicated viruses. Data are presented as mean ± s.d. b, Viral titers in mouse tissues (n = 5) at day 3 after infection with 105 PFU of indicated viruses.

In the mouse model study, M1-PTD induced dose-dependent antibody responses in the sera 3 weeks after vaccination, as measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay, neutralization (NT) antibody assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). The titers of HI antibodies, NT antibodies and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against viral surface HA protein and internal conserved nucleoprotein (NP) elicited by M1-PTD (105 PFU) were significantly (5–50-fold) higher than those elicited by the most widely used inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and similar to those elicited by CAIV (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, high levels of mucosal immune responses, indicated by secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against influenza virus, were elicited by M1-PTD and CAIV but not by IIV vaccination (Fig. 4c). In addition to humoral and mucosal responses, M1-PTD elicited robust T cell responses against viral NP and M1 antigens in the lungs of mice, measured by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays, respectively (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Figs. 7e and 8a,b). Impressively, the viral M1 antigen-specific T cell responses elicited by M1-PTD were significantly stronger than those elicited by the replication-incompetent M1-deficient (M1 knockout (M1KO)) virus (Fig. 4e), which is potentially due to that PTD-mediated M1 degradation enhanced presentation of M1 peptide antigens (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d), consistent with the observations in the studies of PROTAC small chemical molecules34,35. In the ferret model study, M1-PTD (106 PFU) also elicited much stronger HI antibodies, NT antibodies and IgA antibodies than those elicited by IIV 3 weeks after vaccination (Fig. 4f,g). Our results from the animal models indicate that the PROTAC virus vaccine elicited broad and robust immunity, including humoral, mucosal and cellular responses.Fig. 4: Evaluation of the immunogenicity of PROTAC virus M1-PTD in mice and ferrets.a, HI and NT antibody responses in mouse sera at day 21 after vaccination (n = 5).

Data are presented as mean ± s.d.; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. f,g, Antibody responses in vaccinated ferrets. Female ferrets at the age of 4–6 months were inoculated with 106 PFU of the indicated vaccines. Three weeks after vaccination, sera were collected for detection of HI and NT antibody titers (n = 6) (f), and lungs were collected for detection of virus-specific mucosal IgA antibody titers (n = 3) (g).Source dataFull size imagePROTAC vaccine provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challengeWe then evaluated the protective efficacy of M1-PTD against homologous and heterologous virus challenges in mice and ferrets. In the mouse model study, mice immunized with M1-PTD, IIV or CAIV were challenged with 2 × 105 PFU of WT virus 3 weeks after vaccination. To determine the inhibition of viral replication in the lungs, viral titers were analyzed 3 days after challenge. Although high viral titers were detected in mock-vaccinated mice, complete protection without detectable viral titers in the lung was achieved with a single-dose vaccination of M1-PTD at 105 PFU (Fig. 5a). In terms of survival rate and body weight, all mock-vaccinated mice drastically lost body weight and died by day 7 after challenge, and only 60% of IIV-vaccinated mice survived the challenge with obvious body weight loss, whereas all M1-PTD or CAIV-vaccinated mice survived the challenge and did not show any weight loss (Fig. 5b). Strong protective effects were also observed in ferrets, which were challenged 3 weeks after vaccination with 107 PFU of WT virus. Detection of viruses in the lungs of ferrets 3 days after challenge indicated that vaccination with M1-PTD reduced viral titers by ~4.3-log compared to mock vaccination with no clinical symptom indicative of infection, whereas vaccination with IIV reduced viral titers by only ~1.7-log (Fig. 5c). To test the protection of M1-PTD vaccination against heterologous strain, ferrets immunized with 106 PFU of M1-PTD were challenged with 106 PFU of influenza A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pdmH1N1) virus. Measurement of the viral titers 3 days after challenge indicated that M1-PTD vaccination reduced viral titers in nasal washes and lungs of ferrets by ~2.7-log and ~4.7-log, respectively, suggesting that M1-PTD vaccination provided strong heterologous protection (Fig. 5d). Such broadly cross-reactive protection resulted from the broad humoral, mucosal and cytotoxic T lymphocyte immune responses elicited by PROTAC virus vaccine against the conserved epitopes on the viral surface and internal proteins1,15.Fig. 5: Characterizations of the protective efficacy of M1-PTD in mice and ferrets.a, Viral titers at day 3 after challenge with WT WSN virus in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the indicated vaccines (n = 5).

Data are plotted for individual ferrets and overlaid with mean ± s.d.; unpaired two-tailed t-test.Source dataFull size imageFinally, we tested whether this method can be applied to other influenza virus strains by incorporating PTD into M1 protein of another virus strain, influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (PR8). The resultant PROTAC virus strain, M1-PTDPR8, was also highly attenuated in conventional cells as measured by CPE assay and viral replication curves (Extended Data Fig. 9), similar to the observations in M1-PTDWSN virus strain (Figs. 1e,f and 2a).DiscussionOverall, by using the host’s protein degradation machinery to control viral protein stability, we successfully developed a PROTAC virus vaccine. An ideal vaccine should be sufficiently attenuated in the host for safety while retaining robust immunogenicity for efficacy and able to be produced efficiently in manufacturing-suitable tissue culture platforms36,37. PROTAC virus can be highly attenuated in conventional cells but can retain the ability to replicate efficiently in the engineered TEVp-expressing MDCK cell line, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human vaccine production38. PROTAC virus can be sufficiently attenuated in vivo but can elicit robust and diverse humoral, mucosal and cellular immunity and, thus, provide broad protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges.In addition to the clinically used approaches to produce IIV and CAIV, several other strategies have been developed to attenuate viruses in preclinical studies2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Compared to these existing approaches, our PROTAC virus vaccine technology uses a distinct vaccine design principle—that is, conditionally targeting viral protein to the host’s protein degradation system to create proteolysis-targeting virus as vaccine. Our approach has five key features. (1) This approach can highly attenuate viruses to a low level of viral replication in our experiments. Thus, PROTAC virus vaccine may have a higher level of safety than those generated by existing approaches, which still exhibit considerable replication competence in conventional cells and even kill hosts at high doses4, leading to safety concerns. (2) It may be a useful approach to attenuate multiple circulating seasonal or pandemic virus strains, providing a sufficient antigen match between the vaccine and target virus and, thus, stronger efficacy. This contrasts with existing vaccines, such as CAIV FluMist, wherein only HA and NA are from the circulating strains, with the remaining six internal genes being from a cold-adapted master donor virus4. This also contrasts with mRNA vaccines, which heavily depend on delivery vehicles and mainly contain viral surface protein, usually lacking other internal conserved viral proteins that are important for the triggering of long-term cellular immunity and cross-reactive protection against heterologous viruses, although mRNA could be quickly designed and scaled up39,40. (3) In principle, many PTDs can be used to generate PROTAC viruses, because more than 600 E3 ligases have been found in the human ubiquitin–proteasome system (Supplementary Table 1)27. Given the potential dysfunction or loss of VHL in patients with VHL diseases41, a systemic investigation on the diverse PTD–E3 ligase pairs and the linkers between PTD and viral proteins could enable the discovery of optimal PROTAC vaccine candidates with higher production efficiency, safety or efficacy that suit populations with different genetic backgrounds, such as individuals with defect or high expression levels of specific E3 ligases. In addition, the use of PROTAC vaccines for those who are receiving proteasome inhibitor therapy needs further evaluation for potential safety concerns. (4) It is a simple and general method, potentially applicable to many other viruses, and accessible to most laboratories. (5) It enables cost-effective vaccine production within weeks under normal cell culture conditions by using TEVp-expressing or viral proteins of interest-expressing cells (Extended Data Fig. 10), which is advantageous over the existing approaches that depend on embryonated eggs15. Therefore, this PROTAC vaccine technology could be a promising and universal strategy for creating safer and more effective vaccines against various types of viruses. The success in PROTAC vaccine technology may also represent an important breakthrough at the interface between basic research of protein degradation machinery and vaccine development, emerging as a new frontier for both areas.MethodsViruses, cells and vaccinesInfluenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (WSN) and influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (PR8) were used as study models. Influenza A/Netherlands/602/2009 virus (pdmH1N1) was kindly provided by Ron A. M. Fouchier from the National Influenza Center and Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands. WSN and pdmH1N1 viruses were used for the challenge experiments in mice and ferrets. HEK293T (CRL-3216) and MDCK.2 (CRL-2936) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, 10569-010 or c11995500BT) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10082-147, or PAN, ST30-3302), 100 µg ml−1 of streptomycin and 100 U ml−1 of penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MDCK.2 is a standard cell line in the field of influenza virus and vaccine research and has been approved by the FDA for human vaccine production42. Raw264.7 cell line was kindly provided by Tianhui Hu from the Cancer Research Center of Xiamen University and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, c11995500BT) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAN, ST30-3302), 100 µg ml−1 of streptomycin and 100 U ml−1 of penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The clinically used approaches were used to generate the most widely used IIV and CAIV as positive controls6,33,43,44. To generate IIV, WSN influenza virus-containing culture supernatants were treated with 0.1–0.2% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 1 week. After confirmation of viral inactivation by the absence of detectable infectious virus in MDCK.2 cells, the formalin-inactivated virus was purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and quantified for concentration of HA by ELISA43,44. The doses of IIV and PROTAC vaccine used in animal experiments were unified by the same amount of HA. To generate CAIV, five cold-adapted mutations from clinically used influenza vaccine FluMist were incorporated into three gene segments of WSN influenza virus: 265S in PB2; 391E, 581G and 661T in PB1; and 34G in NP6,33. CAIV was validated by the temperature-sensitive and attenuation phenotypes as described previously6,33. A replication-incompetent M1-deficient virus (M1KO) was also generated by introducing a stop codon at P16 of M1 protein of WSN influenza virus and propagating this virus in M1-expressing HEK293T cells, as described previously with modifications45.Plasmid constructionThe 12-plasmid influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus rescue system46 and the eight-plasmid influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus rescue system47 were kindly provided by George F. Gao from the Center for Molecular Virology, CAS Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Xavier Saelens from the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology. Engineered plasmids containing cleavable PTD within the open reading frame were obtained from the WT plasmids via mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed by gene sequencing (TsingKe Beijing). The lentiviral vector (lenti-TEVp) used to generate the TEVp-expressing stable cell lines was a gift from Marco Tripodi. The helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G-VSVG) were kindly provided from Corregene Biotechnology.

Then, a mixture of 15 µg of lenti-TEVp plasmid, 9 µg of psPAX2 and 6 µg of pMD2G-VSVG was transfected into the cells using TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours later, the transfection medium was replaced by DMEM (Gibco, with sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 3% FBS. The lentivirus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 hours after transfection and filtered through a 0.45-µm filter. Then, stable lentiviral transduction was performed to integrate the TEVp gene into the genome of HEK293T and MDCK.2 cells. HEK293T or MDCK.2 cells were seeded in a six-well plate and transduced 24 hours later with lentiviral filtrates in the presence of 8 µg ml−1 of polybrene. Then, selection was performed under the pressure of 2 µg ml−1 of puromycin (InvivoGen, ani-pr) until parental cells completely died. The resultant stably transduced cells were subjected to monoclonal culture by inoculating into a 96-well plate. The HEK293T-TEVp and MDCK-TEVp cells with the highest TEVp expression levels were selected for influenza virus generation.qRT–PCRCells were collected and RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 52906) and reverse transcribed into cDNA by using Reverse Transcription System (Promega, A3500), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Absolute quantification of copy numbers of TEVp mRNA in cells was performed using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, A6001), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lenti-TEVp plasmid was used as standard DNA to obtain the standard curve. The forward and reverse primers for TEVp were TCATTACAAACAAGCACTTG and TAGGCATGCGAATAATTATC, respectively. The forward and reverse primers for viral NP were TCAAGTGAGAGAGAGCCGGA and TCAAAGTCGTACCCACTGGC, respectively. The PCR conditions were one cycle at 95 °C for 5 minutes; 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 20 seconds; and one cycle at 95 °C for 15 seconds, 60 °C for 15 seconds and 95 °C for 15 seconds. The data were analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Western blottingTotal protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Lysates were separated on FuturePAGE 4–12% tris-glycine gels (ACE, F11412Gel) or Novex WedgeWell 4–20% tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen, XP04200BOX) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Invitrogen, IB24001, or Millipore, IPVH00010). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (YEASEN, 36120ES76, or BD Biosciences, 232100) in TBST (0.1% Tween-20 in tris-buffered saline) (Coolaber, SL1328-500mL×10, or Abcam, ab64204) before overnight incubation with indicated antibodies. After incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, the bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce West Femto ECL).Generation of WT influenza viruses and PROTAC influenza viruses harboring cleavable PTD(s) in their genomeFor generation of WT WSN influenza virus, 2 × 105 cells per well from the HEK293T-TEVp cell line under passage 15 and 5 × 104 cells per well from the MDCK-TEVp cell line under passage 15 were seeded into six-well plates in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 2 µg ml−1 of puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr). The co-culture of HEK293T and MDCK.2 cells is a standard method to generate influenza viruses: HEK293T cells enable highly efficient transfection of plasmids for the first round of virus production, whereas MDCK.2 cells further expand the progeny viruses to higher titers48. Twenty-four hours later, a mixture of 0.2 µg each of the plasmids in the virus rescue system was transfected into the HEK293T-TEVp/MDCK-TEVp co-culture using TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus, MIR 6003), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 6 hours, the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were further cultured for 4 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and then the supernatant was collected. The virus in the supernatant was amplified in MDCK-TEVp cells in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. The supernatant containing the generated virus was harvested and centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 minutes to remove cell debris. To generate PROTAC influenza viruses, an almost identical procedure was carried out with the following modification: the plasmid-expressing WT viral RNA was replaced by the corresponding engineered plasmid harboring cleavable PTD within the open reading frame.For generation of WT PR8 influenza virus, 2 × 105 cells per well from the HEK293T-TEVp cell line under passage 15 and 105 cells per well from the MDCK-TEVp cell line under passage 15 were seeded into six-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 2 µg ml−1 of puromycin (InvivoGen, ant-pr). Twenty-four hours later, cell culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Gibco, 31985-070), and a mixture of 0.4 µg each of the plasmids in the virus rescue system was transfected into the HEK293T-TEVp/MDCK-TEVp co-culture using TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus, MIR 6003), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 6 hours, the transfection medium was replaced with Opti-MEM. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell culture was supplemented with 0.5 µg ml−1 of TPCK-trypsin. The cells were further cultured for 4–5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and then the supernatant was collected. The virus in the supernatant was amplified in MDCK-TEVp cells in Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.5 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. The supernatant containing the generated virus was harvested and centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 minutes to remove cell debris. To generate PROTAC influenza virus, an almost identical procedure was carried out with the following modification: the plasmid-expressing WT viral RNA was replaced by the corresponding engineered plasmid harboring cleavable PTD within the open reading frame.CPE assayCells were seeded into six-well or 96-well plates, cultured for 24 hours and incubated with influenza viruses in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. After 4–5 days of incubation, CPE was observed and recorded under microscope. The CPE was precisely quantified by CellTiter-Glo assay, a standard method of determining the number of viable cells. In brief, CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added to each well, and the plates were read using a plate reader, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Plaque formation assayMDCK.2 cells or MDCK-TEVp cells were seeded in a 12-well plate to produce a confluent monolayer. The next day, the cells were washed with PBS and infected with a ten-fold dilution series of the virus in DMEM medium, in a total volume of 1 ml. The inoculum was removed after 1 hour of incubation at 37 °C and replaced by 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 1.5% low-melting-point agarose (Amresco, 0815-100G) and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. After 4–5 days of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). Visible plaques were counted, and the virus titers were determined.TCID50 assayMDCK.2 cells or MDCK-TEVp cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5,000 cells per well. Twenty-four hours later, cell culture medium was removed, and cells were infected with ten-fold serial dilutions of viral supernatants starting at 1:10 in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-trypsin. The assay was carried out in eight parallels with the last column of the 96-well plate as cell control without virus. After 4–5 days of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich). The percentage of CPE was recorded for each virus dilution, and the TCID50 per milliliter (TCID50/ml) for given virus was calculated according to the Reed–Muench method49. The viral titers were expressed as PFU/mL by multiplying the TCID50/ml by 0.7 (ref. 50).Virus growth kinetics analysisTo determine in vitro virus growth kinetics, 15–20 × 104 cells per well from MDCK-TEVp cell line or MDCK.2 cell line were seeded into six-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected with an MOI = 0.01 of viruses for 1 hour at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were further cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. At the indicated times after infection (24, 48, 72 and 96 hours), the cell supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by the plaque formation assay and TCID50 assay as described above.Immunofluorescence assayInfluenza virus propagation in TEVp-expressing stable cells and conventional cells was determined by immunofluorescence. Then, 105 cells per well from MDCK-TEVp cell line or MDCK.2 cell line were seeded into 12-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected with an MOI = 0.01 of viruses in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. To confirm that the live attenuation of the PROTAC viruses was proteasome dependent, a parallel experiment was conducted, in which the culture medium was supplemented with indicated concentrations of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich, M7449-1mL). Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) and blocked with 10% goat serum in PBST. Anti-M1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, NBP2-14995, or Sino Biological, 40010-RP01) or anti-NP antibody (Abcam, ab128193) was used to detect influenza viral M1 or NP protein, respectively. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies) was used as secondary antibody. Cell nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were recorded with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon), and image processing was done using NIS-Elements (Nikon). Virus infection was quantified by measuring the percentages of M1-positive or NP-positive cells in 3–5 different fields for each condition.Genetic stability evaluation of PROTAC influenza virusesMDCK-TEVp cells at 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates were infected with PROTAC influenza virus strains at an MOI of 0.01 in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin. When >90% CPE was observed, the supernatants were harvested and used for infection in the next round of investigation. The procedure was repeated more than 20 times. Influenza viral RNA was extracted by using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed into cDNA by using Reverse Transcription System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant cDNA products were subjected to sequencing to investigate whether any mutation occurred during virus propagation.Concentration and purification of influenza virus particlesInfluenza viruses were produced as described above. The virus-containing supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 103g for 15 minutes at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Then, the supernatant was collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 105g for 2 hours at 4 °C in a Ti40 rotor. The resultant virus precipitation was resuspended in 500 µl of buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA and purified by density gradient centrifugation of sucrose (20–60%) at 105g for 2 hours at 4 °C in a SW40 rotor. The banded viruses were collected, diluted with buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation at 105g for 2 hours at 4 °C in a SW40 rotor and resuspended in PBS. The purified viruses were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C until use. The influenza virus particles could also be concentrated and purified using PEGeasy Virus Concentration Reagent (DongLing Biotech, GE-19002-50), according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications. In brief, the virus-containing supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 3,200g for 15 minutes at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Then, the supernatant was collected and incubated with PEG solution overnight at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3,200g for 30 minutes at 4 °C. The resultant virus precipitation was resuspended in PBS and either used immediately or stored at −80 °C until use.Mouse studiesFemale specific-pathogen-free BALB/c, C57BL/6J and BALB/c nude mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology and GemPharmatech) at the age of 6–8 weeks were used to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and protection efficacy of vaccines.

At day 21 after vaccination, the ferrets were challenged with 106 PFU of heterologous influenza A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pdmH1N1) viruses. At day 3 after challenge, nasal washes and organs were collected from three ferrets in each group for quantification of virus titers by plaque formation assay.Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Sinovac Biotech, Servicebio and Peking University.Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. The use of paraffin-embedded and frozen sections of human lung tissue was in accordance with all relevant ethical regulations and approved by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University.HI assayThe titers of HI antibodies in sera samples were tested by a standard HI assay5. In brief, receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE)-incubated sera samples were pre-treated for 30 minutes at 56 °C. Sera samples were two-fold serially diluted starting at 1:10 in PBS in a V-shaped 96-well plate and incubated with four HA units of WT virus for 1 hour at 37 °C. Then, 0.5% (v/v) chicken red blood cells in PBS were added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The HI titers were read as the highest dilution of sera samples that inhibited hemagglutination.Virus NT assayMDCK.2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to produce a confluent monolayer. RDE-treated sera samples were two-fold serially diluted starting at 1:10 in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and incubated with virus (MOI = 0.01) for 1 hour at 37 °C. Then, the sera/virus mixture was applied to MDCK.2 cells in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and 2 μg ml−1 of TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated for 3–5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. CPE was observed and recorded. Antibody neutralizing titers were read as the reciprocals of the highest dilution of sera samples that completely inhibited CPE.ELISAELISA was used to analyze IgG antibody in sera and IgA antibody in BAL samples from the immunized animals. Recombinant proteins (HA and NP) of WT viruses (1 µg ml−1) (Sino Biological, 11692-V08H for HA and 11675-V08B for NP) were diluted in ELISA coating buffer (Solarbio, C1055). Then, 50 µl of this solution was added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA microplate (Corning, 3590) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), 100 µl of blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk (YEASEN, 36120ES60) in washing buffer) was applied to all wells for 1 hour at 37 °C. After removing the blocking buffer and washing three times with washing buffer, 100 µl of serum or BAL samples diluted in blocking buffer was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 2 hours at 37 °C. After washing three times with washing buffer, 100 µl of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Proteintech) or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse/ferret IgA antibody (Abcam/Rockland Immunochemicals) diluted in blocking buffer was applied to each well for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. After washing five times with washing buffer, microplates were detected with 100 µl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate (Beyotime, P0209), and the reaction was stopped after 15 minutes by the addition of 100 µl of ELISA stop solution (Solarbio, C1058). The spectroscopic absorbance of each well was read by an automated plate reader (BioTek Synergy H1) at a wavelength of 450 nm.Analysis of influenza virus-induced T cell responses by flow cytometryTetramer staining and flow cytometry were used to detect influenza virus NP-specific CD8+ T cells5,6. In brief, mouse lung tissues were harvested, and single-cell suspensions were generated. T cell population was enriched using the EasySep Mouse T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) and stained with anti-mouse CD8a-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences) and phycoerythrin-conjugated H-2Db tetramer specific to influenza viral NP epitope (NP366–374, ASNENMETM) (MBL). To detect CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, the single-cell suspensions were strained with APC anti-mouse CD8a antibody (BioLegend) or APC anti-mouse CD4 antibody (BioLegend), respectively. Samples were analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and CytExpert software.IFN-γ ELISpotInfluenza viral M1 peptide-specific T cell responses were detected by an IFN-γ ELISpot assay (Mabtech, 3321-4AST-2), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, pre-coated 96-well plates with anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody were washed four times with sterile PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from lung tissues and added to the plate (5 × 105 cells per well). Then, M1 peptide was added to the wells with a final concentration of 5 µg ml−1. After 24–30 hours of incubation in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2, the cells were removed, and the plates were washed five times with PBS. Then, the plates were processed in turn with biotinylated detection antibody R4-6A2, streptavidin-ALP and BCIP/NBT-plus substrate. When distinct spots emerged, the color development was stopped by extensive wash with deionized water. The numbers of the spots were recorded by an ELISpot reader (Cellular Technology).The following M1 peptides (synthesized by GenScript) were used in this experiment:M1128–135: MGLIYNRMM158–66: GILGFVFTLQuantification of M1 antigen presentationTo quantify M1 antigen presentation, Raw264.7 cells at 8 × 105 cells per well were seeded into six-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected with M1-PTD or M1KO viruses (MOI = 0.1) in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and 2 µg ml−1 of TPCK-trypsin. The uninfected cells were used as control. Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were harvested, and the M1 antigen peptides on cell surface were stained with anti-M1 antibody (Sino Biological, 40010-RP01) or customized specific antibody against M1 peptide (M1128–135: MGLIYNRM). Samples were analyzed with a FACS flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and CytExpert software.Protein structure predictionThe structure models of PTD-tagged influenza viral proteins were predicted by I-TASSER32, a composite protein structure prediction approach combining template-based modeling and ab initio loop reconstruction. In brief, the full-length query sequence (influenza viral protein plus the PTD peptide) was searched through the Protein Data Bank by LOMETS51 for potential templates to model the PTD peptide. Meanwhile, each native structure of influenza viral proteins was specified as an additional structure template by the ‘-restraint2’ flag of the I-TASSER suite. The structure fragments from the templates were assembled into full-length structure by I-TASSER using replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) simulation. To ensure that the I-TASSER structure model did not deviate from the native structure of viral protein, the REMC simulation was guided by a generic I-TASSER force field with additional distance restraint to the native structure of viral protein. Conformations from REMC simulation trajectory are clustered by pairwise structure similarity and refined at the atomic level to derive the final model. Apart from the assignment of the influenza viral protein structure for additional template restraint, I-TASSER was run with default parameters. The viral protein portions of all predicted protein structures are almost same to the native structure of influenza viral proteins (template modeling (TM) score >0.9)52.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated at least two times. Data are presented as mean values ± s.d. Graphing and statistical comparison of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 and Microsoft Excel. Two-group comparisons were assessed using the two-tailed Student’s t-test; comparisons of three or more groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant; exact P values are labeled in each figure. Images represent as least two independent experiments for images shown in Figs. 1c and 2b–e,g,h and Extended Data Figs. 2a–c and 6.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Data are from GTEx Analysis Release V8 (dbGaP accession number phs000424.v8.p2) (https://gtexportal.org/home/gene/VHL). Box plots are shown as median and 25th and 75th percentiles; points are displayed as outliers if they are above or below 1.5 times the interquartile range. TPM, transcripts per million. b, Expression of VHL in mouse tissues based on RNA-seq data of E-MTAB-2801 in Expression Atlas. Data are presented as mean ± SD; n = 2 for heart and 3 for others. c, Expression of VHL in the human lung. Data are from the Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134086-VHL/single+cell+type/lung)53. pTPM, transcripts per million protein coding genes.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 2 VHL is widely expressed in lungs of mouse and human.a, Western blotting images showing the expression of VHL in lungs of BALB/c and C57BL/6 J mice. b, Immunohistochemistry images showing the expression of VHL (brown) in lungs of BALB/c mouse, C57BL/6 J mouse, and human (n = 3). c, Immunofluorescence image showing the expression of VHL in primary human lung alveolar epithelium cultured on Transwells. Green, VHL; blue, nuclei. All experiments were repeated at least two times.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 3 Schematic structure model of the influenza A virion.Influenza A virions are enveloped spherical structures with diameters of 80–120 nm54. The genome of each influenza A virion contains eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments, encoding 10 main viral proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), M2, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic protein (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), and nuclear export protein (NEP, also known as NS2). HA and NA are two main antigenic determinants of influenza virus, which are on the surface of the viral envelope and mediate viral entry into host cells and release of progeny virions from host cells, respectively. M2 is the third integral membrane protein, which forms ion channels in virion particles and has roles in viral entry, assembly, and budding. M1, the most abundant protein in the virion, lines the internal surface of the viral lipid bilayer and mediates the interactions between the viral membrane and ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNP is a complex structure composed of multiple copies of the viral NP, which wraps eight viral RNA genome segments, and a single RNA polymerase, which binds to the termini of each RNA genome segment. The RNA polymerase has three subunits: PB1, PB2, and PA, which are responsible for viral replication and transcription17,54. NS1 plays an important role in evasion of the host innate immune system and facilitates viral replication. NEP mediates the export of the newly synthesized viral RNP from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.Extended Data Fig. 4 Structure prediction of PTD-tagged influenza viral proteins according to I-TASSER32.Green, viral protein; blue, TEVcs linker; orange, proteasome-targeting peptides. Top images showing the overall structures of influenza viral proteins containing PTD, bottom images showing the close-up views on PTD domain in each influenza viral protein. The PDB IDs of M1, PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and NS1 are 7JM3, 4WSB, 4WSB, 4IUJ, 2IQH, and 4OPH, respectively.Extended Data Fig. 5 Verification of the genetic stability of M1-PTD by sequencing after 20 passages in MDCK-TEVp cells.The gene sequence used to construct the M1-PTD was used as the template.Extended Data Fig. 6 M1-PTD infection had no effect on HIF-1α, the endogenous substrate of VHL, even at MOI = 1.0.MDCK.2 cells were infected with M1-PTD (MOI = 0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0) and analyzed for HIF-1α protein levels by western blotting at 48 h post-infection. The experiment was repeated two times.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 7 The dose-dependent immune responses elicited by M1-PTD in WT mice and the immune responses elicited by M1-PTD in BALB/c Nude mice.a, HI antibody responses elicited by indicated dosages of M1-PTD in the sera of WT BALB/c (left) and BALB/c Nude (right) mice at day 21 post-vaccination (n = 5). Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; left graph, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test; right graph, unpaired two-tailed t-test; n.s., not significant. b, NT antibody responses elicited by indicated dosages of M1-PTD in the sera of WT BALB/c (left) and BALB/c Nude (right) mice at day 21 post-vaccination (n = 5). Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; left graph, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test; right graph, unpaired two-tailed t-test; n.s., not significant. c, Anti-HA antibody responses elicited by indicated dosages of M1-PTD in the sera of WT BALB/c (left) and BALB/c Nude (right) mice at day 21 post-vaccination (n = 5). Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; left graph, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test; right graph, unpaired two-tailed t-test; n.s., not significant. d, Anti-NP antibody responses elicited by indicated dosages of M1-PTD in the sera of WT BALB/c (left) and BALB/c Nude (right) mice at day 21 post-vaccination (n = 5). Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; left graph, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test; right graph, unpaired two-tailed t-test; n.s., not significant. Note that M1-PTD did not induce immune response in T cell-deficient BALB/c Nude mice, indicating that T cell response may be the driver for the immunity elicited by M1-PTD. e, Viral M1 antigen-specific T cell responses elicited by indicated dosages of M1-PTD in the lungs of WT C57BL/6 J mice at day 7 post-vaccination (n = 5), measured by ELISpot assay. Two peptides, M1128-135 MGLIYNRM (left) and M158-66 GILGFVFTL (right), were used as the stimuli. IFNγ-expressing cells per million cells were shown. Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 8 T cell responses induced by M1-PTD and M1 antigen presentation mediated by PTD.a, CD8 and CD4 T cell responses elicited by 105 PFU of M1-PTD, CAIV, and M1-KO vaccines in lungs of C57BL/6 J mice at day 7 post-vaccination, measured by flow cytometry. Data are plotted for individual mice and overlaid with mean ± SD; n = 3 mice for Vehicle in left graph, 4 mice for CAIV in left graph, and 5 mice for all other groups; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. b, Representative flow cytometry histograms are shown for lung samples from mice vaccinated with 105 PFU of M1-PTD. Purple, stained cells; red, unstained cells. c and d, PTD-mediated M1 degradation increases M1 antigen presentation in Raw264.7 cells. Raw264.7 cells were infected with M1-PTD or M1KO virus (MOI = 0.1). 24 hours after infection, M1 antigen presentation on the surface of Raw264.7 cells was detected by an anti-M1 peptide (M1128-135: MGLIYNRM) antibody (c) or an anti-M1 antibody (d) using flow cytometry. Data are presented as mean ± SD; n = 3 biological replicates; unpaired two-tailed t-test.Source dataExtended Data Fig. 9 Characterization of the broad applicability of PROTAC virus vaccine strategy.a, Generation and characterization of PROTAC virus M1-PTDPR8 by incorporating PTD to M1 protein of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus (PR8).

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors for illness among humans exposed to infected birds. As of April 3, 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 82.05 million birds in 48 U.S. states had been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since February 2022. Out of the 1,116 flocks to test positive for the virus, 473 were commercial and 643 were backyard flocks. Yet, since 2020, only 28 human cases associated with this particular group of avian influenza have been detected globally—2 of which occurred in the U.S. Understanding the history of this virus, as well as current guidelines and recommendations for investigations and response (i.e., monitoring for human infection and person-to-person spread) are extremely important for public health. History of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza It was 1878 in northern Italy, and veterinarian Edoardo Perroncito observed a problem. A contagious respiratory disease was spreading among poultry with a high fatality rate. At the time, "fowl cholera," a deadly respiratory disease, caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida, was common and believed to be the culprit of the disease. As other investigators studied Perroncito’s findings throughout the 1900s, they determined that the disease was caused by a virus small enough to pass through a filter, which was later determined to be a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and was officially renamed as such in 1981.

As HPAI continued to spread globally throughout the 1920s, sporadic outbreaks occurred, including several in the U.S. From 1959-1995, the emergence of HPAI across the world was reported on 15 separate occasions. All infections were caused by the influenza A virus, but the subtypes varied between H5 and H7 groups. (Note: influenza A virus is divided into subtypes, based on the properties of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins present on the virus’s surface). Interestingly, until 1996, the U.K. was disproportionately impacted by the disease, while only 1 outbreak was known to have occurred in all of Asia. Millions of birds culled in Asia to prevent the spread of HPAI H5N1. Source: flickr. In 1996, things changed. A new strain of HPAI subtype H5N1 was introduced to poultry via migratory waterfowl in the Guangdong province of China, resulting in a mortality of greater than 40% in aquatic birds. Subsequent reassortment events between HPAI and low pathogenic avian influenza strains (LPAI) led to an HPAI strain that was disastrous for Hong Kong, resulting in the culling of the entire poultry population, 18 human infections and 6 human deaths. This was the first time a lethal case of HPAI in humans had been documented; human infection with HPAI was previously believed to be improbable. After the outbreak of HPAI in Hong Kong in 1997, things remained quiet until 2003 when 2 humans were diagnosed with HPAI H5N1 after returning from China. From 2003-2018, human cases were reported from 16 countries, resulting in hundreds of deaths. Clinical Picture in Animals and Humans Symptoms and Transmission of Avian Influenza in Birds Fortunately, many avian influenza A viruses exhibit low pathogenicity, causing few signs of disease in infected wild birds. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses are either asymptomatic or cause mild/subclinical disease (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production) in chickens and poultry. However, these viruses are primed for continual emergence and pandemic potential, and some low-pathogenic viruses can mutate in poultry into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. HPAI viruses often cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry. HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus infections can cause disease that impacts multi-organ systems with mortality as high as 90-100% in chickens, often within 48 hours. HPAI A(H5N1) is one of the most contagious viruses occurring among birds, and the clinical outcome is typically deadly, especially in domestic poultry. However, ducks can be infected without any signs of illness. HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus infections in poultry also can spill back into wild birds, resulting in rapid geographic dissemination of the virus with bird migration. While some wild bird species can be infected with some HPAI A(H5) or A(H7) virus subtypes without appearing sick, other HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) virus subtypes can cause severe disease and mortality in some infected wild birds, as well as in infected poultry. Transmission of Avian Influenza from Birds to Humans When birds are infected with this virus, they shed bird flu virus through their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections are likely caused by accidental inoculation of virus into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth or via respiratory routes. Inhalation of virus occurs when the virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust), and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches a fomite (contaminated object) that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. No human bird flu infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products. Bird flu transmission from human–to-human is very rare, and when it has happened it has only spread to a few people. Human infections with bird flu viruses have ranged in severity from asymptomatic/mild illness to severe disease resulting in mortality. Asian lineage H7N9 and Asian lineage H5N1 viruses have been responsible for most human illness from bird flu viruses globally, including the most serious illnesses and illness with the highest mortality. Research has also reported that companion animals, especially cats, may be at risk of disease and/or death from HPAI. Dogs may also be susceptible, but only in rare instances. Some strains of the virus can affect mammals, such as pigs, cats, horses, dogs and ferrets. Symptoms of Avian Influenza in Humans What does a bird flu infection in people look like? The reported signs and symptoms of this type of infection in humans range from asymptomatic to mild (e.g., conjunctivitised eye) or mild, flu-like (e.g., upper respiratory symptoms), to more severe (e.g., pneumonia requiring hospitalization). Fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater), cough, sore throat, congestion, achiness, headaches, fatigue and shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, are common. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or seizures may be observed more rarely. One Health Epidemiology for Tracking and Prevention The One Health initiative is a collaborative, multisectoral and transdisciplinary approach—working at the local, regional, national and global levels—with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes, recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants and their shared environment. Source: CDC. HPAI is a 1 of many examples that illustrates the ongoing and critical importance of a One Health initiative for zoonotic and/or vector borne diseases that intersect animal and plant health, environmental space and human health. A recent Health Alert Network (HAN) CDC Advisory for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus: Recommendations for Human Health Investigations and Response was released for multiple entities and personnel. For full guidelines and descriptions of the recommendations, please see the CDC HAN Advisory. Current State of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Prevention The pandemic risk associated with HPAI is high. The combination of rapid mutations in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins and increased risk of HPAI spillover from poultry to humans is cause for significant concern. H5N1 HPAI was replaced by H5N6 and H5N8 subtypes from 2014 through 2020. However, in 2021 H5N1 emerged again and seemed to be more fit to predominate. Since early 2021, the new H5N1 HPAI responsible for the ongoing outbreak has effectively displaced other H5 HPAI viruses. While the reason for this is not entirely clear, it is believed that the explosion of cases is due to the introduction and spread of the virus by migratory birds. The first human case of the current avian influenza outbreak in the U.S. occurred in a worker who was culling a flock of poultry with suspected avian influenza in Colorado in April 2022. In April 2024, a second person tested positive after exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with HPAI H5N1 virus. The CDC stresses that the increased detection of H5 influenza in birds does not change the risk to the general public’s health, and the risk of members of the general public acquiring infection with avian influenza is low. While no human-to-human transmission has occurred with the avian influenza that is currently circulating in the U.S., the CDC is closely watching for signals that might indicate increased risk of infection for the general public.

Source: United States Geological Survey Although a vaccine against HPAI in poultry is available, it is not commonly used and presents many challenges. Mass poultry vaccination has been successfully accomplished in countries with good veterinary infrastructure, but barriers include regular reformulation of the vaccine, limited cold chain capacity, government participation and costs. Furthermore, if vaccination is not performed properly it can contribute to the emergence of new field strains. The greatest risk of infection is for individuals who directly handle or work around poultry. This is an exceptionally important risk to consider, given that the COVID-19 pandemic and fears of food shortages contributed to an exponential increase in backyard poultry ownership. The CDC has developed individual guidance documents for various audiences, which include hunters, the general public, poultry producers (including those who have backyard poultry), poultry outbreak responders and healthcare providers. Early in the summer of 1999, county health departments across New York began to report an alarming and widespread uptick in the number of dead birds found on the ground. Between May and Nov., more than 15,000 dead birds were reported. What caused this die-off? Read this next article, featured in the Winter 2021 issue of Microcosm, our flagship member magazine.

The double-layered protein nanoparticle vaccine, which is constructed with a stabilized portion of the influenza virus (the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk), induced broadly reactive immune responses and conferred robust and sustained cross-immune protection against influenza B virus strains of both lineages. The findings are published in the journal Biomaterials. Influenza epidemics pose a major threat to public health, and type B influenza has coincided with several severe flu outbreaks. About one-fourth of clinical infection cases are caused by influenza B viruses each year. Influenza B viruses are sometimes the dominant circulating strains during influenza seasons, such as the 2019-20 U.S. flu season when influenza B caused more than 50 percent of the infections. Influenza B has two lineages that are genetically distinct and trigger different immune responses. Seasonal flu vaccines are developed with one or both lineages of influenza B viruses, but they’re limited by the ability of circulating strains to escape the immune system or vaccination. These vaccines are often ineffective because the variable portion of the influenza virus (the HA head) evolves. As a result, seasonal influenza vaccines need to be reformulated and updated frequently. To overcome these limitations, a universal influenza vaccine containing conserved parts of the virus and providing substantial broad cross-protection against diverse virus strains is urgently needed. “In this study, we generated structure-stabilized HA stalk antigens from influenza B and fabricated double-layered protein nanoparticles as universal influenza B vaccine candidates,” said Dr. Baozhong Wang, senior author of the study and Distinguished University Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University. “We found that layered protein nanoparticles incorporated with structure-stabilized constant antigens have potential as a universal influenza vaccine with improved immune protective potency and breadth.” The nanoparticle vaccine was tested in cell culture and in mice. Studies in cell culture found the protein nanoparticles were effectively taken up to activate dendritic cells, which are critical for inducing protective immune responses against pathogens. The vaccine was found to be safe, biocompatible, biodegradable and highly immunogenic in animals. “Our next aim is to combine the influenza A nanoparticles from our previous study with the influenza B nanoparticles we have fabricated and tested here to create a multivalent universal influenza nanoparticle vaccine against both influenza A and B,” Wang said. Co-authors of the study include Yufeng Song (first author), Wandi Zhu, Ye Wang, Lei Deng, Yao Ma, Chunhong Dong, Gilbert X. Gonzalez, Joo Kim, Lai Wei, Sang-Moo Kang and Bao-Zhong Wang of the Center for Inflammation, Immunity & Infection in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State.

Taubenberger, senior investigator for the NIH, told Medical News Today.“On a global level, millions of influenza infections occur annually, mainly in the form of seasonal epidemics causing millions of severe infections and up to 500,000 deaths.”– Dr. Jeffrey K. Taubenberger“On top of that,” he noted, “the unpredictable introduction of antigenically novel influenza A viruses from animals to humans can lead to the development of pandemics with even greater public health impacts. The 1918 influenza pandemic resulted in at least 50 million deaths globally.”Dr. Taubenberger is the principal investigator of a promising animal study testing a universal flu vaccine in mice.While the final publication of Dr. Taubenberger’s research is not expected until later this month, it has become the basis of a universal vaccine candidate called BPL-1357. It is now entering phase 1 clinical trials at the NIH to assess its safety for humans.A successful universal flu vaccine would be effective against current and future viral strains and not require yearly reformulation or shots.“If such a vaccine strategy could be developed,” said Dr. Taubenberger, “this would be a major public health achievement.”What the experimental vaccine containsBPL-1357 contains strains of avian flu. Dr. Taubenberger explained why: “All influenza A viruses in humans are ultimately derived from the wild avian viral pool, which is very extensive and diverse antigenically and genetically.”“In birds, there are 16 subtypes of hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 subtypes of neuraminidase (NA), the two major surface proteins of the virus,” he pointed out.“We chose a set containing 4 HA subtypes — H1, H3, H5, and H7 — for two reasons,” he went on to explain. “First, H1 and H3 have caused the majority of human influenza infections over the last century. H5 and H7 avian viruses have caused a number of zoonotic human infections, and are considered possible pandemic threats. Secondly, H1 and H5 are group 1 HA molecules, while H3 and H7 are group 2 HAs, [that] hopefully maximize development of broad protective immunity.”Similar considerations went into the selection of NA strains.All the strains in BPL-1357 are killed viruses.While theoretically safe, Dr. Sylvie Alonso, associate professor at the National University of Singapore — not involved in the current research — cautioned, “manufacturing of this type of vaccine is a complicated process that has a certain level of safety risk since big quantities of live virus need to be grown and handled.”Dr. Alonso added, that it “requires stringent safety checks to ensure that the inactivation of the viruses has been 100%. Ensuring that the virus does not mutate while being cultured in big quantity is also an important aspect.”Delivery methodThe NIH clinical trial will test the delivery of BPL-1357 both via intramuscular injection and intranasally. Researchers are hopeful that the nasal delivery route will be at least as successful as the shot.Dr. Peter Palese, professor and chairman of the Department of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai in New York City — also not involved in the animal study or trial — told MNT:“It is a very good strategy because the antibodies are right in the mucosal area, [so infection is less likely] and second, because they are also preventing transmission from [one] immunized person to the next one.”In children, he said, a nasal vaccine can be a “very, very good vaccine. In adults the efficacy is somewhat lower, and there’s a very simple explanation. [Virally] naive children, if they get the vaccine, will make an antibody. [Many] older people have a partial pre-immunity that makes the live vaccine not as good in adults as one would hope.”He remains hopeful for BPL-1357, though, since it uses killed viruses, “so that’s not a problem.”Still, he is withholding judgment for now: “Okay, let me just say it is always easier to protect mice. So, I think this is a [like the] the Missouri license plate: ‘Show Me’.”Why create a universal flu vaccine?Dr. Palese explained the value of developing a universal flu vaccine: “We have always four components in our influenza vaccine. We have two influenza A components, and two influenza B components. Every year in February, there is an FDA [Food and Drug Administration committee] that has to make a decision based on surveillance what each of these four components will be in the next vaccine formulation.”This decision is made in June or July, Dr. Palese says, in hopes that there will be a “good match of these components with the actual variants circulating in November or December.”It does not always work, however. “We had even situations where we had really only 20% efficacy,” noted Dr. Palese.Still, he pointed out that, even so: “The current influenza virus vaccines are, in my opinion, much better than their reputation is. Yes, they are not perfect. If they say it’s only 50% effective, in 50% of the cases, you have no symptoms whatsoever. In the other 50%, there are some symptoms. However, these are much milder than in a person who would not have been vaccinated.”Dr. Palese says the yearly process is also very costly: “Every year a large number of doses of the influenza virus vaccines are actually thrown out because the next year, components have to be reevaluated.”People also have to be reminded each year to get a flu shot.“A universal vaccine,” said Dr. Palese, “could be defined as a vaccine that you don’t have to take every year, maybe only once in a lifetime.“Clinical Trials / Drug TrialsFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesFluShare this articleWritten by Robby Berman on July 5, 2022 — Fact checked by Catherine Carver, BA, MPH, MBChBLatest newsClassic and green Mediterranean diets may help slow brain agingRheumatoid arthritis linked to changes in the gut microbiome in new studyDaytime sleepiness may be a sign of higher dementia riskCould taking fish oil supplements help lower cancer risk?Can a combo of “active” therapies help lower dementia risk?Related CoverageWhat to know about the swine flu vaccineMedically reviewed by Alana Biggers, M.D., MPHAre swine flu vaccines safe and effective?

Save this to read later. Send to email 5 Min Read • Updated July 8, 2022 COVID-19 News Language: English Español 中文 While people are accustomed to dealing with runny noses and scratchy throats in the fall and winter, many are experiencing the same symptoms this summer. This could be due to a number of reasons, according to Dr. Judy Tung, section chief of Adult Internal Medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Cold and flu viruses are continuing to circulate — in fact, in late April and early May, New York state saw an unusual spike in influenza — coinciding with summer allergies, not to mention an uptick in COVID-19 cases due to the rise of Omicron subvariants. Dr. Judy Tung “Summer cold symptoms are common and confusing this year not only because of COVID but also because of the late flu peak,” says Dr. Tung. To understand what viruses are circulating now and how to tell the difference between a summer cold, allergies, and COVID-19, Health Matters spoke with Dr. Tung, who is also associate dean for faculty development at Weill Cornell Medicine. Health Matters: The CDC reported an “unusually low” amount of flu activity last year. What have you seen this year with the flu and colds? We started to see a resurgence of flu at the end of 2021, and then a big drop in cases at the beginning of 2022, during the initial Omicron surge. But with the relaxation of masking and distancing this spring, influenza experienced a late peak. As for colds, this summer I’ve seen a lot more GI symptoms that accompany colds — vomiting and diarrhea in addition to fever, congestion and cough. This probably speaks to a dominance of enterovirus, a common summer cold virus that can produce more GI symptoms or pink eye symptoms than rhinovirus, which is more dominant in the winter. This can be confusing, because COVID also causes GI symptoms. Why are we usually able to avoid bad colds in the summer? Why are colds lasting longer? One theory for why colds are lasting longer is that the immune system got a little forgetful, not having been exposed to the most current viral strains, and therefore is less prepared to fight them off. The immune system builds antibodies and other memory white blood cells to fight off pathogens after being exposed to them. When our immune systems are exposed to cold viruses all year long, they are “on the ready.” That didn’t happen last year because of all the precautions people took to protect themselves against COVID. “It is important to get tested for COVID if you have cold symptoms — not because you are going to get gravely ill, but because you may inadvertently pass it along to someone who could get gravely ill.” — Dr. Judy Tung What are the biggest differences in symptoms between common colds, allergies, and COVID-19? COVID is associated with loss of smell and taste, or unusual tastes that are not common in uncomplicated colds. Sinus infections can do this, but regular colds typically don’t affect smell or taste to the degree we see in COVID-19. Allergies can really feel like a cold, down to the body aches when allergies are severe. Allergies do not produce fever and normally take many days of postnasal dripping to cause a cough, whereas colds and COVID can move to coughing swiftly. What’s the best way to care for summer colds? There is little difference in the way we care for summer and winter colds — drink fluids and get plenty of rest. One advantage of summer is that you can open windows to ensure that shared space is well ventilated, especially if there is a member in the household who is sick. With the rise of the Omicron subvariants, what is important to keep in mind when you come down with what seems to be an ordinary cold or allergy symptoms? It is important to get tested for COVID if you have cold symptoms — not because you are going to get gravely ill, but because you may inadvertently pass it along to someone who could get gravely ill. Vaccination and boosting definitely protect people from severe COVID infection, preventing hospitalization and death. However, Omicron is highly infectious, and there is increasing evidence that while the vaccines are still proving to protect us against severe COVID, they are not as effective against stopping us from getting infected or reinfected. Furthermore, there is some recent evidence that while Omicron is definitely milder than Delta, it is more contagious and may linger for longer, so I encourage people to stay masked for 10 to 14 days and to use home antigen tests and look for a negative test to guide them on when they can relax with masking again.

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 4-Jul-2022 Researchers propose a new live-attenuated influenza A vaccine approach Peer-Reviewed Publication Chinese Academy of Sciences Headquarters image: Schematic illustration of the generation of PROTAC viruses (VP, viral protein; Ub, ubiquitin) view more Credit: SI Longlong A promising strategy to reduce the impact of viral infectious diseases, such as influenza, is the use of attenuated, live viruses as vaccines. However, the usefulness of traditional live-attenuated virus vaccines has often been limited by suboptimal immunogenicity, safety concerns, or cumbersome manufacturing processes and techniques. In addition, immune escape due to rapid viral evolution poses a further challenge for traditional influenza vaccines. Recently, a research team led by Prof. SI Longlong from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has proposed a new live-attenuated influenza vaccine approach — generating proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) influenza A virus as a live-attenuated vaccine by utilizing the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome system of host cells to degrade viral proteins. The results were published in Nature Biotechnology on July 4. Given that virus replication depends on virally encoded proteins, manipulation of viral protein stability by utilizing the protein degradation machinery of the host cell may represent a potential approach to switch the viral life cycle on and off for vaccine development. Thus, the researchers designed proteolysis-targeting chimeric (PROTAC) viruses by fusing a conditionally removable proteasome-targeting domain (PTD) to influenza viral proteins. The PTD was designed to contain a proteasome-targeting peptide and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site (TEVcs) linker. It was used to selectively induce proteasomal degradation of viral proteins of interest; however, the TEVcs linker could be selectively cleaved by the tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) to separate the viral proteins from the PTD, thus sparing them from degradation. Accordingly, the researchers engineered the genome of influenza A viruses in TEVp-expressing stable cell lines engineered for virus production to introduce the conditionally removable PTD, generating fully infective PROTAC viruses that were live-attenuated by the host protein degradation machinery upon infection. In mouse and ferret models, PROTAC viruses were sufficiently attenuated but able to elicit robust and broad humoral, mucosal, and cellular immunity. As a result, they provided broad protection against homologous and heterologous virus challenges. "This PROTAC vaccine technology could also be useful for generating live-attenuated vaccines against other types of pathogens," said Prof. SI.

An usual number of seals have been getting stranded and dying off Maine this summer, and avian influenza is to blame, the federal government said Tuesday July 5, 2022. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) By PATRICK WHITTLE Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — An unusual number of seals are becoming stranded and dying off Maine this summer, and avian influenza is to blame, the federal government said Tuesday.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed that samples from four Maine seals tested positive for the virus. The animals all died or required euthanasia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.Marine mammal rescuers started to notice an unusually high number of seal strandings in June, and then the USDA conducted the tests, NOAA said in a statement. The rate of dead seal strandings in Maine is about three times the normal rate for the summer and is close to 60, the agency said.The USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state animal and public health officials about the deaths, which came after a bird flu outbreak that led to the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on farms. The virus is capable of jumping to mammals, though it rarely affects humans. It’s not the first instance of bird flu jumping to marine mammals such as seals, but the federal government is monitoring the deaths closely nonetheless, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson. “There is a national outbreak of avian flu happening, so that was the cause of concern for these animals,” Ferreira said.Most of the seals that have been founded stranded in Maine this summer have been dead, NOAA said. The dead seals have included gray seals and harbor seals. The health risk “posed by avian flu to the general public is low; however, precautions are recommended,” NOAA’s statement said. The agency said people and pets should never approach seals, and should contact authorities if they find an animal they believe is stranded.Elsewhere in New England, hundreds of birds have washed up dead on Martha’s Vineyard, and local officials have sounded the alarm about a possible bird flu outbreak. The source of the outbreak among seals is still being investigated.Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue organization, that it has responded to 40 stranded seals since June 1. Katy Green, a spokesperson for the organization, said it is “aware of this evolving situation” and working with NOAA on it.Gray seals and harbor seals are abundant off New England, where they are beloved by wildlife watchers and sometimes bemoaned by fishermen. However, the bird flu deaths don’t represent the first time they’ve died off at an alarming rate.NOAA declared an “unusual mortality event” for the seals after more than 2,700 of them stranded off Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts from July 2018 to March 2020. Feds attributed those deaths to phocine distemper virus. That virus does not impact humans. PATRICK WHITTLE Whittle is an Associated Press reporter based in Portland, Maine.

Approved vaccines include Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent.The approval follows the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) preferential recommendation for adults 65 years of age and older including Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and Flublok Quadrivalent.“ACIP’s recommendation is a first step to help improve protection against flu and its complications for this 65 years and older high-risk population,” Michael Greenberg, MD, MPH, North America Medial head of Vaccines at Sanofi, said in a statement. “Not every flu vaccine is created equal and we are pleased with ACIP’s acknowledgement that Fluzone high-Dose Quadrivalent & Flublok Quadrivalent have demonstrated improved protection from flu and its related complications through randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence.”The licensure approval allows Sanofi to begin shipping their vaccines to be administered to the vulnerable 65 years of age and older population based on their needs as recommended by the ACIP.The Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent were submitted to the FDA for approval to include new flu strains for the upcoming 2022-2023 flu season. These new flu strains are identified based on FDA, WHO, and CDC predictions for influenza strains likely to cause the most illness in the upcoming flu season.Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent, and Fluzone Quadrivalent are indicated for immunization against disease caused by influenza A and B strains contained in the vaccine. Fluzone Quadrivalent is administered to people 6 months of age and older, whereas Flublok Quadrivalent is administered to those 18 years of age and older.Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only recombinant influenza vaccine for adults 18 years of age or older proven to be 30% more effective than a standard dose vaccine at preventing flu infection in more than 9000 adults 50 years of age or older, according to a clinical study. The most common adverse effects (AEs) experienced by adults 50 years of age or older were tenderness and/or pain at injection site, headache, and tiredness.Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is administered to people 65 years of age and older and provides protection against 4 flu strains. It is the only influenza vaccine licensed for use in adults 65 years of age or older to have demonstrated superior efficacy in a randomized controlled trial versus a standard dose influenza vaccine for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness, according to Sanofi.Additionally, Sanofi asserts that Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is the only influenza vaccine with 10 years of data demonstrating protection from flu and its related complications.“Of note, ACIP recognized that Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent had the most data available, including evidence favoring its use over standard dose for all the benefit outcomes within the GRADE analysis; influenza illnesses, outpatient/ER visits, hospitalizations, and deaths,” Greenberg said. “Nevertheless, we believe even more can be done to provide healthcare providers with clearer guidance.”In a meta-analysis of 15 published reports that included approximately 34 million people, those who received Fluzone High-Dose experienced an 18% reduction in cardiorespiratory hospitalizations and a 28% decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations. Both reductions are above what the standard dose vaccines provided.Fluzone High-Dose is manufactured according to the same process as and with an overlapping composition with the trivalent formulation, which Sanofi states was clinically proven to be 24.2% more effective at preventing flu than the standard-dose Fluzone vaccine in adults 65 years of age and older.However, AEs were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose compared to a standard dose vaccine, according to Sanofi.In a press release, Sanofi suggests that ACIP's recommendation will help reduce the risk of influenza cases and severe flu-related complications in this population with the highest risk.“As a leader in flu vaccination, we remain committed to ensure adults 65 years and older have access to flu vaccines, proven to protect them from what really matters, such as flu-related hospitalizations due to cardiovascular events and pneumonia,” Greenberg said.ReferenceSanofi flu vaccines licensed and approved for 2022-2023 influenza season, including CDC preferred higher-dose vaccines for adults 65+ [press release].

(Photo by Terry Pierson, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) By Allyson Escobar | aescobar@scng.comUPDATED: July 7, 2022 at 8:07 AM PSTNearly 20 burros, or wild donkeys, that roam the foothills and canyons between Colton and Moreno Valley have died in recent weeks as an illness spreads among herds.The culprit, experts said, is a viral equine influenza that started spreading among one or two herds in mid-June. Mostly young burros began showing signs of the infection, Inland Empire horse veterinarians and animal rescue officials said. Some donkeys were unvaccinated and died before they could receive care.“The (equine) influenza is spread through air droplets, water, nose-to-nose respiration,” and can be prevented by vaccines, said Chad Cheatham, vice president of the non-profit rescue center DonkeyLand. in the Reche Canyon area.Seventeen deaths have been reported in the area so far — most of them, 12, in the Moreno Valley area. But a doctor said the sickness cannot be spread to humans or other kinds of animals.Burros move Wednesday, July 6, 2022, among the hills.

(Photo by Terry Pierson, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) ExpandDonkeyLand, a volunteer-run sanctuary and rescue center for the animals, has been receiving frequent calls about sick or dying burros in Reche Canyon, between Colton and Moreno Valley, and the surrounding areas.The wild donkeys are seen in natural areas including Reche Canyon and in the foothills along Box Springs Mountain, Pigeon Pass Road, Redlands Boulevard and San Timoteo Canyon Road. In late 2020, more than 40 burros died from an equine influenza in the same area.Last week, two deceased wild burros were sent to a state lab in San Bernardino for testing, a DonkeyLand news release states. The preliminary findings were positive for equine influenza.Brian Cronin, chief of San Bernardino County Animal Care, said by email that the illness is occurring primarily in Riverside County and Moreno Valley. Representatives from Riverside County Animal Services, which rehabilitates the animals, could not be reached Wednesday, July 6. In San Bernardino County, burros have been identified in the Reche Canyon, San Timoteo Canyon and mountain communities and Parker Dam areas. Aside from illness such as the infection, they are sometimes injured, hit by cars or found deceased, Cronin said.Moreno Valley Animal Services Director Steve Fries said there have been six reported donkey deaths in the area of Redlands Boulevard and Locust and Juniper avenues in the city. Lab results on two of the donkeys indicate they died from viral pneumonia with a secondary bacterial infection, Fries said.“Wild donkeys are not vaccinated,” Fries said. “These donkeys are also social creatures, and they are often in close proximity to each other and share water resources, leading them to be in close contact with an infected donkey.”Those who work with the donkeys don’t know if the same illness as 2020 is striking the animals, he said. Experts suggest that equine owners vaccinate their animals for equine influenza and consult veterinarians.Dr. Paul Wan, a veterinarian with the SoCal Equine Hospital in Norco and Apple Valley, said symptoms in the burros are visibly noticeable. They include foaming bubbles in the mouth, runny noses or nasal discharge, coughing, heavy-labored breathing and lethargy.“They use their stomach muscles to breathe, and you can see their flanks moving,” said Wan, who helps rehabilitate ailing burros at DonkeyLand. “It’s an aerosolized virus. This time, it’s affecting more of the younger burros, from newborns to 2- or 3-year-olds.”Wan and the DonkeyLand staff set a goal to gather and vaccinate at least 20% of the area’s wild burros — approximately 250 to 300 — that are susceptible to viruses.An equine herpes virus killed or sickened many domestic and show horses earlier this year. The outbreak temporarily shut down equestrian events in counties and cities statewide, including Norco in Riverside County.Wan said the equine influenza infecting the burros is “species specific” — so it cannot be spread to humans or other animal species. Wan believes this current round is “the same strain” as the equine flu seen in 2020.“I don’t think it’s mutated or anything. It’s just, unfortunately, we’re dealing with naive animals. They don’t have any immunity and they’re just susceptible,” Wan said. “It’s like if you’ve never been exposed to the flu, and then all of a sudden you’re exposed, and you’re probably gonna get it … unfortunately, the ones we vaccinated in 2020 probably don’t have a lot a whole of immunity.”Cheatham said the virus is easily spread among herds, or sometimes through horses — or by the burros drinking any water not found naturally. Residents sometimes leave water outside for wild donkeys they think are dehydrated in the heat.“People put water out and it could be very dangerous if it’s not cleaned or topped off with new water,” said Amber-LeVonne Cheatham, the founder of DonkeyLand. “There may be viruses getting passed, and it can cause fatalities. I know people love and want to save the burros, but it’s just dangerous.”The wild burros are not dehydrated, Amber-LeVonne Cheatham said. They can find natural spring water from the mountains and surrounding foothills, she said.An ordinance in Riverside County bars anyone from feeding wild burros.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Since Australia’s first Omicron wave after borders opened late last year, the pandemic has largely faded from the news and public perception. Gone are the daily briefings with updates on the numbers of cases, hospitalisations and deaths. But this perception doesn’t match reality. While hospitalisation and death rates have been relatively lower than earlier waves – thanks to the vaccination rollout and naturally acquired immunity – 95% of all Australia’s COVID cases have occurred since the New Year. The daily rate of infections continues in the tens of thousands. Almost 3,000 Australians died of COVID in the first quarter of 2022, placing it between coronary heart disease and stroke as a major cause of death. This year we’ve seen both the Omicron wave and the re-emergence of influenza. After almost disappearing for two years of the pandemic, the lifting of most restrictions (such as social distancing and working from home), the decline in mask use and opening of international borders has allowed influenza to re-emerge. So, how do COVID and seasonal influenza compare? How deadly are COVID and influenza? The case fatality rate – the proportion of COVID cases who die – has improved dramatically over the pandemic. In the 2020 Victorian June-October wave, around 3% of cases died. In the 2021 Delta waves in New South Wales and Victoria, the death rate was under 1%. For the Omicron wave this year – by which time most of the population were vaccinated – the case fatality rate has approached 0.1%. This is comparable to the seasonal influenza case fatality rate seen in “normal” flu years. This drop in COVID case fatality rate has several causes: our high vaccination uptake, immunity from previous infection, better treatments, and Omicron being less deadly. The relative contributions are hard to tease out, but vaccination is likely to have played the most significant role. The importance of COVID vaccination was underscored by a recent report estimating that internationally, vaccines have prevented between 14.4 and 19.8 million deaths. The impact would have been much greater with more equitable global distribution of vaccines. Read more: Respiratory infections like whooping cough and flu have plummeted amid COVID. But 'bounce back' is a worry Which is worse for unvaccinated people? As of January, Omicron caused around one-third the rates of hospitalisation and death as the Delta variant. And for well-vaccinated people, this was comparable to influenza. For unvaccinated people, Omicron was still worse than influenza. But any comparison of COVID variants and influenza is complicated by new sub-variants, waning immunity, and the effects of vaccine booster doses. How well do vaccines protect against COVID variants? Although Omicron is less lethal than Delta, vaccination is also less effective, especially without a third or fourth dose. The table below is compiled from weekly reports from the United Kingdom of vaccine effectiveness, mostly among those over 50 years of age. It shows vaccine effectiveness in preventing cases has declined with the Omicron variant. But the effectiveness in preventing hospitalisations and deaths has remained high, particularly with boosters. It’s important to interpret the apparently lower protective effect of vaccination against hospitalisation and death during the Omicron wave with caution. Some patients in hospital were found incidentally to have a positive test for COVID, which did not contribute to their subsequent death. Vaccination could not have prevented that. Read more: Herd immunity was sold as the path out of the pandemic. Here's why we're not talking about it any more Which is more transmissible – COVID or the flu? COVID has been far more infectious and spreads more rapidly than influenza. The first Omicron variant was estimated to be 100% more transmissible than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, and 37% more transmissible than Delta. Successive Omicron sub-variants have ever higher infectiousness – all far beyond that of influenza. Seasonal influenza has a reproduction number of about 1.3 , compared with 4.2 for Omicron. That means one person with the flu spreads it to 1.3 other people, on average, while one person with Omicron passes it to 4.2 others. That sounds modest but these multiply, so three cycles of flu is 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.3 = 2.2 cases, whereas three cycles of Omicron is 4.2 x 4.2 x 4.2 = 74. As a result, we have had nearly 100-fold more COVID than influenza cases this year, and COVID will likely remain the major cause of hospitalisations and deaths over winter. One illustration of this is data from the United States: in January 2022, more US children died of COVID in a single month than in any of the ten previous years from influenza. What are we likely to see in future? Compared with many countries, Australia has done well in controlling COVID. It has minimised both the impact of illness and the economic burden, through international and state border closures, intermittent lockdowns in some states, and a very successful initial vaccine rollout. But the COVID pandemic is not over, and we will experience further waves of infection with new sub-variants such as Omicron BA.4/5 (now 35% of cases in NSW), which will continue to cause illness, hospitalisation and death. Unfortunately, Australia’s booster uptake has been much slower than the initial vaccination campaign and has almost stalled. This complacency is dangerous. In the past three years we have experienced the pandemic and a series of natural disasters in Australia. Fatigue and a desire to move past COVID is completely understandable but carries substantial risk. During winter, we must redouble our efforts to maintain population immunity through vaccine boosters combined with reasonable protective measures. Make sure your COVID and influenza vaccines are up-to-date, avoid crowded places (or wear a mask if you can’t), and avoid others if you have any respiratory symptoms.

The animals all died or required euthanasia, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.Marine mammal rescuers started to notice an unusually high number of seal strandings in June, and then the USDA conducted the tests, NOAA said in a statement. The rate of dead seal strandings in Maine is about three times the normal rate for the summer and is close to 60, the agency said.Kennebunkport issued a notice to residents this week about the elevated number of seals stranding on their shores over the past few weeks. "Please, do not approach any animals on the beach as it might be hazardous to your health," the notice stated. "The town is working to address the issue with guidance from state and federal officials, and we will provide more updates soon." The USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state animal and public health officials about the deaths, which came after a bird flu outbreak that led to the deaths of tens of millions of chickens and turkeys on farms. The virus is capable of jumping to mammals, though it rarely affects humans.It's not the first instance of bird flu jumping to marine mammals such as seals, but the federal government is monitoring the deaths closely nonetheless, said Allison Ferreira, a NOAA spokesperson."There is a national outbreak of avian flu happening, so that was the cause of concern for these animals," Ferreira said.Bisnow CEO dies: ‘One Tree Hill’ star Bevin Prince's husband fatally struck by lightningGeorgia Guidestones: GBI: Monument 'completely demolished' after explosion left Guidestones damagedMost of the seals that have been founded stranded in Maine this summer have been dead, NOAA said. The dead seals have included gray seals and harbor seals.The health risk "posed by avian flu to the general public is low; however, precautions are recommended," NOAA's statement said. The agency said people and pets should never approach seals, and should contact authorities if they find an animal they believe is stranded.Elsewhere in New England, hundreds of birds have washed up dead on Martha's Vineyard and Maine beaches, and local officials have sounded the alarm about a possible bird flu outbreak.The source of the outbreak among seals is still being investigated.Marine Mammals of Maine, a rescue organization, that it has responded to 40 stranded seals since June 1. Katy Green, a spokesperson for the organization, said it is "aware of this evolving situation" and working with NOAA on it.Gray seals and harbor seals are abundant off New England, where they are beloved by wildlife watchers and sometimes bemoaned by fishermen. However, the bird flu deaths don't represent the first time they've died off at an alarming rate.NOAA declared an "unusual mortality event" for the seals after more than 2,700 of them stranded off Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts from July 2018 to March 2020. Feds attributed those deaths to the phocine distemper virus. That virus does not impact humans.

Wildlife experts with the province say out of 22 nests they are actively monitoring, only five had chicks in them. (Alain-Pierre Hovasse/Hancock Foundation)Social SharingHighly contagious avian flu could be affecting more than just agriculture birds as wildlife experts in the province say they are starting to see concerning conditions for bald eagles and other wild birds in the southwestern part of B.C.Caeley Thacker, a wildlife veterinarian with the B.C. Ministry of Forests, says an inter-agency effort is being made with Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Ministry of Agriculture to closely monitor the current bald eagle population and nests."They have 22 active nests that they're monitoring, and at this time, only five are still active," Thacker said on the CBC's The Early Edition on Monday. "The report from last year was about half of the nests monitored were active, so it's lower this year."She said the province has started to closely monitor bald eagles and collect data to find out what is causing the low nest success and why only a handful of nests had chicks.Jim Springer shared this photo of a bald eagle taken in southwest Calgary's Carburn Park in the spring of 2021. Thacker says avian influenza is contributing to bird deaths but they will need to gather more information on what is happening with their food source to determine the cause. (Jim Springer)Thacker said some birds have tested positive for avian flu, but that doesn't seem to be the only factor contributing to the dramatic drop in young eagles in the southwestern part of the province, as well as the spike in the reporting of dead birds."Other factors could be the weather. We are having a particularly cold and wet spring, but we [also] need to look further into what is happening with the food source. We don't know exactly yet what is happening."She said predator species like eagles and other raptors are especially susceptible to avian influenza as they could consume a carcass or a live infected bird."As of last week, we tested about 40 eagles, and we've had 10 positives for that highly pathogenic avian influenza strain."As the spring migration continues, she said jurisdictions in the north are also seeing more birds infected with avian flu.Euthanized bald eagle in Yukon to be tested for avian fluTwo wild birds test positive for avian flu in a first for the YukonThe province said in a written statement it has collected 47 dead eagles since February, 12 of which had tested positive for avian influenza.Cases among waterfowlEagles often prey on waterfowl, such as ducks and geese.Jackie McQuillan, the support centre lead with the Wildlife Rescue Association of B.C., says 45 suspected cases of avian flu have been identified in waterfowl taken to their treatment facility in the Lower Mainland. Testing has not yet confirmed whether it's the highly contagious form that's been circulating in B.C.She said they're seeing strong neurological symptoms such as convulsing, as well as twisted necks and swollen heads in birds that they believe have the virus. Although avian influenza can be hard to spot, Thacker said bird watchers should also look out for swollen eyes or heads and lethargic behaviour.McQuillan said if an eagle saw a bird that wasn't in great shape, unable to evade its predator, it's likely the eagle would eat an infected bird.Mill Lake a 'complete disaster'Elizabeth Melnick, the founder of Elizabeth's Wildlife Centre in Abbotsford, says the number of calls and reports of Canada geese and goslings showing symptoms of avian flu in Mill Lake started to skyrocket at the end of May and into June.She said things have slowed down in the last two weeks, but she's never seen the virus affect so many wild birds.Avian flu outbreaks confirmed on more B.C. farms after brief pause in new casesThe Fraser Valley has 80% of B.C.'s poultry farms.

"It was predominately Mill Lake."The lake near the Trans-Canada Highway in Abbotsford is a popular community area, Melnick said, with a nature trail around the water, a picnic and play area for families, and an outdoor swimming pool. She said the centre was receiving reports of dead geese up to four times a day in June.Canada geese at Trout Lake in Vancouver on March 19, 2020.

We had so many calls of dead and dying Canada geese. We've got babies and frequent feeders in that area, and the phones never stopped," Melnick said.She said the centre also received two ducks from Aldergrove that tested positive for avian flu and one great blue heron from Chilliwack."It's always the same symptoms. The head shaking, the stargazing, it's all neurological. The goslings had snowy white eyes as well, and they were also lethargic."Keeping infection out of the environmentWhile outbreaks are easier to maintain in an agricultural setting, not much can be done for wild birds, says Thacker, so the best thing we can do is prevent the environment from becoming infected."The best thing we can do is remove carcasses from the landscape and prevent birds from congregating as much as possible," she said.She said there has been a decline in eagles on the West Coast since last year.Wildlife rescue on Vancouver Island to limit visitors as avian flu continues to spread in B.C."We need to figure out what is causing that and what we can do about it, if anything."ABOUT THE AUTHORChristina (Hwa Song) JungReporterChristina Jung is a digital reporter for CBC.

(KABC) -- In the heart of the Inland Empire, 2,000 acres of land have been set aside as a donkey sanctuary.A safe place for wild burros to wander freely without traffic or trains.It's a project DonkeyLand's founder Amber Cheatham has been working on for a decade."We are about 90% done with the fencing for the sanctuary and then all of the donkeys we have in our care that were either orphaned or sick and injured that have been rehabilitated will be released here at the sanctuary," said Vice President of DonkeyLand Chad Cheatham.It's a work in progress that is taking on a greater sense of urgency.Since June, several herds have come down with equine influenza, a virus that has proved to be fatal."When they are really sick, they will sit or lay down more. You'll actually see them down more," said Dr. Paul Wan of SoCal Equine Hospital in Norco.Two years ago, a similar illness claimed the lives of several donkeys, but this time around, Cheatham says the illness is acting different."Now, they're exhibiting symptoms where they may be lying under a tree not standing and we go to assist them. Once they stand up, then they just die," he said.To combat the virus, Wan and volunteers at DonkeyLand are teaming up to vaccinate the burro population in hopes it will slow the spread. But they're also urging residents in the area not to leave standing water out for the burros."What can happen if they gather at a watering hole and with the nasal discharge, they are shedding the virus," said Wan. "The virus gets in the water and so they can consume it that way."The virus, while transmitted through droplets from a sneeze or cough, is not infectious to humans.Cheatham said if the someone sees or finds a sick burro, call DonkeyLand or animal control to receive help.Soon, DonkeyLand hopes the sanctuary will be where donkeys will not only find a safe place, but also a natural source of drinking water from several springs and wells on the property.If you'd like to donate to help DonkeyLand vaccinate and care for the donkeys, visit their website.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

According to a whistleblower who spoke with the newspaper Ontario Farmer, the egg-laying hens were killed last April by being sprayed with suffocating nitrogen foam at two separate egg farms in North Lancaster, Ontario. Avian influenza has been spreading across Canada, infecting birds confined in egg, chicken, duck, and turkey farms. Over two million birds have been exterminated by farms and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in efforts to control the outbreak. Despite these mass killings, neither farmers nor the CFIA have shared information publicly about how these birds are being killed—leaving compassionate Canadians in the dark about their suffering. The whistleblower who spoke with Ontario Farmer was closely involved with the CFIA operation at the egg farms over a period of six weeks. Shockingly, the killings appear to have been botched from the start. Many hens did not die after CFIA employees initially walked through the barns and sprayed them with suffocating nitrogen foam. Days later, live birds were found who had survived by burrowing under piles of dead hens, or who had only been partially sprayed with nitrogen the first time. CFIA employees continued to find live birds on their second, third, and fourth walk-throughs of the barns, several days after the initial extermination attempt—leaving live birds to suffer amongst their dead companions for days. Image: Jo-Anne McArthur / We Animals Media Like most farming practices, mass culls happen behind closed doors, away from public view. The cruel methods that are typically used to kill entire barns full of animals are considered legal in Canada, falling under the animal welfare law exemption for “standard farming practices”. Animal Justice has filed a legal complaint with the CFIA, and Ontario’s Animal Welfare Services, asking them to investigate whether any laws were violated when birds were left to suffer in the barns for days. Nitrogen foam is one way that egg farms perform mass exterminations of birds who are either sick or are no longer profitable because their bodies have given out after years of egg production. Other methods accepted by the industry include poisoning birds with carbon dioxide gas; and ventilation shutdown, where air circulation is shut off and birds are left to overheat and suffocate over the course of many hours. Ventilation shutdown is common in the United States, although it is not clear how common it is in Canada. Factory farms have created the ideal breeding grounds for deadly pathogens like avian flu, and birds pay the ultimate price when authorities order mass culls. Please consider removing your support for the industry by leaving chicken, eggs, and other animal products off of your plate.

Reporting of wild birds was introduced in April this year.The HPAI strain is behind the largest ever outbreak of the disease on these islands, which began in November 2021.It led to the culling of hundreds of thousands of birds across the UK, when cases were detected in commercial poultry flocks. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said there had been no confirmed cases of bird flu at its West Light Seabird Centre on Rathlin Island. A spokesperson said staff and volunteers were "following strict protocols and will continue to be vigilant for dead or sick birds, reporting this to DAERA (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) as required". A team of scientists across the UK is examining why this season's outbreak has been so fatal, and what measures are needed "to prevent future spill-overs of influenza with pandemic potential into humans".

A DAERA spokesperson said: "There have been no further cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in poultry in Northern Ireland since early February 2022. "Since the wild bird survey recommenced in April, two submissions have tested positive for HPAI H5N1. "We are also aware of an increase in mortality of seabirds on Rathlin Island. "Testing is currently being carried out to determine if HPAI has been the cause."Flock keepers, from poultry farmers to backyard hobbyists, have been advised to maintain strict biosecurity standards. Meanwhile, parts of England, Scotland and Wales are still feeling the brunt of the outbreak in their wild bird populations.

Now, there's no criteria for the higher dose vaccine other than age, the province says. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty)Social SharingAll Manitobans age 65 and older are eligible for a high-dose flu vaccine this fall to protect them from severe illness.The province currently offers the higher dose vaccine to people 65 and older who meet specific eligibility requirements, including those who live in long-term care facilities or assisted living housing, but this fall, the province will drop those requirements.This change will bring Manitoba in line with recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization to use the high-dose influenza vaccine for adults 65 and older when available, the province said in a news release on Wednesday.Chief Provincial Public Health Officer Dr. Brent Roussin said in the release there is good evidence to show the high-dose vaccine provides better protection for older adults compared to the standard dose of the flu vaccine.The higher dose will improve outcomes for people in that age group and reduce illness, hospitalization and post-influenza death, he added.Temporary emergency department closures in southwestern Manitoba not surprising: officialsCOVID-19 restrictions might be gone this summer, but the virus isn't, Manitoba expert warnsThe province is working with health-care providers, pharmacists and others who administer the vaccine to have it ready for the campaign, which normally starts in October.Both kinds of flu vaccines, the standard and high-dose, will be available to Manitobans then at no cost. The province will spend about $3.6 million to expand the eligibility.More information about the launch of the seasonal flu campaign will be available in the coming months.Last year, about 400,000 doses of flu vaccine were given to people in Manitoba, meaning about 29 per cent of the eligible population got vaccinated.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

They were discovered at the island's main harbour, Church Bay, earlier this week and removed for testing.The RSPB says there are now suspected cases at the colony near its West Light Seabird Centre on the island.Bird flu has also been confirmed at two other locations since the start of June.There have been positive test results on birds found at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, and in Bangor, County Down. Gemma Daly, a veterinary officer with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera), said there were 50 dead guillemots reported on Rathlin, which is where the positive test samples came from.She said the positive case in Bangor was from a gannet at the beginning of June, with a goose and mallard testing positive around Lough Erne.Remain openThere will be no further testing of birds on Rathlin now that bird flu has been confirmed there. "Although suspected, there are currently no confirmed cases at the West Light Seabird Centre, and the site will continue to remain open and we look forward to continuing to welcome visitors, " the RSPB NI said in a Facebook post, external.The organisation said the detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 there was not unexpected, as the disease has already been found in wild birds across the UK and Ireland. "2021/22 has been the worst ever outbreak of HPAI in the UK and has not only affected a large number of birds but is ongoing over a long time period."RSPB staff and volunteers across our entire reserves network and on Rathlin Island have been following strict protocols and will continue to be vigilant for dead or sick birds, reporting these to Daera as required." Although the avian influenza protection zone for Northern Ireland was lifted at the start of June 2022, flock owners have been advised to continue with enhanced biosecurity measures while the disease is still circulating in wild bird populations. Significant mortalities have been reported in Great Britain. This outbreak of HPAI H5N1 bird flu has been described as the largest in these islands, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled in commercial and backyard hobby flocks.Daera says the public should not handle dead or sick birds. Any dead birds should be reported to the helpline number 0300 200 7840, although the department says not all reported fatalities will be collected for surveillance. Landowners are required to dispose of any dead birds where they are not collected. The department says it has taken proactive measures to improve biosecurity at seabird breeding colonies, and the situation is being monitored.

Deposit RM100 and get a RM10 bonus with the code VERSAMM10 By Ben Tan Friday, 08 Jul 2022 11:38 AM MYT KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 — The current shortage of medicine at pharmacies in the country, especially for over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, has worsened in recent weeks partly due to the latest spike in not only Covid-19 infections but also outbreaks in influenza and hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD).Citing several pharmacists and private clinics around the country, The Star reported that many OTC medicine such as paracetamol, cough syrups and lozenges for sore throat have been in low supply since last month.With children’s cough syrup and Panadol Syrup for kids also out of stock, The Star reported that some parents have resorted to dissolve paracetamol tablets for their sick children."The supply of Panadol Extend was also cut off for a while and we only just received stocks last week," an unnamed pharmacist told the daily, adding that the supply of all types of Panadol was so low that stocks would normally run out in just two days.Another unnamed doctor also told the newspaper that the shortage of medicine could lead to a health crisis."Most pharmacies and clinics are out of stock on medications such as Clarinase for flu and blocked nose, and Betadine for sore throat."We also recently received a memo from our supplier saying that flu jabs will only be available in 2024,” the anonymous doctor was quoted saying.Federation of Private Medical Practitioners Associations Malaysia president Dr Steven Chow told The Star that the supply of common medicine is getting worse and unlikely to be resolved soon.According to Dr Chow, many clinics are now short of basic cough and cold syrups due to the series of outbreaks like HFMD, influenza and surges in Covid-19 cases."This includes multiple prescription medications such as antibiotics, prednisolone, antivirals, OTC medications for fever, flu, cough and cold, and paediatric medicines like syrups — they are currently out of stock in general practitioner clinics."In the meantime, if we are faced with an unexpected disease outbreak, it will trigger a crisis,” he was quoted saying, adding that mouth ulcer sprays are also running short due to the current surge of HFMD cases.Malaysian Pharmacists Society president Amrahi Buang said medicine in the country has been in short supply since the Covid-19 pandemic began two years ago.He added that the war between Ukraine and Russia have also affected shipment of medicine to Malaysia."The fluctuation of Covid-19 cases will affect medicine supply because it involves global trade."Even if we want to manufacture our own medicine, we still have to import the ingredients or packing materials, so no one can solve this — we need to accept [that there is a shortage of medicine]."All this is happening — we have food security and now we have medicine security issue."But it is something that everyone is aware of and the Health Ministry is taking action because we anticipated this two years ago,” Amrahi was quoted saying.He also advised the public to refrain from hoarding common drugs, which could worsen the shortage further."Avoid hoarding medicine and make use of alternative treatments such as honey and lemon (for sore throat)."For me, it is best if we improve our health literacy and at the same time take care of our health — go for preventive care,” he was quoted saying.On June 21, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the current medicine shortage mostly involves medication for common illnesses like cough, cold and fever and antibiotics for children.However, he expects the situation to stabilise this month.

People were observed walking dogs at the site where over a dozen carcasses of birds currently lie scattered about. Picture: DGSThe short stretch of pebble beach next to Lybster Harbour should be approached with caution due to the amount of apparent bird flu casualties on it.This is the advice from retired Thurso vet Sinclair Manson who told the Caithness Courier about the severity of the problem in the county and further afield.A recently deceased gannet washed in at Lybster. Picture: DGS"There's a notice at Thurso beach as well telling people to stay away from the carcases of birds," said Mr Manson."People should stay well clear from them. It's probably bird flu that's killing a lot of these birds as it's rife at the moment. A lot of these epidemics run their course and a percentage will die...perhaps 30, 40 or even 50 per cent maybe but they will recover from it, there's no doubt about that."A young black backed gull dead at Lybster harbour. Picture: DGSA seal carcass was also on the beach. The association of avian viruses with influenza outbreaks in seals suggests that 'transmission of avian viruses to seals' is occurring in nature, said one study. Picture: DGSMr Manson said the avian flu epidemic is "devastating at the moment" and the public will undoubtedly feel concerned when walking beaches and coming across so many dead birds. "They should keep well away from them and keep their dogs away too. When we deal with them [dead birds] we wear PPE to make sure we don't pick it [bird flu] up ourselves."He said that the main risks of avian flu transmission to humans comes from people who have had close contact with domestic birds. "Like in Southeast Asia where people have chickens living in their houses," he added.Close contact between birds, with the breeding season underway, is causing the virus to spread even more, he says. "There's nothing we can really do about it. Gulls, gannets and auks are in close confines as they're congregating to breed and that's why there's so many of those. Birds which generally nest by themselves are much less at risk." Commenting about bird flu epidemics in the past Mr Manson said that the strains were different 20 or 30 years ago but the current strain is "particularly virulent" and has probably come in through migratory birds. "Migratory geese and wildfowl will probably be carrying it. There were over 80 dead geese found at Scrabster recently and then scavenging birds come in to feed on them so it just perpetuates [the virus]."This guillemot has had its innards apparently pecked out by a scavenging bird thus spreading any disease it may have had. Picture: DGSDuring the recent visit by the Courier to Lybster harbour there was no warning notice sited by the beach mentioning the epidemic and members of the public were seen exercising dogs close to the carcases. One man was also observed taking notes of the various casualties on the pebble beach. Retired Dounreay scientist Robin Sellers is well-known within the birding community and counted, among various others, a gannet, a great black backed gull, a kittiwake, a herring gull and four guillemots – one of which was a newly fledged chick.Another dead guillemot. There was a large percentage of this particular species on the beach. Picture: DGS"I don't think I've ever seen so many in such a short space," said Mr Sellers. "I live in Cumbria and we had a 'wreck of seabirds' in 2014 but this is a higher density of birds. We shouldn't really be on the beach as avian influenza is apparently easily spread."Mr Sellers had undertaken a survey of herring gulls further north along the Caithness coast at Sarclet earlier in the day but did not notice any major drop in numbers. The Scottish Government's rural affairs department which confirmed that this past winter saw the "largest outbreak of avian flu in the UK to date". The outbreak has affected the wild bird population as well as commercial flocks, it added.Related article: Suspected avian flu outbreak – carnage on Dunnet beach as over 100 dead seabirds counted Numerous seabird carcases have been reported on beaches throughout the county, with Dunnet being particularly affected, and several recently deceased gannets found on Reiss beach at the weekend.Several dead gannets were also found on Reiss beach at the weekend. Picture: Alan HendryWick and East Caithness councillor Willie Mackay said: “Avian influenza is a notifiable animal disease and must be reported to Defra if suspect poultry and captive birds show signs."It is very worrying the amount of wild birds found recently on our beaches and caution should prevail if finding visibly sick or dead birds. As far as I am aware there are no poultry entries allowed for this year's Latheron Show and County Show owing to the recent spread of this worrying bird flu.”Councillor Andrew Jarvie from the same ward said: "This is a very sad sight to see and is a timely reminder that even up here we need to be aware how far and quickly this virus can travel. One of the biggest outbreaks occurred in Orkney just last month."I can only hope the spread can be halted as soon as possible to stop the needless deaths of so much wildlife. Dead birds can still transmit the virus to other birds, particularly birds of prey. So if you see a dead bird, it's essential you report it to Defra by its helpline on 03459 335 577 to help halt the spread."Several dead gannets were also found on Reiss beach at the weekend. Picture: Alan HendryA government spokesperson told the paper: “While maintaining high levels of biosecurity among domestic flocks helps protect against disease, addressing the disease among wild birds poses significant challenges. Avian influenza is a disease that affects the wild bird population globally. “The Scottish Government is taking the situation very seriously and is working hard with partner organisations to progress measures to respond to the reports of increased mortality among wild bird populations and help them become more resilient.”A Highland Council spokesperson said: “Follow @ScotGovRural for the latest Avian Influenza update from the Scottish Government which states: If you find three dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks), a single dead bird of prey, or five or more dead wild birds of any other species (including gulls) in the same place at the same time, you should report them to Defra’s national GB telephone helpline on 03459 33 55 77.” Do you want to respond to this article?
