As the influenza virus N2 neuraminidase (NA) gene was introduced from avian sources during the 1957 pandemic, we investigate the reactivity of N2 antibodies against A(H9N2) AIVs. Serosurvey of healthy individuals reveal the highest rates of AIV N2 antibodies in individuals aged ≥65 years. Exposure to the 1968 pandemic N2, but not recent N2, protected against A(H9N2) AIV challenge in female mice. In some older adults, infection with contemporary A(H3N2) virus could recall cross-reactive AIV NA antibodies, showing discernable human- or avian-NA type reactivity. Individuals born before 1957 have higher anti-AIV N2 titers compared to those born between 1957 and 1968. The anti-AIV N2 antibodies titers correlate with antibody titers to the 1957 N2, suggesting that exposure to the A(H2N2) virus contribute to this reactivity. These findings underscore the critical role of neuraminidase immunity in zoonotic and pandemic influenza risk assessment.

Sporadic human outbreaks caused by 13 AIV subtypes have led to over 2739 reported cases since 1996. The recent emergence and geographical expansion of novel A(H5Nx) viruses has also raised public health concerns1(https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/influenza-at-the-human-animal-interface-summary-and-assessment)2. Notably, AIV subtypes A(H7N9), A(H5N1) and A(H9N2), responsible for the majority of human infections, exhibit distinct age-dependent incidence of infection and severe disease that have yet to be explained by current knowledge of host, viral or environmental factors. A(H5N1) AIV cases are predominant among individuals ≤15 years old (yo) while A(H7N9) AIV cases are more commonly reported in adults aged ≥60yo2,3. Given the increasing spread of these novel AIV subtypes, understanding factors that shape these age-specific epidemiological patterns can help to elucidate the pandemic risks associated with AIVs.Current pandemic risk assessment frameworks used by the World Health Organization (WHO) rely on measuring neutralizing antibodies or antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that are detected by the hemagglutination inhibition assay, to assess population immunity4. However, recent evidence suggests that antibodies targeting the neuraminidase (NA) protein exhibit broad cross-reactivity5,6,7,8 and play a significant role in reducing disease severity following seasonal influenza virus infections9. Indeed, N2 antibodies elicited by the 1957 A(H2N2) pandemic strain were postulated to have reduced the impact of the 1968 A(H3N2) pandemic10. However, the importance of NA antibodies in the context of AIV infections remain unexplored.A(H9N2) AIVs are amongst the most prevalent subtype in poultry globally and have recently become the predominant circulating strain in poultry in China. This coincided with increases in cases of A(H9N2) human infections, specifically in young children11,12,13. However, seropositivity rates ranging from 1.37% to 11.2% have been observed in occupationally exposed adults in China, suggesting the occurrence of mild or asymptomatic infections in older individuals occupationally exposed to the virus14.A(H9N2) AIVs share the same NA subtype as seasonal A(H3N2) influenza viruses, and the current human N2 evolved from its avian progenitor, introduced to the human population during the 1957 A(H2N2) pandemic. Because the first influenza virus exposure primes immunological memory that can be boosted upon reinfection with an antigenically-related strain later in life15,16,17,18, we hypothesized that cross-reactive N2 antibodies may be present in an age-dependent manner and potentially contribute to the age-specific incidence of A(H9N2) AIVs infections in humans. To investigate this, we conducted age-stratified serosurvey for antibodies against avian N2, with a focus on the A(H9N2) subtype, in cohorts of healthy individuals or individuals infected with seasonal A(H3N2). We further demonstrated the protective capacity of these cross-reactive antibodies in the mice model.ResultsHigh amino acid similarity between historical human seasonal N2 and avian N2To reconstruct the evolutionary history of avian and human N2 genes, we analyzed 103 sequences representing major human A(H2N2) and A(H3N2) variants since their introduction into humans in 1957 (n = 42) and genetically diverse avian N2 strains collected since 1960s (n = 61). Figure 1a shows that human and avian N2 cluster into two distinctive branches, showing independent evolution since 1957. Human N2s evolved in a typical ladder-like pattern, suggestive of an immune driven evolution, much like HA. In contrast, avian N2s showed a more balanced phylogeny, suggesting a lack of selective pressure on the avian N2s. We found that the avian N2 from A(H9N2) AIVs consistently clustered into the same three major HA subclades: (i)Y439, (ii) G1, and (iii) BJ94, with BJ94 further divided into the F98 and G9 sub-lineages.Fig. 1: Evolutionary relationships and genetic similarity of human and avian N2 neuraminidases from 1957 to 2019.a Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with branches colored by host and subtype. Representative strains used for serological testing are labeled, and abbreviations used in this study are shown in bold. b Heatmap of pairwise comparison of amino acid sequence similarities for human and avian N2 strains between 1957 to 2019, generated by using “ComplexHeatmap” package in R. Annotation on the right represents the NA amino acid sequence similarities, representative strains and year of virus isolation. Highly similar sequences between avian and human N2 are boxed.Full size imageAt a protein level, pairwise analysis indicated that human N2s from 1957 to early 1970s showed close to 90% amino acid sequence identity to the avian N2 strains (Fig. 1b, boxed). Human N2s gradually diverged, and viruses in the last 20 years shared only between 75% to 80% similarity with the ancestral avian N2s (Fig. 1b). These data show that until the 1970s, human N2s shared high amino acid sequence similarity with avian N2s.Age -specific seroprevalence and the protective capacity of the cross-reactive N2 antibodiesTo assess the seroprevalence of cross-reactive avian N2 antibodies, we collected residual serum samples from healthy individuals or those admitted for reasons not related to infectious diseases to the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, located in the urban center of Guangzhou (Table 1). We used an age-stratified study design, with 20 individuals per age group, based on the expected immune imprinting profile to influenza virus strains during early life (further described in Methods). For serological testing of AIV N2 antibodies, we selected eight A(H9N2) viruses representing major A(H9N2) clades detected globally (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1). We also selected 11 human A(H3N2) viruses representing major H3 antigenic types circulating from 1968 – 2016 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2)19.Table 1 Summary of human serum samples used in this studyFull size tableHI titers were detectable against seven of the more recent A(H3N2) viruses but were undetectable against A(H9N2) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 3) in our Guangzhou cohort. Stratifying the responses by age group revealed that peak HI and NI titers were detected against virus strains circulating within the decade of birth (Fig. 2b, c, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), consistent with the principles of immunological imprinting. NI titers were higher than HI titers for the corresponding viruses, likely due to differences in assay sensitivity (Fig. 2b, c). However, NI titers against avian N2s were relatively consistent across the eight strains in an age-dependent manner (Fig. 2d). The oldest group, ≥65yo, had the highest titers to all eight strains, while the youngest group, ≤5yo, had undetectable or relatively low NI titers. With the exception of the 6-10yo group, NI titers against all eight N2s increased in an age-dependent manner. Compared to responses in the ≥65yo group, there was also a significant age-dependent decrease in NI titers to early human N2, represented by the pandemic virus A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (AI68) (Fig. 2e). Notably, while the ≥65yo group showed strong positive correlations between NI titers to AI68 and all eight avian N2s (r = 0.70 to 0.89, p < 0.0005), the 40-64yo group showed no or varying degree of correlations (r = 0.15 to 0.71, ns or p < 0.05-0.0005) (Supplementary Table 5). Taken together, NI titers to avian N2s were highest in older age groups and correlated with the AI68 N2 titers.Fig. 2: Cross-reactive and protective potential of human N2 antibodies against subtype A(H9N2) influenza A viruses in Guangzhou cohort samples.a Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titers against representative strains of subtype A(H9N2) AIV and antigenically-distinct human A(H3N2) influenza viruses in human circulation since 1968.

All NI-antibody was detected using enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) using recombinant viruses bearing the target NA with a HA gene from Aeal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1) and the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8). Colored circles above the graph indicate those viruses circulating at the time of birth of the oldest participant in each age group. Dotted lines in (a–e) indicate limits of detection. The bar graphs indicate the geometric mean antibody titer with 95% confidence intervals, with n = 20 individuals per age group. Statistical significance in (d) was calculated using two-sided two-way ANOVA compared to ≥ 65-year-old age group using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (****p < 0.0001 for all age groups). Statistical significance in (d) was calculated using two-sided two-way ANOVA compared to ≥ 65 yo group, adjusted with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (****p < 0.0001 for all age groups). Statistical significance in (e) was calculated using two-sided one-way ANOVA compared ≥ 65 yo group, adjusted with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (****p < 0.0001 for ≤ 5 yo, 6–10 yo, 11–20 yo and 21–39 yo, **p = 0.0057 for 40–64 yo). Weight loss was expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Survival rate in g was compared using two-sided Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test with PBS as the reference group (**p = 0.0024 for 40–64 yo, ***p = 0.0002 for ≥ 65 yo). Each group had n = 10 mice, except for the 6–10 yo group and 21–39 yo group which had 8 mice, and the 40-64 yo group which had 9.Full size imageTo determine whether these cross-reactive N2 antibodies were protective, we passively transferred the pooled, age-stratified sera into BALB/c mice and challenged these mice with A/chicken/Zhejiang/198/2019 (H9N2) (ZJ19). ZJ19, belonging to the BJ94/F98 clade, was pathogenic in mice without prior adaptation and is 99% similar at the nucleotide level to the human isolate of H9N2, A/Suzhou/GIRD01/2019 (SZ19) used in the serological testing. NI titers of the sera pooled from each age group used to inoculate mice were as follows: undetectable (<10) in ≤5yo, 20 in 6-10yo, 10 in 11-20yo, 20 in 21-39yo and 40-64yo, and 160 in ≥65yo. Post challenge, serum from ≥65yo individuals was the most protective, resulting in the least weight loss (Fig. 2f) and significantly better survival rates compared to PBS control mice (Fig. 2g). Although weight loss curves were similar, survival rates were also significantly higher in mice that received sera from the 40-64yo compared to PBS control. No statistically significant differences in the survival rates were observed for the other age groups. These findings suggest that individuals ≥65yo and, to some extent, those ≥40yo had cross-reactive antibodies that were protective against a lethal A(H9N2) AIV challenge.To further exclude the role of HA-binding antibodies in our observation, whether from past H9N2 exposure or any cross-reactive antibodies that may target H9, we measured their H9-binding antibodies against a recombinant H9 protein, A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) by ELISA. Some individuals above the ages of 21 showed H9-binding positivity (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, except for those aged ≥ 65yo compared to the 11-20yo and the ≤ 5yo, there were no statistically significant differences amongst other age groups. Because pooled sera from the 21-39 yo did not protect the mice from the ZJ19 challenge (Fig. 2f, g), this suggests that H9-binding antibodies were not a major determinant in the protective effect observed. Further, even after excluding those participants with anti-H9 binding positivity, all our observed pattern of cross-reactivity in the Guangzhou cohort still holds (Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting that this avian N2 cross-reactivity is not due to previous exposures to H9N2 or cross-reactive H9 antibodies.Antigenic relationship between early human and avian N2To determine if exposure to early human N2s was a determinant of cross-reactivity, we performed a prime-challenge experiment in mice (Fig. 3a). Mice was primed with A/Aichi/2/1968(H3N2) (AI68) wild type virus, and reverse-genetics derived viruses bearing the HA and NA of A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 H3N2) (SG16) or A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) (MI15). AI68 was chosen to represent the early H3N2 virus while SG16 was chosen to represent a contemporary H3N2 virus. MI15 was used as heterologous NA subtype control. Although the priming doses were predetermined to elicit comparable N2 titers between AI68 and SG16, in the eventual experiment, the two priming doses elicited higher homologous HI and NI titers in the AI68-primed mice compared to SG16 (Fig. 3b). The control ZJ19 and rgH1N1 viruses had higher HI but lower NI titers compared to AI68.Fig. 3: Antigenic relationship between AI68 N2 with an avian N2.a Experimental schema of the prime-challenge experiment. Groups of mice were immunized with two-doses of a wild-type (wt) A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (AI68), rg-derived A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 (H3N2) (SG16), rg-A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) (MI15) or wt-A/chicken/Zhejiang/198/2019 (H9N2) (ZJ19) and subsequently challenged with ZJ19. b Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) antibody profiles at Day 42 post-immunization against the priming viruses (n = 11 mice/group). c NI antibody titers of mice in each immunization group and d its associated fold-change against ZJ19 before and after challenge. e NI antibody titers of mice in each immunization group and f its associated fold-change against the priming viruses before and after challenge. n = 5 mice/group, except for MI15 which had n = 4. All NI-antibody was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) using recombinant viruses bearing the target NA with a HA gene from Aeal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1) and the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8). Dotted lines in b, c and e indicate limits of detection. The bar graphs indicate the geometric mean antibody titer with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance in b–c was calculated using two-sided one-way ANOVA with the H3N2-AI68 group as reference, adjusted with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (For b, in HI assay, **p = 0.0026 for rgH3N2-SG16, ****p < 0.0001for rgH1N1-MI15, H9N2-ZJ19; in NI assay, ****p < 0.0001 for rgH3N2-SG16, rgH1N1-MI15, H9N2-ZJ19; for c, in pre-challenge **p = 0.0031 for H9N2-ZJ19, ****p < 0.0001 for rgH3N2-SG16, rgH1N1-MI15 and PBS; in post-challenge *p = 0.0112 for rgH3N2-SG16, *p = 0.0104 for rgH1N1-MI15, *p = 0.0316 for H9N2-ZJ19, *p = 0.0112 for PBS). Statistical significance between paired samples in e was analyzed using two-sided paired t-test (***p = 0.0004 for H3N2-AI68, **p = 0.0086 for H9N2-ZJ19). Figure 3a created with BioRender.com released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.Full size imageWe assessed the baseline cross-reactivity in the pre-challenge immune sera to the NA of ZJ19. Apart from the positive control, AI68 had the highest titers to ZJ19 and was significantly higher compared to SG16 and MI15 (Fig. 3c). Post challenge, AI68- and ZJ19-primed groups showed smaller increases in ZJ19 N2 titers compared to SG16-, MI15- and PBS-primed groups (Fig. 3c, d), likely due to the higher levels of baseline antibody. However, only mice in the AI68 or ZJ19 group showed significant induction of priming N2 antibodies and at least four-fold increases in NI-titers after challenge (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Table 6). All animals were protected, with no significant differences in weight loss amongst groups (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c), except for those in the PBS group. These data indicate that AI68 and ZJ19 shared cross-reactive epitopes and were antigenically closer compared to SG16.AI68 immune sera were protective against ZJ19 challenge in miceTo clearly demonstrate the role of NA and to reduce potential interference from the different HAs, we generated a complementary set of isogenic, reverse-genetics (rg)H6Nx viruses bearing the NA from AI68, SG16, or MI15 in the second prime-challenge experiment (Fig. 4a(i)). After two priming doses, the HI titers were comparable amongst the rgH6Nx viruses but were significantly lower than the H9N2 control (Fig. 4b) whereas the NI titers were comparable for N2 but lower than the rgH6N1 control. As in Fig. 3f, challenge with ZJ19 only boosted antibodies to AI68 and its homologous antigen (Fig. 4c, d). Except for mice in the PBS group, all animals survived the challenge (Supplementary Fig. 3d–f).Fig. 4: Protective capacity of the 1968 A(H3N2) pandemic N2 antibody against subtype A(H9N2) AIV infection.a Experimental schema of (i) prime-challenge and (ii) passive transfer experiment. Groups of mice (for i; n = 11/group, for (ii); n = 14/group for immunization, n = 10/group, except n = 8 for rgH6N2-SG16 group, for challenge) were immunized with two-doses of recombinant H6Nx viruses bearing the NA from A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (AI68), A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 (H3N2) (SG16), or A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) (MI15), or wild-type (wt) A/chicken/Zhejiang/198/2019 (H9N2) (ZJ19).

Dotted lines in (b) and (c) indicate limits of detection. The bar graphs indicate the geometric mean antibody titer with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance in (b) was calculated using two-sided one-way ANOVA using rgH6N2-AI68 group as reference, adjusted with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (in HI assay, ****p < 0.0001 for H9N2-ZJ19; in NI assay, ****p < 0.0001 for rgH6N1-MI15). Statistical significance in (c) was analyzed using two-sided paired t-test (**p = 0.0086 for H9N2-ZJ19, ***p = 0.0006 for rgH6N2-AI68). Weight loss in (e) was expressed as mean ± standard deviation, with statistical difference compared to the PBS group using two-sided, adjusted with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test from days 0 to 7 post-inoculation (days 2 *p = 0.0047 for rgH6N2-AI68; days 3 *p = 0.0106 for H9N2-ZJ19, **p = 0.0026 for rgH6N2-AI68; days 4, *p = 0.0467 for rgH6N2-AI68, ****p < 0.0001 for H9N2-ZJ19; days 5 *p = 0.0411 for rgH6N2-SG16, *p = 0.0239 rgH6N1-MI15, ****p < 0.0001 for H9N2-ZJ19; days 6, ****p < 0.0001 for H9N2-ZJ19; days 7, *p = 0.0213 for rgH6N1-MI15, ****p < 0.0001 for H9N2-ZJ19). Survival rate in (f) was compared to PBS group using two-sided Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test (*p = 0.0128 for rgH6N2-AI68, *p = 0.0411 for rgH6N1-MI15, ***p = 0.0005 for H9N2-ZJ19). Figure 4a created with BioRender.com released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.Full size imageTo demonstrate that the antibodies elicited by the AI68 N2 were protective against ZJ19 challenge, we immunized another set of mice and conducted passive transfer of the immune sera into naïve mice prior to challenge (Fig. 4a(ii)). Mice that received SG16 and MI15 immune sera lost significantly more weight than mice receiving AI68 N2-primed sera at one to seven days post-inoculation (Fig. 4e). After day eight, surviving mice recovered their weight and were mostly indistinguishable from mice immunized with ZJ19. Despite some early weight loss, 70% of mice that received sera from AI68-primed mice survived compared to 0- 25% survival rate in the other groups (Fig. 4f). These data indicate that N2 antibodies generated by AI68 priming were protective against lethal A(H9N2) AIV infection compared to contemporary human N2.Cross-reactivity to other NA subtypes in older adultsWe asked if these antibody responses could be recalled after seasonal influenza virus infection, and if the antibody cross-reactivity observed was limited to N2 subtypes. We used a subset of human serum samples collected from the China Ageing REspiratory infections Study (CARES), a community-based longitudinal surveillance study on respiratory viral infections in 1532 older adults, conducted between 2015-2017 in Suzhou and Yancheng, Jiangsu province, China20. Paired baseline and post-infection serum samples from 43 PCR-confirmed cases of A(H3N2) influenza virus infections in adults aged 60 to 88 yo were used for evaluation (Table 1). These older adults were infected with A(H3N2) viruses belonging to clade 3 c.2a. This group of selected participants has no history of influenza vaccination and 37.2% of them reported visits to live poultry market within the last 12 months. At baseline, 5 of the 43 individuals (11.6%) have HI antibodies > 40 to at least one of three A(H9N2) strains and 9 of them (20.9%) have detectable H9 protein binding antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), although interestingly none were positive by both assays. None of the participants have HI antibodies to A(H7N9).To determine the extent of cross-reactivity, we aimed to generate rgH6Nx viruses bearing all nine avian NA subtypes, N1 to N9. However, only viruses bearing N5 (Group 1), N3, N7 or N9 (Group 2) were successfully rescued (Supplementary Table 7). Using baseline serum samples from CARES and data from the 21-39 yo individuals in Fig. 2 as comparators, we confirmed the presence of significantly higher NI titers to AI68 N2 and the two-representative avian N2s, HK99 and PA15 in older adults. We also found higher baseline titers against N3, N5, N7 and N9 compared to the younger adults (Fig. 5a). Because we have a larger sample size here compared to the Guangzhou serum samples, we were able to further stratify the responses into 60-69 (n = 17), 70-79 (n = 18) and 80-88 yo (n = 8) groups. The NI titers against AI68, HK99 and PA15 were mostly comparable for the three subgroups, although responses against HK99 were marginally higher in the 60-69 yo (Fig. 5b–d). N3 and N9 titers were also highest among 60-69 yo, with titers significantly higher compared to younger adults (Fig. 5e–h). No significant differences in NI titers were noted for N5 and N7 across the age groups (Fig. 5f, g). Interestingly, baseline AI68 N2 titers correlated strongly with HK99, PA15 and modestly with N3 and N5, but not with N7 or N9 (Fig. 5i). In contrast, baseline titers of HK99 correlated well with all avian NAs, suggesting that cross-reactivity driven by the AI68 N2 may be mostly limited to avian N2 and its closest phylogenetic neighbor, N3, whereas reactivity against HK99 will also likely include reactivity against broader avian NA subtypes.Fig. 5: Antibody cross-reactivity to avian neuraminidase (NA) subtypes in the CARES samples.a Neuraminidase-inhibition (NI) antibody titers in older (≥60 yo, n = 43) and younger adults (21-39 yo, n = 20) to the N2 of A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (AI68) and avian N2s (from H9N2; HK99 and PA15), N3, N5, N7 and N9.

Of this group, seroconversion rates were 39.5% to AI68, 18.6% to HK99, 25.6% to PA15, 18.6% to N3, 2.3% to N7, 4.7% to N9 and 11.6% to N5 (Table 2), displaying a similar trend in cross-reactivity as seen with the baseline sera. We asked if any correlations amongst the seroconversion events existed, i.e., whether seroconversion occurred against multiple strains or just single strains. We excluded N7 and N9 from the analysis due to low numbers of seroconversion events. There were significant positive correlations between seroconversion to HK14 N2 (circulating strain), AI68 and, curiously, PA15, but not HK99, N3 or N5 (Fig. 5j). However, seroconversions to the N2s of HK99 and PA15 were positively correlated to seroconversions to N3. Collectively, these data indicated that amongst the subtypes tested, avian NA cross-reactivity beyond N2 in baseline sera was more frequently observed in 60-69 yo, particularly against N3 and N9 in Group 2. Re-exposure to human N2 is likely to boost only AI68 N2, but can induce cross-group avian NA responses in some individuals that had pre-existing avian-type NA reactivity. Presence of cross-reactive H9 antibodies at baseline, as determined by either ELISA and HAI, did not seem to affect these NA responses as these differences and correlations still holds even when we restricted the analyzes to the 29 H9-seronegative (by both assays) individuals (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 8).Table 2 Seroconversion rates to the different NA subtypes among the 43 A(H3N2)-infected participants in CARES cohortFull size tableRole of HA-stalk and other HA-binding antibodiesHA-stalk antibodies have been reported to interfere with NI assays through steric hindrance21. To exclude the potential interference by HA-stalk antibodies in our data, we measured the level of antibodies specific for Group 1 and 2 HA-stalk regions using previously described constructs, pH1HA10-Foldon (designed from A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)) and HK68-H3-SI (designed from A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2))22,23,24 in the human and mice serum samples used in our study. Minimal antibodies were detected against both stalk proteins across all age groups in both the Guangzhou and CARES cohorts with no significant difference detected across any age groups (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). We also tested the sera from the mouse immunization experiments for HA-stalk, H9 and H6 antibodies. As expected, since H6 belongs to Group 1, mice immunized with the rgH6Nx constructs elicited more Group 1 HA stalk antibodies compared to Group 2, although the titers were still relatively low. No significant difference of anti-HA stalk antibodies and anti-H9 binding were detected across the different groups of immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). No cross-reactivity were observed between H6 and H9 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). We conclude that HA-stalk and H9-binding antibodies are not major determinants of the cross-reactivity observed.Avian NA cross-reactivity profile stratified by year of birthWhen we parsed the N2 cross-reactive data in the Guangzhou cohort (Fig. 2d) according to year of birth, we observed distinct reactivity profiles in relation to the AI68 N2 titers. Individuals born between 1957 to 1968 (52-63 yo) showed high AI68 N2 titers but modest reactivity to avian N2 strains (Fig. 6a). In contrast, individuals born prior to 1957, showed high AI68 and avian N2 titers. HI titers to AI68 were detected in most of these individuals, with no difference in the average GMT between individuals born before 1957 with those born between 1957 to 1968 (Fig. 6b). This suggests that the cross-protection conferred by the pooled sera from 40-64 yo against ZJ19 in Fig. 2g likely came from these individuals with high AI68 N2 antibody titers. Individuals in the CARES cohort, who were all born before 1955, demonstrated a similar high avian N2 cross-reactivity profile (Fig. 6c). No year-of-birth pattern was observed for reactivity against the other avian NA subtypes in the CARES samples (Supplementary Fig. 6). Collectively, this data suggests individuals born prior to 1957 had higher avian N2 cross-reactivity profile compared to those born between 1957 and 1968.Fig. 6: Antibodies cross-reactivity of neuraminidase between A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2), A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2) and avian A(H9N2).a The NI antibody profile against the NA of A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (AI68) and avian A(H9N2), and the HI antibody profile against AI68, as determined for Fig. 2, when stratified by year of birth.

Analyzes were stratified to individuals after 1968 (n = 47), between 1957 to 1968 (n = 13), and individuals born before 1957 (n = 45). h The NI antibody profile of the EPI-HK participants against human N2; SG57 and AI68, and avian N2; HK99 and PA15, when stratified by year of birth. i Correlation of NI titers between SG57 N2 and the different neuraminidase subtypes in n = 58 individuals born in or before 1968 from EPI-HK cohort.

Statistical significance in b was analyzed using two-sided unpaired t-test. Statistical significance between different age groups in d–g was analyzed using two-sided one-way ANOVA, adjusted with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (***p = 0.0008 for 1957-1968 vs before 1957, ****p < 0.0001 for after 1968 vs 1957-1968 or 1968 vs before 1957 in (d); ****p < 0.0001 for after 1968 vs 1957-1968 or 1968 vs before 1957 in e, f or g). Correlation in i was reported by Spearman’s correlation for each comparison using two-sided test and visualized using the ‘corrplot’ package (R version 0.92), and p-values were adjusted by controlling for the False Discovery Rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (***p < 0.001 for each pairwise comparison).Full size imageTo evaluate whether the high avian N2 cross-reactivity was related to the 1957 pandemic exposure, we tested 112 age-stratified serum samples collected from a separate community-based cohort study on respiratory virus infections in Hong Kong, “Evaluating Population Immunity in Hong Kong” (EPI-HK)25. After excluding 7 individuals with positive H9 HI titers against HK11 and SZ19, we tested the remaining 105 samples for antibodies against N2 from A/Singapore/1/1957(H2N2) (SG57), AI68 and the two-representative avian N2, HK99 and PA15. Results from this cohort showed that N2 titers to SG57 were highest in those born before 1957 and gradually declined thereafter (Fig. 6d). In contrast, N2 titers to AI68 were not different between those born before 1957 and those born between 1957 and 1968 (Fig. 6e). This birth-year response pattern was consistent to that of HK99 and PA15 although the SG57 titers were generally lower compared to the two avian strains and AI68 (Fig. 6f–h). The N2 titers were well-correlated amongst the tested strains but a stronger correlation was noted between the avian N2s with SG57 than AI68 (Fig. 6i). Given that the AI68 N2 still shares antigenic similarity with the 1957 and avian N2, it is likely that exposure to the 1968 N2 elicited antibodies that can cross-react with avian N2 in naïve population while boosting the pre-existing N2 antibodies, resulting in higher avian N2 titers in the pre-1957 cohort.DiscussionOur study investigated the cross-reactive and protective potential of NA antibodies to A(H9N2) AIVs. We discovered that older adults exhibited high titers of cross-reactive NA antibodies against various A(H9N2) viruses, that is likely conferred by exposures to the 1957 and 1968 pandemic viruses. Our mouse studies indicated that these cross-reactive antibodies are protective and data from the CARES cohort suggest that they can still be recalled after seasonal A(H3N2) infection in some individuals.The NA cross-reactivity profile outlined in Fig. 6 reveals three intriguing birth-year specific patterns; (i) high antibody reactivity to SG57, AI68 and avian N2 in those born prior to 1957, (ii) high AI68 but moderate SG57 and avian N2 reactivity in those born between 1957 and 1968 and (iii) declining AI68, and low SG57 and avian N2 reactivity in those born after 1968. Based on modeling estimates26 and seroprevalence studies27, the first exposure to influenza typically occur within the first decade of life15-16, resulting in peak titers to strains circulating within this period (Fig. 2b). With this expectation, those born prior to 1957 would be exposed to a 1957 avian origin-N2, while those born within a decade prior to 1968 would be exposed to the 1968 N2 that have drifted from its 1957 N2-avian predecessor and adapted in humans28,29. Those born after 1968 would be exposed to further human-adapted progenies of AI68 N2, conferring more human-like antigenic specificities. This explanation is also consistent with our HI titer profile to AI68 and the report by E. te Beest et al., where they observed peak IgG titers to AI68 in Dutch adults born between the years of 1954 to 196930. Because of antigenic similarities between the 1957 and 1968 N2, the high avian NA cross-reactivity profile in those born prior to 1957 could also be the result of boosting during re-exposure to 1968 N2. Because the N9 and N3 titers correlated with avian NA titers (Fig. 5i) and was observed only within this narrow age range, it may be related to avian-type NA reactivity, potentially conferred by exposure to the H2N2 pandemic, although this needs to be tested experimentally.Intriguingly, early A(H9N2) vaccine trial reported by Stephenson et al., identified high pre-existing H9 HI-antibodies in individuals born prior to 196831. The authors concluded this is likely due to cross-reactivity between H2 and H9, as they did not detect significant pre-existing N2 antibodies by microneutralization assay. However, this conclusion could be confounded by the observation that NA antibodies do not readily neutralize viruses in vitro32,33 and that certain avian neuraminidases possess hemagglutination ability33,34,35. Hence it is possible that these high-preexisting H9 HI-titers were due to NA-antibodies. Furthermore, we did not detect significant levels of H9-binding antibodies in both the Guangzhou and CARES cohort that is consistent with the protection observed in mice challenge experiments, and our passive transfer experiments clearly demonstrate a protective role for N2 antibodies against A(H9N2) challenge.We also could not exclude the possibility that an avian N2 predecessor may have circulated in China prior to its emergence in 1957. Alternatively, another hypothesis to explain the high reactivity to avian NA in individuals ≥65 yo is the contribution of N1 circulating prior to 1957. The N1 that emerged during the 1918 pandemic is postulated to have also originated from avian reservoirs36,37. The higher avian N2 titers observed in this age group could have been compounded by exposure to this N1, although one would expect this NA to have lost its avian-like antigenicity after 20 years of human circulation. Due to the scarcity of data, further study will be required to prove either hypothesis.Data from our mouse studies suggest that exposure to 1968-like N2s protected against A(H9N2) challenge, which would explain why sera from 40-64 yo were protective against A(H9N2) challenge in the passive transfer experiments. This age group included individuals that showed the highest AI68 N2 antibody titers despite low avian N2 reactivity. Post-infection serum samples from the CARES cohort suggest that these cross-reactive N2 antibodies can be recalled even by a contemporary A(H3N2) virus in some individuals in this group, suggesting that cross-reactive memory B cells persisted and could be activated upon re-exposure38. Data in Fig. 5j showed that seroconversion to HK14 correlated with PA15, but not HK99, which suggests that either PA15 may share some epitopes with HK14 or the PA15 N2 may have more accessible epitopes, lending to higher sensitivity in antibody detection with the assay. The presence of these cross-reactive memory B cells suggests protective capacity against AIVs bearing N2 or potentially even N3 or N5. Furthermore, because the CARES cohort were sampled at six-month intervals, these post-infection, cross-reactive NA antibody responses are likely stable and of high affinity, rather than a transient polyreactive response. However, despite the high baseline titers, this capacity does not appear to extend too broadly across the two groups since N5, N7 and N9 recall responses after infection are minimal, which could explain why H7N9 was still able to cause spillover infections in predominantly older adults during its early emergence in China in 201339.There are some limitations to our study. The avian N2 strains evaluated in the serosurvey were mainly Eurasian lineages and did not include North American lineages. However, unlike the Eurasian lineage A(H9N2) viruses, the North American A(H9N2) viruses have not caused any major poultry outbreaks or been associated with human infections in recent years. As such, the focus of our study was to evaluate cross-reactivity against A(H9N2) variants of public health concern. Nonetheless, a comprehensive characterization of the breadth of N2, or even other avian NA subtypes, antibody cross-reactivity present in the human population may reveal important insights into the antigenic relationships of ancestral human N2 viruses with avian predecessors. A larger sample size could further clarify the patterns of cross-reactivity. In addition, it is unknown how representative the age-specific profile of NA cross-reactivity described here would compare across different geographic locations, although we hypothesize that it will likely be generalizable based on our observation that exposure to AI68 alone was sufficient to confer cross-reactive antibodies and protection against A(H9N2) challenge. As most A(H9N2) viruses do not cause significant morbidity in mice40, we were only able to assess protection using this particular isolate of A(H9N2), ZJ19, which showed measurable morbidity at a dose of 107 PFU. We were still able to demonstrate protection conferred by the human or mouse sera, despite the relatively high dose used. Lastly, pooled human sera may contain protective non-NA antibodies. We attempted to address this by purifying NA antibodies but were unsuccessful in recovering sufficient antibodies to perform the passive transfer experiments. Whilst we cannot exclude the contributions of non-NA antibodies, we suspect that their contribution was minimal based on our observation that priming with rgH6Nx viruses did not provide protection against A(H9N2) challenge, despite both being Group 1 AIVs.To summarize, we showed that cross-reactive and protective avian N2 antibodies are present in the population in an age-dependent manner due to past exposure to avian-like NAs during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. This is likely a major determinant of age-specific morbidity associated with A(H9N2) AIV infection and should be further explored within the context of other zoonotic influenza viruses. Likewise, NA-immunity should be considered in risk-assessment evaluations of zoonotic influenza viruses.MethodsEthics statementStudies using samples of the Guangzhou cohort received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Ref: ES-2023- K011-01). Written informed consent was waived as de-identified residual sera were used. The CARES study received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Ref: JSJK2015-B013-02) while the EPI-HK study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong (Ref: UW15-404 and UW19-720). All participants or their guardians in the CARES and EPI-HK study provided informed written consent.Phylogenetic analysis and strains selectionNA from A(H3N2) vaccine strains were selected as representative strains, while AIV strains were selected based on prototypical strains of geographical and temporal importance. Viral genomes were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database (http://www.fludb.org) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (https://gisaid.org). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using the maximum likelihood method with the GTR + G + I nucleotide substitution model in MEGA-X41. Branch support was estimated using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic relationships and sequence similarity were used to select representative A(H3N2) and A(H9N2) strains for serological studies. These included prototypical A(H9N2) viruses representing BJ94 subclades, A/chicken/Hong Kong/G9/1997 (HK97) and A/chicken/Fujian/9290/2005 (FU05)42, as well as a BJ94/F98 A(H9N2) virus, A/Suzhou/GIRD01/2019 (SZ19), which was isolated from a critical case of respiratory illness in a 9-year-old43. We also included the G1 subclade A(H9N2) viruses A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/1999 (HK99), A/chicken/Hong Kong/YU250W/2011 (HK11), A/Pakistan/486/2015 (PA15), A/chicken/Egypt /S12568C/2016 (EG16), and A/Oman/2747/2019 (OM19). Notably, PA15, EG16 and OM19 have recently been identified as candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for pandemic preparedness (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/a(h9n2)—northern-hemisphere-2022-2023).Human cohortsTo determine the antibody seroprevalence to human and avian N2 in the human population, we used residual human serum samples collected by the Department of Laboratory Medicine of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in Guangzhou, China and serum collected from a community-based longitudinal cohort study on respiratory virus infections in Hong Kong, “Evaluating Population Immunity in Hong Kong” (EPI-HK)25. Serum samples from the Guangzhou cohort were collected during physical examinations generally conducted once a year for education and employment purposes, whereas the EPI-HK baseline serum samples were collected upon enrollment in July 2020.In the Guangzhou cohort, twenty serum samples per age group were collected based on previous findings that predicted probability of exposure24; i.e ≤5yo: no or at most 1 exposure, 6-10 yo: at least 1 exposure, 11-20 yo: likely more than 1 exposure, 21-39 yo: multiple exposures. For the 40-64 yo and the > 65 yo, we further considered the potential imprint profile due to early life exposure based on the viruses in circulation at time of birth (Supplementary Table 2). In the EPI-HK cohort, we modified the age groups to 0–10, 11–20, 21–39, 40–64, 65–74 and > 75 years old to prioritize the older adults. Both cohorts were pre-specified to include equal ratios of males to females. HI assays were conducted to identify and exclude individuals that may have been exposed to subtype A(H9N2) IAVs and to confirm those with past exposures to subtype A(H3N2) IAVs.To determine whether the antibody reactivity against NA protein can also be observed in other avian NA subtypes and if these antibody responses could be recalled after seasonal influenza virus infection, we use paired baseline and post-infection serum samples from 43 PCR-confirmed cases of A(H3N2) influenza virus infections identified from the China Ageing REspiratory infections Study (CARES). CARES was a longitudinal surveillance cohort for respiratory viral infections, conducted amongst community-dwelling adults between 60–89 years of age at enrollment during the winter of 2015-2017 in Suzhou and Yancheng, Jiangsu province, China20.Virus generation, propagation and titrationWild type (wt) and reverse genetics (rg) viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. To generate rg-viruses, genes of interests were synthesized (Supplementary Table 7) (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.), cloned into pHW2000 and used to rescue viruses based on the eight plasmid rg-system44. Briefly, plasmids encoding the HA and NA genes of interests were co-transfected along with the six internal genes were of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) into 293 T cells at 1 µg each using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Wild type A/chicken/Zhejiang/198/2019 (H9N2) (ZJ19) virus and A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) were used for the challenge experiment. rgH3N2 viruses were generated for HI assay, whereas rgH6Nx viruses were generated for ELLA. The rgH6Nx viruses were generated using the mismatched H6 from Aeal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1). Sanger sequencing was used to confirm virus genome sequences. Virus stocks were stored at −80 °C and titrated by plaque assay in Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells that were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Hemagglutination inhibition assayHemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays were performed according to standard protocol (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/44518). Briefly, sera were pre-treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken) to remove non-specific inhibitors of agglutination and heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h. Serum samples were titrated in serial two-fold dilutions with a starting dilution of 1:10 and incubated with four agglutinating doses of test antigens for 45 min. Antibody titers were measured as the reciprocal of the highest dilution causing complete hemagglutination inhibition of 1% guinea pig red blood cells (Guangzhou Ruite Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).Neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assayFunctional NA antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) using rg viruses expressing the NA of the target strains and a mismatched HA. Microtiter plates were coated overnight with fetuin (BIO-RAD) prior to the addition of two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera starting with a dilution of 1:20 and a pre-determined concentration of recombinant virus, incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. Peroxidase-labeled peanut agglutinin (lectin) (Sigma) was added to the reaction and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound lectins were detected with 3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate System (Life Technologies). NI titers were measured as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that resulted in more than 50% signal inhibition compared to virus-only wells. Paired sera were tested together in the same run. A serum with previously pre-defined titer against the reference antigens was used as an internal control.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Recombinant full-length HA proteins (Sinobiologicals) or the HA-stalk proteins were coated at 0.5 mg/ml onto 96-well high binding immunoassay plates in coating buffer overnight at 4 °C. Negative wells were coated with buffer only. Plates were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked for two hours with PBS supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Lonsera). After removing the blocking solution, 50 μl of serially diluted sera was added at a starting dilution of 1:200 in duplicate wells and incubated for two hours at 37 °C. Sera were then removed and plates were washed three times with PBS-T. 50 μl/well anti-human (Bioss, bs-0297G-HRP) or anti-mouse IgG (Bioss, bs-0296G-HRP) secondary antibody, diluted 1:20,000 or 1:10,000 in 5% FBS-PBS-T, was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Secondary antibody was then removed and the plates were washed three times with 220 μl/well PBS-T, and 50 μl/well of TMB was added. After 15 min, 50 μl/well of 0.5 M H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. End-point titer was calculated as the reciprocal dilution that gave a positiveegative optical density readout ratio of >2. Sera from H1 or H3 stalk-immunized mice was used as a positive control.Mouse experimentsAll mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional animal care guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Guangzhou Medical University. We used female mice in this study as they develop more robust antibody IgG responses compared to male mice45. Mice were purchased from Zhejiang Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd and housed in the Experimental Animal Center of Guangzhou Medical University under in a ventilated isocage, in a room with a 12- h light/dark cycle. The temperature and humidity are maintained at 20–26 °C with 30%–70% percent humidity. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Infection was performed by intranasal inoculation of 30 μl virus inoculum after isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease. Animals that reached humane endpoints, such as severe symptomology or >30% weight loss, were euthanized. To determine lung viral loads, lungs were weighed, homogenized using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) and pelleted by centrifugation. The collected supernatant was titrated in MDCK cells. Experimental schema of mouse experiments was created with BioRender.com (https://www.biorender.com).Human sera passive transfer-challenge mouse experiment6-8 weeks old female Balb/c mice (n = 8 to 10 per group, depending on the available volume of pooled sera) were intraperitoneally injected with 350 μl of pooled human sera (pooled in equal volume from all samples) from the respective age groups and challenged 18 hours later with 107.1 PFU of ZJ19. Animals were monitored daily for signs of discomfort and weight loss for up to 14 days post inoculation (DPI).Prime-challenge mouse experimentIn the first prime-challenge experiment, groups of 6-8 weeks old female Balb/c mice (n = 11/group) were inoculated with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or the following priming viruses: wild-type H3N2-AI68 (A/Aichi/2/1968) virus, and reassortant rgH3N2-SG16, containing the HA and NA genes of A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 (H3N2), or rgH1N1-MI15 containing the HA and NA genes of A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) at 102, 106, 102 PFU respectively. In the second prime-challenge experiment, the rgH6Nx viruses; rgH6N2-AI68, rgH6N2-SG16 or rgH6N1-MI15 containing the NA genes of AI68, SG16 or MI15, the HA gene of Aeal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1) and remaining genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) were used at 103, 104 or 103 PFU, respectively. The positive and negative control groups were inoculated with 105.5 PFU of A/chicken/Zhejiang/198/2019 (H9N2) (ZJ19) or PBS. Mice were boosted again with the same viruses at 21DPI and challenged with 107.1 PFU of ZJ19 at 51 DPI. After challenge, lungs were collected at 3 and 6 DPI for virus titration (n = 3) and the remaining mice (n = 5) were monitored for 14 DPI to study disease pathogenesis. Sera were collected at baseline, at secondary boost and after viral challenge. Virus titers were titrated by tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) assay in MDCK cells.Immune sera passive transfer-challenge mouse experimentTo assess the cross-protective efficacy of NA antibodies, sera were collected from 6-8 weeks old female Balb/c mice (n = 14/group) after two doses of inoculation with rgH6Nx viruses rgH6N2-AI68, rgH6N2-SG16 or rgH6N1-MI15 at 103, 104, and 103 PFU, respectively. Positive control serum was pooled from mice inoculated with 105.5 PFU of ZJ19 and negative control serum was pooled from PBS-inoculated mice. 350 μl of pooled, heat-inactivated mouse immune sera were passively transferred by intraperitoneal injection (n = 8 to 10 per group, depending on the available volume of pooled sera). Recipient mice were challenged 18 h later with 107.1 PFU of ZJ19 and monitored for weight loss and symptoms for up to 14 DPI46.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9), while correlations amongst different strains were performed by using corrplot package (version 0.92) (https://github.comaiyun/corrplot) and Complex Heatmap was generated by using Complex Heatmap package (version 2.13.1) (http://bioconductor.org/packageselease/BiocViews.html#___Software)47 using R software (version 4.2.2). For antibody data, samples that did not meet the assay detection threshold were assigned a value half of the starting dilutions, i.e., mouse sera with no detectable signal in ELLA and HI assays were assigned a titer of 5 and samples of human sera with no detectable signal in ELLA assays were assigned a titer of 10. Antibody data were log transformed for statistical testing. Point estimates were expressed as geometric mean titers (GMT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and fold-changes were expressed as geometric mean fold changes (GMFCs) with 95% CI. Statistical significance between paired samples were determined using paired-tests while differences between groups were determined by unpaired t-tests or one-way ANOVA. Mouse survival was analyzed using Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test; p < 0.05 was considered significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

These are summarized below looking at the date of notification, the importance of the detection, the source of exposure (how the case was infected), and the case profile (including age, sex, underlying health condition and history).Avian Influenza A (H5N1) - AustraliaNotificationOn 17 May 2024, the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) for Reference and Research on Influenza in Australia notified the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) of Australia of a suspected case of human A(H5N1) avian influenza (HPAI) in Melbourne, Victoria.ImportanceThis is the first confirmed human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5N1) virus detected and reported by Australia.Source of exposureAlthough the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, the exposure likely occurred in India, where the case had travelled, and where this clade of A(H5N1) viruses has been detected in birds. Case profileThe case is a two and a half-year-old girl with no underlying conditions. She had a history of travel to Kolkata, India, from 12 to 29 February 2024. She returned to Australia on 1 March 2024.Upon returning to Australia, the child presented at a hospital in Victoria on 2 March 2024, where she received medical care and was admitted on the same day. On 4 March, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit at a referral hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, due to worsening symptoms, for a period of one week. The patient was discharged from hospital after a two and a half week admission. The case is now reported to be clinically well.More information: https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON519Avian Influenza A (H5N2) - MexicoNotificationOn 23 May 2024, the Mexico IHR NFP reported to PAHO/WHO a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N2) virus in a patient with underlying co-morbidities who subsequently died.ImportanceThis is the first laboratory-confirmed human with an influenza A(H5N2) detection reported globally and the first avian H5 virus detection in a person reported in Mexico.Source of exposureAlthough the source of exposure to the virus in this case is currently unknown, A(H5N2) viruses have been reported in poultry in Mexico. Case profileThe case is a 59-year-old resident of the State of Mexico who was hospitalized in Mexico City and had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals. The case had multiple underlying medical conditions. The case’s relatives reported that the case had already been bedridden for three weeks, for other reasons, prior to the onset of acute symptoms. On 24 April, the case sought medical attention, was hospitalized, and died the same day due to complications of his condition. Although H5N2 was detected, it is not always clear what role a disease has in the death of a patient with underlying medical health issues. Further clinical and lab studies are ongoing to better understand the cause of death.

These are the main findings of the latest report on avian influenza by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU reference laboratory (EURL), based on reported data between April and June 2024. The improvement of the situation in Europe may be linked to several factors and needs further investigation. These may include: immunity developed by wild birds following previous infection; reduction of certain wild bird populations; decreased environmental contamination; and changes in the composition of viral genotypes. Experts noted the continuous circulation of HPAI virus in wild birds in Europe throughout the year, albeit at low numbers. They recommended to enhance surveillance in view of the next influenza season.HPAI outside EuropeFor the first time in many years, Australia has reported HPAI cases. The different subtypes circulating in Australia are currently not reported in the rest of the world.Experts noted the unexpected diversity of mammal species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species affected by HPAI as well as the different viral genotypes circulating among poultry, wild birds, and mammals in North America. Direct cattle-to-cattle transmission has not yet been confirmed, while raw milk from cows has been observed as a new, unexpected route of transmission. Current evidence indicates that industrial pasteurisation plays a significant role in inactivating HPAI virus in the raw milk of cows.How to contact usEFSA Media Relations OfficeTel. +39 0521 036 149E-mail: press [at] efsa.europa.eu (Press[at]efsa[dot]europa[dot]eu)(Only if you are a member of the press)Ask a Question ServiceYou have a question about EFSA’s work?

During the H3N2 CIV evolution in beagles, the virus formed a new clade after 2019 and gradually became more adaptable to other mammals. Therefore, successfully elucidating the biological characteristics and constructing a canine influenza infection model is required for CIV characterization.MethodsWe performed genetic analyses to examine the biological characteristics and infection dynamics of CIV.ResultsThe genotype of our H3N2 CIV strain (from 2019 in Shanghai) belonged to the 5.1 clade, which is now prevalent in China. Using MDCK cells, we investigated viral cytopathic effects. Virus size and morphology were observed using transmission electron microscopy. Beagles were also infected with 104, 105, and 106 50% egg-infectious doses (EID50). When compared with the other groups, the 106 EID50 group showed the most obvious clinical symptoms, the highest virus titers, and typical lung pathological changes. Our results suggested that the other two treatments caused mild clinical manifestations and pathological changes. Subsequently, CIV distribution in the 106 EID50 group was detected by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining, which indicated that CIV primarily infected the lungs.ConclusionsThe framework established in this study will guide further CIV prevention strategies. BackgroundCanine influenza virus (CIV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and contains eight single-stranded negative RNA fragments encoding more than 15 viral proteins [1]. Dogs are susceptible to avian influenza virus (H3N2 and H5N1), equine influenza virus (H3N8), or human influenza virus (pdmH1N1 and H3N2) [2,3,4]. Globally, H3N8 and H3N2 are the major CIV subtypes [4]. H3N8 CIV has been circulating mainly in the United States since 2004 [5], while H3N2 CIV is dominant in South Korea and China [4, 6]. When compared with H3N8 CIV, H3N2 CIV has a wider host range and infects various mammals, including ferrets, guinea pigs, mice, and cats [7,8,9,10].Throughout history, influenza pandemics have been caused by the introduction of new viruses. Pigs are a “mixed container” of influenza A virus (IAV) in birds and mammals, while dogs are the most likely animals to come into contact with humans, and are suspected as potential mixed containers. As one of the most popular pets, dogs have close contact with humans, so CIV spread poses a serious threat to the human influenza virus. However, studies on animals infected with CIV have been conducted. H3N2 CIV pathogenesis is contradictory. Research has shown that H3N2 CIV damages organs and the respiratory tract, with virus titers detected in corresponding tissues [11]. In contrast, low pathogenic H3N2 CIV and even highly pathogenic H5N1 CIV are the main causes of damage to the tonsils and respiratory tract, with virus titers undetected in other organs [12,13,14]. These results indicate that CIV clinical symptoms and virus replication dynamics are highly dependent on individual differences in the infection strain, the vaccination route, and host immunity [15,16,17,18]. Therefore, the comprehensive confirmation of H3N2 CIV pathogenicity in dogs is required. In our study, a new CIV genotype was cultured in MDCK cells supplemented with 2% Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium and trypsin, treated with 1 µg/ml TPCK, and observed under electron microscopy. We also investigated viral infection dynamics in beagles.MethodsEthics statementAnimal protocols were approved by the Laboratory Animals Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Animal Disease Control Center.Phylogenetic analysesThe hemagglutinin (HA) genes of six H3N2 CIV isolates (A/canine/China/Shanghai/0103/2019; A/canine/China/Shanghai/0104/2019; A/canine/China/Shanghai/0105/2019; A/canine/China/Shanghai/018/2019; A/canine/China/Shanghai/019/2019; A/canine/China/Shanghai/0114/2019) from Shanghai in 2019 were used for genetic and phylogenetic analyses (Accession numbers; MK758007.1–MK7580054.1). Sequence data were compiled and edited using Lasergene sequence analysis software (Dnastar Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using CLUSTAL W. The maximum likelihood tree for origin analysis was constructed in MEGA 4 using 1,000 bootstrap replications [19, 20].Virus propagation and electron microscopyA/canine/Shanghai/0103/2019 (H3N2) was isolated from a stray dog in Shanghai, China. The virus was propagated in 9 day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C for 48 h and stored at -80 °C. Viral titers were evaluated using the 50% egg-infectious dose (EID50/ml) method and calculated using the Reed–Muench method [21]. For virus isolation using MDCK cells, 1 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin was used to support viral growth. Infected cells were incubated under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 72 h. Supernatants were harvested and further passaged. Then, infection was detected using RT-PCR (Qiagen, Shenzhen). The H3N2 virus (A/canine/Shanghai/0103/2019) was adsorbed onto a carbon parlodion-coated copper grid for 2 min. Excess suspension was removed by blotting with filter paper, and the grid was immediately stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid for 10 min. Excess stain was removed using filter paper, after which samples were examined using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan).Clinical studies and viral challengeSixteen beagles (10 weeks old) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center (Runde Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Prior to studies, serum samples were collected from all dogs and subjected to hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays to ensure that animals had not been exposed to H3N2 CIV. Four dogs were used as controls. For intranasal administration, the 12 remaining dogs were divided into three groups and intranasally inoculated with 1 ml of 104, 105, or 106 EID50 of A/canine/Shanghai/0103/2019. The control group was intranasally inoculated with the same volume of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dogs were housed in separate cages and observed for 10 days after infection.Nasal swabs were collected, during which time clinical symptoms were monitored. The clinical score of each dog was evaluated using a previously described scoring system [22]. Nasal secretions were collected from left and right nostrils every day until day 10 after inoculation (0–10 days post infection (dpi)) and diluted in 1 ml of PBS plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Nasal swabs were used for measuring EID50 values using 9–11 day old embryonic chicken eggs. Two dogs from the control group and two from each experimental group were then humanely euthanized at 5 dpi. Turbinates, tracheas, and lung tissues were collected, and EID50 sample values determined. Briefly, 1 ml of sterile PBS was added per 1 g of collected tissue, which was then ground in a liquid nitrogen homogenizer. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation and inoculated at different dilutions into 9 day old chicken embryos. The two remaining dogs in groups were monitored until day 10.Serological testingBlood samples were collected from dogs at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 dpi. Approximately 500 µl of serum was collected from each dog and stored at -20 °C until required. One volume of serum was mixed with three volumes of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE, Denka Seiken Co., Ltd.), incubated for 18 h at 37 °C and then 30 min at 56 °C. Antiserum titers were determined using HI assays. The 1% red blood cells used in this study were collected from SPF cocks and diluted in sterile PBS.Histopathological examinations using hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence (IF) stainingLiver, spleen, lung, trachea, and intestinal tissues collected at 5 dpi were fixed in 10% formalin for > 48 h. Samples were washed overnight, dehydrated in alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Next, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 4–7 μm thick sections and deposited on glass slides. Sections were then mounted and left overnight at 37 °C prior to H&E staining.IF staining was performed on deparaffinized and rehydrated tissue sections. Briefly, sections were first treated with antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories, California, USA) in a pressure cooker. After blocking in 0.1% Sudan black B for 15 min and 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature for 30 min, membranes were incubated with a primary antibody against IAV nucleoprotein (Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. This was followed by incubation with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam) for 30 min, after which sections were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All sections were examined and images captured using a Carl Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison tests using GraphPad Prism (v.7.02) software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). P values < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.ResultsPhylogenetic analysisTo better characterize genetic variations in the six isolated H3N2 CIVs from Shanghai, the HA segment of all six H3N2 CIVs were analyzed and fell into clade 5.1, which is prevalent in China (Fig. 1). Our six isolates belonged to the same clade as the reference strains [23].Fig. 1A phylogenetic tree showing the hemagglutinin segment of H3N2 CIVs. The 2019 isolates included in this study are highlighted in the blue squareFull size imageVirus propagation and electron microscopyTo further investigate viral biological characteristics, MDCK cells were used. The isolate showed remarkable cytopathic effects toward MDCK cells (Fig. 2A and B). H3N2 CIV was detected using RT-PCR (Qiagen, Shenzhen) (Fig. 2C). Virus size and morphology were both examined using transmission electron microscopy; the average size was 100 nm, and spikes were observed on spherical surfaces (Fig. 3).Fig. 2CIV cytopathic effects on MDCK cells at 36 h post-inoculation (hpi) (100× magnification).

All challenged dogs showed respiratory symptoms at 2 dpi, including sneezing, nose clearing, depression, and coughing, which continued until day 8 (Fig. 4A, B).Fig. 4Infected dogs show depression (A) and a streaming nose (B) at 2 dpiFull size imageWhen the infectious dose was 106 EID50, clinical symptom scores were greater than the other two experimental groups at 4 and 6 dpi. The difference between the 106 EID50 group and the other groups was significant at 6 dpi (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). When compared with the control group, body temperatures in infected dogs fluctuated to varying degrees, and fever always occurred at 2–6 dpi (Fig. 5B).The virus was detected within 24 h post-inoculation, and virus shedding lasted for 1–6 days in all challenged dogs. The virus titer in the 106 EID50 group was significantly greater than in the other two groups at 1–5 dpi (P < 0.05). No virus was detected on the 7th day, showing that virus shedding terminated at 7 dpi in beagles (Fig. 5C). As shown (Fig. 5D), virus titers were evaluated in turbinates, tracheas, and lungs in infected dogs at 5 dpi. In turbinates and lungs, but not in tracheas, virus titers in 106 EID50 and 105 EID50 groups were significantly greater than titers in the 104 EID50 group (P < 0.05).Fig. 5Dogs were inoculated with 106, 105, or 104 EID50 (n = 2) of the A/canine/Shanghai/0103/2019 virus or PBS (n = 2) as a control. Nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung tissues were collected after humanely euthanizing two dogs in each group at 5 dpi.

An anatomical lung examination revealed that 106 EID50 and 105 EID50 groups showed obvious lesions; lung surfaces had visible bleeding spots. However, visible lesions were barely detected in 104 EID50 group lungs (Fig. 7A–D).Fig. 7Macroscopic images showing beagle lungs.

Lung pathological lesions, including interstitial pneumonia and hepatocyte degeneration and swelling, were observed (Fig. 8A). As shown (Fig. 8B), strong CIV antigen staining was observed in lungs, while no CIV antigen staining was detected in the liver (Fig. 8).Fig. 8At 5 dpi, liver, spleen, lung, trachea, and intestinal tissues were collected for hematoxylin and eosin (A–D) and immunofluorescence staining (E–H)Full size imageDiscussionAs a popular companion, dogs typically have close contact with humans and are considered potential intermediate IAV hosts [24]. Canine influenza has occurred in Shanghai and other places in recent years, and potentially threatens public health safety. Research on H3N2 subtype CIV pathogenicity can help us better understand disease pathogenesis, vaccine research and evaluation. Therefore, six H3N2 CIV strains from Shanghai were analyzed according to the report by Chen et al.; these strains belonged to the 5.1 clade, which is now prevalent in China [23]. We also confirmed that H3N2 subtype CIV caused high fever, shortness of breath, cough, and severe lung consolidation in dogs, largely consistent with published H3N2 CIV pathogenicity [25, 26]. To prevent further CIV, infection dynamics in beagle were investigated. We compared clinical scores, body temperatures, nasal swab wash virus titers, tissue virus titers, and lung tissue damage between different titer groups (104 EID50, 105 EID50, and 106 EID50). Overall, when compared with other lower intranasal doses, the intranasal 106 EID50 dose caused obvious clinical symptoms and tissue damage. At 6 dpi, more than 24 HI titers were induced in challenged groups. The body induces immune responses against IAVs, which often cause secondary bacterial diseases and lung diseases after infection [27].Influenza virus mainly infects the upper respiratory tract and bronchial epithelial cells, but in severe cases, it can spread to the bronchioles and alveoli to cause interstitial pneumonia. To assess the degree of lung injury caused by different challenges, we collected lung tissues from infected beagles at 5 dpi. With increasing dose, clinical symptoms in dogs were more obvious; lung lesions were more serious, and the attack dose positively correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, we tested the tissue tropism of the virus in liver, spleen, lung, trachea, and intestine samples. H&E staining revealed that hepatocytes were swollen and degenerated, and lungs showed interstitial pneumonia. Using IF, CIV mainly infected the lungs but not the liver, spleen, trachea, or intestines. From our analyses, the clinical symptom observation and body temperature detection have the error of human factors, and the two can be used as the reference for the animal test of H3N2 subtype CIV infection. Severe lung consolidation occurred in 106 EID50-infected dogs. Therefore, the degree of consolidation in lungs was an important criterion for the incidence of canine. Hence, our experiment lays a solid foundation for studying CIV pathogenesis and evaluating vaccine efficacy.IAV pandemics are caused by novel viruses that efficiently sustain transmission into human populations with limited herd immunity. Dogs are potential mixing vessels for avian and mammalian IAVs and represent a human health concern due to their susceptibility to infection, their numbers, and close physical contact with humans [28]. It was reported that our isolates belonged to a distinct branch with mutations related to mammalian adaptation [29]. Our study provides increasing evidence that canine population surveillance for IAVs is an important component of pandemic preparedness. Data availability No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. ReferencesLee I-W, Kim Y-I, Lim G-J, et al.

In describing the findings, the FDA said the study compliments an initial study the agency did this spring testing 297 samples of commercial dairy products—all found to be negative for viable (live) highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. Virus highly sensitive to heat treatment"The results of the study announced today strongly indicate that the virus is much more sensitive to heat treatment with commercial pasteurization equipment than other studies might suggest," said Stephen Walker, PhD, a consumer safety officer at the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), in an FDA press release.The results of the study announced today strongly indicate that the virus is much more sensitive to heat treatment with commercial pasteurization equipment than other studies might suggestThe experiments used 275 raw milk samples obtained from multiple farms in four states currently experiencing H5N1 outbreaks among dairy cattle. Of the 275 samples, 158 were positive for viral fragments. Of those, 39 had infectious virus at an average of 3,000 virus particles per milliliter.The samples were then subjected to "high-temperature-short-time" (HTST) or "flash pasteurization," the most commonly used US pasteurization technique. It consists of heating the milk to 161°F (72°C) for 15 seconds in a continuous flow. The researchers also contaminated some raw milk samples with a higher concentration of virus, 5 million virus particles per milliliter. HTST eliminated the virus in all samples tested. "While testing finished product post-pasteurization is one strategy to detect potential problems in finished products, validating the effectiveness of the pasteurization parameters critically demonstrates that commercial milk processing is capable of controlling the HPAI virus," said Nathan Anderson, PhD, also from CFSAN. Pasteurized milk contains no live virus In related news, another new preprint study from researchers at Ohio State University, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the University of Illinois shows H5N1 avian flu RNA, but not live virus, in pasteurized retail milk.The study found evidence of H5N1 viral nucleic acid in 36.3% of samples (61 of 168) from pasteurized milk bought from retail stores across the United States."None of the retail milk samples included in this study contained viable, infectious A(H5N1) virus per in vitro and in vivo assays, which provides evidence that pasteurization is sufficient for inactivation of pathogens in the commercial milk supply," the authors wrote.Neither preprint study has been peer-reviewed.Currently the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has detected H5N1 in 137 dairy herds from 12 states. Over the weekend the USDA confirmed new outbreaks in Colorado (3) and Iowa (1).

That's according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, which said it is the fourth confirmed human case in the United States since an outbreak among cows that appears to have started in March. Stock photo of cows VLIET/Getty Images The man was working in Northern Colorado and had direct contact with cattle that were infected with avian flu. To this point, the only U.S. cases have been among farmworkers. The CDPHE says the person who tested positive for the avian flu only had one symptom — pink eye, otherwise known as conjunctivitis. The CDC, however, reported Friday that a "respiratory sample," from the worker also tested positive for the virus, despite the patient not reporting symptoms other than pink eye. So far, only someone in Michigan — who was also exposed to sick dairy cattle — has developed respiratory symptoms after being infected with the virus.The Colorado worker was tested after reporting his symptoms and received an antiviral treatment with oseltamivir afterwards. Those are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended steps when there's a confirmed human case. The man, whose identity is not being released, has recovered. This is the first confirmed a case of avian flu in Colorado since 2022. CDPHE state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said the risk to the public is low. "Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals," Herlihy said in a prepared statement. Jill Hunsaker Ryan, the executive director of the CDPHE said "Coloradans should feel confident that the state is doing everything possible to mitigate the virus." The guidance for farmworkers includes the recommendation that people shouldn't touch animals who are sick or who have died. For people who must handle such animals, the following is recommended: - Wear personal protective equipment that includes an N95 respirator as well as eye protection and gloves. - Wash hands with soap and water afterward. An alcohol-based hand rub could also be used if soap and water is not available. "We can make these recommendations, but I think all of us realize that this may be a bit challenging for workers to comply with that," the CDC's Tim Uyeki said at a briefing with rural doctors last month.It is unclear whether the man was wearing personal protective equipment. "Our partnership with the Colorado Department of Agriculture has been crucial in disseminating information to dairy farmers across the state," Hunsaker Ryan said.The three other confirmed human cases of avian flu since the March outbreak in cattle were found in Texas and Michigan. Anyone who has been working with dairy cows and begins to feel sick with possible avian flu symptoms should call the CDPHE at 303-692-2700 during the day or 303-370-9395 after hours. More information about avian flu can be found on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's website.News of the case comes as federal officials are now debating whether and when to deploy 4.8 million doses of bird flu vaccine that are being filled into vials this summer. Finland announced last month it would offer shots to workers who might be exposed to the virus. Vaccinating farm workers?U.S. officials say manufacturing of the vaccines is expected to be done by August. Vaccinemaker CSL Seqirus says it is still in talks with the Food and Drug Administration to clear use of their shots in humans. After that, it would be up to the CDC to decide whether to roll out the shots for farm workers."No final decisions are made, but we are in the process of robust discussion," the CDC's Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah told reporters on Tuesday. Shah said the vaccine debate hinges in part on whether more distribution of flu treatments might be a better alternative."If our goal is to reduce the number of infections that may occur, we have to wonder whether vaccination is the best route for that, or whether there may be other routes that are faster or even more effective such as, as I mentioned, more widespread use of antivirals," said Shah.Officials are also discussing other measures to help workers infected with the virus, Shah added, including the possibility of offering financial help with sick leave and further outreach.Farm workers may also not be willing to get the shots, even if they were to become eligible for vaccination. "If right now, H5 is not perceived as a pressing threat among farm workers, and I'm not speculating as to whether it is or not, but if that is the case, then uptake may not be robust," said Shah.

Models of maternal immune activation (MIA) using viral mimetics demonstrate that activation of maternal intestinal T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which produce effector cytokine interleukin (IL)-17, leads to aberrant fetal brain development, such as neocortical malformations. Fetal microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) also serve as potential cellular mediators of MIA-induced cortical abnormalities. However, neither the inflammation-induced TH17 cell pathway nor fetal brain-resident macrophages have been thoroughly examined in models of live viral infection during pregnancy. Here, we inoculated pregnant mice with two infectious doses of IAV and evaluated peak innate and adaptive immune responses in the dam and fetus. While respiratory IAV infection led to dose-dependent maternal colonic shortening and microbial dysregulation, there was no elevation in intestinal TH17 cells nor IL-17. Systemically, IAV resulted in consistent dose- and time-dependent increases in IL-6 and IFN-γ. Fetal cortical abnormalities and global changes in fetal brain transcripts were observable in the high-but not the moderate-dose IAV group. Profiling of fetal microglia and BAMs revealed dose- and time-dependent differences in the numbers of meningeal but not choroid plexus BAMs, while microglial numbers and proliferative capacity of Iba1+ cells remained constant. Fetal brain-resident macrophages increased phagocytic CD68 expression, also in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Taken together, our findings indicate that certain features of MIA are conserved between mimetic and live virus models, while others are not. Overall, we provide consistent evidence of an infection severity threshold for downstream maternal inflammation and fetal cortical abnormalities, which recapitulates a key feature of the epidemiological data and further underscores the importance of using live pathogens in NDD modeling to better evaluate the complete immune response and to improve translation to the clinic.

Most individuals have mild symptoms; however, IAV infection during pregnancy poses a substantially increased risk of morbidity and mortality in both mother and infant [2,3,4] due to pregnancy-mediated changes to the maternal immune landscape [5]. Gestational IAV infection also has the potential to cause long-lasting negative health outcomes in the developing offspring. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that IAV infection during pregnancy increases the prevalence of offspring neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) like schizophrenia [6,7,8], bipolar disorder [9], and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [10] (as reviewed in [11]).Early rodent models of prenatal exposure to IAV found that offspring developed neuropathology similar to that seen in ASD and schizophrenia [12,13,14]. Notably, the cause of these brain abnormalities was determined to be from the maternal anti-viral inflammatory response rather than vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus [15]. Pathogen mimetics, such as bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or synthetic dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), are currently popular choices for maternal immune activation (MIA) modeling due to the controlled and predictable innate immune response elicited, which enables researchers to target specific fetal developmental periods. While these mimetic models recapitulate NDD-like behavioral and neuropathological offspring phenotypes [16, 17], they fail to recreate the full spectrum of pathogen-induced pathological conditions. Unlike poly I:C, live viruses like IAV actively replicate within infected tissue and elicit a complex cascade of innate and adaptive immune responses [18,19,20]. Thus, certain characteristics of important downstream immune signaling cascades differ between poly I:C and live IAV. However, some canonical inflammatory signaling cascades may be conserved between the two models. Poly I:C-initiated MIA models first implicated interleukin (IL)-6, a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, in offspring NDDs [21,22,23]. Similarly, our group and others have also observed IAV-induced increases in IL-6 [24,25,26], yet the various mechanisms by which maternally derived IL-6 may directly impact offspring neurodevelopmental processes are still being revealed [23, 27]. IL-6 can also act upstream of effector cytokine IL-17, which has been more recently implicated as the major driver of fetal brain abnormalities. In poly I:C-induced MIA, increased production of IL-17 results from activation of pre-existing maternal intestinal T helper (TH)-17 cells [28,29,30,31,32]. While IL-17-producing intestinal TH17 cells have also been identified as potential drivers of IAV-mediated intestinal injury [33], this occurs on a very different time scale (6-8 days following IAV inoculation versus 24–48 h following poly I:C injection) and requires differentiation and propagation of naive CD4+ T cells into pathogenic TH17 cells [33, 34]. Therefore, we hypothesized that IAV infection during pregnancy would lead to activation of maternal intestinal TH17 cells and increased IL-17 production, albeit through unique innate and adaptive mechanisms.Still, the mechanisms by which discrete maternal intestinal immune responses might perturb the fetal brain remain to be fully elucidated. Recent work from mimetic-induced MIA models indicates that elevated maternal IL-6 and IL-17 lead directly to fetal brain abnormalities by binding receptors on neurons, as indicated by increased transcription of neuronal IL-6 and IL-17 receptors [29]. While these changes appear to disrupt synaptogenesis and brain connectivity [23, 27], it is unclear how this proposed receptor-ligand binding sequence results in fetal cortical malformations. Furthermore, it is unclear whether a similar signaling cascade is activated during maternal IAV infection or if there are additional inflammatory signals at play.Mounting evidence indicates that fetal microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs) respond to maternally derived inflammation [35, 36] and could be contributing to neocortical developmental abnormalities [37]. Microglia are present in the embryonic brain at the onset of neurogenesis [38], which places them at the center of early neuronal support. One of their many roles during development includes shaping the neocortex by stimulating neural precursor cell proliferation [39] and by subsequent phagocytosis of excess neural precursor cells [40]. At least one study directly implicates fetal microglia in mediating interneuron deficits during MIA [37]. Less is known about the role of BAMs during MIA, although recent evidence suggests they play a significant role in propagating MIA-induced inflammatory signaling at the embryonic choroid plexus [36]. Critically, fetal microglia and BAMs have never been examined during IAV-induced maternal inflammation. We hypothesized that maternal IAV infection would lead to notable shifts in fetal microglia and BAM phenotypes concomitant with disrupted neocortical development.To test these hypotheses, we used an established rodent model of gestational viral infection with mouse-adapted IAV [24]. By comparing moderate and high IAV challenge doses in pregnant dams during peak innate and adaptive immunity (2- and 7-days post inoculation (dpi), respectively), we demonstrate that a maternal infection severity threshold exists for the onset of fetal brain abnormalities. Furthermore, while high-dose IAV induced fetal cortical abnormalities and increased the number of BAMs and brain-resident macrophage phagocytic capacity, IAV infection failed to increase circulating levels of maternal IL-17A and did not induce a pathogenic intestinal TH17 cell phenotype. These findings indicate that gestational IAV infection leads to aberrant fetal cortical development in the absence of upregulated levels of maternal IL-17.Materials and methodsAnimalsSingly housed male and pair-housed nulliparous female C57BL/6NTac mice obtained from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY) at 9-to-10 weeks old were acclimated to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign animal facilities for a minimum of one week. Following acclimation, mice were trio-bred for 2-to-4 days. The presence of a vaginal plug was designated as gestational day (GD)0.5. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle, and body weights were recorded daily. A total of 60 pregnant dams across five biological replicates were used to examine tissues at 2 dpi (GD11.5). 29 pregnant dams across three biological replicates were used to examine tissues at 7 dpi (GD16.5). A separate cohort of 10 pregnant dams was used for bulk RNA-sequencing of the fetal brain at 7 dpi. All animal research was approved by and performed in accordance with The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.Influenza A viral inoculationMouse-adapted IAV (subtype H3N2, strain X31) was provided by Dr. Jacob Yount at The Ohio State University. On GD9.5, pregnant dams were randomly assigned to infected or control groups. Murine infection at GD9.5 approximates the end of the first trimester in humans [41], a time when the risk of IAV infection leading to aberrant offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes is high [7]. They were then anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane before intranasal inoculation with either a moderate dose of 103 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) IAV (X31mod) or a high dose of 104 TCID50 IAV (X31hi) in sterile saline. Control animals were inoculated with sterile saline (Con). Across three biological replicates at 2 dpi, 13 pregnant dams served as controls, 14 were inoculated with X31mod, and 12 were inoculated with X31hi. An additional two biological replicates at 2 dpi were used for colonic flow cytometry analysis, and 7 pregnant dams served as controls, 7 were inoculated with X31mod, and 7 were inoculated with X31hi. Across three identical replicates at 7 dpi, 10 pregnant dams served as controls, 9 were inoculated with X31mod, and 10 were inoculated with X31hi.Tissue collectionTissues were collected and examined at either 2 or 7 dpi. Pregnant dams were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and tissues were excised under sterile conditions. Maternal whole blood was obtained through blind cardiac puncture and subsequently centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Maternal serum was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Dams whose tissues were used for immunohistochemistry at 2 dpi were transcardially perfused with 25 mL sterile saline following blood collection. The uterus was removed from the dam and placed in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH = 7.4; PBS), then placentae and fetuses were separated and cleaned. Fetuses were immersion fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and stored at 4 °C. The ileum and right lung were collected from each pregnant dam and snap frozen on dry ice before storing at −80˚C until further processing. The left lung was immersion fixed in 10% NBF and stored at 4 °C until histopathology processing. Maternal colon length was measured before collection. The colon was then snap frozen and stored at −80 °C or placed in ice cold media for further processing (see section “Flow cytometry”).Lung histologyDam lung tissue was processed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Tissues were paraffin-embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Slides were evaluated by a board-certified veterinary comparative pathologist, Dr. Shih-Hsuan Hsiao, who was blinded to treatment groups. Semi-quantitative scoring of lung histopathology was performed using a rubric from previously published scoring methods [42]. The following lesions were independently scored for each sample: bronchitis, interstitial inflammation, edema, endothelialitis, pleuritis, and thrombus formation. Each lesion type was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 (0: absent, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: very severe). The total histopathological score is expressed as the sum of scores for all parameters with a maximum score of 24.Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent per the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Catalog no. 15-596-026). RNA integrity and concentration were determined using the Nanodrop Nd-8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Four micrograms of cDNA per sample was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Catalog no. 43-688-13) and Mastercycler Pro Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf) and was subsequently diluted 1:5 in DEPC water. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Catalog no. A46111). Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method against housekeeping genes (for mouse cDNA) or total Eubacteria (for microbial DNA) and presented as relative expression compared to control. Rplp0 and Hprt1 were used as housekeeping genes for mouse ileal and lung cDNA, respectively, and did not differ between treatment groups (p-value = 0.94, p-value = 0.28, respectively). Custom primer information is listed in Supplementary Table S1 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA).Protein immunoassaysProtein was isolated using Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (T-PER) per the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Catalog no. 78510). Protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. PI23225) and read on BioTek ELx800 Microplate Reader (Agilent). Serum samples were analyzed using LEGENDplex MU Inflammatory Panel (13-plex) per the manufacturer’s protocol (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, Catalog no. 740446). All samples were run on the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed on Qognit software (San Carlos, CA).ImmunohistochemistryUpon tissue collection, embryonic day (E)11.5 fetuses and E16.5 fetal heads were immersion-fixed in 10% NBF for 24 h at 4 °C. They were then decanted and washed twice in PBS followed by immersion in 30% sucrose solution with sodium azide for at least 48 h at 4 °C. E16.5 brains were dissected from heads after fixation and cryoprotection; E11.5 fetuses were kept whole. Cryoprotected tissue was embedded in OCT tissue-tek (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. NC9159334) and stored long-term at −80 °C. 60 µm sagittal sections of E11.5 fetuses and 25 µm coronal sections of E16.5 fetal brains were cryosectioned. Free-floating batch staining was performed for each staining configuration. Sections were washed three times in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. PRH5152; PBST) for 5 min each time and subsequently incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum [R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, Catalog no. S13110], 1% bovine serum albumin [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 126609100GM], 0.3% Triton-X 100 [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. ICN19485450] in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. For stains with a mouse host, sections were blocked with Mouse-on-Mouse IgG Blocking Solution for 1 h at room temperature (1:30; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. R37621). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies—rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000; Wako Chemicals U.S.A, Richmond, VA, Catalog no. 019-19741), rat anti-CD206 (1:1000; Biorad, Hercules, CA, Catalog no. MCA2235GA), rat anti-Ki67 (1:500; Invitrogen, Catalog no. 14-5698-82), rat anti-CD68 (1:1000; Biorad MCA1957GA), rabbit anti-TBR1 (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK, Catalog no. ab183032), or mouse anti-SATB2 (1:300; Abcam, Catalog no. ab51502). Sections were washed three times in PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies—Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, Catalog no. 111-585-003), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG H&L (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalog no. 112-545-003), or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (1:400; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. A-11001)—for 2 h followed by staining in DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. EN62248) for 1 min. Sections were mounted with Fluoromount-G Mounting Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 5018788) and stored long-term at 4 °C.Imaging and image analysisAll images were acquired using a ZEISS AxioScan.Z1 slide scanner with system configurations as follows: Colibri 7 LED light source: 385 nm, 430 nm, 511 nm, 555 nm, 590 nm, 630 nm; Objectives: 5×/0.25 10×/0.45, 20×/0.8, 40×/0.5 Pol and 50×/0.8 Pol; Filter: GFP, DsRed, Cy5, DAPI/GFP/CY3/Cy5, and CFP/FP/mCherry; Camera: Hamamatsu Orca Flash, AxioCam IC (CCD AxioCam IC Color camera) and Hitachi HV-F202SCL. Images were subjected to the same conditions for each staining configuration. Image files were blinded and analyzed using ZEISS ZEN 3.0 Blue software (Oberkochen, DE). Cell counts were performed manually and normalized by whole brain area (mm2) for Iba1+CD206− (microglia), Iba1+CD206+ (BAMs), Iba1+Ki67+ (proliferating Iba1+ cells), and Iba1+CD68+ (phagocytic Iba1+ cells). Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and cell counts were performed using ImageJ on a 300 × 300 µm2 region of interest (ROI) for SATB2 (upper excitatory neurons) and TBR1 (deep excitatory neurons) in E16.5 fetal brains. The ROI was further divided into 10 equal laminar bins, and the signal intensity of each bin was normalized relative to the total signal intensity of the ROI. The location of the primary somatosensory cortex region was determined based on the distance from the retrosplenial cortex relative to the length of the dorsal midline. E11.5 brain regions were identified using Chen et al. (2017) [43] and Kaufman’s Atlas of Mouse Development [44]. E16.5 brain regions were identified using Uta Schambra’s Prenatal Mouse Brain Atlas where coronal 15/16 was used for caudal regions and coronal 10/11 was used for rostral regions [45].Flow cytometryFlow cytometry was performed on 2 and 7 dpi colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) based on previously published methods [46]. The colon was flushed with FACS buffer (2% FBS [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. MT35010CV], 2 mM EDTA [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 15-575-020] in 1 × HBSS [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 14175145]). Mesenteric fat was removed, and the colon was longitudinally bisected. Colons were incubated in EDTA-DTT buffer (2% FBS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Catalog no. 10708984001] in 1× HBSS) at 37 °C, 250 rpm for 20 min to remove epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes. Colons were subsequently incubated in digestion buffer (2% FBS, 50 µg/mL DNase I [Sigma Aldrich, Catalog no. 10104159001], and 62.5 µg/mL Liberase [Sigma Aldrich, Catalog no. 5401127011] in RPMI-1640 [Corning, Corning, NY, Catalog no. 15-040-CV]) at 37 °C, 250 rpm for 45 min. The resulting cells were isolated using a 100 µm cell strainer followed by a 40/80 Percoll (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 45001753) gradient. Cells were resuspended in T cell culture media (10% FBS, 50 µg/mL gentamicin sulfate [Corning, Catalog no. 30-005-CR], 2× GlutaMAX [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 35050061], 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin [Corning, Catalog no. 30002Cl], and 55 µM 2-Beta-Mercaptoethanol [Thermo Fisher Scientific Catalog no. 21-985-023] in RPMI-1640) and counted using Invitrogen Countess Automated Cell Counter and adjusted so there were 1 × 106-2 × 106 cells/100 µl. Cells were then cultured for 3 h in T cell stimulation media (1000 ng/mL PMA [Sigma Aldrich, Catalog no. P1585-1MG], 2 µM Ionomycin [Sigma Aldrich, Catalog no. I0634-1MG], and 2 µg/mL GolgiPlug [BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, Catalog no. 555029] in T cell culture media) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. L34966), Rat anti-mouse CD16/32 Fc Block (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 553142), and surface markers CD4 anti-mouse BB700 (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 566407) and CD45 anti-mouse APC-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 557659). Cells were then fixed and permeabilized using FOXP3 Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 00-5523-00) and stained for intracellular markers RORγt anti-mouse PE-CF594 (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 562684), Tbet anti-mouse APC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 17-5825-82), IL-17A anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (BioLegend, Catalog no. 506910), IL-17F anti-mouse PE (BD Biosciences, Catalog no. 561627), and IFN-γ anti-mouse Brilliant Violet 421 (BioLegend, Catalog no. 505830). Cells were run on the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer. Fluorescence minus ones (FMOs) were used daily for gating. Compensation was done using UltraComp compensation beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 501129040). Flow analysis was done using FlowJo (Ashland, OR). Absolute cell counts were calculated as the percent of the gated subset multiplied by the total number of lymphocytes per 100 µl sample.16S sequencingDNA extraction was performed using a QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, Catalog no. 51604) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with slight modifications as previously described [47]. Briefly, 20-40 mg of stool was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in lysozyme buffer (22 mg/ml lysozyme, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton-x, pH 8.0), then bead-beat for 150 s with 0.1 mm zirconia beads. Samples were incubated at 95°C for 5 min with InhibitEX Buffer, then incubated at 70 °C for 10 min with Proteinase K and Buffer AL. Following this step, the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit isolation protocol was followed, beginning with the ethanol step. DNA was quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) using the dsDNA Broad Range Assay Kit.After extraction and DNA quality assurance through gel electrophoresis, library construction was completed using a Fluidigm Access Array system in the Functional Genomics Unit of the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. After library construction, 250 bp of the V4 region of the 16SrRNA gene were amplified and sequenced at the WM Keck Center for Biotechnology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign using an Illumina MiSeq2000. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers 515F (5′-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). PCR reactions were conducted in triplicate and resulting amplicons were pooled.Illumina libraries were generated from the pooled amplicons and paired-end (2 × 250 nt) sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. After sequencing and barcode trimming, raw sequence data (FASTQs) underwent quality control using DADA2, trimming low-quality bases with a cutoff Phred score >30. DADA2 was used for denoising, merging paired-end reads, and inferring amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). ASVs were mapped to SILVA rRNA database version 138.1 with QIIME2. Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon’s Index) were calculated to assess within-sample diversity. Beta diversity metrics (Unweighted Unifrac) were calculated to assess between-sample diversity. Downstream statistical analysis and data visualization were completed with MicrobiomeAnalyst. Taxa abundance data were filtered as follows: minimum count = 4, prevalence in samples = 20%, and percentage to remove = 10%. Data were then transformed using the centered log-ratio (CLR) method to mitigate compositional biases and improve interpretability. Negative binomial regression models were employed to explore relationships between dam influenza status and the gut microbiome.Bulk RNA sequencingRNA from pooled E16.5 fetal whole brains was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Catalog no. 74004). RNA quality and integrity were then determined by 28S/18S rRNA analysis with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. All samples scored an RNA Quality Number over 7 indicating little to no signs of degradation (Fig. S1A). RNA sequencing was performed at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit with an average fragment length of 100 bp. Libraries were pooled and quantified using qPCR and were then sequenced on one S Prime (SP) lane for 101 cycles from one end of the fragments on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). FASTQ files were generated from the raw sequencing runs and demultiplexed with the bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina). Adapters were trimmed from the 3′-end of the reads, and FASTQC v0.11.8 indicated no adapter sequence contamination and average per-base quality scores over 30 in all samples (Fig. S1B).All reference files were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) ftp site. The Mus musculus H3N2 transcriptome file “GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_rna.fna.gz; influenza_A_X-31_H3N2_rna.fa” from NCBI Annotation 109 was used for quasi-mapping and count generation. This transcriptome is derived from genome GRCm39 (Mouse); A/X-31(H3N2). Since the quasi-mapping step only uses transcript sequences, the gene model file “GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.gff.gz; influenza_A_X-31_H3N2.gff3” was used to generate transcript-gene mapping table (“trx_Egids_GRCm39_annot109.txt”) for gene-level counts. Our raw sequencing data can be found at GEO (accession no. GSE262291).Salmon version 1.4.0 was used to quasi-map reads to the transcriptome and quantify the abundance of each transcript. The transcriptome was first indexed using the decoy-aware method in Salmon with the entire genome file “GCF_000001635.27_GRCm39_genomic.fna.gz; influenza_A_X-31_H3N2_genes.fa” as the decoy sequence. Then quasi-mapping was performed to map reads to the transcriptome with additional arguments –seqBias and –gcBias to correct sequence-specific and GC content biases, –numBootstraps=30 to compute bootstrap transcript abundance estimates, and –validateMappings to help improve the accuracy of mappings. Gene-level counts were then estimated based on transcript-level counts using the bias-corrected counts without an offset method from the ‘tximport’ package in R. The percentage of reads mapped to the transcriptome for all samples was between 70-80% (Fig. S2A). Normalization of samples was between 0.97-1.03 using the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method (Fig. S2B). Remove Unwanted Variation (RUV) analysis was performed on the data. RUV is a method to estimate factors that can be added to the statistical model (co-variates) assuming that these factors are spurious technical variations in the samples and not biologically related. Additional normalization using RUV is often necessary for RNA-Seq experiments and helps to improve biological insights [48]. Clustering after RUV removal was done using the limma package in R (Fig. S2C). The limma-trend method was used to find differentially expressed genes using a model of ~ treatment + 4 RUV factors [49]. P-values of differentially expressed genes were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction for false discovery (p < 0.1). The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to find the top ten significantly enriched up and downregulated Gene Ontology (GO) pathways. Independent qPCR of six biologically relevant genes was used to validate RNA-seq findings (Fig. S2E, F).StatisticsDam was treated as the experimental unit for all outcomes, and one randomly selected fetus per litter was used for each experimental outcome. An a priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power v3.1.9.6 for sample size estimation based on data from IL-6 serum with an effect size F = 0.86. With a significance criterion of α = 0.05 and power = 0.80, the minimum sample size needed with this effect size is N = 18, and our minimum obtained sample size was N = 21. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 Software (San Diego, CA) with significance set at alpha = 0.05 unless otherwise specified. Dam body weights across time were analyzed using repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse correction for sphericity and Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. Con, X31mod, and X31hi groups were compared using one-way ANOVA assuming Gaussian distribution and homogeneity of variance of residuals, and Tukey correction for multiple comparisons was used. For data with unequal variance, Brown-Forsythe ANOVA was performed with Dunnet T3 correction for multiple comparisons. For non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was performed with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons. Kruskal-Wallis was used in the case that residuals did not meet normality or homogeneity of variance. Outliers were identified and removed using the ROUT method with Q = 1%.ResultsRespiratory IAV infection leads to maternal inflammation at the site of infection and systemically in a dose- and time-dependent mannerTo capture the complete immune response, we evaluated pregnant dams and fetuses at 2 and 7 dpi to approximate the peak of both innate and adaptive anti-viral responses, respectively [50, 51]. We previously reported that fetal brain neuroinflammatory transcripts are unaltered by inoculation with a moderate infectious titer of IAV (X31mod) [24]; thus, we included an additional high infectious titer (X31hi) in the current study (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the infectious dose of IAV impacts maternal symptomology and pathology, dam body weights were monitored daily (Fig. S3), and anti-viral immune response was examined in the lungs and systemically. Dam body weight gain per day was significantly decreased from 2-to-7 dpi in X31hi dams whereas X31mod dams exhibited a decrease in body weight gain per day only at 6 dpi (Fig. 1B). Both moderate- and high-dose dams demonstrated a spike in body weight gain per day at 5 dpi followed by a subsequent dip at 6 dpi, which could indicate a potential shift from innate to adaptive immunity [51]. IAV infection did not affect litter size or number of fetal resorptions at either time point, which is consistent with our previous findings [24] (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of viral RNA was confirmed in infected maternal lungs, although there was no difference in gene expression between high and moderate doses (Fig. 1C). The lack of change in viral RNA between infected groups was expected as the initial viral dose is not indicative of viral load or symptomology [52,53,54]. Histopathological scoring of H&E-stained maternal lungs showed increased total lung lesion scores regardless of viral dose (Fig. 1D-E). Specifically, scores for bronchitis, interstitial inflammation, and endothelialitis were upregulated throughout the infection (Supplementary Table S3). Genes encoding for classic pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were upregulated in the lungs in a dose-dependent manner at 2 dpi (Fig. 1F). Only Il1b remained elevated at 7 dpi (Fig. 1G, Supplementary Table S4). Type II antiviral interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) was upregulated in X31hi dams only during acute infection (Fig. S4A). Type I and type II interferons were downregulated in IAV-infected lungs at 7 dpi, which is consistent with prior kinetic studies of IAV-X31 [55] (Fig. S4B). We then evaluated IL-17 expression in the lungs. Elevated IL-17 signaling during IAV infection is shown to cause acute lung injury while also playing a protective role against secondary bacterial infections [56, 57]. In line with these findings, we observed an increase in Il17f at 2 dpi (Fig. 1H) and an increase in Il17a and Il17f at 7 dpi in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1I).Fig. 1: Respiratory IAV infection alters maternal lung inflammation and circulating cytokines in a dose- and time-dependent manner.A Experimental schematic. B IAV inoculation at GD9.5 suppressed body weight gain per day from 2-to-7 dpi in X31hi dams only (repeated measures 2-way ANOVA, the main effect of time = p < 0.001; * = Con vs X31hi, & = X31mod vs X31hi, + = Con vs X31mod). C The presence of IAV-X31 in lungs at 2 and 7 dpi was evaluated using qPCR with a cycle threshold of ≤ 30 cycles as confirmed infection (dotted line). D Quantification of H&E pathological scoring showed elevated lung lesion scores in infected dams. The scoring criteria are listed in the methods with additional scoring values in Supplementary Table S3. E Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung sections. Asterisks (*) indicate bronchi filled with clusters of neutrophils with cellular debris, and arrows (→) indicate arterial and venous endothelia with rolling neutrophils. Genes encoding for classic pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in maternal lungs were F upregulated in a dose-dependent manner at 2 dpi whereas G only Il1b was upregulated at 7 dpi. IL-17 genes were upregulated in the maternal lung at H 2 and I 7 dpi in a dose-dependent manner. Maternal cytokines in circulation at J 2 and K 7 dpi. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was upregulated in moderate- and high-dose dams proportional to dosage at both time points. IL-17A was not upregulated in circulation at either endpoint. IAV = influenza A virus, GD = gestational day, dpi = days post-inoculation, Con = saline control, X31mod = IAV-X31 103 TCID50, X31hi = IAV-X31 104 TCID50. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons. For data containing residuals with unequal variance, Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post hoc multiple comparisons was used. For non-parametric data, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons was used. Data are means ± SEM; one symbol = p < 0.05, two symbols = p < 0.01, three symbols = p < 0.001; dots represent individual dams; n = 9–14 per treatment group. See Supplementary Tables S3–5 for complete statistical analysis of all data collected for this figure (individual mean ± SEM per group, p-values, hypothesis test used, and test statistic).Full size imageTo evaluate the systemic impacts of IAV across viral replication, we measured maternal serum cytokine concentrations (Supplementary Table S5). IL-6 was upregulated in a dose-dependent manner at 2 and 7 dpi (Fig. 1J, K). Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 differed across groups at 2 dpi (Fig. S4C, D). IFN-γ and IL-23–a cytokine required for the commitment and propagation of TH17 cells [58]–were also upregulated in a dose-dependent manner at 7 dpi (Fig. S4D). Notably, IL-17A was not upregulated at either time point (Fig. 1J, K), which differs from poly I:C-induced MIA studies showing an elevation of IL-17A in maternal circulation [29, 30]. However, this is consistent with a lack of elevated IL-17A in the serum of IAV-infected male mice [33].Respiratory IAV infection disrupts maternal intestinal immunity in a dose- and time-dependent mannerWe evaluated the maternal intestines to determine if alterations in TH17 cells are present during gestational IAV, similar to poly I:C-induced MIA [29, 30], and if these TH17 cells transition to a pathogenic phenotype, similar to IAV-infected male mice [33]. At 2 dpi, high-dose dams exhibit colonic shortening, which persists out to 7 dpi, a finding that has been found in previous mouse models of IAV [24, 33] (Fig. 2A). Colonic shortening is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation and colitis [59]. Furthermore, while fewer TH17 cells reside in the colon compared to the small intestine, colonic TH17 cells are more susceptible to developing pathogenic phenotypes [34, 60]. Therefore, we decided to phenotype colonic lamina propria TH17 cells in IAV-infected dams (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table S6). CD45+CD4+ lymphocytes were gated on markers for homeostatic TH17 (RORγt, IL-17A, IL-17F), TH1 (Tbet, IFN-γ), and pathogenic TH17 (RORγt, Tbet, IFN-γ,IL-17A) cells [34, 61]. We observed a downregulation in the percentage of IL-17F+ and IL-17F+RORγt+ colonic T cells from X31hi dams at 2 dpi (Fig. 2C). This finding persisted into 7 dpi with an additional decrease in RORγt+ and IL-17A+RORγt+ T cells (Figs. 2D, S5A). When quantifying absolute cell count, we observed no differences at 2 dpi and downregulation in RORγt, IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-γ and double positive RORγt cells at 7 dpi (Fig. S4E, F, Supplementary Table S6). Therefore, not only are the relative percentages of TH17 cell populations downregulated, but so are the absolute cell counts with respect to the total lymphocyte population. Further gating on CD45+CD4+RORγt+ and CD45+CD4+Tbet+ T cells revealed downregulation in classic TH17 (IL-17F+) cells at 2 and 7 dpi and no changes in classic TH1 cells, respectively (Fig. S5B–E). Additionally, there was no evidence to indicate an increase in pathogenic colonic TH17 cells when gating for RORγt+Tbet+ and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ double-positive cells (Fig. S5F, G).Fig. 2: Respiratory IAV infection dysregulates maternal intestinal immunity in a dose- and time-dependent manner.A IAV reduced colon length in high-dose dams as early as 2 dpi, and this persisted at 7 dpi. B Example flow cytometry gating for colonic LPLs. Gating on CD45+CD4+ T cells in the colon revealed C downregulation of IL-17F+ and IL-17F+RORγt+ T cells at 2 dpi which persisted into D 7 dpi in addition to downregulation of RORγt+ and IL-17A+RORγt+ T cells. qPCR of the ileum, the terminal end of the small intestine, confirms findings in the colon where E little changes were observed at 2 dpi and F downregulation in Il17a and Il17f was seen at 7 dpi. Notably, Rorc transcription did not coincide with decreased RORγt protein expression. G Relative gene expression via qPCR showed a decrease in SFB, a bacterial regulator of TH17 cells, in the colon contents of high-dose dams at 7 dpi. IAV = influenza A virus, dpi = days post-inoculation, LPL = lamina propria lymphocytes, Con = saline control, X31mod = IAV-X31 103 TCID50, X31hi = IAV-X31 104 TCID50, SSC-A = side scatter-area, FSC-A = forward scatter-area. Groups were compared with one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons. For data containing residuals with unequal variance, Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post hoc multiple comparisons was used. For non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons was used. Data are means ± SEM; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001; dots represent individual dams; n = 7–14 per treatment group. See Supplementary Tables S6–7 for complete statistical analysis of all data collected for this figure (individual mean ± SEM per group, p-values, hypothesis test used, and test statistic).Full size imageTo determine if the downregulation of IL-17 was specific to the colon, we looked at gene expression in the ileum of the small intestine, which is where the majority of homeostatic TH17 cells reside [62, 63] and the typical intestinal region of interest in MIA studies [28, 29]. qPCR of the ileum revealed a similar pattern to colonic flow cytometry findings: no transcripts differed at 2 dpi whereas both Il17a and Il17f decreased in the IAV groups at 7 dpi (Fig. 2E, F). There was also a decrease in ileal Il22, another cytokine produced by TH17 cells (Supplementary Table S7). Contrastingly, transcription of Rorc, the gene encoding for TH17 cell transcription factor RORγt, was upregulated at both time points in high-dose dams only (Fig. 2E, F). We previously observed this same upregulation in Rorc in both the colon and ileum of moderate-dose dams at 7 dpi [24]. Thus, increased transcription of Rorc does not coincide with an increased number of RORγt+ cells in this model. We then looked upstream at TH17-cell priming genes and found upregulation in ileal Il6, downregulation in Tgfb1 and Il1b, and no changes in Il23a at 7 dpi (Supplementary Table S7). Altogether, these data demonstrate that gestational IAV alters intestinal immunity throughout infection despite a lack of viral replication within the intestines (Supplementary Table S7). Notably, it appears that maternal colonic shortening cannot be explained by IL-17-producing TH17 cells in our model of IAV infection.Respiratory IAV infection alters the maternal colonic microbiomeIntestinal TH17 cells rely on segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which regulate the development of homeostatic TH17 cell populations in the small intestine [63]. Some have found that the presence of SFB in pregnant mice is necessary to induce activation of TH17 cells and is also required for neuropathological and behavioral abnormalities in offspring from poly-I:C-induced MIA [28, 30]. Others have recently demonstrated offspring behavioral alterations in the absence of maternal SFB [64]. We observed a decrease in SFB gene expression in X31hi dams at 7 dpi (Fig. 2G), which corroborates what was previously found in the intestinal contents of IAV-infected male mice [33].Intestinal microbial dysbiosis as a characteristic of respiratory IAV infection has been found in both human and animal models [33, 65,66,67]. To evaluate potential microbial disruption, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on the colon contents of control and IAV-infected mice at 2 and 7 dpi. There was no difference between X31mod and X31hi treatment groups when evaluating within-sample diversity (alpha diversity) or between-sample diversity (beta diversity) at 2 dpi (p-and q-value = 0.75; p- and q-value = 0.25, respectively) or 7 dpi (p- and q-value = 0.93; p- and q-value = 0.74, respectively); therefore, X31 treatment groups were collapsed. Alpha diversity was only different at 2 dpi (Fig. S6A) whereas beta-diversity was different at both endpoints (Fig. S6B, C). Taxonomic analysis revealed no differentially expressed bacteria at the genus level when adjusting for false discovery rate (Fig. S6D). However, heat tree analysis verified the upregulation in Bacteroides along with the downregulation of several genus-level microbes associated with the Firmicutes phylum (Fig. S6E, F). A decrease in Firmicutes and upregulation in Bacteroidetes (the phyla Bacteroides falls under) was previously reported in mice with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [66] and in humans with IAV infection [68]. Altogether, these data verify colonic microbial alterations in gestating dams upon exposure to IAV.Gestational IAV infection leads to cortical abnormalities in the fetal brainWe next wanted to see if maternal IAV infection led to cortical abnormalities as previously described in mimetic-induced MIA models [28, 29, 36, 69,70,71,72]. We performed immunohistochemistry on fetal brains at E16.5, as cortical layers are not distinguishable until E13.5 [43] (Supplementary Table S8). We examined the primary somatosensory cortex (Fig. 3A) based on prior MIA studies [71]. We observed a decrease in SATB2+ cells and SATB2 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in fetal brains from high-dose infected dams (Fig. 3B, C), and no changes in TBR1 cell count or fluorescence (Fig. 3D, E), which is consistent with prior studies [29]. Notably, we proceeded with MFI analysis for subsequent measurements since cell counts and MFI are highly correlated (Fig. S7A). SATB2 and TBR1 group differences were apparent in both the right and left hemispheres (Fig. S7B), did not differ between hemispheres (Fig. S7D), and displayed a similar pattern in a more rostral region along the anterior-posterior axis (Fig. S7C). We also saw a dose-dependent decrease in cortical plate thickness (Fig. 3F), a pathological indication of NDDs in humans [73,74,75]. We then divided this somatosensory cortical region of interest (ROI) into 10 equal laminar bins to determine the presence or absence of cortical malformations as previously described [29, 70,71,72]. Significant differences were observed in bins 1, 7, and 8 for SATB2 MFI (Fig. 3G) and bins 3, 9, and 10 for TBR1 MFI in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3H). Overall, these data indicate that prenatal respiratory IAV infection leads to perturbations in fetal cortical development in a dose-dependent manner, providing further support for the existence of an infection severity threshold.Fig. 3: Respiratory IAV infection during pregnancy impacts cortical development in fetal brains from high- but not moderate-dose dams at E16.5, 7 dpi.A Representative images of E16.5, 7 dpi fetal brains stained for SATB2 (green) and TBR1 (red). Close-up images were taken in the right-hemisphere somatosensory cortex in a 300 × 300 µm2 ROI. Top scale bars = 500 µm; bottom scale bars = 100 µm. I–VI in the bottom left image represents cortical layers 1–6, and 1–10 in the bottom right image represents the bins. B, C MFI and cell count per µm2 of SATB2, an upper excitatory neuronal marker, is decreased in the fetal brains of high-dose mothers. D, E MFI and cell counts of TBR1, a deep excitatory neuronal marker, were not statistically different between groups (p-value = 0.10). F Prenatal exposure to IAV-X31 reduced cortical thickness in fetal brains from X31hi dams. Dividing the ROI into 10 equal cortical laminar bins showed altered cortical lamination in G SATB2 bins 1, 7, and 8 and H TBR1 bins 3, 9, and 10 (* = Con vs X31hi, & = X31mod vs X31hi,+= Con vs X31mod).

Groups were compared with one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons. For data containing residuals with unequal variance, Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post hoc multiple comparisons was used. For non-parametric data, Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons was used. Data are means ± SEM; one symbol = p < 0.05, two symbols = p < 0.01; dots represent one representative fetus per litter; n = 9–10 per treatment group. See Supplementary Table S8 for complete statistical analysis of all data collected for this figure (individual mean ± SEM per group, p-values, hypothesis test used, and test statistic).Full size imageBulk RNA sequencing of the fetal brain reveals IAV-dependent transcriptional changes related to synaptic signaling and neuronal developmentSince a high dose of IAV was required to produce cortical abnormalities, and since we did not observe any changes in the 591 neuroinflammatory genes evaluated in X31mod fetal brains from our previous study [24], we performed bulk RNA-sequencing on control and X31hi fetal brains at E16.5, 7 dpi. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 211 differentially upregulated and 173 differentially downregulated genes (Fig. S2D). We then used DAVID to determine the top ten significantly enriched up- and down-regulated GO pathways. Upregulated GO pathways largely corresponded to synaptic signaling (Fig. 4A), and downregulated GO pathways largely corresponded to neuronal and cellular development (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table S9). These top GO pathways are in alignment with GO pathways enriched in human NDDs [76, 77]. Furthermore, a myriad of differentially expressed genes in the selected pathways are candidate genes for NDDs based on the Developmental Brain Disorder Gene Database (DBD) and the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database (Fig. 4C, D, as indicated by * and + symbols, respectively). In contrast to findings from poly I:C MIA models [29], transcription of Il17ra and Il17rc (encoding the receptor complex for IL-17A and F) was unchanged in X31hi fetal brains (adj. p = 0.61 and 0.83, respectively). Furthermore, no transcriptional differences were observed for Il6ra (adj. p = 0.84) or interferon-related genes (Supplementary Table S10).Fig. 4: Bulk RNA-seq reveals genes enriched in neuronal development and synaptic signaling in fetal brains exposed to a high dose of prenatal IAV infection at E16.5, 7 dpi.Top ten significantly enriched A upregulated and B downregulated GO pathways in fetal brains prenatally exposed to a high dose of IAV, quantified by –log (p-value).

IAV = influenza A virus, dpi = days post-inoculation, Con = saline control, X31hi = IAV-X31 104 TCID50, GO = gene ontology. Benjamini–Hochberg’s correction for false discovery (p < 0.1) was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Data are standardized logCPM values (Z score); dots represent one representative fetus per litter; n = 4–6 per treatment group. See Supplementary Tables S9–10 for additional statistical analysis of data collected for this figure.Full size imageThe glutamatergic synapse pathway (GO:0098978) was the most significantly enriched upregulated GO term (Fig. 4A). Excitatory synaptic cell-adhesion molecules, Nrxn1 and Nlgn1, were upregulated. Interestingly, the gene encoding for excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 (Shank3; adj. p = 0.09) was downregulated. This may indicate an imbalance in the development of pre- and post-synaptic terminals during gestational IAV infection. The GABA-ergic synapse pathway (GO:0098982) was also upregulated, as evidenced by upregulation in GABA receptor genes Gabrb3 and Gabra5 (Fig. 4C, Fig. S2E).Nervous system development (GO:0007399) and cell cycle (GO:0007049) were among the most significantly enriched downregulated GO pathways (Fig. 4B). This was evident in the downregulation of genes encoding for proteins related to cortical lamination, like Apc2 and Mdga1 (Figs. 4D, S2F). Apc2 is involved in neuronal migration and axonal projection [78], and Mdga1 plays a role in upper excitatory neuronal migration [79]. Genes responsible for proper embryonic neuronal migration and development including Aspm [80], Cdk1 [81], and Cks2 [82]—each of which are also involved in cell cycling—were also downregulated (Fig. 4D). Notably, expression of Satb2 and Tbr1 was unchanged (adj. p = 0.61 and 0.49, respectively); however, transcription of nuclear genes does not always equate to translation. Overall, these data indicate that gene pathways related to synaptic signaling and neuronal development are among the most dysregulated in the developing brain following prenatal exposure to a high dose of IAV.Gestational IAV infection alters embryonic brain-resident macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent mannerWhile some genetic mutations may underly cortical malformations [83, 84], exactly what leads to perturbations in neocortical development during prenatal inflammation remains undetermined. Several studies implicate fetal microglia in MIA-related pathology [35, 40, 85,86,87,88]. Here, we hypothesized that an IAV immune insult would redirect microglia from their normal neurotrophic support functions, leading to neocortical abnormalities. To differentiate between microglia and BAMs, we co-stained fetal brain sections with CD206 and Iba1 at E11.5 and 16.5 (Fig. 5A, F, Supplementary Table S11). We observed no differences in number of microglia (CD206-Iba1+) across the whole brain at 2 (Fig. 5B) or 7 dpi (Fig. 5D). When assessed within and across specific fore-, mid-, and hind-brain regions (E11.5; Fig. S7E) or between the left and right hemispheres (E16.5; Fig. S7F), microglia density remained unchanged.Fig. 5: Border-associated macrophages but not microglia are upregulated in fetal brains from high-dose IAV dams.A Representative sagittal sections of the E11.5 fetal brain stained with Iba1 (red) and CD206 (green). Microglia are Iba1+CD206- and BAMs are Iba1+CD206+. Left scale bar = 1000 µm; right scale bar = 100 µm. There were no changes in B microglia or C BAM count per mm2 at E11.5, 2 dpi. While there were no changes in D microglia count, E BAM count was upregulated in E16.5, 7 dpi fetal brains exposed to a high dose of IAV. F Representative coronal sections of the meninges and choroid plexus from each treatment group of Iba1 and CD206 co-stained E16.5 fetal brains. Scale bars = 100 µm. G, H Separation of choroid plexus and meningeal BAMs showed that only G meningeal BAMs were increased at 7 dpi. I Evaluation of E16.5 brain macrophage proliferation via Ki67 and Iba1 co-staining revealed no changes in double-positive cells in the J whole brain, K parenchyma, L meninges, or M choroid plexus. Arrows = representative co-staining; scale bars = 100 µm. IAV = influenza A virus, dpi = days post-inoculation, E = embryonic day, MFI = mean fluorescence intensity, T = telencephalon, D = diencephalon, MS = mesencephalon, MT = metencephalon MY = myencephalon, Con = saline control, X31mod = IAV-X31 103 TCID50, X31hi = IAV-X31 104 TCID50. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc for multiple comparisons. For data containing residuals with unequal variance, Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett T3 post hoc multiple comparisons was used. Data are means ± SEM; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; dots represent one representative fetus per litter; n = 9–14 per treatment group. See Supplementary Table S11 for complete statistical analysis of all data collected for this figure (individual mean ± SEM per group, p-values, hypothesis test used, and test statistic).Full size imageLittle is known about BAMs under homeostatic conditions, and even less is known about their function during embryonic development [89]. However, these transcriptionally distinct macrophages migrate from the yolk sac around the same time as microglia and take up residence at the brain’s borders [90, 91]. Therefore, it is possible they also play a role in neuronal development. In line with this hypothesis, we observed an increase in BAMs (CD206+Iba1+) in fetal brains from X31hi dams (Fig. 5E), which manifested at 7 dpi but was not apparent at 2 dpi (Fig. 5C, S7G). This observation was not restricted to a specific hemisphere (Fig. S7H). Previous studies have found increased trafficking of BAMs into the embryonic choroid plexus (ChP) during MIA [36]. While we did not observe a difference in the number of ChP BAMs (Fig. 5H), numbers of meningeal BAMs were significantly increased in fetal brains from high-dose IAV dams (Fig. 5G). Interestingly, Mrc1, the gene encoding for CD206, was not altered in our RNA sequencing dataset (adj. p = 0.88).We then assessed whether or not prenatal IAV infection altered the proliferative and/or phagocytic capacity of brain-resident macrophages (Iba1+ cells), as seen in other MIA models [35, 36, 88, 92]. Cell proliferation, as measured by co-expression with nuclear Ki67 (Fig. 5I), was not altered in the whole brain at E16.5, 7 dpi (Fig. 5J). No changes were found when the brain was further partitioned into parenchymal, meningeal, and choroid plexus Iba1+Ki67+ brain macrophages, which serve as an approximation of microglia, meningeal BAMs, and ChP BAMs, respectively (Fig. 5K–M) [36]. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of Ki67-positive staining did not differ, indicating that overall cell proliferation was unchanged by prenatal IAV infection (Supplementary Table S11).In contrast, phagocytic capacity, as measured by Iba1+ co-expression with lysosomal CD68 (Fig. 6A), was increased in X31hi fetal brains at E16.5 (Fig. 6B, C; represented by total double-positive cell counts per area and as a percentage of single-positive Iba1 cells). Analysis of Iba1+CD68+ cell numbers in the parenchyma and meninges revealed no differences across the three treatment groups (Fig. 6D, F); however, independent t-tests comparing Con and X31hi indicate high-dose IAV-induced increases in CD68 co-expression only in the meninges (Fig. S7I, J). Interestingly, overall counts of Iba1+CD68+ BAMs increased in the choroid plexus (Fig. 6H) despite no difference in the abundance of Iba1+CD206+ BAMs (Fig. 5H). To determine whether these observations were due to increased overall cell number versus phagocytic CD68 expression, we evaluated double-positive cells as a percentage of single-positive Iba1 cells. Comparison of parenchymal Iba1+ cells across three treatment groups did not reach significance (Fig. 6E), while independent t-tests comparing Con and X31hi groups indicate high-dose increases in the percent of Iba1 cells positive for CD68 (Fig. S7I). Conversely, meningeal Iba1+ cells did not differ in CD68 expression (Figs. 6G, S7J), indicating the Iba1+CD68+ increase is likely due to elevation in overall numbers of meningeal BAMs as seen in Fig. 5G. Lastly, the increase in Iba1+CD68+ choroid plexus BAMs does not coincide with elevated CD68 expression as a percentage of Iba1+ cells (Figs. 6I, S7K). Further investigation is needed to determine whether this discrepancy reflects a biologically relevant feature of Iba1+ cell distribution in the embryonic ChP following IAV infection. Overall, these data demonstrate consistent changes in BAM numbers and potential phagocytic capacity in the developing brain during late-stage IAV infection, with few changes in resident parenchymal Iba1+ microglia.Fig. 6: Brain-resident macrophages exhibit elevated levels of phagocytic markers in fetal brains from high-dose IAV dams.A Representative coronal sections of E16.5 fetal brains stained with Iba1 (red) and CD68 (green). Scale bars = 100 µm. Brain-resident macrophages (Iba1+ cells) showed increased phagocytic capacity in X31hi fetal brains when evaluating B total counts of Iba1+CD68+ cells per mm2 and C percentage of Iba1+ cells that were also CD68+. D–G Parenchymal Iba1+ cells, which approximate microglia, and meningeal Iba1+ cells (meningeal BAMs) did not demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in phagocytic capacity. H Elevated counts of Iba1+CD68+ choroid plexus BAMs did not persist when evaluated as a I percentage of Iba1+ cells that were also CD68+.

See Supplementary Table S11 for complete statistical analysis of all data collected for this figure (individual mean ± SEM per group, p-values, hypothesis test used, and test statistic).Full size imageDiscussionThe United States has seen a significant increase in the incidence of NDDs over the past two decades [93]. As genetic risk factors comprise a small percentage of NDD etiologies, it is important to evaluate additional risk factors. In the 1990s, S.H. Fatemi and colleagues developed a mouse model of prenatal exposure to a neurotropic strain of IAV to evaluate the epidemiological link between IAV and offspring NDDs [12,13,14]. Since then, the majority of animal studies have used immunostimulants to identify potential mechanisms of gestational maternal inflammation. In this study, we use a non-neurotropic strain of IAV that recapitulates seasonal influenza infections in humans [94]. Critically, our work reveals that an infection severity threshold exists in tissues downstream of the site of infection, which is a concept that is also evident in poly I:C MIA models [95, 96] and reflects differences in disease severity seen in seasonal influenza outbreaks. While IAV dose did not impact maternal lung lesions or viral transcripts, it played a significant role in fetal brain abnormalities, which corroborates our previous findings indicating protection of the fetal brain during moderately pathogenic IAV infection [24]. IAV infection severity also dictated downstream maternal intestinal immune dysfunction, which coincided with mild but significant colonic TH17 cell suppression.IAV infection can trigger adaptive immune responses that arise from a disruption in endogenous microbes, which appear to be at the crux of IAV-induced intestinal inflammation (as reviewed in [97]). Gastroenteritis-like symptoms, such as colonic shortening and shifts in the intestinal microbiome, are often evident during respiratory IAV infection even though the virus does not infect intestinal tissue [65]. Importantly, microbe depletion prior to IAV inoculation has been shown to diminish IAV-induced IL-17A production and intestinal injury [33]. Overall, the evidence suggests that microbial disruption precedes intestinal inflammation during respiratory IAV infection, leading to the differentiation of naïve CD4+ cells into pathogenic TH17 cells [60]. More importantly, infection-induced dysbiosis is a clinically relevant phenotype that is not fully recapitulated in poly I:C MIA models, wherein activation of pre-existing homeostatic TH17 cells, following poly I:C recognition by dendritic cells, precedes poly I:C-induced gut dysbiosis [20, 28, 98]. While our data indicate persistent colonic shortening throughout IAV replication and changes in microbial composition, we observe reduced production of IL-17 and lower numbers of colonic TH17 cells post-IAV infection. Although this suggests a deviation from previously published observations with highly pathogenic IAV strain PR8 [33], it is possible that IL-17 production could be elevated at some point between 2 and 7 dpi in our X31 model, or that the more moderately pathogenic strain X31 does not induce severe intestinal immune shifts comparable to PR8. It is also possible that pregnancy-specific immune responses to respiratory IAV infection (as reviewed in [99]) also lead to a unique intestinal immune phenotype following respiratory IAV infection, although this remains to be tested.In poly I:C-induced MIA models, pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdowns of maternal IL-17A are sufficient to halt the development of offspring cortical patches and behavioral deficits [29]. These studies found that offspring abnormalities are also absent in poly I:C-challenged animals that do not harbor SFB, and thus do not have sufficient populations of TH17 cells to mount an IL-17 response [28, 30]. A recent study contradicted these findings and determined that SFB is not necessary to induce behavioral abnormalities in offspring [64]. Similarly, we observe cortical abnormalities in our model of IAV-induced MIA despite persistent downregulation of intestinal IL-17 responses and SFB transcripts. Notably, while anti-viral IL-17 responses in maternal lungs were within normal ranges for IAV infection, circulating IL-17 levels remained low and did not differ between groups, which is consistent with our previous findings [24] and similar to other IAV studies [33]. This suggests that the alterations in neocortical development observed in our model are inducible via alternative, and potentially IL-17-independent, mechanisms. While further testing is required to parse this out, it is important to note the consistent elevation in IL-6 across maternal tissue types (lung, serum, intestine) in our model. Indeed, the idea that maternal IL-6 mediates offspring neurodevelopmental abnormalities predates the more recent interest in IL-17A. Early poly I:C-induced MIA studies revealed that pharmacological inhibition and genetic depletion of IL-6 prevented certain aspects of behavioral deficits in offspring [21]. Genetic ablation of the IL-6 receptor on placental trophoblasts in poly I:C-challenged dams prevented offspring behavioral abnormalities and neuropathologies [23]. Recent studies further bolster the idea that IL-6 is capable of directly mediating brain development via prenatal programming of synaptogenesis (as seen in mice) and via dysregulation of radial glia (as seen in human brain organoids) [27, 100]. There is also strong evidence documenting the negative effects of anti-viral interferon signaling on placental and fetal development during maternal infection [101]. The type I and II interferon signaling patterns observed in our model may be acting via similar mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible that maternal IL-6 and/or IFN signaling—rather than IL-17—could be driving downstream intestinal inflammation and disrupted fetal neocortical phenotypes in our model.Alterations in neocortical development can have life-long negative consequences for behavior and neural processing, and disordered cortical lamination is common in NDDs [102]. Here, we observed a reduction in superficial SATB2+ neurons in the neocortex of E16.5 fetuses exposed to high but not moderate dose maternal IAV infection. Several mimetic-induced MIA models report the same reduction in fetal SATB2+ neurons and improper cortical layering of SATB2 and TBR1 before the onset of behavioral deficits [29, 70, 72, 103], suggesting that this phenomenon is conserved across disparate models of MIA. The importance of SATB2 can be appreciated when observing patients with genetic mutations and deletions of Satb2. This SATB2-associated syndrome causes a myriad of complications, including autistic-like behavior and speech impairments [104]. Interestingly, influenza vaccination in early pregnancy has been shown to prevent a reduction in embryonic SATB2 in a rodent model of LPS-induced MIA [72]. While it stands to reason that maternal vaccination against IAV before infection would similarly protect against SATB2 abnormalities in our model, this still needs to be tested. Although others have proposed that upregulation of IL-17 receptors on embryonic neurons precedes SATB2 abnormalities [71], we observed no differences in IL-17 receptor transcripts in the embryonic brain. Overall, SATB2+ neurons appear to be conserved cellular targets of maternal inflammation and are likely disrupted through an IL-17-independent mechanism in our model.Our RNA-seq data from X31hi fetal brains bolsters the evidence for altered cortical lamination. For instance, we see a reduction in genes Apc2, Mdga1, and Usp11. Genetic knockout or loss of function studies performed on each of these genes reveal their importance in regulating early neuronal layering in the murine cortex. Knockout of Apc2 leads to improper cortical lamination of TBR1+ neurons at E16.5 [78]. Knockout of Usp11, which encodes a protein responsible for cortical neurogenesis and migration, leads to reduced migration of neuronal progenitors into superficial layers (e.g., reduction in SATB2 in layers II-IV) [105]. Loss of function of Mdga1 indicated that this gene is critical for radial migration of upper layer neurons [79]. Overall, the downregulation of these genes, among others, supports the idea that severe maternal IAV infection disrupts processes related to neocortical formation and neuron migration.As cortical neurogenesis precedes synaptogenesis [38], alterations in cortical lamination are often accompanied by dysregulated synaptic signaling [106, 107]. The observed upregulation in glutamatergic synapse-related genes in our model corroborates evidence from a recent study demonstrating that direct intracerebroventricular injection of IL-6 into the embryonic brain elevates genetic programs of synaptogenesis in cortical glutamatergic neurons [27]. Poly I:C-induced MIA studies also describe upregulated glutamatergic synapse density in cortical upper layer [108] and deep layer [109] neurons. Critically, our data are also in alignment with clinical studies that demonstrate dysregulation in both cortical lamination and synapse development and function (e.g., excitatory/inhibitory imbalance) in patients with NDDs [102, 110]. Future studies are needed to determine whether IAV-induced changes in fetal brain organization and developmental processing persist postnatally and whether they correspond with NDD-related behaviors.We hypothesized that microglia and BAMs would be prime cellular candidates for orchestrating cortical pathologies. At the time of our maternal IAV challenge, yolk-sac-derived microglia are migrating to the embryonic brain where they aid in critical neurotrophic support functions including cortical development [39, 40] and cortical synaptic formation [111]. The role microglia play in NDDs is debated; however, numerous studies report that microglia are impacted by MIA [37, 87, 112]. While our histological analysis of embryonic microglia indicates that their migration patterns and proliferation are not altered by maternal IAV infection, the percent of CD68+ parenchymal Iba1 cells is increased in the high-dose IAV group compared to controls. Overall counts of CD68+ Iba1 cells were also increased across the whole fetal brain, indicating a pro-phagocytic shift in the brain-resident macrophage population. Moving forward, functional assays are needed to confirm whether microglial/macrophage activities are shifted in the immediate days following infection. Indeed, microglial density and proliferative capacity may not directly correlate with phagocytic function nor with the production of neurotrophic or inflammatory mediators, each of which has been shown to modulate critical neurodevelopmental processes (as reviewed in [20]). Furthermore, a limitation of our study is the use of one randomly selected fetus per litter, which does not represent potential within-litter variability or sex differences [113]. While MIA-induced sex differences are most apparent in offspring behavioral outcomes, several studies have also shown sex-specific differences in placental transcripts [114] and in offspring microglial outcomes [115, 116]. Therefore, parsing out sex differences in our model will be an important next step.Interestingly, the dose-dependent increased density of BAMs indicates a macrophage-specific response to IAV-induced maternal inflammation. While BAMs do not infiltrate the brain parenchyma to interact with early neuronal cells like microglia do, they are in direct contact with the periphery and thus play a critical role in immune defense [90, 117]. At least one study demonstrates that poly I:C-induced MIA directly impacts the homeostatic function of embryonic brain macrophages, leading to increases in ChP macrophage populations [36]. These authors propose that an accumulation of macrophages at the ChP and ventricular zone indirectly contributes to the cortical malformations observed in their model, whereby increased recruitment of phagocytes into the brain parenchyma disrupts neural progenitor proliferation at the cortex [36]. Direct examination of this proposed mechanism, however, is still needed. Notably, we observed an increased abundance of CD206+ macrophages in the meninges, concomitant with increased expression of Iba1+CD68+ cells in X31hi fetuses compared to control. Interestingly, despite indications that CD68 expression may also increase in ChP BAMs in high-dose IAV fetuses, overall numbers of CD206+ macrophages did not differ in this region, which contrasts with recent poly I:C findings [36]. To our knowledge, no study has specifically evaluated embryonic meningeal BAMs following maternal inflammation, nor has any study compared BAM subsets in this context. Further work is needed to elucidate the role meningeal and ChP BAMs might play in regulating prenatal neuronal patterning following maternal IAV infection and the mechanisms by which they might fulfill these roles.Taken together, our data suggest that IAV-induced cortical malformations and altered macrophage populations in the embryonic brain arise independently of maternal IL-17 signaling at 2 and 7 dpi. Importantly, we demonstrate that a higher infectious dose of IAV is necessary to induce downstream changes in the maternal intestine and the fetal brain, further bolstering our previous findings [24]. Overall, the discrepancies and similarities we observed between our model of live IAV-induced MIA and models of mimetic-induced MIA highlight the importance of using live pathogens to evaluate the complete immune response and to improve translation to the clinic. Understanding these model differences is critical for effectively delineating translationally relevant NDD etiologies and determining susceptibility and resiliency of offspring to developing NDDs following MIA [118].

Chaphalkar, PhD.Reviewed by Susha Cheriyedath, M.Sc.Jul 2 2024 In a recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers in Alaska, United States of America (US) reported a natural infection of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) or bird flu virus in a young, free-ranging polar bear that was found dead in Alaska in 2023. They highlighted the significance of continued wildlife health surveillance by the community as well as by hunters in the Arctic. Dispatch: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus A(H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b Infection in Free-Ranging Polar Bear, Alaska, USA. Image Credit: Alexey Seafarer / Shutterstock Background First detected in October 2020 in Europe, the HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b virus has since often infected various mammal species globally ever since. In North America, natural bird flu infections have been observed in several bear species, including Asiatic black bears, American black bears, grizzly bears, and Kodiak brown bears. Animals in captivity, including sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and giant pandas, have been reported to contract other influenza A(H1N1) viruses. Additionally, antibodies against H3 and H6 influenza subtypes suggest previous natural exposures to bird flu viruses. Notably, seroconversion has been noted in Barent Sea polar bears and Alaskan brown bears but not in the southern Beaufort Sea polar bears. Interestingly, genome analysis of Alaskan wildlife influenza viruses has both unreassorted and reassorted strains. The HPAI virus genotype A3 was likely introduced into Alaska via the East Asia–Australia Flyway in November 2021. Since then, it has been detected in various wild birds, including California condors in Arizona, and mammals such as red foxes, fishers, martens, raccoons, and brown bears along the Pacific Flyway. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are classified as a threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act. Understanding their health threats is crucial for conservation efforts and developing effective management strategies. In the present study, researchers report the case of a male polar bear naturally infected with the HPAI H5N1 virus that succumbed to the infection. About the study The North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management (NSB DWM) in Alaska researches wildlife health and maintains programs for monitoring the harvest of marine mammals, including polar bears, by the community. The Alaska Office of the State Veterinarian oversees wildlife surveillance for the presence of notifiable infectious diseases. After identifying HPAI H5N1 in birds of prey and a red fox in April 2022, the Office of the State Veterinarian began collaborating with NSB DWM for surveillance testing of avian influenza in birds and other wildlife. Related StoriesCDC identifies new Oropouche virus cases in U.S. travelers, raising public health concernsStudy reveals high effectiveness of flu vaccines in children but highlights challenges with certain subtypesScientists detect replication-competent Oropouche virus in semen of traveler, sparking transmission fearsLocal residents reported finding a dead polar bear near Point Barrow, Alaska, in August 2023. A postmortem examination was conducted. The bear was found to be a 120 cm-long juvenile male in a condition of moderate to advanced decomposition. After a gross examination, tissue samples were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathologic examination. Swab samples were also collected and stored at −50°C. They were processed for routine histopathologic examination with eosin and hematoxylin staining. Swab specimens were tested for the influenza virus matrix gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immunohistochemistry was performed using an influenza A virus polyclonal antibody. Further, molecular confirmation and virus genome characterization were carried out. Results and discussion Gross examination revealed liver and lung congestion, ulcerative skin lesions, sanguinal effusion, cerebral swelling and congestion, and an empty stomach. The major histopathologic findings were granulocytic and mononuclear meningoencephalitis with microgliosis, neuronophagia, vasculitis, neuronal necrosis, and parenchymal rarefaction. Additionally, the researchers identified focal lipid pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and multifocal ulcerative dermatitis. Swab specimens were found to be negative for the influenza virus matrix gene. Despite negative PCR tests, immunohistochemistry detected influenza A virus antigen in neurons and microglial cells. Molecular analysis identified HPAI virus genotype A3, a Eurasian influenza virus. The virus was first detected in Alaska in April 2022 and was the most detected genotype in the region during August–December 2023. Full genome sequences for the virus infecting the polar bear were deposited in GenBank and GISAID (short for global initiative on sharing all influenza data). Conclusion In conclusion, the discovery of HPAI H5N1 in a polar bear indicates the virus's ability to spill over into various mammalian species, emphasizing the need for vigilant monitoring (both community- and hunter-based) of wildlife health to detect emerging pathogens early. The successful detection of the virus through collaborative efforts between wildlife management departments and state veterinarians highlights the importance of integrated surveillance systems in monitoring and responding to wildlife health issues. Since polar bears and other wildlife are integral to the subsistence lifestyle and food security of Indigenous communities in the Arctic, detecting HPAI H5N1 highlights potential zoonotic risks. This calls for strategies to mitigate the impact on traditional food sources and safeguard public health. The findings provide valuable data on the spread and impact of HPAI H5N1 in the Arctic region, contributing to the broader scientific understanding of influenza virus ecology and cross-species transmission dynamics.

In this study, we aimed to identify clinical and host-specific factors that influence the duration of hospitalization and the progression to acute respiratory failure (ARF) in influenza. We performed an analysis of data from a prospective active influenza surveillance study that was conducted over five seasons (2018/19 to 2022/23). A total of 1402 patients with influenza were included in the analysis, the majority of which (64.5%) were children (under 18 years), and 9.1% were elderly. At least one chronic condition was present in 29.2% of patients, and 9.9% of patients developed ARF. The median hospital stay was 4 days (IQR: 3, 6 days). The most important predictors of prolonged hospital stay and development of ARF were extremes of age (infants and elderly), presence of chronic diseases, particularly the cumulus of at least 3 chronic diseases, and late presentation to hospital. Among the chronic diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease were strongly associated with a longer duration of hospitalization and occurrence of ARF. In this context, interventions aimed at chronic disease management, promoting influenza vaccination, and improving awareness and access to health services may contribute to reducing the impact of influenza not only in Romania but globally. In addition, continued monitoring of the circulation of influenza viruses is essential to limit their spread among vulnerable populations.

Many patients with influenza may require hospitalization and even admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)1. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control2 and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention3 have defined a set of patient groups who are at higher risk of unfavorable influenza outcomes, particularly elderly people and persons with chronic conditions. At the same time, a number of influenza-specific severity scores have been developed (IDEAS scale4, FluA-p score5, FLU-PRO6), but most remain underused, as their implementation can sometimes be challenging for the clinician due to the inclusion of either laboratory parameters or a large number of variables. In addition, the spread and impact of influenza virus infection is also influenced by the characteristics of the population (individual and socio-economic) in a given geographical areaegion7,8,9. Furthermore, knowledge of regional data is important to establish appropriate management and tailored strategies to prevent and control potential influenza epidemics or pandemics.Romania experiences a high number of influenza cases each year, and vaccination coverage is low, reported at only 23% among the elderly and 8% among children and healthcare workers in the 2022/23 season10. Understanding the specific characteristics of patients with influenza in this region and identifying risk factors that could potentially be assessed right from the initial medical assessment is essential. This will allow early therapeutic decisions to be made and complications to be prevented in those identified as being at risk.In this context, through a comprehensive analysis of data from active influenza surveillance studies in Romania, we aimed to identify clinical and host-specific factors that influence the duration of hospitalization and progression to acute respiratory failure (ARF) in influenza virus infection.MethodsWe conducted an analysis of data from prospective active influenza surveillance studies conducted at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases "Prof. Dr. Matei Balș" (NIID), Bucharest, over five consecutive seasons. NIID is the largest hospital for infectious diseases (covering children and adults) in Romania and is part of the international influenza active surveillance networks Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) and Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccine Effectiveness (DRIVE, 2018 to 2022).The methodology of the studies together with the patient selection criteria and the protocol for identification of influenza viruses by RT-PCR have been fully described in previously published reports11,12,13,14. In brief, patients hospitalized during an influenza season (usually November–May) for influenza-like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) with symptom onset of 7 days or less and who consented to participate in the study were tested by RT-PCR for the influenza viruses and were followed-up for influenza-related outcomes. Clinical data were collected through a standardized medical questionnaire.We included in the analysis data from all patients hospitalized for influenza, who were enrolled in active influenza surveillance studies over five seasons (2018/19 to 2022/23). Demographic (sex, age), clinical (symptoms of ILI and SARI15), chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, other chronic lung disease, immune disease, rheumatological disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obesity, cancer, chronic liver disease, neurological disease, HIV infection and other chronic conditions) and clinical outcomes (requirement of oxygen supplementation, intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, occurrence of pneumonia) were assessed to identify predictors of length of hospital stay and progression to acute respiratory failure. The following age groups were defined: infant (0–11 months), toddler (1–2 years), preschooler (3–4 years), schooler (5–13 years), teenager (14–17 years), adult (18–64 years), elderly (65 years and over).Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The chi-squared test (χ2) with risk calculation by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was used to analyze categorical variables. Logistic regression tests were used to stratify variables with statistical significance. For continuous variables, the Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check the normality of the distribution. As all our variables were non-parametrically distributed, we present the median and interquartile range (IQR), while differences between groups were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test (U) and the Kruskal–Wallis H test (H). The effect size (r) for the two tests was calculated as described in the literature16. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Prof. Dr. Matei Balș”, Bucharest, Romania. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients or legal guardians, as appropriate, provided written informed consent prior to performing any study-related procedures.ResultsPatient characteristicsA total of 1402 patients with influenza were included in the analysis, the majority of which (64.5%, n = 904) were children (under 18 years), and 9.1% (n = 128) were elderly. The median age was 7.6 years (IQR: 2.6, 33.4 years) and there was a slight predominance of females (52.5%, n = 736).Approximately one third of patients had at least one chronic disease (29.2%, n = 409). In terms of influenza outcomes, 9.9% (n = 139) had ARF requiring oxygen supplementation, and 3.5% (n = 49) required admission to ICU. All characteristics of the patients included in the study are shown in Table 1.Table 1 General characteristics of patients included in the study.Full size tableInfluenza A was the predominant viral type (79.3%, n = 1112), especially the influenza A(H1N1) subtype (38.3%, n = 537). Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were identified in 75 cases (5.3%) (Fig. 1).Figure 1Study chart with distribution of cases by seasons.Full size imagePredictors of length of hospitalizationOverall, the median length of hospital stay was 4 days (IQR: 3, 6 days) and was not influenced by gender (same value for both sexes, p = 0.673), but it varied by age group. Elderly patients required up to 8 days (IQR: 6, 11 days) of hospitalization, whereas infants had a median of 5 days (IQR: 3, 6 days) (p < 0.001, H(6) = 136.6). The distribution of the length of hospital stay by age group is shown in Fig. 2. The median duration of hospital stay for a patient with influenza without complications or risk factors was 2 days (IQR: 1, 3 days), p < 0.001.Figure 2Distribution of the median length of hospitalization by age group. Infants: 0–11 months; toddlers: 1–2 years; preschoolers: 3–4 years; schoolers: 5–13 years; teenagers: 14–17 years; adults: 18–64 years; elderly: 65 years and over.Full size imageClinically, only the presence of dyspnea and deterioration of the general condition at the time of admission were significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay, up to 7 days (IQR: 4, 10 days) p < 0.001 for dyspnea, and up to 5 days (IQR: 3, 7 days) p < 0.001 for deterioration. The other analyzed symptoms did not influence the length of hospital stay (p > 0.05 for each). Admission to hospital more than 3 days after symptom onset was associated with a median length of hospital stay increased to 5 days (IQR: 3, 7 days), p = 0.001.The presence of at least one chronic condition was associated with a median length of stay of 6 days (IQR: 4, 8 days), p < 0.001, while the cumulative association of at least three chronic conditions increased the length of stay to 8 days (IQR: 6, 11 days), p < 0.001. Among the chronic conditions, cardiovascular disease, COPD, obesity, diabetes, cancer, CKD, chronic liver disease, and neurological disease significantly increased the length of hospital stay (Table 2).Table 2 Length of hospitalisation according to patient characteristics.Full size tableThe occurrence of viral pneumonia prolonged the duration of hospitalization by 1.5 days (5.5 days (IQR: 4, 8 days), p < 0.001) and the presence of ARF by 4 additional days (8 days (IQR: 6, 12 days), p < 0.001). Similarly, a longer duration of hospitalization was noted for patients admitted to the ICU (8 days (IQR: 6, 13.5 days), p < 0.001) and in particular those requiring mechanical ventilation (11.5 days (IQR: 7, 19 days), p < 0.001).We found no differences in length of hospital stay according to influenza virus type and subtype/lineage. Among co-infections, only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 had a significant effect on length of hospital stay (Table 2).Predictors of acute respiratory failureA total of 139 (9.9%) patients with influenza developed ARF. This occurred in all age groups, but was most prevalent in the elderly, who had an 8.9-fold increased risk (p < 0.001, χ2(1) = 141.3, OR = 8.9, 95%CI 5.9–13.5) of developing respiratory failure compared with other age groups. The median age of those with ARF was 57.3 years (IQR: 5.3, 71.0 years).Clinically, the presence of dyspnea was the best predictor of progression to ARF (OR = 30.3, p < 0.001). Other symptoms associated with an increased likelihood of ARF were cough (OR = 3.6, p = 0.008) and deterioration of the general condition (OR = 2.8, p < 0.001), while nasal congestion (OR = 0.4, p < 0.001), headache (OR = 0.6, p = 0.018) and odynophagia (OR = 0.5, p = 0.002) decreased the likelihood of ARF if present at the time of hospital admission (Fig. 3, Table 1S supplementary material).Figure 3Probability of predicting progression to acute respiratory failure based on symptoms at hospital admission.Full size imageChronic conditions were strongly associated with ARF. The presence of at least one chronic disease was associated with a sevenfold increase in risk (p < 0.001), while the association of at least three chronic diseases increased the risk 11.5-fold (p < 0.001). COPD, cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity were most strongly associated with progression to ARF. We also observed that late presentation to the hospital, more than 3 days after symptom onset, increased the risk of respiratory failure 2.4 times (p < 0.001; Fig. 4, Table 1S supplementary material).Figure 4Probability of predicting progression to acute respiratory failure based on chronic conditions. COPD—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Full size imageInfluenza B/Victoria cases had twofold lower odds (OR = 0.5, p = 0.019) of progression to ARF compared to influenza A cases (Fig. 4). Conversely, influenza A cases carried higher odds of progression to ARF compared to influenza B (OR = 1.6, p = 0.053). The presence of viral co-infections appeared to more frequently lead to ARF (8.6% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.070); in particular, RSV co-infection was associated with a 3.1-fold increased risk (p = 0.013, Fig. 5, Table 1S supplementary material).Figure 5Probability of predicting progression to acute respiratory failure according to type of influenza virus and co-infections. RSV—respiratory syncytial virus; SARS-CoV-2—severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Full size imageThroughout the 5 influenza seasons analyzed, 12 deaths were recorded in the study group, with an overall case fatality rate of 0.9%. All deaths occurred in adult patients, who had influenza A, and who had developed ARF.DiscussionThrough this analysis of data from prospective active influenza surveillance studies, we aimed to provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay between patient characteristics and influenza outcomes, in order to identify factors influencing length of hospital stay and progression to ARF in patients with influenza in Romania. These results may be useful for the effective management of influenza cases by providing rapid decision support to clinicians.We found a median hospital stay of 4 days, which was reduced to 2 days in patients without risk factors and/or co-infections. In fact, this is the period during which the etiological diagnosis is established, the severity of the disease is assessed, antiviral treatment is initiated, its tolerability is evaluated and, in patients without additional risk factors, a first therapeutic response is achieved, generally with rapid remission of fever and general symptoms. In comparison, the median length of hospital stay at the extremes of age was 5 days for infants and 8 days for the elderly, highlighting the fact that these age groups are disproportionately affected by influenza and drawing attention to the burden on the healthcare system and the patient, caused by a vaccine-preventable disease. Therefore, regardless of the cumulative presence of other risk factors, efforts must be made to increase influenza vaccination rates in these populations. This is of particular importance in Romania where, as mentioned in the introduction, the influenza vaccination coverage for the most recent influenza season (2022/23) was 23% among the elderly10. In contrast, in the United States, the average vaccination coverage for the same age group in the same season was 69.7%17, much closer to the 75% target of the World Health Assembly and the European Council.A number of very interesting results from this study identify the main host characteristics associated with prolonged hospitalization. Of these, the presence of a chronic disease had the greatest impact (median length of stay 6 days), but especially the cumulative presence of at least three chronic diseases (8 days). Specifically, COPD (8 days), CKD (9 days), cardiovascular disease (7 days), cancer (7 days), diabetes (7 days) and obesity (6 days) had the greatest impact on length of stay. It is important to note that these are the most common comorbidities found in patients with influenza but also in the general population. Analysis of data from the 2019/20 season from all GIHSN study centers, which applied the same protocol as our study, identified a prevalence of 28.2% for cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for COPD, 11.8% for diabetes, 6.9% for CKD and 8.7% for obesity across 19 centers with a total of 3021 influenza patients18. Most of these percentages are lower than those found in our study in Romania, which can be explained by the demographic diversity of the populations of the countries included in the GIHSN analysis. Clearly, the health status of a country's population and the prevalence of chronic diseases in that population have an important impact on the clinical outcome of influenza. Public health policies should be aimed at preventing and controlling influenza epidemics while also focusing on preventing and controlling chronic diseases, which are important risk factors for adverse outcomes of influenza, as we have shown in our study. Reducing the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases will modulate the negative impact of influenza, even in the face of a pandemic. In a study from Canada, Kim P. et al. showed that the burden of severe influenza in people over 50 years of age remains significant despite publicly funded vaccination programmes, as long as the prevalence of chronic diseases increases in the same population19.A particularly important finding of our study relates to the precise identification of highly predictive factors for the development of ARF in influenza, namely: older patient age (8.9-fold increased risk), presence of a chronic condition (7.0-fold increased risk) or a combination of comorbidities (11.5-fold increased risk), in particular obesity (6.4-fold increased risk), cancer (6.3-fold increased risk), cardiovascular disease (9.2-fold increased risk), CKD (4.3-fold increased risk) and COPD (13.4-fold increased risk). The excess risk seen in patients with COPD is likely to be multifactorial. On the one hand, influenza is an infectious injury that occurs in the already fragile respiratory system of patients with chronic lung disease and can easily progress to severe forms with respiratory failure. On the other hand, influenza can lead to exacerbation of COPD, with loss of control of the chronic lung disease and the need for adjustment of comorbidity treatment, which is often a lengthy process and prolongs hospitalization beyond the actual influenza episode20. A very important issue to discuss is the impact of obesity on the adverse course of influenza. In a context where the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, including in Romania21, being overweight can be a determining factor in increasing the burden of influenza. It is currently known that obesity is associated with a chronic pro-inflammatory status22, leading to pulmonary meta-inflammation23 with increased alveolar-capillary permeability and decreased epithelial regeneration24, which will lead to the development of ARF and increased length of hospitalization. In addition, it has been observed that obese patients with influenza have a prolonged persistence of viable influenza viruses in the airways, leading to increased infectivity, but also to a greater likelihood of accumulation of mutations in the viral genome25.It is particularly important to understand and be aware of these host-specific risk factors, both for prolonged hospitalization and for severe forms of influenza with associated ARF. It is essential that medical education is provided to these groups of patients, and to the physicians of different specialties who care for them, to make patients aware of their specific risk and thus increase vaccination uptake.Another particularly important element of our analysis is the identification of late presentation to the hospital as a major risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and the development of ARF. The importance of early diagnosis of influenza, with or without specific medical evaluation, correlates with the optimal interval for early initiation of antiviral treatment. In influenza, it is optimal to start treatment within the first 48 h of clinical onset. A study of eight consecutive influenza seasons showed that early administration of oseltamivir within the first 48 h reduced influenza mortality by 31%, including in critically ill patients26. In essence, late diagnosis and late presentation to the doctor miss out on the window of opportunity for this early initiation of antiviral treatment and allow viral and inflammatory damage associated with ARF and other specific complications to set in. It is therefore important to increase the referral of patients with influenza-like symptoms to primary care services for early diagnosis and treatment. It is also important to note that late presentation is not a contraindication to antiviral treatment; on the contrary, treatment should be initiated at any time, as soon as possible after the patient's initial assessment, particularly in severe cases26. A study conducted in France during the 2018/19 season raised a red flag about the misinterpretation of the recommendation for early antiviral treatment in influenza. Specifically, Cizeron et al.27 showed that oseltamivir was prescribed in only 59.9% of patients in their center and, paradoxically, less often in patients with risk factors (50%) than in those without risk factors (70%). Even more concerning was the rate of antiviral treatment administered in only 45.3% of severe influenza cases, and the main element identified by the authors as statistically significantly associated with inadequate prescription of antiviral treatment was late presentation of patients, within 48–120 h (median 72 h)27.When analyzing influenza virus types, length of hospital stay was not significantly associated with any of the viral subtypes in our study, but odds of progression to ARF were higher for influenza A compared to influenza B. Conversely, infection with influenza B/Victoria viruses was associated with lower odds of progression to ARF (OR = 0.5). This may be an artificial finding, potentially due to the fact that 82.5% of the patients with influenza B in our analysis were children, a patient population that generally displays better outcomes of influenza, compared to elderly comorbid patients. This aspect of a predominant circulation of influenza B viruses in the pediatric population has also been observed worldwide28. However, overall, 16.8% of patients with ARF had influenza B, similar to a 6-year report showing that 20% of cases of respiratory distress due to influenza were caused by influenza B viruses29. Cases of respiratory failure associated with influenza B have been described in the elderly30, adults31 and children32 without associated chronic diseases. Therefore, the impact of influenza B should not be underestimated, as cases with an unfavorable outcome may occur even in patients without underlying risk factors. An anatomopathological review by Paddock et al.33 showed that patients who died from influenza B infection, whether or not associated with bacterial pneumonia, had a rapid clinical progression, with approximately half of all patients dying within 3 days of illness onset. Genetic factors may also play an important role in the progression of such cases, which is why the study of host specificities in relation to viral specificities is important in order to understand the pathophysiology of these interactions.Our study analyzes data from active influenza surveillance according to standardized international protocols. However, it also has a number of limitations. First, the period analyzed (2018–2023) overlaps to a certain extent with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on influenza virus circulation and patient access to healthcare services. Second, a large proportion of the patients in our analysis were children. This is partly due to the fact that our institute is the main infectious disease hospital in the region, and many pediatric cases are referred to our hospital. Furthermore, hospitalization of children is also influenced by parental concerns and difficulties in home-based symptom management, and it might not always be a reflection of the true severity of the disease. However, the large number of patients and the extensive data analysis provide information that can easily be used in medical practice, which constitute important strengths of our current study.ConclusionsOur analysis showed that extremes of age (infants and the elderly), the presence of chronic conditions (especially COPD, cardiovascular disease, CKD, obesity, cancer and diabetes) and late presentation to the hospital have a significant impact on the length of hospital stay and the likelihood of developing acute respiratory failure during influenza virus infection. In this context, interventions aimed at managing chronic diseases, promoting influenza vaccination, and improving awareness of and access to health services can significantly contribute to reducing the impact of influenza. In addition, continuous monitoring of influenza virus circulation is essential to limit its spread among vulnerable populations.

It sets out how the PIP Framework Partnership Contribution preparedness funds will be used and aims to improve global influenza pandemic preparedness by guiding capacity building activities over the next six years. The HLIP III has one overall outcome: to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness through a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach that ensures a more equitable, fairer response by building stronger and resilient country capacities.It is supported by four outputs: policy and plans that result in health systems prepared for pandemic influenza;laboratory capacity and resilient surveillance systems are maintained and strengthened through GISRS;strengthened community engagement, knowledge translation and infodemic management capacities for influenza; andstrong regulatory systems and a common approach to timely and affordable access, allocation and deployment of pandemic influenza products that results in a more equitable response.Each output has a corresponding set of deliverables, which are achieved through implementation of activities.The recently released HLIP III monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework serves as an integral companion to the implementation plan. It facilitates technical implementation and monitoring by teams at WHO headquarters, regional offices, and at country offices, and provides a reference guide for all beneficiaries and stakeholders to understand how progress is measured against the HLIP III results hierarchy.The framework includes multiple components to measure progress, performance and impact over time:milestones: activities or events that mark significant progress in achieving the deliverablesindicators: quantitative measurement utilized to monitor progress towards achieving the outputs and outcomestories from the field: real-world experiences, captured through narratives and case studiesmid-term reviewevaluation.To learn more about the framework and how it applies to your work related to pandemic influenza preparedness, you can find the publication here:Monitoring and evaluation framework Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOCDC confirms 4th human case of H5N1 avian flu as more dairy herds in Colorado hit | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

Previous human cases were in Texas (one) and Michigan (two).In a press release emailed to journalists, the CDC said the Colorado patient is a dairy worker who was being monitored because of work exposure to H5N1 virus-infected cattle. "The person reported eye symptoms only, received oseltamivir [Tamiflu] treatment, and has recovered," the CDC said. "Based on the information available at this time, this infection does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low."This infection does not change CDC's current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment.The first two agricultural workers infected in the United States, in Texas and Michigan this spring, also reported eye symptoms. Two more herds in Colorado affectedThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has added two more H5N1 avian flu dairy herd outbreaks to its confirmed list, both in Colorado, raising its total to 139 affected herds from 12 states.Colorado has had the most affected herds in the past 30 days, with 23 herds affected, APHIS said. APHIS also reported H5N1 in 2 more domestic cats since our last report, 1 each in Michigan and Colorado, raising the total to 30 infected cats.A WOAH (World Organization for Animal Health) notification on the Colorado cat, which is from Adams County, says the cat was exhibiting acute respiratory signs but wasn't associated with any known H5N1-affected cattle or poultry premises.As more dairy herds have been infected with highly pathogenic avian flu, researchers from the Food and Drug Administration have continued to sample commercial pasteurized milk and conduct experiments that reassure consumers that the pasteurization process used in the United States inactivates H5N1. It is not yet known if drinking raw milk from an infected cow could pass H5N1 to humans, but mouse studies suggest it is possible.Half of Americans do not understand pasteurization process A new survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center, however, shows that less than half of US adults know that drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk is riskier than drinking pasteurized milk. The survey included 1,031 adults polled from June 7 to June 10. While only 4% of Americans report regularly consuming raw milk products, selling such products is legal in 30 states.One in five Americans (20%) said they are not sure if pasteurization can kill harmful bacteria and viruses. And 4% of those polls said pasteurization is simply not effective in doing so.In the poll, over half of the respondents (54%) think that drinking raw milk is either safer (9%) or just as safe (15%) or are unsure (30%) whether it is more or less safe than drinking pasteurized milk. Pasteurization does not lower the nutritional value of milk, but 16% polled believe that it does destroy nutrients, and 41% aren't sure. Outside of H5N1, raw milk is estimated to cause 840 times more illnesses and 45 times more hospitalizations than pasteurized products, according to the Annenberg Center.It is important that anyone planning to consume raw milk be aware that doing so can make you sick and that pasteurization reduces the risk of milk-borne illnesses."It is important that anyone planning to consume raw milk be aware that doing so can make you sick and that pasteurization reduces the risk of milk-borne illnesses," said Patrick E. Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Health and Risk Communication Institute at the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) at the University of Pennsylvania.Note: This story was updated at 1:40 pm Central Time with information on the human case.

In such markets, AIVs pose threats to both poultry and public health. Within LBMs, AIVs spread through various routes, including direct contact, environmental contamination, and aerosol transmission. Unique factors in Egyptian LBMs, such as the coexistence of wild and domestic birds, increase transmission risks between birds as well as spill-overs into exposed humans. Understanding the transmission dynamics of AIVs is vital for implementing effective control measures. We conducted a study in four Egyptian LBMs located in Mediterranean coast cities from November 2021 to March 2023. In this study we tested 3,971 samples from poultry, wild birds, and the environment, out of which 692 (17.4%) were positive for AIV. Poultry exhibited a higher prevalence (42.2%) than wild birds (34.4%). Environmental samples, including water (30.8%), surfaces (17.2%), and air (18.2%), also tested positive for AIV. Diverse AIV subtypes, including H5N1, H9N2, H5/H9 co-infection, and H5N8, were detected among avian species and the environment. Temporal analysis revealed fluctuating IAV positivity rates from November 2021 to March 2023. These results emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance, resource allocation, and multisectoral collaboration to protect poultry and human health, and prevent novel influenza strains’ emergence in Egyptian LBMs. Similar content being viewed by others Geographical variation in the risk of H7N9 human infections in China: implications for risk-based surveillance Article Open access 25 June 2020 Survey of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses in live poultry markets in Guangxi Province, Southern China, 2016–2019 Article Open access 01 December 2021 Epidemiology and molecular characterization of avian influenza A viruses H5N1 and H3N8 subtypes in poultry farms and live bird markets in Bangladesh Article Open access 16 May 2023 IntroductionAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) are commonly harbored by wild birds and can infect domestic poultry, especially waterfowl in close contact1. In 2020, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) A(H5N1), clade 2.3.4.4b, spread among domestic and wild birds in Europe. An increased mortality in wild birds was observed in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy2. The virus spread to local wild birds and had undergone mutations that increased the risk of human infections. Transmission to poultry was possible as breeding birds migrate inland. HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b transmitted from Europe into North America in late 2021 through Iceland via migratory birds3. In the Americas, the virus spread from Mexico to Southern Chile, mainly affecting Peruvian pelicans2. H5N1 Infections in mammals, likely due to contact with sick birds, were reported including a mass death event of sea lions in Peru. H5N1 infections in humans were reported from Cambodia, China, Ecuador, and Vietnam, and H5N6 infections from China and have caused severe illness and fatalities in humans4,5. The risk of H5 infection was assessed as low to moderate among people exposed to birds in Europe6,7,8. Highly pathogenic AIV (H5N1) was introduced into Egypt in 2005 and became endemic in poultry in 2008. Since then, many outbreaks were reported9. The 2.3.4.4b H5N8 virus was first detected in Egypt in wild birds in 2016 and replaced the clade 2.2.1 H5N1 viruses10.Low pathogenic H9N2 avian influenza viruses typically cause mild disease in birds, often with no or minimal symptoms. However, H9N2 infection can cause a drop in egg production, and infected birds can shed and transmit the virus to other species. Moreover, H9N2 infection can cause high mortality in poultry in case of co-infection with other pathogens. In China, H9N2 viruses became endemic in commercial chicken flocks and dominant in live poultry markets since 201611. Over 100 human cases of H9N2 virus were reported, with more than 50 cases occurring after the COVID-19 outbreak2,12. A seroprevalence rate of 11.2% against H9N2 AIVs among healthy occupational workers was detected in several provinces of China during 2014–201613,14. In Egypt, H9N2 AIV are endemic in poultry and are continuously circulating in LBM despite the use of avian influenza vaccines. Reassortant H9N2 viruses were detected15. Co-circulation of H5 and H9N2 viruses enhances the likelihood of genetic reassortment, which might increase the zoonotic potential.Handling and transporting infected birds in markets contribute significantly to avian influenza transmission. Close contact between humans and infected birds poses risks to market workers and visitors16. Activities like capturing, restraining, and moving infected birds bring humans in direct contact with them. Handling infected birds without proper personal protection and hygiene practices can directly transmit avian influenza viruses to humans. Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza, specifically H5N1 and H7N9 strains, is possible but limited. Live bird market (LBM) settings, where birds and humans closely interact, provide an environment for the virus to potentially adapt and undergo genetic mutations that might improve virus infectivity and transmissibility in humans. This raises concerns about a potential pandemic if the virus becomes easily transmissible between people17.When different bird species come in close proximity, especially in live bird markets selling both poultry and trapped wild birds, there is a higher risk for cross-species transmission of viruses. Co-existence of infected and susceptible birds in markets provides opportunities for the virus to spread and infect new hosts18,19,20. In Egyptian markets, workers face occupational hazards related to avian influenza viruses, including direct contact with infected birds or their bodily fluids, exposure to contaminated surfaces and equipment, and inhalation of airborne particles carrying the virus21,22.We have been conducting routine active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in LBM and migratory wild birds in Egypt since 2009 to monitor influenza viruses with pandemic potential at the human–animal interface and identify the genetic and antigenic characteristics of influenza A viruses that were introduced into Egypt. We reported the first detection of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses in wild birds and domestic ducks from live bird market samples from 2021-2022 in Egypt and showed that the virus could be able to infect and cause disease in mammals9, which required continuous monitoring of AIV in Egypt.Here, we provide an update on the epizootiology and subtypes of AIVs circulating in Egyptian live bird market. We conducted a study in four Egyptian LBMs located in Mediterranean coast cities from November 2021 to March 2023. In this study we tested 3,971 samples from poultry, wild birds, and the environment to understand the transmission dynamics of AIVs and potential environmental contamination.Materials and MethodsAvian influenza surveillanceActive surveillance for AIVs was conducted in four Egyptian live bird markets located in Mediterranean coast cities (Baltim, Damietta, Port-said, and Rasheed) from November 2021 to March 2023. A unique feature of those markets is that trapped wild birds are sold live alongside live domestic poultry. Biosecurity measures in these markets were relatively low, increasing the risk of contact between commercial poultry and wild birds. Each of the LBMs was visited once per month to capture seasonal variations in AIV prevalence, ensure sampling adequacy, enhance detection sensitivity, and optimize resource utilization. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected from domestic poultry and wild birds in a viral transport medium.Environmental sample collectionSample collection was carried out in the slaughter zone and sale zone of LBMs to encompass areas with potential high viral loads and diverse avian interactions. Given the unique dynamics of Egyptian LBMs, where a variety of avian species, including both wild and domestic birds, coexist in close proximity, the choice of surfaces for sampling was crucial. Surfaces such as cages, feeders, and slaughtering tables were selected based on their direct or indirect contact with live poultry. These surfaces represent critical points of interaction between birds and environmental elements within the market, thereby serving as potential fomites for virus transmission. The variation in the number of samples per visit was determined based on the diversity of surface types and their respective exposure to poultry. For instance, surfaces directly in contact with live poultry, such as feeders and cages, were sampled more extensively due to their higher likelihood of harboring viral contaminants. In contrast, surfaces with indirect poultry contact, such as slaughtering tables, were sampled to a lesser extent but still included to assess potential environmental contamination during market operations. This approach allowed us to capture a comprehensive snapshot of environmental viral dissemination within LBMs while optimizing resource allocation and sampling efficiency. In this study, where AIVs are known to spread through various routes, including aerosol transmission, determining the detection limit of the air sampler is crucial for assessing the risk of viral dissemination in the market environment. The ability to detect viral particles at low concentrations allows us to monitor the presence of AIVs in the air, which can serve as an early warning system for potential outbreaks or increased transmission rates within the LBMs.Air sampling was performed with a Coriolis Micro biological air sampler (BERTIN TECHNOLOGIES, France). The cyclonic technology, paired with a high airflow rate of up to 300 L/min, allows reliable virus collection. The detection limit of 100 genomes/m3 refers to the minimum concentration of viral genomes in the air that can be reliably detected using the Coriolis Micro biological air sampler employed in our study. This limit was determined based on the manufacturer’s specifications and performance characteristics of the sampler. The Coriolis Micro sampler utilizes cyclonic technology coupled with a high airflow rate of up to 300 L/min, which enables efficient collection of airborne particles, including viruses.According to the manufacturer’s instructions, a concentration of only 100 genomes/m3 is detectable in samples collected in an infection medium (medium containing 4% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)). A collection cone, pre-filled with an infection medium, is placed on the biological air sampler. Once initiated, Coriolis Micro generates a vortex in the collection cone. Viruses or microorganisms are centrifuged onto the inner walls of the cone and are separated from the air. The sample is then ready for collection in cryovials for RNA extraction. Disinfection was performed by rinsing the collection vessel with water followed by contact with 70% absolute alcohol for one minute and one other water rinse.Sterile swabs were used to wipe different spots in live bird markets. Surface types included cages, feeder (feed holder for poultry to eat from most often a bowl or trough), and tables used during the slaughtering of some poultry to be sold inside the market. Most of surfaces were in direct contact with the poultry, where live poultry could potentially touch the surface (e.g., Feeder or cages), or in indirect contact with the live poultry, (e.g., slaughtering spots). Different surface types were sampled at each market for a total of five samples per visit with the maximum possible amount of exposed surface area (i.e., area exposed to poultry) wiped on each surface (varied for each surface). Individual wipes were placed in vials containing 5 ml of viral transport media and frozen (–80 °C) until testing.Water sampling from waterers in LBMs is crucial due to its potential role in AIV transmission dynamics. Waterers serve as essential sources of drinking water for both domestic poultry and wild birds within LBMs. Given the communal nature of water sources in these settings, they can become reservoirs for AIVs shed by infected birds. Therefore, by specifically targeting waterers, we aimed to capture any potential viral contamination present in these critical environmental reservoirs.Water samples were collected mostly from Waterer (water holder for poultry to drink; most often a nipple waterer or bowl), 5 ml were collected directly from each waterer and five samples were collected per each side and frozen until viral RNA extraction to adequately assess the spatial distribution of AIVs within LBMs. LBMs are dynamic environments where birds move freely and interact with various surfaces. By collecting multiple samples from different locations within each side of the market, we aimed to capture the variability in viral contamination across different areas. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of AIV prevalence and distribution within LBMs, allowing for targeted interventions to mitigate transmission risks.Nasal swabs and hand wipes were collected from market workers to detect any infection in exposed workers after completing written informed consent. Handwipes were collected using 2×2 inch gauze strips saturated with sterile viral transport media. All collected samples were kept on ice until received in the laboratory then stored at -80 °C until use. A total of 1880 bird samples, 1660 human samples, and 431 environmental samples were analyzed. Field data, including sample date and type, species, health status, age, and sex, were recorded. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Research Centre, Egypt and the Institutional Review Board (protocol number 14 155), and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, USA.Sample screening and virus isolationViral RNA was extracted from the original swabs, collected air, water, surface samples, and hand wipes using the MagNA Pure 96 platform and the KingFisher Flex instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rocklin, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA was then tested for AIVs using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for the presence of AIV targeting the universal M-gene23. Samples with a Ct value of 35 or lower were considered positive. Positive samples in the influenza matrix gene rRT-PCR were individually inoculated into the allantoic cavity of specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. The eggs were incubated at 37 °C for 48-72 hours. Allantoic fluid was collected after chilling the eggs at 4 °C overnight and used for a hemagglutination assay (HA) with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes, following the protocols of the World Health Organization (WHO). Samples with positive HA titers were then subtyped and sequenced as previously described24,25.Sample sequencingViral RNA from allantoic fluid was used to synthesize the first cDNA strand through reverse transcription using the SuperScript IV first-strand synthesis kit and the Uni12 influenza primer. Multiplex PCR of all eight gene segments was performed using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase and Uni12/13 primers. The PCR products were purified, and sequencing library preparation was conducted with Illumina’s Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit. The amplicons were then sequenced on Illumina’s MiSeq platform using the paired-end approach. The eight full segments of each H5N8 virus were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench, version 21. To control the risk of PCR contamination, all laboratory procedures were conducted in a dedicated PCR facility with separate workstations, physical barriers were considered, positive and negative controls were used, physical separation of pre- and post-PCR areas, and decontamination protocols were followed.Statistical analysisThe Chi-square test was used to perform statistical comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel built-in functions and tools for basic statistical analyses.ResultsPrevalence of AIVs in LBMs and wild birdsThe distribution of the collected samples and influenza A detection rate within each category are presented in Table 1. The table shows the number and percentage of collected samples that tested positive for Influenza A virus and provides the corresponding p-values to indicate the statistical significance of observed differences. Across various sample types, including avian, environmental, and human, the prevalence of Influenza A virus varied significantly (p < 0.001). The collected samples included 608 oropharyngeal (32.3%) and 608 cloacal samples (32.3%) from domestic poultry intended for human consumption, 332 oropharyngeal (17.7%) and 332 cloacal samples (17.7%) from wild bird species sold in the live bird markets, 197 surface samples (45.7%), 201 water samples from drinking water troughs (46.6%), 33 air samples (7.7%), and 830 human nasal swabs and 830 wipes from individuals working in the market.Table 1 Comparison of Influenza A positivity rate by variable and sample typeFull size tableOut of the 3971 samples analyzed, influenza A virus (IAV) was detected in 692 (17.4%) samples. Out of the 608 oropharyngeal and 608 cloacal poultry samples, 160 (26.3%) and 97 (15.9%) samples tested positive for IAV respectively (p value < 0.001). Additionally, out of 332 oropharyngeal and 332 cloacal wild bird samples collected, 65 (19.6%) and 49 (14.8%) samples tested positive for IAV respectively (p-value < 0.001). It is worth noting that while nearly all samples (99%) were collected from apparently healthy birds, IAV was detected in 17.4% of them. The detection rate of influenza was found to be higher in poultry intended for consumption compared to wild birds (42.2% vs 34.4%, p < 0.001).Regarding environmental samples, 62 (30.8%) out of 201 water samples, 34 (17.2%) out of 197 surface samples, and 6 (18.2%) out of 33 air samples tested positive for IAV (p value < 0.001). From human samples, a total of 113 (13.6%) nasal swabs and 106 (12.8%) hand wipes tested positive for IAV. The p value for this comparison is 0.408, indicating that the difference is not statistically significant.Table 2 provides the total number of AIV-positive samples, subtypes, and isolates presented by different species and environmental samples.Table 2 Number of IAV positive samples, subtypes, and isolates presented by speciesFull size tableBlack-legged kittiwake had two positive samples out of six collected samples, but no specific subtypes or isolates were reported.

Among the analyzed avian samples, the Eurasian golden oriole showed one positive sample out of 14 tested. The Garganey had 36 positive samples out of 178, with three samples identified as subtype H5N1, one sample identified as subtype H9N2, and one isolate of H9N2 subtype. The Mallard duck had six positive samples out of 44, while the Moorhen had 14 positive samples out of 134 collected. The Muscovy duck showed 8 positive samples out of 10, with six samples identified as subtype H5N1. Four isolates of subtype H5N1 were obtained from the Muscovy Duck samples. The Northern shoveler had 33 positive samples out of 156, while the Pigeon had 15 positive samples out of 164, with one sample identified as subtype H5N1. The Northern pintail showed 21 positive samples out of 86, with one sample identified as subtype H5N1. One isolate of subtype H5N1 was obtained from the Pintail samples. The Purple swamphen exhibited 7 positive samples out of 10, while the Ruff had only one positive sample out of 16. The Saker falcon had two positive samples out of 10, with one sample identified as subtype H9N2. One isolate of subtype H9N2 was obtained from the Saker falcon samples. The Turkey had five positive samples out of 10, with two samples identified as subtype H9N2. Two isolates of subtype H9N2 were obtained from the Turkey samples. These findings demonstrate the presence of Influenza A in various avian species, highlighting the diversity of subtypes and isolates circulating in the studied samples.Among the environmental samples, 34 out of 197 surface samples tested positive for Influenza A, with one sample identified as subtype H5N1 and four identified as H9N2; five isolates were obtained (one of subtype H5N1 and four of subtype H9N2). Water samples had 62 positive cases out of 201 with seven samples of H9N2 subtype; four isolates of subtype H9N2 were obtained. Air samples showed six positive cases out of 33.The data obtained from these avian and environmental samples provide valuable insights into the diversity of circulating AIV subtypes and isolates and highlight the environmental contamination by various IAV subtypes across the LBMs.Seasonality of avian influenza viruses in LBMs and environmentsThe monthly positivity rate of IAV in wild birds, poultry, and the environment from November 2021 to March 2023 is presented in Fig. 1. Among wild bird samples, the positivity rate of IAV fluctuated from 0% to 56.9% during the study period. The highest positivity rate was observed in January 2023, while the lowest was recorded in January 2022. No positive samples were detected in April, June, August, September, and November 2022. The positivity rate of IAV in poultry ranged from 0% to 27.4%. The highest positivity rate was observed in June 2022, while the lowest was recorded in October 2022. Positive samples were not detected in April and November 2022. The positivity rate of IAV across environmental samples ranged from 0% to 12.8%. While the highest positivity rate was observed in July 2022, the lowest was recorded in May 2022. No positive samples were detected in April, November, and December 2022. These percentages provide insights about the circulation of influenza A virus in the respective sample types (wild birds, poultry, and the environment) throughout the study period.Fig. 1: Positivity rate of IAV in poultry, wild birds, and environment by month during active AIV surveillance from November 2021 to March 2023 in Egyptian LBM.IAV-positive wild bird samples are represented in pink, IAV-positive poultry samples are represented in green, IAV-positive environment samples are represented in blue, and IAV-negative samples are represented in white.Full size imageAdditionally, data analysis revealed potential transmission routes among poultry, wild birds, and the environment. Periods with relatively high positivity rate of IAV in poultry indicate possible transmission within poultry populations. Similarly, wild birds AIV positivity rate exhibited variability throughout the study period, suggesting potential transmission within wild bird populations.The positivity rate of IAV in water, surface, and air samples also fluctuated, indicating the presence of the virus in the environment and potential environmental contamination. Overall, the findings indicate a fluctuating presence of IAV among poultry, wild birds, and the environment during the specified time period. These results suggest the possibility of viral transmission and circulation among these different sources.Variations of the AIV positivity rates and subtypes among different sample typesThe presence and prevalence of different IAV subtypes are illustrated in Fig.2. The percentage of total avian-positive influenza samples varied across the months, ranging from 1.62% to 14.82%, indicating the presence of viral infection in poultry and wild birds within the market. The percentage of total environmental positive IAV samples varied across the months, ranging from 1.96% to 18.63%, indicating the presence of viral contamination in the market environment.Fig. 2: Percentage of AIV positive non-subtyped and subtyped (H5N1, H5N8, and H9N2) in avian and environmental samples by month during surveillance from November 2021 to March 2023.A IAV subtyped and non-subtyped in avian samples, in poultry and wild birds; B IAV subtyped and non-subtyped in environmental samples: surface, water, and air. IAV positive non-subtyped samples are represented in light red, H5N1 subtyped samples are represented in light green, H5N8 subtyped samples are represented in light blue, H9N2 subtyped samples are represented in light yellow, and H5/H9 subtyped samples are represented in grey.Full size imagePoultry samplesIn poultry samples, the H5N1 subtype was detected in December 2021, March 2022, December 2022, and February 2023 with prevalence rates of 2.86%, 16.67%, 31.25%, and 16.0%, respectively, among the positive samples. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza associated with severe illness and high mortality rates in birds and, in rare cases, in humans. The presence of H5N1 in the poultry samples indicates its circulation within the market environment during those specific months. The H5N8 subtype was detected in December 2021 and January 2022 with prevalence rates of 2.857% and 2.778%, respectively. The H9N2 subtype was detected in the poultry samples in November 2021, December 2021, January 2022, February 2022, March 2022, May 2022, June 2022, August 2022, September 2022, October 2022, December 2022, January 2023, February 2023, and March 2023, with prevalence rates ranging from 2.78% to 83.33% among the positive samples. H9N2 is a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza that can infect various bird species, including poultry. The presence of H9N2 in these poultry samples indicates its continuous circulation and potential transmission within the market environment throughout the surveillance period. The H5/H9 subtype was detected in March 2022 with a prevalence rate of 6.667%.Wild samplesIn wild bird samples, H5N1 subtype was only detected in December 2021 with 2.9% prevalence rate. The H5N8 subtype was detected in wild avian samples in November 2021, with a prevalence rate of 4.76% among the positive samples. H5N8 is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza that has been associated with severe illness and high mortality rates in birds. The presence of H5N8 in the wild avian samples indicates its circulation within the market environment during that specific month. The H9N2 subtype was detected in the wild avian samples in November 2021, May 2022, and March 2023, with prevalence rates ranging from 9.52% to 25% among the positive samples. H9N2 is a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza that can infect various bird species, including wild birds. The presence of H9N2 in these wild avian samples indicates its sporadic presence and potential transmission within the market environment during those specific months. The H5/H9 subtype was not detected in any of the wild avian samples.These results highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and monitoring of IAV subtypes in wild avian populations within Egyptian markets to understand the prevalence, circulation, and potential risks associated with different strains. It also emphasizes the need for appropriate biosecurity measures and interventions to prevent the transmission and spread of avian influenza among wild bird populations and to minimize the risk of zoonotic transmission to both animals and humans.Surface samplesIn surface samples, no H5N1 or H5N8 subtypes were detected during the entire period except only for H5N1 was detected in February 2023 with a prevalence of 8.3%. However, there was a detection of the H9N2 subtype in July 2022 and February 2023, with a prevalence of 5.26% and 25% respectively among the positive samples. No H5/H9 subtype was identified in any of the surface samples during the specified timeframe.Overall, the graph indicates that while positive IAV samples were found on surfaces in Egyptian markets during surveillance, only the H9N2 subtype was detected, and it was present in a relatively low proportion in July 2022 and high proportion in February 2023 in addition to H5N1 that was detected with 8.3% prevalence in February 2023. It is important to note that the absence of specific subtypes (H5N8 or H5/H9) in the surface samples does not necessarily imply their absence in other sample types or at different time points.Water samplesNo water samples tested positive for H5N1 or H5N8, which are highly pathogenic strains associated with avian influenza. However, the H9N2 subtype was detected in December 2021, June 2022, August 2022, September 2022, February 2023, and March 2023, with prevalence rates of 8.33%, 33.33%, 100%, 12.5%, 8.3%, and 33.33%, respectively, among the positive samples. The H5/H9 subtype was not detected in any of the water samples throughout the surveillance period. It’s important to note that the absence of certain subtypes in the water samples does not imply their absence in other sample types or locations within Egyptian markets. The results highlight the need for continued surveillance and monitoring to understand the prevalence and distribution of different IAV subtypes in the water within the market environment.Air samplesNo specific IAV subtypes (H5N1, H5N8, H9N2, or H5/H9) were detected in any of the air samples throughout the entire period. It is important to note that the data presented in the graph only pertains to the specified time period and does not indicate the absence of these subtypes in other sample types or during different timeframes. Several factors may contribute to the absence of specific IAV subtypes in air samples.Limitations and implicationsWhile our study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and diversity of AIVs in Egyptian LBMs, it is crucial to acknowledge certain limitations that may impact the interpretation of our findings and their broader implications.One significant limitation of our study is the bias inherent in sampling apparently healthy birds. Detecting viruses primarily in healthy birds may not fully represent the true prevalence of AIVs in LBMs or accurately assess the potential risk to public health. By focusing on apparently healthy birds, we may underestimate the overall prevalence of AIVs, as sick birds are more likely to exhibit viral shedding and be targeted for sampling in other studies. Additionally, the presence of AIVs in asymptomatic carriers among apparently healthy birds emphasizes the silent threat posed by these carriers in LBMs. The implications of this sampling bias are multifaceted. First, relying solely on samples from apparently healthy birds may lead to an incomplete understanding of AIV transmission dynamics within LBMs. The true extent of viral circulation and transmission pathways, particularly from asymptomatic carriers to susceptible hosts, may be underestimated. Consequently, the efficacy of control measures and intervention strategies based on this incomplete understanding may be compromised.Moreover, the method used for air sampling, while effective for detecting airborne particles carrying viruses, may have limitations in capturing specific IAV subtypes. The shedding dynamics of different IAV subtypes by infected birds and environmental sources may vary. Certain subtypes may be shed in higher quantities through respiratory secretions or fecal matter, making them more likely to be detected in environmental samples such as water or surfaces compared to air samples. Airborne viruses may undergo degradation or loss of infectivity over time due to environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. The stability of specific IAV subtypes in the air may differ, affecting their detectability in air samples.Furthermore, the underestimation of AIV prevalence in LBMs could have implications for public health risk assessment. Failure to accurately assess the prevalence of AIVs, especially in environments where humans come into close contact with infected birds, may underestimate the potential for zoonotic transmission and the risk of novel influenza strain emergence. This underscores the importance of considering not only the prevalence of AIVs but also their distribution and transmission dynamics in LBMs to adequately assess public health risks and inform preventive measures.In addition, the sampling bias may limit the generalizability of our findings to other LBMs or regions with different environmental, ecological, or operational characteristics. Variations in market settings, biosecurity measures, poultry management practices, and wild bird populations may influence the prevalence and transmission dynamics of AIVs. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating our findings to broader contexts without considering these factors.While our study provides valuable insights into AIV prevalence and diversity in Egyptian LBMs, the limitation associated with sampling bias underscores the need for future research to adopt more comprehensive sampling strategies that account for both apparently healthy and clinically ill birds. Addressing this limitation will improve our understanding of AIV transmission dynamics, enhance risk assessment capabilities, and inform more effective control and prevention strategies to mitigate the threat of avian influenza in LBMs and safeguard both animal and public health.DiscussionAIVs are continuously circulating in Egyptian live bird markets, posing risks to the poultry industry and public health. Live bird markets in Egypt facilitate the trade and allow the interaction of various bird species, which increases potential AIVs transmission26. Monitoring and surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Egyptian live bird markets are crucial to track the presence of AIVs and other avian pathogens. Active surveillance programs allow regular collection of samples from different sources in the markets, including poultry, wild birds, and the environment, such as water, surfaces, and air27.AIVs in Egyptian markets spread through direct contact, environmental contamination, and aerosol transmission. Infected birds transmit the virus through pecking, feeding, or mating. AIVs are shed through respiratory secretions, feces, saliva, and ocular discharge and spread through coughing, sneezing, and normal respiration. Respiratory droplets and dust particles carry the virus infecting birds that inhale them. Contaminated surfaces and equipment within markets play a role in transmission when infected birds come into contact with them. Therefore, this environmental contamination exposes susceptible birds to infection. These routes apply to avian markets worldwide but specific factors in Egyptian markets, such as environmental conditions and the coexistence of domestic and wild birds, increase transmission risks28,29.The study was conducted in four Egyptian LBMs located in Mediterranean coast cities. This choice of study sites was intentional to capture the real-world scenario prevalent in many LBMs in Egypt. Monthly active surveillance for AIVs was conducted over a span of 16 months, from November 2021 to March 2023, to assess the prevalence and circulation of AIVs among poultry, wild birds, and the environment within these LBMs. This prolonged surveillance period allowed us to capture seasonal variations and assess the impact of low biosecurity measures over time.Variation in AIV positivity rates among sample types (higher prevalence of AIV in poultry compared to wild birds) can be attributed to several factors. Poultry in LBMs are often intensively raised in proximity, facilitating rapid virus transmission. Conversely, wild bird populations may have lower densities and less frequent interactions, reducing the likelihood of virus spread. Furthermore, differences in immune status and susceptibility between poultry and wild birds may contribute to varying positivity rates. Poultry in LBMs are often exposed to stressors that compromise immune function, making them more susceptible to AIV infection compared to wild birds in their natural habitats. The observed variations in AIV positivity rates among different sample types underscore the multifactorial nature of AIV transmission within LBMs. By considering temporal dynamics, species-specific transmission patterns, and market hygiene practices, we can better understand and mitigate the risks associated with AIV circulation in Egyptian LBMs. Further research and surveillance efforts are warranted to elucidate the complex interactions driving AIV transmission and inform targeted control strategies.Environmental samples, including water, surfaces, and air, also tested positive for AIV, albeit at lower rates than poultry suggesting environmental contamination in LBMs that can serve as a reservoir for viral persistence and transmission. Factors such as inadequate sanitation practices and overcrowding may exacerbate environmental contamination, leading to sporadic AIV detection. The fluctuating positivity rates in environmental samples may reflect seasonal variations in LBM activities, such as increased trade during certain periods or changes in environmental conditions conducive to viral survival. The presence of H9N2 subtype in both surface and water samples suggests that infected birds shed the virus into the environment, contaminating surfaces and water sources commonly used by both poultry and wild birds. The coexistence of wild and domestic birds in LBMs enhances transmission risks, as close contact between species facilitates viral spread. The detection of H9N2 in surface and water samples underscores the risk of viral transmission to both avian species and potentially exposed humans. Infected surfaces and water sources serve as reservoirs for the virus, posing continuous threats to the poultry industry and public health.The fluctuating positivity rates observed over the surveillance period suggest dynamic AIV transmission dynamics within LBMs. Seasonal factors, such as changes in bird migration patterns or environmental conditions, may influence virus circulation. Additionally, temporal variations in market activities, such as restocking of poultry or influx of migratory birds, could impact AIV prevalence. Cold, dry conditions support AIV survival and transmission, while warmer temperatures reduce viability. Higher AIV rates in colder months like January and February in the Mediterranean region align with this trend30. Understanding these temporal patterns is crucial for targeted surveillance and intervention strategies.The diversity of AIV subtypes and isolates detected across avian species highlights the complex transmission dynamics within LBMs. Certain bird species may act as reservoirs for specific AIV subtypes, facilitating interspecies transmission. The presence of highly pathogenic AIV subtypes, such as H5N1 and H5N8, underscores the potential for zoonotic spillover events and the need for vigilant surveillance and control measures.Variations in AIV positivity rates among different sample types may also reflect differences in market hygiene and biosecurity practices. Inadequate biosecurity measures, such as poor sanitation or insufficient quarantine procedures, can increase virus transmission within LBMs. Direct contact between humans and infected birds, as well as environmental contamination, were facilitated by the lack of stringent biosecurity protocols. The transmission routes of AIVs in environments where both poultry and wild birds coexist are summarized in Fig.3. The main pathways include the transmission of AIVs through shared drinking water sources, airborne dissemination, and contamination of various surfaces. The higher prevalence of AIVs detected in poultry intended for consumption compared to wild birds underscores the role of biosecurity in mitigating transmission among poultry populations. The close confinement and frequent handling of poultry in LBMs create conducive conditions for virus spread. Environmental samples, including water, surfaces, and air, also tested positive for AIV, indicating widespread contamination within LBMs. Improving biosecurity protocols and promoting hygiene practices among market workers and visitors are essential for reducing AIV transmission and minimizing public health risks.Fig. 3: Transmission pathways of avian influenza viruses among poultry and wild birds in shared environments, and human interactions in LBM.Avian influenza viruses in wild birds are represented in green circles and avian influenza viruses in domestic birds are represented in red circles.Full size imageOur study provides crucial insights into the prevalence and diversity of AIV subtypes in Egyptian LBMs, emphasizing their potential risks. The higher prevalence of AIV in poultry intended for consumption compared to wild birds underscores a greater public health concern. The presence of highly pathogenic strains like H5N1 and H5N8 among poultry highlights the risk of severe illness and mortality, both in birds and possibly in humans. Similarly, the circulation of low pathogenic H9N2 in both poultry and wild birds raises concerns due to its potential for zoonotic transmission and its role in endemicity in poultry populations. Furthermore, the detection of diverse AIV subtypes in environmental samples indicates environmental contamination, posing additional challenges for disease control.Migratory birds introduce new AIV strains into LBMs, especially during peak migration periods. While not directly assessed, the presence of wild birds in LBMs suggests their role in AIV introduction. LBMs facilitate AIV transmission due to diverse bird trading. Increased trading during festive seasons or high-demand periods contributes to higher AIV prevalence. Market activities like auctions and restocking also affect transmission dynamics. Poultry farming practices, market hygiene, and public health interventions impact AIV transmission. Changes in human behavior, like holiday market visits, influence AIV spread. Interventions, such as vaccination and biosecurity measures during specific seasons also affect AIV prevalence. Understanding human interventions is vital for interpreting seasonal trends in AIV transmission.Our findings highlight the urgent need for implementing and enforcing robust biosecurity measures in LBMs to reduce the risk of AIV transmission. This includes measures such as restricting bird movement, proper waste management, disinfection protocols, and promoting hygiene practices among market workers and visitors. Future research should focus on assessing the effectiveness of specific biosecurity interventions in mitigating AIV transmission within LBMs. Comparative studies evaluating the impact of improved biosecurity measures on AIV prevalence and transmission dynamics would provide valuable insights for policy development and implementation. Additionally, collaborative efforts involving government agencies, veterinary services, public health authorities, and market stakeholders are essential for developing comprehensive strategies to control AIVs and prevent potential zoonotic transmission events.ConclusionOur study identified diverse AIV subtypes, including highly pathogenic strains like H5N1 and H5N8, circulating among poultry, wild birds, and environmental samples. Temporal analysis revealed fluctuating positivity rates, indicating ongoing transmission dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of continuous surveillance, resource allocation, and collaborative efforts to prevent potential outbreaks and protect public health. Recommendations include implementing stringent biosecurity measures, enhancing environmental hygiene, and promoting One Health approaches to mitigate zoonotic transmission risks by applying One Health measures such as surveillance, outbreak investigation, multisectoral working groups, designing and implementing policies and strategies and fill critical gaps in scientific knowledge.While our study provides valuable insights into the diversity of AIV subtypes within Egyptian LBMs, it’s essential to recognize the contextual factors unique to these markets and the Mediterranean coast cities where our study was conducted. The dynamics of AIV transmission can be influenced by various factors, including geographic location, climate, market practices, bird species composition, biosecurity measures, and human behavior. Therefore, caution must be exercised when extrapolating our findings to other regions or contexts with different characteristics. The presence of diverse AIV subtypes detected in our study, including H5N1, H9N2, H5/H9 co-infection, and H5N8, highlights the complexity of AIV circulation within Egyptian LBMs. However, the prevalence and distribution of these subtypes may vary in other geographical locations due to differences in poultry management practices, bird species composition, and environmental conditions. Therefore, it’s crucial to conduct similar surveillance studies in different regions to understand the regional variations in AIV epidemiology and inform context-specific control measures.Furthermore, the seasonal variability in AIV positivity rates observed in our study may not be directly applicable to other regions with different climatic conditions and bird migration patterns. Factors such as temperature, humidity, and bird migratory routes can influence the timing and intensity of AIV transmission cycles. Therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating our findings to regions with distinct seasonal patterns.The external validity of our results also depends on the representativeness of the LBMs sampled in our study. While we conducted surveillance in four LBMs located in Mediterranean coast cities, the dynamics of AIV transmission may differ in LBMs located in other parts of Egypt or in different countries. Therefore, future studies should aim to sample a more extensive range of LBMs across diverse geographic regions to enhance the generalizability of the findings. Future research efforts should focus on conducting surveillance studies in different geographic locations, considering local contextual factors, to improve the external validity and generalizability of the results. This approach will facilitate a better understanding of AIV epidemiology on a global scale and inform evidence-based control strategies tailored to specific regional contexts.In conclusion, our study underscores the importance of surveillance, biosecurity, and collaborative efforts among stakeholders under One Health approach to prevent potentially dangerous new influenza strains and protect poultry, human, and environmental health.

Pandemics can lead to widespread illness, significant mortality, and substantial economic impacts due to healthcare expenses and loss of productivity. Through the concerted efforts of Member States, WHO, partners and investments from the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) Partnership Contribution (PC) and other sources, all 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR) now have a WHO-recognized national influenza centre (NIC). This significant accomplishment strengthens laboratory capacity in line with the objectives of the Global Influenza Strategy (2019-2030).The Global Influenza Strategy emphasizes the critical need to build strong national capacities, prioritizing laboratories to improve pandemic influenza preparedness and strengthen International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) core capacities. Given that NICs are the backbone of the WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), the region set and has now achieved its target to establish a WHO-recognized NIC in each SEAR Member State.Building a regional networkIn 1952, India began building its influenza laboratory capacity, which coincided with the founding of GISRS. By the 1970s, WHO-recognized NICs were operational in India (1977), Indonesia (1976) and Thailand (1972). At the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic, seven Member States (63%) had a NIC, with the NICs in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand supporting the four countries that did not have their own NIC.The National Public Health Laboratory in Nepal was recognized by the WHO in 2010. In 2019, recognizing the critical role of NICs, the Regional Office aimed to designate and achieve WHO recognition for public health laboratories in the remaining three Member States (Bhutan, Maldives and Timor-Leste). WHO organized and coordinated external assessments of these public health laboratories, identifying key gaps in workforce competence, laboratory quality management, specimen transportation, documentation of laboratory activities and systematic equipment management.To address these gaps, these three NICs worked closely with WHO, WHO Collaborating Centres at the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), and the Victoria Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia to train and mentor senior laboratory staff, thereby enhancing national capacities both in the short and long term. External financial support was provided through the PIP PC and other partners. These collaborative efforts resulted in significant progress, as indicated by subsequent assessments, leading to WHO recognizing the remaining three laboratories as NICs.Sustaining the gains All SEAR Member States are now committed to maintaining high-quality and safe influenza testing. This is achieved through participation in the WHO External Quality Assessment Programme (EQAP), consistent data reporting to WHO, and the regular sharing of influenza viruses. WHO supports these efforts by conducting national and international surveillance reviews, coordinating regional biosafety trainings based on the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, and facilitating training and mentoring at WHO Collaborating Centres. In 2023, a regional consultation brought together all NICs to discuss strategies for strengthening laboratory capacity to ensure the coordinated implementation of an expanded GISRS (e-GISRS) while preserving influenza-specific achievements. These strategies included adopting WHO-recommended standards for the laboratory diagnosis of influenza and engaging in broader consultations with countries. The aim was to define the scope and terms of reference for NICs, reference laboratories and other collaborators, ultimately improving the organization and coordinated implementation of e-GISRS within countries.The concerted efforts of Member States, technical support from WHO and other partners, and sustainable financing through the PIP PC and other sources have significantly improved expertise and infrastructure at NICs. These enhancements have strengthened laboratory capacities for influenza preparedness in the WHO South-East Asia Region, aligning with the goals of the WHO Global Influenza Strategy.

H1N1 initiates inflammatory responses that aim to contain and eliminate microbial invaders. Various lipid mediators (LMs) are biosynthesized and play a critical role in fighting viruses during inflammation; thus, by profiling the LMs in patients, researchers can obtain mechanistic insights into diseases, such as the pathways disrupted. To date, the relationship between molecular alterations in LMs and the pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza in children is poorly understood. Here, we employed a targeted liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS) to profile LMs in serum from children with H1N1 influenza (H1N1 children) and recovered children. We found that 22 LM species were altered in H1N1 children with mild symptoms. Analysis of the LM profiles of recovered children revealed a decrease in the levels of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and thromboxane B3 (TxB3) and an increase in the levels of other 8 altered LM species associated with H1N1 influenza, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-derived dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DiHETrEs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) from arachidonic acid (AA), and epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (EpOMEs) from linoleic acid (LA). Taken together, the results of this study revealed that serum LMs change dynamically in H1N1 children with mild symptoms. The dramatically altered LMs in H1N1 children could serve as a basis for potential therapeutics or adjuvants against H1N1 influenza.

H1N1 influenza virus can cause significant morbidity and mortality in children2. Individuals with the highest rates of influenza-related hospital admission include infants, young children, and adults over 65 years3.While most H1N1 influenza virus infections in humans are self-limiting, highly virulent strains can cause an overexuberant inflammatory response that is detrimental to the host4. Although it is well known that the pathogenicity of influenza strains can vary widely, the precise mechanisms leading to the infection outcome are not fully understood. During H1N1 influenza virus-induced inflammation, various lipid mediators (LMs) play important roles in the regulation of inflammatory responses5,6. LMs are autacoids produced from essential fatty acids and constitute a central part of the concerted immune response. They are involved in all aspects of the inflammatory response including initiation, propagation, and resolution7,8. Although the resolution of inflammation was previously thought to be a passive process, it has since been established that specific LMs play central roles in driving the endogenous counterregulation of inflammation and the activation of resolution6.Arachidonic acid (AA 20:4 n-6), a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is the precursor of proinflammatory prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs), thromboxanes (Tx) and proresolving lipoxins (LXs)9. The n-3 essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:5 n-3) are precursors of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), namely protectins (PDs), resolvins, and maresins10. These molecules play a pivotal role in regulating viral replication as well as in reprogramming the host innate and adaptive immune response11,12.The role of LMs in infection and inflammation has been studied in animal models of viral infection including influenza viruses, herpes simplex viruses, and coronaviruses6,12, among which SPMs have been shown to reduce disease severity11,13. Since LMs play a critical role in viral infection and inflammation, researchers can uncover disrupted pathways and reveal biological insight into diseases by profiling LMs in patients. The plasma profiling of LMs in coronavirus (COVID-19) patients revealed that the levels of LMs in critically ill patients were reduced, and certain SPMs can be used to determine disease severity14. Lu et al.15 demonstrated that various eicosanoids were dysregulated in adult patients with H1N1 influenza-induced pneumonia.In this study, we used a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS) platform to characterize the serum LM profiles of healthy children, children with H1N1 influenza (H1N1 children) and children after recovery; in addition, we examined bioactive lipids that were potentially disturbed and related pathways during H1N1 influenza in children.ResultsStudy design and blood samplesWe collected blood samples from 88 children, including 44 H1N1 children and 44 healthy age- and sex-matched children, from Shaoxing Shangyu Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital (Fig. 1). All H1N1 influenza cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR), and diagnosed as mild symptoms based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for H1N1 influenza virus of the National Health Commission of China16. Among the H1N1 children, 36 returned for physical examination after recovery, and blood samples were also collected. All the H1N1 children were tested for other viruses, including coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus. Only the children tested positive for H1N1 influenza virus and not other viruses were included in this study. The H1N1 children showed mild symptoms, such as fever (body temperature ≥ 37.2 °C) and cough, but no severe symptoms. The healthy children who did not experience any cold or flu symptoms, such as fever and cough, after 1 week were chosen for physical examination (Table 1). Blood tests revealed that white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYM), and platelet (PLT) counts were lower in H1N1 and recovered children than in healthy children, while neutrophil (NEUT) counts were greater in the H1N1 group and decreased in the recovered group. The serum samples were analyzed using a targeted LC‒MS/MS acquisition strategy and each lipid mediator was quantified based on its calibration curve generated by the synthesized standard. To monitor the data acquisition process, we interspersed quality control (QC) samples during mass spectrometry data acquisition, which contained a small portion of the serum samples from all samples in this study.Figure 1Study design. Flow chart showing the steps of this study.Full size imageTable 1 Patient demographics and hematological and biochemical variables.Full size tableDifferences of LM profiles between healthy controls and H1N1 childrenWe identified 64 LMs in serum across all samples and determined the concentrations of LMs derived from various precursors, including n-6 PUFAs, n-6 linoleic acid (LA) and AA, as well as n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA. The QC samples showed good correlation and reproducibility in a pairwise comparison matrix (Suppl. Fig. 1). The relative standard deviation (RSD, %) of the peak areas of internal standards across all the QC samples (Suppl. Table 1) showed that the RSD was less than 15% for each internal standard, indicating that repeatability during LC‒MS/MS was acceptable. Our platform covers a broad range of oxidized fatty acid metabolites from diverse precursors and measures LMs at picomolar concentrations. We found that 22 lipid species were significantly changed in the blood of H1N1 children (P < 0.05) (Suppl. Table 2), compared with healthy controls. Eicosanoids and octadecanoids (derived from LA) were the major LMs altered after H1N1 influenza virus infection (Fig. 2A). In addition, using orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), we showed that H1N1 children and healthy controls were well separated based on serum LMs (Fig. 2B). The variable importance in projection (VIP) scores revealed 18 LMs that most strongly contributed to the observed separation (Fig. 2C). Notably, most LMs identified by VIP were identical to those identified by univariate analysis, as shown in Fig. 2A.Figure 2Serum LM remodeling after infection with H1N1 influenza virus in children.

Table 3). OPLS-DA (Fig. 3B) revealed a partial separation between the recovered and H1N1 groups; the VIP scores (Fig. 3C) indicated that most of LMs whose levels were found to strongly contribute to the separation in OPLS-DA also showed statistically significant differences in their levels in paired Student’s t tests. To determine which LMs were restored to normal, we mapped the LM profiles of children across the healthy, H1N1 and recovery groups and revealed that the levels of 12 common LM species significantly differed between the healthy and H1N1 groups and between the H1N1 and recovered groups. (Fig. 3D).Figure 3Serum LM alteration from H1N1 influenza to recovery in children.

Fig. 2). The three groups partially overlapped and the VIP scores showed the relevant LMs for separating the three groups. Furthermore, one-way ANOVA was applied to the healthy, H1N1, and recovered children. We found that 25 LM species showed significant differences among these three groups (Suppl. Table 4), among which 11 LM species were partially or completely restored to normal after recovery, except for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (Fig. 4). For these 11 LMs species, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme-derived 11, 12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (11,12-DiHETrEs), 14,15-DiHETrE, 8,9-DiHETrE, 17-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17-HETE), and 20-HETE from AA, 12(13)- epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid (12,(13)EpOME), 9,(10)-EpOME from LA, and LA, were increased in H1N1 children compared with the healthy and recovered groups, whereas cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived thromboxane B2 (TxB2) from AA and TxB3 from EPA were decreased in H1N1 children and then returned to normal after recovery. Interestingly, the level of the 5-LOX derived metabolite LTB4 from AA remained low in the recovered group. An LMs metabolic pathway scheme (Fig. 5) highlighted differences in LM biosynthetic pathways in H1N1 children compared with the healthy and recovered groups. This analysis demonstrated that most LMs, which were altered during H1N1 influenza, contained upregulated CYP-derived products from AA and LA and downregulated products from COX enzymes. These results suggest that these enzymes exhibit a unique pattern in the activity during H1N1 influenza virus infection in children.Figure 4Temporal changes in serum LMs from healthy status to H1N1 influenza and then from H1N1 influenza to recovery in children. One-way ANOVA was applied to the healthy, H1N1, and recovered children. If a difference among three groups was found, the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons, where *P value < 0.05, **P value < 0.01, and ***P value < 0.001.

We found that all the LM levels were not normally distributed; therefore, Spearman correlation was applied to examine the relationships between hematological variables and LM levels. The LMs that correlated significantly with hematological variables are listed in Suppl. Table 5, with correlation coefficients (r) and P values < 0.05. The range of the r values of the LMs ranges from − 0.413 to 0.487, indicating weak to moderate associations between hematological variables and LM concentrations. Among the 11 LM species identified during the progress from health to H1N1 influenza and back to recovery, NEUT count was positively correlated with LTB4 (r = 0.412), 19, 20-DiHDPA (r = 0.388), 14,15-DiHETrE (r = 0.386), 20-HETE (r = 0.369), 11,12-DiHETrE (r = 0.351), 12, 13-EpOME (r = 0.265), LA (r = 0.219), and 17-HETE (r = 0.203) but negatively correlated withTxB3 (r = − 0.239) and TxB2 (r = -0.265); PLT count was positively correlated with TxB2 (r = 0.303), TxB3 (r = 0271) and LTB4 (r = 0.244) but negatively correlated with 20-HETE (r = − 0.181), 14,15-DiHETErE (r = − 0.182), and 12,13-EpOME (r = -0.219); LYM count was positively correlated with TxB2 (r = 0.487), and TxB3 (r = 0.361) but negatively correlated with 19,20-DiHDPA (r = − 0.191), 8,9-DiHETrE (r = − 0.228), 17-HETE (r = − 0.216), 20-HETE (r = − 0.385), 12,13-EpOME (r = − 0.278), 11,12-DiHETrE (r = − 0.360), LA (r = − 0.331), and 14,15-DiHETrE (r = − 0.413); WBC count was positively correlated with LTB4 (r = 0.395) and 19.20-DiHDPA (r = 0.220); Hemoglobin (HGB) was positively correlated with 12,13-EpOME (r = 0.201) and 11,12-DiHETrE (r = 0.182).DiscussionIn this study, we applied a targeted LC‒MS/MS platform to systematically investigate the profile of serum LMs in H1N1 children. We demonstrated that eicosanoids from AA and octadecanoids from LA were dysregulated in H1N1 children. Furthermore, the level of 11 LM species were fully or partially restored to healthy levels after recovery. Taken together, these findings suggest that disruptions in the biosynthesis of LMs, especially eicosanoids, occur during H1N1 influenza virus infection and clearance in children.Bioactive LMs play a crucial role in the induction and resolution of inflammation during influenza virus infection5,6,12. Controlled immune responses to infection and injury involve complex molecular networks and often opposing actions12. Irun et al.17 revealed that the levels of serum LMs, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and resolving E1, 14-hydroxy docosahexaenoic acid (14-HDHA), were increased in the patients with severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Palmas et al.14 reported that the levels of lipoxygenase pathway-related mediators, such as LTB4 and RvD1, were lower in critically ill COVID-19 patients than in those with severe disease. In mouse model infected with the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8/H1N1), PGs in bronchoalveolar lavage increased in the early inflammation phase and decreased thereafter; H1N1 virus-infected mice also exhibited decreased levels of LOX-derived metabolites and increased levels of CYP pathway-related metabolites12. Our study showed that the levels of the CYP pathway-derived products DiHETrEs, 17-HETE, 20-HETE, 12,13-EpOME, and 19,20-DiHDPA increased in H1N1 children with mild symptoms and decreased to basal levels after recovery. These results are consistent with a previous study in which CYP pathway-derived metabolites were increased in patients with severe H1N1 influenza-induced pneumonia compared with healthy adult individuals15. Moreover, the levels of COX pathway products TxB2 and TxB3 were reduced in H1N1 children but returned to normal levels after recovery. The exception is LTB4, which is biosynthesized by leukocytes during inflammation18; LTB4 level remained low in H1N1 influenza and further decrease even after recovery. Our results suggested that during H1N1 influenza, serum LMs, especially eicosanoids, are tightly regulated to counterbalance the severity of inflammation and maintain the physiological functions.TxB2 and TxB3 are thromboxanes that are mainly biosynthesized from AA and EPA, respectively, with catalysis by thromboxane synthase in platelets. TxA2 and TxA3 are active products of platelets and are quickly hydrolyzed to the inactive forms TxB2 and TxB3 nonenzymatically19,20,21. Local TxA2 and TxA3 levels are critical for the regulation of systemic blood pressure and thrombogenesis22. The levels of TxA2 and TxA3 are positively correlated with the PLT count. The lower PLT count in H1N1 children is considered to be associated with the reduction in thromboxane levels. After the children recovered from H1N1 influenza virus infection, the levels of these bioactive compounds were restored, as the PLT count was restored to the normal level.LTB4, which activates leukocytes and prolongs their survival, is the most important leukotriene in acute inflammatory responses. Additionally, LTB4 is a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages and stimulates leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium by upregulating integrin expression23,24. LTB4 biosynthesis is initiated by the 5-LOX-mediated conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4 (LTA4), after which LTA4 is subsequently converted to LTB4. The enzyme LTA4 hydrolase converts LTA4 to LTB4 mainly in white blood cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes25. Our study indicated that LTB4 was positively correlated with the NEUT, PLT and WBC counts. The reduction in LTB4 in H1N1 children compared to healthy controls might be linked to the total reduction in the WBC count, although the neutrophil count was greater. A further reduction in the WBC count might lead to a decreased LTB4 level even after recovery from H1N1 influenza.Inflammation is an essential host defense mechanism that is necessary for protection against pathogens, microorganisms and viruses. However, excessive and nonresolving inflammatory responses are damaging to the host6,10. H1N1 influenza virus infection triggers an excessive inflammatory response in hosts and, if untreated, can lead to influenza-induced pneumonia or other complications, including sepsis syndrome and respiratory distress syndrome26. Patients that overlapped between H1N1 and recovered children might have different dynamic process for inflammation to resolution27,28, leading to some recovered children still unresolved. During the process of inflammation, LMs from PUFAs, including AA, LA, EPA, and DHA, are synthesized and play a crucial role in controlling inflammation and combating infectious organisms. In the early stage of inflammation, LTs and PGs are important for promoting the immune response following tissue injury7,8. During the resolution of inflammation, SPMs with anti-inflammatory and proresolving effects are produced and have potent immunoregulatory effects12. In influenza virus infection, a DHA-derived resolvin, 17-HDHA, upregulates the production of neutralizing antibodies to the virus13, whereas PD family members inhibit influenza virus replication via RNA export machinery11. Notably, during H1N1 influenza, the levels of vicinal diols, such as 11,12-DiHETrE, 14,15-DiHETrE, 8,9-DiHETrE from AA, and other metabolites produced via the CYP and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) pathways, increase in children with disease progression of H1N1 influenza. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are CYP intermediate products, are anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antifibrotic, and antihypertensive agents that act in both autocrine and paracrine manners29. The end metabolites of these compounds, vicinal diols, might be used as potential biomarkers for inflammatory and related diseases.In conclusion, our study revealed different serum LM profiles in children with H1N1 influenza virus infection associated with inflammatory responses. We identified a number of LM species that were altered by H1N1 influenza and restored after spontaneous recovery in children. These findings shed light on the pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza in children, and provided foundations for potential therapeutic tools to treat this disease.MethodsStudy subjectsForty-four H1N1 children and forty-four age- and sex- matched healthy control children aged 1–10 years were included in this study from Shaoxing Shangyu Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. H1N1 influenza virus was confirmed using direct immunofluorescence assays according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for H1N1 influenza virus of the National Health Commission of China16,30. Oropharynx swabs were collected, and the swabs were tested for various viruses, including adenovirus (ADV), influenza A (FLUA), influenza B (FLUB) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), using colloidal gold methods. For influenza A-positive samples, H1N1 was further confirmed via real-time RT‒PCR31,32. Briefly, total viral RNA from throat swab samples was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stored at − 80 °C, RT‒PCR was performed with a one-step PrimeScript® RT‒PCR reagent (Takara, Dalian, China). The final optimized 50 μl reaction mixture consisted of 5 μl of RNA, 25 μl of 2 × One Step RT‒PCR Buffer, 1 μl of TaKaRa EX Taq HS (5 U/μl), 1 μl of Prime-Script RT Enzyme Mix, 1 μl of forward primer (40 μM), 1 μl of reverse primer (40 μM), and 0.5 μl of probe (20 μM) for H1N1 influenza virus (Suppl. Table 6). The thermal cycling parameters were as follows: cDNA synthesis at 42 °C for 30 min; denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 45 s. The fluorescence was recorded at 60 °C on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Only those with H1N1 influenza virus infections and no coinfections were included in this study. The healthy children were chosen based on the absence of cold or flu symptoms, such as fever (body temperature ≥ 37.2 °C) or cough, within 1 week. Human serum samples were collected after an overnight fast. Among the H1N1 children, thirty-six returned to the hospital for physical examination after recovery for approximately 5–7 days and mostly showed no symptoms of fever, excluding three patients who still had a cough. The serum samples for the recovery group were collected and used for analysis. The study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shaoxing Shangyu Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital (LL-2023-07-05). Written informed consent was obtained from a parent and/or legal guardian for study participation.LM extractionAll LM standards were purchased from the Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). HLB SPE cartridges were purchased from Anbocis Technology (Beijing, China). All HPLC-grade solvents were acquired from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or Merck & Co., Inc. (Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Before lipid extraction, human serum samples were thawed on ice. Small aliquots (20 μl) of each human serum sample were pooled as QC samples and thoroughly mixed for 3 min. Aliquots of 100 μl of thawed human serum and QC samples were used for sample preparation. A mixture of deuterium-labeled internal standards was added to each sample, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL of cold methanol (MeOH). The samples were vortexed for 5 min and stored at − 20 °C overnight. The cold samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was then transferred to a new tube. The samples were evaporated under nitrogen to volume of 50 μl, after which 1 mL of acidified H2O (pH 3.5) was added to each sample before HLB solid phase extraction (SPE) as previously described33. In brief, the acidified samples were loaded onto an HLB SPE column, washed with water and hexane, and eluted with methyl formate. The methyl formate fractions were collected, dried under nitrogen, and reconstituted in 100 μL of MeOH:H2O (2:3, v/v). The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, and 80 μl of each supernatant was subjected to LC–MS/MS analysis.LC–MS/MS for LMsLC–MS/MS for LMs has been reported previously33. Briefly, LMs were analyzed by LC–MS/MS using a Shimadzu LC-20ACXR (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Sciex 5500 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Sciex, MA, USA) with heated electrospray ionization (ESI). A Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) was maintained at 40 °C. Solvent A was composed of 100% H2O with 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was composed of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1% formic acid. A gradient was applied with 35% B at 0 min, increased to 50% B until 4.0 min, increased to 95% B at 9.0 min, maintained at 95% B until 11.5 min, returned to 35% B at 12.0 min, and maintained at 35% B until 14.0 min, with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The ESI–MS instrument was operated in negative mode with a voltage of − 4500 V, a temperature of 500 °C, a curtain gas at 30 psi, GS1 at 40 psi, and GS2 at 40 psi. The mass spectrometry parameters for each lipid were optimized, and a scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) strategy was applied. The retention time, specific MRM transitions, and corresponding internal standards for each lipid mediator are listed in Suppl. Table 7. We used different deuterated standards to normalize individual lipid mediators according to their structural similarities and chromatographic behaviors, i.e., retention times. Calibration curves for the LMs were generated using synthetic LM mixtures, including appropriate internal standard mixtures (d4-LTB4, d5-LXA4, d4-PGE2, d5-RvD2, and d8-5-HETE), with a linear regression coefficient of determination (R2) ≥ 0.99. Quantitation was performed using MutliQuant software (Sciex, MA, USA). During LC–MS/MS, QC samples were interspersed after 20 injections, with 6 QC samples positioned at the beginning and end of the analysis.Statistical analysisThe P values were calculated by Student’s t test or paired Student’s t test, and values greater than 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences. One-way ANOVA was applied to three groups. If a significant difference among three groups was found, the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. OPLS-DA and PLS-DA were performed to identify LMs that discriminate between different groups. VIP scores allowed the classification of variables according to their explanatory power. The predictors with large VIPs were the most relevant. The normality of hematological variables and the concentration of each LM were examined by the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. Pearson correlation was used if the data followed a normal distribution, or Spearman correlation was applied for the correlation analysis, with P < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. The data were analyzed and plots were generated using R version 4.2.2.

By applying, evaluating and refining tools to measure the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics every year, WHO and Member States can be better prepared. WHO aims to provide a structured approach for countries to visualize and interpret data. This approach offers the scientific evidence necessary to communicate risk and inform the timing, scale, emphasis, intensity and urgency of response actions. The pandemic and seasonal influenza severity assessment (PISA) updated guidance seeks to achieve precisely this goal, ensuring that data visualization and interpretation lead to effective decision-making and response planning.The aims of the influenza severity assessment at the national level are to: describe the epidemiological situation in the context of historical data and assess the severity of an influenza epidemic or pandemic based on all reliable information; inform national and global risk assessments; and apprise public health preparedness, response and recovery measures, as well as resource allocation.PISA involves using historical data to set thresholds which define levels of activity ranging from “below baseline” through to “extraordinary”. By comparing current activity to these thresholds, countries can put not only pandemics but also regular seasonal epidemics into perspective.WHO has recently published the second edition of the PISA guidance (the first edition was published in 2017). This revision takes into account changes in respiratory virus surveillance, as well as lessons learned by countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was developed in alignment with WHO initiatives and recommendations such as the WHO Global Influenza Strategy (2019-2030), the Preparedness and Resilience to Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative, the Mosaic Respiratory Surveillance Framework, and the WHO interim guidance for the integration of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virologic surveillance.Updates to the guidance broaden the scope of PISA so that the methodology can be applied to syndromic data (such as influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)) as well as influenza-confirmed activity (such as influenza-confirmed ILI or influenza-confirmed SARI). The PISA approach can also be applied to assess the activity of other epidemic-prone respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2, as well as future respiratory viruses of pandemic potential.The impact of epidemics on healthcare capacity has been added as a new indicator to increase the utility of PISA thresholds for assessing the need for public health and social measures. There are now four indicators that countries can select to describe different aspects of severity using their existing surveillance data: transmissibility, seriousness of disease, morbidity and mortality and impact on healthcare capacity. The guidance was developed through the continuing contributions of the PISA technical working group and a consultation meeting in June 2023 with external experts from all six WHO regions as well as WHO staff from headquarters and regional offices.Between March and June 2024, in-person training workshops on the new guidance have been conducted in seven countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Oman and the United Republic of Tanzania), with further workshops planned.

Moderna will leverage its domestic large-scale commercial mRNA vaccine manufacturing platforms and ongoing development of mRNA-based seasonal flu vaccines.The award comes as officials confirm more H5N1 avian flu in US cattle and poultry.Phase 3 trials could begin next yearDawn O'Connell, JD, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, said the $176 million represents the base award and the agreement contains other options that allow the government to quickly pivot funding to other mRNA vaccines when new flu strains or other disease threats emerge. She said the H5 vaccine is in clinical development and that phase 3 trials could begin in 2025.The award also includes an option for large-scale production and pandemic response. At today's briefing, Robert Johnson, PhD, director of medical countermeasures at BARDA, said it's too early to project production capacity. He said the number will depend on dosing information, which should be available later this year. Moderna said in a statement today that in 2023 it launched a phase 1/2 clinical trial of an investigational pandemic flu vaccine in healthy adults, which included candidates against H5 and H7 viruses, and results are expected this year. Meanwhile, fill-and-finish activity continues on vaccine from bulk stocks of candidate cell-based adjuvanted H5 vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, and O'Connell said the first of 4.8 million doses will be available in the middle of July, with production continuing through August. This is faster than the government had anticipated. Officials weigh early vaccine use for high-risk groupsAs vaccine production and planning continues, federal officials are in ongoing discussions about how to best protect farm workers and others exposed to cattle.Nirav Shah, MD, JD, principal deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said if the main goal is to prevent transmission, using antiviral drugs for patients and their contacts may achieve the goal faster than a vaccine. He said health officials are weighing the risks and benefits, as well as whether people exposed to infected cattle will accept the vaccine.So far, more than 780 people exposed to cattle have been monitored, and at least 53 with flulike illness symptoms have been tested for H5, he said. At this point, the number of confirmed human infections linked to the virus in dairy cows stands at three.Shah said the nation has an ample supply of H5 tests, with 750,000 available and 1.2 million coming online over the next several months.More detections in cattle and poultryThe official number of confirmed cases of H5N1 in dairy herds remains at 137 in 12 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. But individual affected states have announced a few more detections, including Minnesota, with another infected herd in Benton County, located in the state's central region. Regarding poultry, USDA APHIS added confirmations of four more H5N1 outbreaks in flocks in two states, Colorado and Minnesota, both of which are also battling the virus in dairy cattle. Colorado's two outbreaks involve backyard flocks in Morgan and Larimer counties, and Minnesota's two outbreaks involve commercial turkey farms in Otter Tail and Swift counties.At today's media briefing, federal officials were asked about recent reports of wastewater detections of H5 avian flu virus in San Francisco. Tracking from WastewaterSCAN has detected positive findings that aligned with outbreaks in cattle in six states, except for some detections in California. Shah said San Franciso isn't known for dairy industries, and one hypothesis is a potential link to live-bird markets. Since 2022, USDA APHIS has reported sporadic highly pathogenic avian flu detections at live-bird markets in five states, with the most recent one reported from San Francisco in May of this year.

ZakiThe US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), will provide approximately $176 million to Moderna for development of an mRNA-based pandemic H5 (avian) influenza vaccine.1 This subtype of influenza virus causes a highly infectious, severe disease in birds called avian influenza and poses a risk for spillover into the human population. The agreement also includes additional options to prepare and accelerate a response to future public health threats.2"mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic," Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel, said. "We are pleased to continue our collaboration with BARDA to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks."2The award was made through BARDA’s new Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) Consortium, managed by Advanced Technology International (ATI). The RRPV is a 10-year, multi-purpose acquisition vehicle and consortium partnership designed to support advanced research and development of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The consortium creates flexible, strategic partnerships with industry that foster innovation and promote collaboration.1Avian Influenza CasesOn Wednesday, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment confirmed a case in its state of avian influenza and this marks the fourth case overall in the United States. 3Thus far all cases have been zoonotic and no transmission from human to human has been reported. In 3 of the 4 confirmed cases in the US, the patients have had conjunctivitis as the main presenting symptom. All patients have recovered and all were working with cows in traditional farm settings.3Concerns About Vaccine AvailabilityRight now some H5N1 vaccines are being stockpiled by the US government in case of a human outbreak, but nothing has been reported in terms of how many are available. Obviously, with the federal government looking to secure more vaccines, there does not appear to be enough if a widespread outbreak does occur. This new award to Moderna looks to address that.“We have successfully taken lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and used them to better prepare for future public health crises. As part of that, we continue to develop new vaccines and other tools to help address influenza and bolster our pandemic response capabilities,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.In terms of who should get vaccinated if transmission does become human-to human, medical providers may be the first in line for such immunizations. “The absolute use of those would be detailed in pandemic plans, but you can imagine if this virus started to go human-to-human, I think the first line responders and healthcare workers might be first in line to receive this,” Richard Webby, PhD, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds and Department of Host-Microbe Interactions, Division of Virology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital said in a previous interview with Contagion. “I mean, if this virus continues to circulate in cows, maybe you can make an argument for people in close contact with those infected herds as well. But I think that's a little less likely. The risk is still very low.”References1.HHS provides $176 million to develop pandemic influenza mRNA-based vaccine. HHS press release. July 4, 2024.

Please turn on JavaScript and try again. Toggle navigation H5N1 mRNA Vaccines Frequently Asked Questions July 2, 2024 ASPR has undertaken a partnership with Moderna to support advanced development and, if needed, procurement, of an mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine. mRNA technology was successfully leveraged during the COVID-19 response, and it allows for accelerated initial vaccine development and complements current rapid production capabilities. While the base award will support a vaccine for H5N1, the contract also supports development and procurement of a vaccine targeting new strains of influenza or other emerging infectious diseases. This approach enables flexibility to pivot to new threats in the ever-changing global public health landscape. ASPR has entered this agreement as part of the agency’s ongoing preparedness actions. Currently, risk to human health from H5N1 is low, and vaccination is not recommended for any segment of the population. FAQs: What are the safety risks associated with messenger RNA, also called mRNA, vaccines? Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades, and mRNA was one of the technologies used to rapidly develop and manufacture safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. As with all licensed vaccines, mRNA vaccines undergo multiple clinical trials to generate safety data for FDA review prior to licensure. Will mRNA vaccines be used to protect against H5N1? Currently, H5N1 is circulating in birds and in some dairy cows, and at this time, risk to human health is low and vaccination is not recommended for any segment of the population. If successfully developed, a licensed mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine would further improve U.S. government response capabilities. If ASPR already has a stockpile of pre-pandemic influenza vaccine, why is this new vaccine needed? ASPR recently announced that we are labeling and filling H5 vaccine manufactured from a well-matched candidate vaccine virus as part of preparedness efforts. This is a cell-based vaccine, another technology licensed for seasonal and pre-pandemic vaccines supported by ASPR. An mRNA-based licensed pandemic influenza vaccine could further improve response timelines. This capability would establish a fourth platform option to the already licensed egg-, cell-, and recombinant protein-based approaches for influenza vaccine production. Could this award be used for other influenza or virus strains? The base award will support advanced development towards FDA approval of a vaccine for H5; however, this agreement was structured such that it could readily support the development and procurement of a vaccine targeting novel strains of influenza or other emerging infectious viruses. How long before this vaccine would be ready for distribution? As with all vaccine development, timelines will be data driven. This vaccine is early in clinical development, with ongoing Phase I clinical trial data expected later this year. Phase three trials are projected to start in 2025. Does BARDA expect to make any additional awards to mRNA vaccine developers? Under Federal Acquisition Regulations, federal agencies are prohibited from disclosing any information on potential future contracts. Uptake for mRNA vaccines has slowed since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Why pursue these technologies without a stronger vaccine market? mRNA is a proven platform for accelerated development, and this partnership will help enable access to this capability. ​ Home Contact Us ASPR Archive Accessibility Privacy Policies Disclaimer HHS Viewers & Players HHS Plain Language FOIA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy HHS, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) 200 Independence Ave., Washington, DC 20201Pasteurization Inactivates Highly Infectious Avian Flu in Milk | ASM.org Skip to main content Login Browse ASM Search American Society for Microbiology Back Who We Are About ASM Our Strategic Roadmap American Academy of Microbiology Board of Directors Council on Microbial Sciences Governance Finances Corporate Council What We Do Advocacy Global Public Health Programs Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Ethics Membership Join/Renew Member Benefits Member Directory ASM Connect Edit Profile Events ASM Microbe Clinical Virology Symposium ASMCUE ASM NGS Conference ASM Conference on Biofilms See All Events Careers & Education Careers Education Science Jobs Professional Development Careers in CPHM Publications Microcosm Books Journals Academy Reports Resource Pages Science Topics Antimicrobial Agents & Resistance Applied & Environmental Science Clinical & Public Health Microbiology Clinical Infections & Vaccines Ecology, Evolution & Biodiversity Host-Microbe Biology Molecular Biology & Physiology Home Press Releases Pasteurization Inactivates Highly Infectious Avian Flu in Milk Pasteurization Inactivates Highly Infectious Avian Flu in Milk July 3, 2024 Highlights: • In late March 2024, H5N1 bird flu was detected in dairy cattle and then in raw milk. • Researchers tested hundreds of milk products from dozens of states for the virus. • No infectious virus was found in pasteurized milk products. • Non-infectious traces of viral genetic material were found in 20% of samples. Washington, D.C.—In March 2024, dairy cows in Texas were found to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1), in the first known case of the virus spreading to cattle. Since then, H5N1 has been found in about 200 animals—and 3 people—across 12 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus was soon detected in raw milk, leading researchers to investigate whether dairy products pose a risk to consumers. “How far is the virus getting through?” asked Erica Spackman, Ph.D., a virologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Athens, Ga. To find out, she and her collaborators tested nearly 300 milk products from 132 processors. The researchers found no infectious virus in the samples, Spackman and her collaborators report this week in the Journal of Virology, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. “Milk is safe,” she said. “Just like bacterial pathogens that occur in milk, or other viruses that could occur in milk, the sanitation processes that are in place are getting rid of the pathogens.” The milk processing pipeline includes multiple layers of protection, Spackman said. Microbiological surveillance of milk products can identify pathogens, and milk from cows with mastitis or other disease conditions does not enter the food supply. Finally, heating during the pasteurization process can destroy H5N1 and other, more common bacterial pathogens. Avian influenza (bird flu) primarily infects and spreads among migratory birds and can be transmitted to domestic poultry, but the virus has been detected in other animals as well. Recently, those have included cats, dogs and juvenile goats, as well as a polar bear in Alaska and elephant and fur seals in the Antarctic. However, the discovery of H5N1 on dairy farms in March was a surprise—the virus had never been found in dairy cattle before. Soon after the discovery, diagnostic testing revealed that an infectious form of the virus was present in raw milk, suggesting the virus passes from cow to milk. That finding led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the USDA to investigate whether pasteurization effectively eliminated risks posed to consumers. Between April 18 and April 22, 2024, researchers used real-time PCR to analyze 297 samples of pasteurized retail milk products, including 23 types of products, collected from 17 states. “We did a viability assay to detect live virus and went as sensitive as we could to get even the least little bit of virus, but couldn’t detect anything,” Spackman said. Using PCR, the researchers did identify viral genetic material in 20% of samples. “It looks like the virus is just totally inactivated,” she said. Spackman said the new findings “give us reassurance that what we have been doing—pasteurization—is keeping us safe from what we don’t know about.” ### The American Society for Microbiology is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of over 32,000 scientists and health practitioners.

NIAID As the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows enters its fourth month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking steps to ramp up the nation’s capacity to test for the virus in people. In a call with reporters Tuesday, Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low at this time. But given that the virus is showing no signs of slowing its push deeper into the U.S. cattle population — threatening to create lasting risks to dairy workers and giving it more chances to evolve in ways that make it better at spreading to and among humans — the agency is looking to increase the number and types of tests that can effectively detect H5N1 infections in people.advertisement “We need to stay prepared for the possibility of an expansion of the H5N1 outbreak in humans,” Shah said. Currently, the CDC’s bird flu test is the only one the Food and Drug Administration has authorized for use. Shah said the agency has distributed 750,000 of these tests to local public public health labs, and is expecting 1.2 million more to come online in the next two to three months. But should the virus begin to spread easily among humans, testing needs may quickly outpace existing public health laboratory capacity. Which is why the CDC is also working with commercial labs to build additional tests. So far, the agency has given eight companies licenses for its tests, Shah said. Three additional licenses are pending and another four companies are in the process of applying for licenses.advertisement The effort appears to be aimed at avoiding mistakes the federal government made in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, when testing failures — including a slow recruitment of commercial labs to the response — allowed the coronavirus to spread undetected.

Privacy Policy The CDC and local health departments have tried to boost bird flu testing among farmworkers — including with financial incentives — but uptake has been slow. Since the outbreak was recognized in March, the U.S. has tested only 53 people for novel influenza strains, which would include H5N1, according to the CDC’s latest figures. Three people — one farmworker in Texas and two in Michigan — tested positive for the virus. Two experienced only minor symptoms, namely conjunctivitis, or pink eye. The third had more traditional flu-like respiratory symptoms, and all three recovered. Many dairy workers are immigrants, who live in rural areas with little access to transportation and no sick leave, making it difficult to travel to health care providers for testing and treatment. While acknowledging these challenges, public health experts have criticized the lack of testing, which is making it difficult to know how many farmworkers have been infected. Insufficient surveillance could also mean public health agencies might miss signs of human-to-human spread of the H5N1 virus. The labs granted CDC licenses will still have to have their versions of the CDC test cleared for use by the FDA before they can be rolled out. Part of that approval process is proving the tests work. And to conduct such validation studies, labs and diagnostics manufacturers need control materials — samples that carry enough of the virus that they will light up a test as positive. That gets more complicated with a flu virus like H5N1, which is highly pathogenic, and therefore requires additional biosafety controls to work with in a lab. Related: Three months into bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows, experts see deep-rooted problems in response To streamline the test validation process, the CDC is working to develop a non-virulent form of the control material, which it plans to provide to diagnostics manufacturers and commercial testing labs, although Shah did not provide a timeline for when they would become available. The agency is also entreating the diagnostics industry to develop additional kinds of H5N1 tests, to broaden the nation’s portfolio of viral detection capabilities. On June 10, CDC put out a call for innovative testing solutions that can be easily ramped up to handle at least a million samples by the end of this year. The agency is now reviewing those applications, Shah said, with a goal of awarding funding to the winning companies by the end of August. On Tuesday, the federal government also announced plans to support the development of messenger RNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines, including those that target H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority, awarded Moderna $176 million to accelerate clinical testing of its pandemic vaccines, which are expected to enter a Phase 3 trial sometime next year. The U.S. government already has vaccine contracts and stockpiles of H5 vaccines made using other platforms by other manufacturers, including CSL Seqirus and Sanofi. Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department for Health and Human Services, said at the press briefing that nearly 5 million doses of H5 vaccine stored in bulk in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile are now in the process of being put into vials, in case it’s needed. “Our expectation is that those first doses will begin coming off the line in the middle of this month,” O’Connell said. “We remain extraordinarily watchful regarding the situation that we’re all tracking regarding dairy cows and working very closely with our other public health partners trying to understand if and when we should move these vaccines from the lines and out into deployment.” As of Tuesday, the Department of Agriculture has reported infections in 137 dairy herds in 12 states. That tally doesn’t include four additional infected herds reported by state authorities this week, including one each in Iowa and Minnesota and two in Colorado. With 27 outbreaks in Colorado — most of which have occurred in the last month — that state has now seen nearly one-quarter of its dairy herds infected with the virus.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:A Colorado resident is the fourth person to test positive for bird flu in the current outbreak.More than 130 dairy cattle herds in 12 states have been affected.A dairy farm worker in Colorado became the fourth person to test positive for avian influenza in the ongoing outbreak affecting dairy cows in the United States, the CDC announced Wednesday.The CDC said it still considers the risk to the general public to be low. A Colorado dairy farm worker is the fourth person to test positive for avian influenza during the current outbreak, the CDC said on Wednesday. Image: Adobe Stock Just like the previous three cases, the Colorado resident works on a dairy farm where cows have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1), also called “bird flu,” according to the CDC. More than 130 cattle herds in 12 states have been impacted by the outbreak, but the CDC said it has not detected any unusual activity in its influenza surveillance systems — which include wastewater surveillance — indicating there is no widespread outbreak occurring among people.As with two of the first three human cases detected in this outbreak, the Colorado dairy worker experienced only eye symptoms and was treated with oseltamivir, recovering fully, the CDC said.The worker, who was being monitored for H5N1 based on their exposure to infected cattle, reported their symptoms to state health officials. CDC testing identified the infection as being caused by an H5 virus. Sequencing is still underway to determine the virus’ neuraminidase — the “N” in influenza subtypes.Healio has been following the H5N1 outbreak closely.

Hillsborough County Pet owners urged to take precautions as local shelters fight canine influenza by: Melissa Marino Posted: Jul 1, 2024 / 05:33 PM EDT Updated: Jul 2, 2024 / 06:17 AM EDT by: Melissa Marino Posted: Jul 1, 2024 / 05:33 PM EDT Updated: Jul 2, 2024 / 06:17 AM EDT SHARE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) — Dogs have started to return to the Pet Resource Center as the shelter works to stop an outbreak of canine influenza. “There’s already been dogs that have died in Hillsborough County,” said Dr. Cynda Crawford, DVM, PhD with the University of Florida Shelter Medicine Program and College of Veterinary Medicine. Crawford co-discovered the canine influenza virus and helped develop the vaccine. She’s working with the Pet Resource Center to help stop the spread of the virus. Last week, PRC was one of several shelters that took drastic measures by shutting down and moving dogs to another facility to quarantine.The Humane Society of Tampa Bay is also not accepting new dogs due to an outbreak of canine influenza. The highly contagious virus has symptoms similar to the flu in adults. “Lots of coughing for two weeks or more, as well as a runny nose or nasal discharge and just not feeling that great,” Crawford said. Crawford said it’s not just shelter dogs at risk. She’s urging owners to get their dogs vaccinated and limit their social interaction. “The dogs that are at risk for exposure [are] those that socialize with other dogs, in dog parks, in the dog daycare centers, going to PetSmart,” Crawford said. For dogs who do get sick, Crawford said they need to be confined at home for a minimum of two weeks. If they don’t seem to be recovering, call a vet. “A certain proportion of them will progress to pneumonia and this pneumonia can be life-threatening,” Crawford said. A spokesperson for the Pet Resource Center said the shelter reopened to the public for cat adoptions, cat intakes, and cat fostering on Monday. PRC received the first batch of test results over the weekend and moved 59 dogs back on-site Monday morning. These dogs are in B and C kennels and will be available for adoption starting July 2. The dogs that have been offsite and returned to PRC all have an “I’m Back” sticker on their profile pictures on ADOPT. PRC said staff worked extremely hard over the past few days to clean PRC top to bottom. Dogs off-site are all doing well, and we will be sending off more tests this week to see who can return in the next wave. According to a spokesperson for the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, the facility is still not accepting any stray or owner-surrendered dogs until July 13. As room allows, HSTB is still taking stray or owner-surrendered cats, rabbits, pocket pets, and exotics. Adoptions are still open for all species, including dogs currently in HSTB care that are healthy. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

(KOIN) – Amid county fair season, Oregon health officials issued safety tips to prevent the spread of avian influenza, also known as bird flu, and other diseases that can be spread by farm animals. According to the Oregon Health Authority, “common-sense” measures for avoiding exposure to the disease include washing hands often and avoiding eating or drinking while in animal areas. “County fairs are so important for celebrating agriculture education and the dedication of Oregon’s agricultural communities. Farm animal exhibits are a big part of what makes these events so fun,” said Dean Sidelinger, health officer and state epidemiologist at OHA. “There are a few common-sense actions people can take to keep the fun going while preventing exposure to germs animals carry that can make people sick.” Beaverton police vehicle hit by IED, suspect at large According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, more than 130 dairy cow herds in 12 states have confirmed cases of H5N1 bird flu. No dairy cow or human cases have been reported in Oregon, officials said. To reduce risk of infection, the CDC recommends people stay home if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, keeping toys, pacifiers, cups, and strollers out of animal areas, avoiding eating or drinking in animal areas, and washing hands often with soap and water after touching animals or equipment in their environment.

Flight diverts after Oregon man is accused of exposing himself, urinating in aisle To prevent the spread of bird flu, farm animals should stay at fairs for short periods of time, ideally three days or less, according to the CDC, adding, animals that are sick should be kept home. Bird flu symptoms to watch for in animals include loss of appetite, fever, eye redness, cough, runny nose, or the appearance of discomfort. Health experts recommend disinfecting all feeders, waterers, and other equipment and show supplies before and after bringing animals to a fair, and to not share equipment used for other animals.

Bird flu has been infecting cows in the U.S. Getty Images Key Facts Moderna said the U.S. government funds will bankroll “late-stage development for an mRNA-based vaccine” against H5 influenza virus to enable a “pre-pandemic” shot to be licensed. Flu viruses are classified by two proteins on the surface of the virus, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), and the research will cover the new strain of H5N1 avian influenza that has been spreading among animals worldwide since 2020 but causing increasing alarm among experts this year as it began showing up in more mammals, notably livestock like dairy cattle in the U.S., as well as occasionally infecting humans. Funding for the project comes from the government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, often just Barda, the agency tasked with defending the country against future health threats like pandemics, emerging infectious diseases, biological and chemical weapons and other public health emergencies. Moderna began early stage clinical trials of an mRNA pandemic flu vaccine in 2023, including shots against the H5 and H7 strains known for their potential to mutate into highly virulent and lethal forms, and said results from the study are expected at some point in 2024. These results will inform late-stage development plans for the vaccine candidate, Moderna said. The agreement includes “additional options to prepare and accelerate a response to future public health threats,” Moderna added, though the company did not specify details of the agreement or elaborate on the nature of the potential threats it would cover. Crucial Quote Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said “mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks,” all of which were demonstrated during their rapid development and rollout during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Moderna also received Barda funding. “We are pleased to continue our collaboration with Barda to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks,” Bancel said. Key Background The COVID-19 pandemic marked a breakthrough for mRNA vaccines and it marked the first time they had been approved despite decades of research from hundreds of scientists. Manufacturing and developing vaccines has historically been a relatively tortuous affair, probably lasting at least a decade for a completely new shot. This is largely due to the logistics involved in safely developing and testing shots against new strains, as well as the nature of producing them at scale. The mRNA vaccines shone in the pandemic because they can be designed, altered and produced far more quickly than traditional vaccines and, through companies like Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech, they were the first to reach the market in the U.S. and many other countries. As an adaptable and quickly mobilized platform, mRNA vaccines have naturally been tapped as a potential countermeasure for emerging threats as well, in addition to a slew of other commonplace infectious diseases as well, such as flu and RSV, as well as for treating cancer. Moderna was one of several private companies to work with Barda on COVID-19 countermeasures during the pandemic, including ramping up production of its highly successful Spikevax shot and developing boosters targeting variants like omicron. Tangent Barda is funding the Moderna mRNA project through a newly formed Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) consortium of medical technology, vaccines and therapeutics specialists designed to “address evolving needs including pandemic influenza, emerging infectious diseases, and other biological threats.” The group made its first award of $25.5 million in May to clinical research group Allucent in order to study next-generation COVID-19 booster vaccines. In June, it disbursed around $550 million to four companies to fund clinical trials into next-generation coronavirus vaccines, including several needleless options and notably a $450 million grant to Vaxart for its oral vaccine candidate. The group is also seeking laboratories that would be able to perform testing in the event of a viral pandemic, including influenza. News Peg H5N1 has spread globally among wild bird populations for several years now but has started showing up more in mammals, such as marine wildlife and domestic herds like dairy cattle in the U.S. H5 bird flu is of particular concern to scientists as it has demonstrated an ability to evolve into highly pathogenic and lethal forms in the past and this strain has devastated both domestic and wild bird populations worldwide. The virus is also considered to have pandemic potential among humans, which could cause devastation on a scale that could easily eclipse COVID-19. How Could Avian Flu (h5n1) Turn Into A Pandemic? Such a pandemic would require the virus to infect humans and consistently spread between them without animals acting as an intermediary. Though there have been several instances of H5 infections in humans in the U.S. in recent months, scientists stress the risks of outbreaks are limited as the virus has been contracted following close contact with animals and hasn’t spread to others, suggesting infection is neither easy nor readily transmitted. Increasing infections among and between mammals are cause for concern, however, as they show an adaptation to a biological system more closely resembling that of humans. Infections occurring among domestic animals, notably dairy herds, compound concern, as these are animals a relatively large number of people come into contact with in some shape or form, such as workers or in dairy products that may contain the virus, increasing the chances of exposure and mutation into a form that takes off. Risks are difficult to quantify on account of the many unknown variables at play. Experts and officials have claimed we are largely flying in the dark on account of the lack of data surrounding the outbreak and many have criticized lax testing requirements and containment measures put in place to stem the tide.

Washington (Credit: Getty Images) Share this Article Facebook Twitter Reddit Email You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license. Tags birdsinfluenza University University of Washington Experts have answers for you about avian flu and how it could become a problem for humans. Four years ago, as attention locked onto COVID-19, another virus began circling the globe. A major outbreak of a new strain of bird flu—formally named Influenza A virus subtype H5N1—has since killed millions of wild birds and infected poultry, dairy cattle, domestic cats, and a small number of humans. In the United States, four people have contracted the virus. The most recently confirmed case, a dairy worker in Michigan, was the first to experience flu-like respiratory symptoms. For now, federal health officials have deemed the virus a low risk to public health, while launching new studies and monitoring the virus’s spread. But what exactly are public health officials looking for? How is this virus different from previous H5N1 outbreaks? And how can a bird flu become humanity’s problem, anyway? University of Washington experts Peter Rabinowitz, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and of family medicine, and Julianne Meisner, an assistant professor of epidemiology and of global health, have some answers. They are director and deputy director, respectively, of UW’s Center for One Health Research, which studies the connections between the health of people, animals and our shared environment. Here, they dig into the questions surrounding avian flu: Q Peter, you recently called the current H5N1 outbreak “unprecedented” for bird flu. What makes this outbreak different, and why is it drawing so much attention from health officials? A Peter Rabinowitz: Thirty years ago, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were rare in birds. Beginning around 2003, a deadly strain of H5N1 avian influenza started spreading widely, but mostly impacted domestic poultry. Now this recent strain of H5N1 that has been circulating worldwide for the past two years is unprecedented in its ability to affect mammals. Q The H5N1 virus started with birds before “jumping” to dairy cattle and now a handful of humans. How does a virus “jump” between species like that, and what makes certain species vulnerable while others seem to resist the virus? A PR: As they circulate, influenza viruses are continually changing some of their genetic material, acquiring new mutations in a process known as “genetic drift.” Sometimes when two different strains of a virus are present in the same host human (or animal), they can “recombine” to create a quite different strain. Q Health officials have said the chances of H5N1 becoming a major threat to humans are minimal, but that they’re monitoring the situation for any changes. What are they looking for? A PR: Health officials are looking for evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission in non-human mammals, and any evidence of person-to-person transmission, which could be a definite warning about H5N1’s potential to become an epidemic. Q The earliest cases of H5N1 in humans were mild—two dairy workers with eye infections—but the most recent case appears to be causing respiratory symptoms. That’s triggered alarm, of course, but what does that say about how the virus is evolving? A Julianne Meisner: The location of symptoms can sometimes—though not always—tell us something about transmission. When symptoms are restricted to just the eye, it’s likely that transmission would require contact with the tissues around or fluids from the eye, similar to how pink eye (conjunctivitis) is transmitted. When health professionals see respiratory symptoms, we get concerned about transmission through droplets or aerosols. Because breathing is something every one of us needs to do, all of the time, respiratory transmission is incredibly efficient, and difficult to avoid. Also, some respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, can propel virus particles further, increasing the efficiency of transmission. Q Much has been made of H5N1 as the next possible pandemic. Should that happen, are there lessons we’ve learned from the COVID-19 pandemic that could help us navigate this one? A PR: Yes, the lessons learned from COVID-19 in terms of rapid development of vaccines and the effectiveness of control measures such as masks would allow us to respond quickly. Unfortunately, everyone is quite tired of hearing about pandemics, so a challenge would be to capitalize on the helpful lessons learned and find a way to avoid misinformation and public backlash to a public health response. JM: While COVID has been very divisive in many ways, it has also familiarized many people with public health: People now know how to navigate dashboards on the health department’s website, and we have muscle memory regarding social distancing, mask wearing, handwashing, etc. Basic epidemiology principles such as quarantine, isolation, transmission rate, etc. are familiar to the general public now. But there is also a lot of fatigue, as Peter mentions, which may make it harder to implement public health countermeasures if they become necessary. Q You both study the connection between human and animal health. It’s easy for people to understand that animal diseases can spread to humans, but how else should we consider that relationship? A PR: We should raise awareness about the terrible impact of the current avian influenza outbreak on wild and domestic animal populations: millions of poultry dying because of spreading infections, also hundreds of thousands of wild birds and mammals, including sea mammals such as sea lions and seals. An event like this represents a threat to biodiversity and the health of ecosystems, which we have learned is extremely important for human health. The concept of “One Health” stresses these vital connections between the health of humans, other species, and our shared ecosystems.

What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.Moderna is set to receive $176 million in federal funding to develop a human vaccine against bird flu following outbreaks of the virus in dairy cows across several states, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday.The U.S. has documented three cases of humans with bird flu in 2024. All had regular contact with dairy cows. As of July, more than 130 herds across 12 states have seen infected cows.More: Be 'alert but not alarmed' about bird flu, CDC official urges.The HHS award to the American vaccine manufacturer will go toward developing an mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccine. Moderna’s candidate for the vaccine draws from mRNA technology used successfully during the COVID-19 response, resulting in one of the first Food and Drug Administration-authorized COVID-19 vaccines ultimately licensed by the FDA, HHS said. Vaccines from mRNA can complement traditional vaccine technologies during a pandemic influenza emergency response. This is a concern with H5N1 avian influenza, even if the current risk to human health remains low.“We have successfully taken lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and used them to better prepare for future public health crises,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “As part of that, we continue to develop new vaccines and other tools to help address influenza and bolster our pandemic response capabilities.” The funding, made through the federal Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle, allows Moderna to enhance vaccine response capability, an HHS news release said. This includes using large-scale commercial mRNA manufacturing and ongoing seasonal flu vaccine development. HHS secured a fair pricing agreement to ensure cost savings access to vaccines. Moderna will prepare materials and conduct clinical trials to collect safety and immune response data to support FDA approval and, eventually, potentially scale response with commercial production in a public health emergency.The award also enables rapid development of mRNA vaccine targeted to various influenza virus subtypes, or strains, with pandemic potential. Development and manufacturing can pivot quickly, if needed to address other emerging infectious diseases, HHS said.Avian influenza timeline: From chickens to foxes, here's how bird flu is spreading across the USIf successfully developed, Moderna’s mRNA-based pandemic flu vaccine could improve response times if a new virus strain emerges. HHS pointed to the swine flu pandemic in 2009. In 2023, the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of HHS, requested proposals from Moderna and other companies to develop mRNA vaccines for potential public health emergencies caused by influenza viruses, including H5N1.In a news release, Moderna said it initiated a study to look at vaccine safety and immunogenicity for pandemic influenza in people 18 and older. This included vaccine candidates against H5 and H7 bird flu viruses. Results are expected in 2024 to inform further study development plans, Moderna said.In the U.S., there have been four human cases of bird flu, including three in 2024. Health officials said the risk to the general population remains low, although dairy workers and others working near infected cows face heightened risk.Beyond the announcement for Moderna, federal health officials have already begun emergency preparedness against bird flu.The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), within HHS, already has 4.8 million doses of bird flu vaccine being poured into vials that could be used pending FDA approval, Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary of ASPR, said in a call with reporters Tuesday morning. Those first doses could be ready by mid-July through August. Still, vaccines may not be the best solution to address bird flu should the outbreak spread further into humans, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Other options to contain bird flu may be used, particularly if more farm workers get sick. These could include widespread use of antivirals to fight the virus, for example. No decision has been made on what the best response is, Shah added.

As part of the global efforts to expand the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to include other respiratory pathogens, WHO SEARO, together with partners, has been supporting several countries across the region to integrate RSV into the existing national influenza-like illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) sentinel surveillance systems. To operationalize the integration of RSV surveillance, further efforts are needed to increase technical capacities for RSV molecular testing and genomic sequencing. This will inform RSV seasonality, virus evolution, and transmission, aiming for a better understanding of the factors that influence virus circulation and disease severity.In June 2024, an international workshop on influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) was jointly organized in Pune, India by the National Influenza Centre (NIC), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (WHO CCRRI) in Melbourne, Australia, with support from the WHO Southeast Asia Regional Office (SEARO).This one-week hands-on training primarily focused on the genomic surveillance of Influenza and RSV, including wet lab training, PCR setup, and bioinformatics analysis, as well as quality control of data submission to public domains. The training was facilitated by experts from the WHO CCRRI in Australia and the NIC, ICMR-NIV in IndiaActive participation in hands-on trainings (Photo Credit: NIV/Pune)During the workshop, Dr. Varsha Potdar, head of the NIC at ICMR-NIV, highlighted its role in strengthening regional disease surveillance through advanced genomics analysis techniques across SEAR member states. Additionally, Dr. Naveen Kumar, Director of ICMR-NIV, emphasized the importance of fostering collaborations and working across borders to build capacities to detect and contain future pandemics.The workshop concluded successfully with participation from 9 representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. These participants acquired valuable skills and knowledge, thereby contributing to strengthened surveillance and response systems against influenza and RSV in the region.

What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.A fourth person has been infected with bird flu this year as an outbreak among dairy cows continues across the U.S., federal health officials announced Wednesday. The four people who contracted the virus live in three states.The case of a Colorado dairy worker is the state's first this year. Health officials identified the first U.S. case of avian influenza in 2022, in an incarcerated person who was exposed to infected chickens at a Colorado poultry farm. The first case in the 2024 outbreak was identified in Texas, and two cases in Michigan followed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Avian influenza timeline: From chickens to foxes, here's how bird flu is spreading across the USColorado health officials said the man, who worked on a dairy farm in northeast Colorado, had direct contact with cattle infected with avian influenza. He was being monitored because of his work exposure to H5N1 virus-infected cows. He did not have contact with the three people infected earlier this year in Texas and Michigan.The Colorado man developed symptoms in late June, said Sasha Geffen, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Health and Environment, in an email. The next day, the man reported his illness to state health officials, who found he had mild symptoms of conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, a condition present in other workers who became sick this year.He was tested two days after symptoms began, but results of his infection by state laboratories were inconclusive, Geffen said. After officials sent specimens to the CDC for testing, the CDC learned on Tuesday the man tested positive for avian influenza. He received oseltmavir, an antiviral drug, and has recovered, CDC said. Colorado officials maintain the current public health risk remains low. The CDC also said the Colorado case doesn’t change the federal health agency’s assessment that the overall risk to the general public is low. The subtype of the bird flu virus the Colorado man has will be determined after genetic sequencing, CDC officials said. That information could be released in the next couple of days and help officials identify changes to the virus and calculate the risk.“Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist for Colorado's public health department, said in a statement. “Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals.”The people who tested positive for bird flu this year were all dairy workers at farms where cows had tested positive for bird flu, the CDC said. Officials said this underscores that it is crucial to take precautions if you have extensive exposure to infected animals. Working in these circumstances poses a greater risk of infection.Vaccines: Bird flu vaccine development funds awarded to Moderna amid multistate outbreakOver 130 U.S. dairy herds have been found to have infected cattle in 12 states. Bird flu is common among wild birds, and officials believe the virus spilled over from wild birds to cows. The infected cows then transmitted it to four people in close contact with the animals.There have been no human-to-human transmissions during this outbreak. Such a finding would stoke alarm among public health officials.Earlier this week, federal officials announced plans to ramp up vaccine production for bird flu vaccines in case more humans become infected.

Moderna announced Tuesday it has been awarded $176 million by the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle, a consortium funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, to help speed up the development of a mRNA vaccine to help fight avian flu.The company announced that the funds are intended to assist the late-stage development and licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine for H5N1 influenza, a highly infectious disease in birds that has been transmitted to humans. According to Moderna, the agreement will also include options to prepare and accelerate a response to future public health threats.Moderna initiated development of a vaccine candidate, mRNA-1018, in 2023. The candidate is currently in a Phase I/II study in adults 18 years and older and is being investigated in the H5 and H7 variants of avian flu. Results from the trial are expected sometime this year.Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and Moderna have worked together previously, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic when the company was awarded a $483 million contract to help advance its mRNA vaccine.“mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. “We are pleased to continue our collaboration with BARDA to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks.”The Centers for Disease Control reported in April 2024 that a person in the U.S. had tested positive for the H5N1 variant after being exposed to infected dairy cattle in Texas. However, this exposure did not increase the risk to humans and the CDC considers the threat to be low.Still, people who have close or prolonged exposure to infected birds or animals are at a greater risk. Last week, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that signs of H5 avian flu were found at three separate wastewater sights in the Bay Area.In May 2024, BARDA selected CSL Seqirus to complete the fill-and-finish process of a pre-pandemic vaccine as part of the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program to increase the number of vaccines on hand for a pre-pandemic response. CSL Seqirus will aim to deliver around 4.8 million doses of its vaccine, which is “matched” to the H5 strain. Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print Government Massachusetts Vaccines Moderna, Inc.

Scientists at both the FDA and USDA have submitted their manuscript (PDF) to the Journal of Food Protection for peer review prior to publication in the journal. Study: Inactivation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with high temperature short time continuous flow pasteurization and virus detection in bulk milk tanks. Image Credit: Terelyuk / Shutterstock This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication, the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources Background In March 2024, the highly pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza (H5N1 HPAI) virus was detected in dairy cow herds and raw cow milk in the U.S. The virus often causes deadly infections in poultry, commonly known as bird or avian flu. Wild birds primarily transmit the virus to domestic poultry and other birds and animals. Although this type of virus does not frequently infect humans, sporadic infections have been detected in humans. Scientists at the FDA and USDA conducted a study to estimate the amount of infectious HPAI virus in raw milk in infected states where herds tested positive for the HPAI virus. They also explored whether the FDA-approved commercial milk pasteurization process effectively inactivates the virus. The pasteurization process kills harmful pathogens by heating milk to a specific temperature for a specific time period. By making milk safer, the process has helped maintain American public health for over 100 years. Study design The FDA scientists collected 275 raw milk (unpasteurized) samples from multiple farms in four affected states. The USDA scientists tested these samples using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine the presence of viral RNA.

In the next phase of the study, scientists evaluated whether continuous-flow processing of raw milk at 72°C for 15 seconds can effectively eliminate the virus. These treatment conditions are commonly termed as "high-temperature-short-time" (HTST) or "flash pasteurization," representing the pasteurization treatment required by the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) that is most commonly utilized by the dairy industry in the U.S. The scientists used homogenized raw milk artificially contaminated with a viral concentration higher than that found in any raw milk samples (approximately 5 million viral particles per milliliter of milk). Inactivation studies commonly use high concentrations of viruses or bacteria to depict high levels of inactivation. The levels are comparable to those used in benchtop experiments. They processed contaminated milk in an HTST continuous-flow pasteurization system, which was designed to closely simulate commercial processing conditions (heating milk at 72°C for 15 seconds). Important observations Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detected H5N1 HPAI virus RNA in 57% of tested raw milk samples. Egg inoculation testing of qRT-PCR-positive samples revealed that 24.8% of them are positive for infectious viruses with an average concentration of about 3000 viral particles per milliliter of milk. No significant correlation was observed between qRT-PCR-estimated viral titer and quantified viable virus. Milk samples processed by the HTST continuous-flow pasteurization system showed complete virus inactivation. The analysis of samples collected in mid-process revealed that the virus was rapidly inactivated. Further analysis by FDA experts indicated that the pasteurization conditions could eliminate at least one trillion viral particles per milliliter of milk. Study significance The study finds that the HTST continuous-flow pasteurization system effectively eliminates the H5N1 HPAI virus from raw milk with a large margin of safety. Overall, the findings ensure the safety of commercial milk supply in the U.S. Stephen Walker, FDA's Consumer Safety Officer, said, "This commercial milk processing simulation study is notably different from some recent benchtop studies published by other institutions, which have shown mixed results regarding the sensitivity of the virus to thermal treatment. Other recent studies relied on benchtop equipment that was likely insufficient to simulate HTST processing conditions accurately. In contrast, the study's results announced today strongly indicate that the virus is much more sensitive to heat treatment with commercial pasteurization equipment than other studies might suggest." Nathan Anderson, Director of FDA's Division of Food Processing Science and Technology, stated, "While testing finished product post-pasteurization is one strategy to detect potential problems in finished products, validating the effectiveness of the pasteurization parameters critically demonstrates that commercial milk processing is capable of controlling the HPAI virus and further provides broad assurance that pasteurized milk and dairy products made from pasteurized milk are safe." Although it is not yet known whether the H5N1 HPAI virus can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated raw milk or milk products, the FDA continues to increase awareness about unpasteurized milk intake as it can potentially cause food-borne disease outbreaks.

BARDA, a strategic preparedness arm of the Department of Health and Human Services, has said for weeks that it has been in talks with mRNA vaccine manufacturers with an aim to diversify the government’s pandemic flu vaccine response capacity. The U.S. government already has vaccine contracts with and stockpiles of H5 vaccines made using other platforms by other manufacturers, including CSL Seqirus and Sanofi. “mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, as demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the statement. “We are pleased to continue our collaboration with BARDA to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks.” The company has already been working on mRNA-based pandemic vaccines, specifically targeting H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. Last year Moderna conducted a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of its candidate mRNA-1018, testing H5 and H7 versions at several dosages in a regimen of two shots separated by three weeks. Previous research has shown that H5 viruses are poorly immunogenic in people and vaccination requires two doses to induce what is thought to be a protective response. advertisement Related: Bird flu snapshot: A pathologist sees familiar echoes in U.S. response to the outbreak Moderna will not disclose the size of the doses it has tested, saying it is keeping that information secret for “competitive reasons.” Results of the Phase 1/2 trial haven’t yet been released but will be at some point in 2024, the company said, adding the results will inform the design of a Phase 3 trial. The H5 virus targeted in the Moderna vaccine used in the Phase 1/2 trial was an H5N8, a cousin of H5N1, the virus spreading in dairy cattle in the United States. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have said the hemagglutinin in that H5N8 virus — hemagglutinin is the protein on the virus surface that attaches to cells it is attempting to invade — is genetically similar enough to that of the circulating H5N1 virus that it should provide protection against it. The Seqirus H5 vaccine in the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile also targets that H5N8 virus. BARDA was looking to expand the country’s pandemic vaccine production arsenal even before the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced in late March that H5N1 was sickening lactating dairy cattle in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico. Since that announcement, approximately 140 herds in a dozen states have tested positive for the virus. It’s believed that many more herds have been infected but farmers refuse to test because they see no upside to disclosing the problem. Since the outbreak was recognized, three farmworkers — one in Texas and two in Michigan — tested positive for the virus. Two had very minor symptoms, effectively only conjunctivitis or pink eye. The third had more traditional flu-like respiratory symptoms; all three recovered.

(Photo courtesy of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory) Federal health officials have commissioned Moderna to develop a vaccine to protect people from an avian influenza that has been circulating in dairy cattle in recent months. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials said Tuesday the agency would devote about $176 million to the effort, with the hope that final clinical trials might commence next year. That schedule could be accelerated if “we’re starting to get extraordinarily concerned about additional human cases, severity of human cases, human-to-human transmission,” said Dawn O’Connell, the department’s assistant secretary for preparedness and response. It’s unclear whether that will happen. Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been widespread in wild birds in the past two years, has been sporadically devastating for U.S. poultry flocks, and has this year been infecting cows at an alarming pace and spreading to different states. Four infections of people who worked closely with infected poultry and cattle have been documented in that time: one poultry worker in 2022 and three dairy workers this year. All of those infections resulted in minor symptoms, and the people recovered. However, the latest infected person showed signs of respiratory illness. The fear is that a mutation in the virus might better enable it to infect human respiratory tissue and easily spread person to person, which could ignite a human pandemic. Key to preventing that is keeping the virus out of people, where it can commingle with other viruses and share bits of genetic material. Dairy precautions Research has shown that the virus likely transmitted from wild birds to Texas dairy cattle as early as December. It spread undercover for months until two veterinarians identified it as the culprit in sick cows in late March. Since then the virus has been found in cattle in at least 137 dairy herds in 12 states. It is believed to have spread between states via the transportation of sick cows. From there, the virus has likely been carried between herds by people and their equipment. Within the individual dairies, the virus can transmit between cows by contaminating equipment that is used for milking the animals. Lab tests have shown that the virus primarily dwells within cows’ mammary glands and that the amount of the virus in their milk is considerable. It’s not yet clear how to feasibly prevent the spread of the virus within herds, said Eric Deeble, acting senior advisor for H5N1 response for the department. H5N1 is the flu subtype that is currently circulating in birds and cattle. “There are a variety of USDA and other researchers that are currently working on that problem,” he said in a Tuesday call with reporters. Deeble said a vaccine for cattle could be effective at halting the virus but that one wouldn’t be available soon. Meantime, federal officials have monitored nearly 800 workers at infected dairy herds for illness and have tested more than 50 of them for bird flu. They have advised dairies to shield their workers with masks and other protective clothing and offered to pay for it. Antiviral drugs might also be used to prevent infections among workers, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that will likely require voluntary participation from those workers. “If H5 is not perceived as a pressing threat among farm workers — and I’m not speculating as to whether it is or not — but if that is the case, then uptake may not be robust,” he said. More testing capacity Shah said there are sufficient numbers of avian flu tests for people in the public health system — about 750,000 — and that another 1.2 million might be available in the next several months. Further, the CDC has worked with more than a dozen companies since last year to help them develop tests that could be produced and deployed if the virus becomes readily transmissible between people. “We need to stay prepared for the possibility of an expansion of the H5N1 outbreak in humans,” Shah said.

Bird flu also has affected 136 dairy cow herds in 12 states, with 56 confirmed cases in the last 30 days, the USDA reported.There have also been three confirmed human cases of H5N1 in 2024, all in dairy workers with presumed exposure to infected cattle. The CDC still considers the risk to the general public to be low.In 2023, BARDA issued a request for proposal to Moderna and other companies for development of mRNA vaccines for potential public health emergencies related to influenza viruses, including bird flu. These types of vaccines can complement traditional technologies during a pandemic emergency response.Moderna in 2023 launched a phase 1/2 trial to study the safety and immunogenicity of its mRNA-1018 pandemic influenza vaccine candidate in 1,500 healthy adults. Results from the study, which is set to conclude this year, will inform phase 3 development plans, the company said in a press release. Vaccine candidates against both H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses are included in the study.The HHS funds will support late-stage development of an mRNA-based vaccine to enable licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine for H5 influenza virus, as well as options to prepare and accelerate a response to potential public health emergencies. The award will also allow development and manufacturing to quickly pivot in the face of other public health threats, such as emerging infectious diseases, according to HHS.Moderna also recently announced positive findings from a phase 1/2 trial of its mRNA combination vaccine for influenza and COVID-19.“We have successfully taken lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and used them to better prepare for future public health crises,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, said in the release. “As part of that, we continue to develop new vaccines and other tools to help address influenza and bolster our pandemic response capabilities. Importantly, we are doing this work in partnership with some of the nation’s leading scientists and clinicians.”References:A study of m-RNA-1018 pandemic influenza candidate vaccines in healthy adults. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05972174.

Updated on July 3, 2024, at 7:53 p.m.The state health department identified a human case of avian influenza H5 infection as the virus has put more than two dozen dairy cattle herds under quarantine. An employee at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado who had direct exposure to dairy cattle with avian flu had a case of conjunctivitis, or pink eye, which he reported to state health officials. The Colorado Department of Public Health Environment, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Colorado Department of Agriculture, tested the man for influenza. Specimens were also sent to the CDC for additional testing, which confirmed he was positive for avian flu. The man was given an antiviral treatment and has recovered. “Our partnership with the Colorado Department of Agriculture has been crucial in disseminating information to dairy farmers across the state,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, the state health department’s executive director, in an emailed statement. “Coloradans should feel confident that the state is doing everything possible to mitigate the virus.”The CDC said the new confirmed case of avian flu in humans underscores its recommended precautions for people who may be exposed to infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals including livestock, or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.“The risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s state epidemiologist in a statement.There have been three other cases of avian flu in humans with the outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle that was first reported in the U.S. in March. One case was reported in Texas and two cases in Michigan. “Like three of the previous cases, the symptoms are restricted to the conjunctiva. One of the previous cases had conjunctivitis plus a cough,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus and expert in infectious diseases, at UC Berkeley. “This case does not alarm me as the person only had involvement of his conjunctiva.”Swartzberg said the receptor site of the virus is found in both the udders of cows and our conjunctiva. According to the Colorado health department, the last human detection of H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022 in someone who was exposed to infected poultry. Colorado currently has the most cases of the virus in dairy cattle, but the state is actively testing for it. It’s unclear how many other states are doing the same. All confirmed cases of avian flu in cattle have been in northeast Colorado. About a quarter of the state’s dairies have confirmed cases. Colorado has 105 licensed dairy facilities, 27 of which have been affected by the avian flu outbreak as of Tuesday, according to the state health department.With more cases popping up, public health experts said enhanced surveillance is critical.Finding human cases of avian influenza isn’t easy – it requires cooperation between the state health department and the department of agriculture, dairy farm owners and workers, said Elizabeth Carlton, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health, via email. By determining where cases are occurring, health officials can understand how the virus is spreading and identify populations at risk. “This case was in a person with exposure to cattle infected with avian influenza. This means this is likely another animal-to-human spillover event, akin to what was seen in the prior cases,” Carlton said. “Risk to the general public still remains low.”But she said detection is key. “It seems like Colorado has a system to detect human cases. I expect, due to this, we may see more cases in the weeks to come,” she said. “It is very important we continue to promote reporting symptoms, testing and treatment, so that we can continue to understand when and how human cases are occurring.”Given reports of the number of cases rising in dairy cattle and other animals in Colorado and elsewhere, Dr. Lee Newman, a pulmonologist and distinguished professor at the Colorado School of Public Health said it shouldn’t be a surprise that bird flu is infecting dairy workers.“If we were doing systematic monitoring of the workers, we'd probably find that there are more cases. We know it can occur,” he said.“We've seen transmission that's gone with the cows, cats who are drinking the milk, where we have now a couple of human cases, not spreading human to human, but (via) contact with the birds and with the mammal,” he said. “It presents a risk, and what clearly needs to happen is for there to be more systematic monitoring of the health and safety of the workers on the front line.”Federal initiatives, like the USDA Support and Voluntary Dairy Herd Status Programs, are continuing to see new enrollments by herds and states across the country, including in Colorado, according to a USDA spokesperson, via email.“The agency is encouraging testing in every way possible and is providing more ways to do so,” the spokesperson said. “We want to learn more about the spread of H5N1 in dairy cattle, detect where it is, and contain the virus to prevent further spread.”In April, USDA announced a federal order that mandates testing before the interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle. It also mandates reporting of positive influenza A test results in livestock.Additionally, the department said it’s using the latest scientific data to learn about the virus and to quickly contain it. On May 10, USDA announced several financial assistance options for producers with affected herds to help them pay for:Biosecurity plans, training, audits and in-line sampler for milk system. Veterinary costs to test and treat animals that become ill. Shipping costs to send samples to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Personal protection equipment (PPE) like goggles, face shields, gloves, and boot covers, or to launder coveralls. Safely dispose of milk from sick cows. As of July 3, 2024, two dozen herds, including 2 in Colorado, are participating in the USDA Support Program for producers, according to the agency.

General Pediatrics and Pediatric Emergency Care Volume 12 - 2024 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2024.1374311 The emergence of non-infectious epiglottitis after the era of Hemophilus influenza type B universal vaccination: two case reports and literature review Alaa Safia*Rabie ShehadehShlomo Merchavy Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Ziv Medical Center, Safed, Israel Objective: Following the global dissemination of vaccination protocols for Hemophilus influenza type B, the occurrence rate and burden of infectious epiglottitis decreased rapidly and substantially. However, this gave space to the rise of non-infectious causes, with children being more vulnerable than adults. This report aims to divert the clinician's attention to the existence of other non-infectious causes of epiglottitis, all of which require careful attention and timely management for favorable clinical outcomes. Case summary: Two cases with positive vaccination history were encountered in our practice. The first case was a 4-year-old girl, presenting with stridor drooling, and dyspnea, later complication by apnea. The fiberoptic exam revealed severe epiglottitic swelling with near-complete injury of the vocal cords with a circumferential burn. She did not respond to racemic epinephrine, and a tracheostomy was done. She was discharged after 6 days with minimal soft palate swelling. The second case was a 2-year-old boy presenting after exposure to an alkaline solution. The case exhibited similar symptoms but with white plaques and edema of the soft palate. The fiberoptic exam showed swelling and erythema of the supraglottic structures with partial obstruction. Although the blood culture was negative, he was intubated and given four intravenous boluses of dexamethasone and penicillin. On the fifth day, the patient was discharged after a normal fiberoptic examination. Discussion: These cases highlight a crucial shift in the etiology of epiglottitis post widespread Hemophilus influenza type B vaccination, underscoring the emergence of non-infectious causes, particularly in children. The two cases presented, both with vaccination histories, demonstrate diverse non-infectious triggers leading to severe epiglottitis. The first case, involving thermal injury, and the second, chemical exposure, both necessitated intensive interventions, including tracheostomy and intubation. These instances emphasize the need for heightened clinical vigilance for non-infectious epiglottitis, demanding prompt recognition and management to ensure positive outcomes. This shift in etiology calls for a reevaluation of traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to pediatric epiglottitis. Introduction Epiglottitis, a rare yet potentially life-threatening condition, has long been considered a medical emergency due to its capacity to cause acute and complete airway obstruction (1). Epiglottitis, once predominantly caused by Hemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), has been a significant concern in pediatric medicine due to its rapid onset and potential to cause life-threatening airway obstruction. Prior to the widespread implementation of Hib vaccination, acute epiglottitis in children was primarily infectious, characterized by high fever, severe throat pain, drooling, and a rapid progression to respiratory distress (2). This condition necessitated urgent medical intervention to secure the airway, often through intubation or tracheostomy. With the introduction and universal adoption of the Hib vaccine, the incidence of infectious epiglottitis has dramatically decreased, leading to a shift in the etiological landscape (3). Presently, non-infectious factors, such as thermal injuries from hot liquids or chemical burns from caustic ingestions, have emerged as significant causes. These cases typically present with similar acute symptoms but differ in etiology, lacking systemic signs of infection like fever. Recognizing these causes is crucial, as the clinical approach and management may vary from infectious forms (4). In the context of pediatric airway diseases, it is also useful to differentiate epiglottitis from infant croup, which is commonly caused by viral agents and presents with a barking cough, stridor, and hoarseness, but without the severe drooling and dysphagia typically seen in epiglottitis (5). Croup generally involves the subglottic region and is less likely to cause acute severe airway obstruction, making its management considerably different from that of epiglottitis. The pediatric airway differs notably from that of adults; it is shorter, narrower, and more compliant. These anatomical features mean that even a small degree of inflammation or swelling can rapidly progress to critical airway obstruction (6). This makes prompt recognition and management of epiglottitis crucial to prevent catastrophic outcomes in children (Supplementary Figure S1). Herein, we present two compelling cases of children who exhibited clinical and radiological signs mimicking acute infectious epiglottitis but were ultimately diagnosed with traumatic epiglottitis stemming from non-infectious causes. Informed consent was retrieved from both cases. The reporting of this case report adhered to the CARE guidelines. The distinctiveness of our cases lies in their non-infectious etiologies of epiglottitis in vaccinated children, a notable deviation in the post-Hemophilus influenza type B vaccine era. One case presented with thermal injury-induced epiglottitis and the other with chemical exposure, both requiring aggressive interventions. These cases highlight a pivotal shift in the understanding of epiglottitis causality, emphasizing the importance of considering non-infectious factors in diagnosis and management, and underscoring the potential severity of such cases in the pediatric population. This contributes uniquely to the evolving landscape of pediatric otolaryngology in the context of widespread vaccination. Case description Case one A 4-year-old female from the Upper Galilee region in Israel was admitted to the emergency department after an incident involving swallowing hot tea with a straw. The onset of her symptoms, which included marked irritability, stridor, dyspnea, and drooling, was insidious and began about four hours prior to hospitalization (Figure 1). These symptoms progressively worsened and were accompanied by difficulty in swallowing and two episodes of apnea. Importantly, there was no history of vocal abuse, respiratory infection, cough, fever, surgery, or trauma. The parents reported a positive vaccination history against Hib. Figure 1 Figure 1 Two cases of non-infectious epiglottitis, 4- and 2-years old children. Paragraph shows the timeline of cases presentation, management, and outcome. On examination, she displayed tachypnea and tachycardia, but no external burns or notable findings in the oral and oropharyngeal cavities. A lateral neck radiograph showed a steeple sign, initially suggesting croup (Figure 2). However, after the lack of response to inhaled racemic epinephrine and the worsening of her respiratory symptoms, a fiber optic examination was conducted. Figure 2 Figure 2 Two years old male with thermal injury-induced epiglottitis. Photograph of lateral neck radiology showing a positive steeple sign. This examination revealed severe swelling of the epiglottic structure, circumferential burn, and near-complete obstruction of the vocal cords, indicative of traumatic epiglottitis (Figure 3). Due to the extensive upper airway involvement and the difficulty of endotracheal tube insertion, a tracheostomy was performed. After 4 days of intubation and treatment with IV dexamethasone, a significant improvement was observed. No burns, scars, or swelling were noted on the repeat direct laryngoscopy. The child was successfully extubated and discharged 2 days later, following a normal fiber optic endoscopy. Upon discharge, the only remaining findings were a swollen and erythematous soft palate and uvula. After 3 months of follow-up, the patient is now fully recovered. Figure 3 Figure 3 Two years old male with thermal injury-induced epiglottitis. Fiberoptic examination showing severe edema of the epiglottis with near-complete obstruction of the vocal cords. Case two A previously healthy 2-year-old male was brought to the emergency department with acute symptoms of drooling, dysphagia, and stridor (Figure 1). His mother reported an incident where he accidentally sprayed an alkaline solution into his mouth. At presentation, the patient appeared irritable, with stridulous breathing and a forward-leaning position. His vital signs included a normal temperature, elevated respiratory rate, heart rate, and normal blood pressure. The case had completely received the Hib vaccination at 16 months. Examination of his mouth and oral pharynx revealed whitish plaques on the soft palate and edema of the soft palate and oropharynx. The patient's hemogram showed normal results. A fiber optic examination demonstrated swollen and erythematous supraglottic structures with partial obstruction (Figure 4). Figure 4 Figure 4 Four years old male with chemical exposure epiglottitis. Fiberoptic examination showing swollen and erythematous supraglottic structures with partial obstruction. Immediate airway management was initiated with the placement of an endotracheal tube. He was treated with four intravenous boluses of dexamethasone and penicillin. Although a blood culture taken prior to admission was negative, antibiotics were administered. After 3 days of intubation, a direct laryngoscopy showed notable improvement with no residual edema. The patient was extubated and discharged from the hospital 2 days later following a normal fiber optic endoscopy. The patient was followed-up for 1 month and was fully recovered upon examination. Discussion Epiglottitis, while uncommon, presents a critical emergency situation. The widespread implementation of the Hib vaccine for infants has led to a dramatic decrease in cases of infectious epiglottitis. Presently, the causes of epiglottitis are predominantly non-infectious. Traumatic supraglottitis can result from various types of airway injuries, including mechanical, thermal, or chemical (7, 8). The airways in children are comparatively narrower than those in adults (6). Consequently, any neck or upper airway injury can result in significant swelling and more rapidly compromise the airway in young patients. This paper focuses on the traumatic variants of non-infectious epiglottitis, an area not comprehensively addressed in existing literature. Currently, there are no definitive guidelines for treating traumatic epiglottitis. To address this gap, we have undertaken a literature review and developed a multidisciplinary management approach for this type of epiglottitis. The presented cases, along with the findings from the literature review (Supplementary Table S1), provide valuable insights into the diverse etiology, presentation, and management of non-infectious epiglottitis in children. The review of 23 cases highlighted that while thermal injuries and foreign body ingestions are common causes (56.51%), a variety of other factors such as caustic injuries and trauma can also lead to this condition. The mean age of presentation was approximately 46 months, with a predominance in males (73.91%). Commonly noted symptoms were stridor (56.52%), drooling (56.52%), dysphagia (47.82%), and dyspnea (43.47%), similar to our cases. In the second cases, antibiotic therapy was initiated due to the presumptive diagnosis of Hib epiglottitis, utilizing penicillin. However, considering the beta-lactamase production capabilities of many H. influenzae type B strains, penicillin may not be the optimal choice (9). Based on current local and global antibiotic resistance patterns, ampicillin or, more reliably, ceftriaxone would be preferred due to their efficacy against beta-lactamase-producing strains (3). This selection underscores the importance of antibiotic stewardship and the need for up-to-date knowledge on local pathogen resistance patterns, ensuring that management choices align with the best chance for successful treatment outcomes. The management strategies varied, with over half of the cases in the literature review receiving antibiotics and steroids, and about 40% receiving epinephrine. This aligns with the treatments provided in our cases, where steroids played a crucial role in the management. Airway intervention was necessary in 82.60% of cases, emphasizing the critical nature of early diagnosis and intervention (Supplementary Table S2). However, intubation was delayed in 57.89% of intubated cases. ICU admission was required in 56.52% of cases, with a mean ICU and hospital stay of 4.78 (SD = 1.86) and 5.88 (3.01) days, respectively. Importantly, complications occurred in 47.82% of them with two deaths occurring (10). The role of vaccination, particularly against Hemophilus influenza type B, in the context of non-infectious epiglottitis is intriguing (11). While only a small proportion of cases in the literature review were vaccinated, it raises questions about the potential impact of vaccination status on the presentation, management, and outcomes of these patients. Vaccination might influence the clinical suspicion towards non-infectious causes and could potentially alter the approach to management and airway intervention. In our review, we noted that among the five vaccinated cases, 80% required intubation (delayed; mean = 1.6 days) and ICU admission. Vaccinated patients had similar ICU and hospital length of stay to that of the whole population. One case required readmission with no deaths being reported. More research is needed to understand the full implications of vaccination status in these cases. Finally, the recognition of non-infectious causes in pediatric epiglottitis is crucial for appropriate management. These case reports, supported by a comprehensive literature review, highlight the need for heightened awareness and consideration of non-infectious causes in pediatric epiglottitis. They also underscore the importance of individualized patient care and the potential role of vaccination in influencing clinical outcomes.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print The U.S. government will pay the vaccine maker Moderna $176 million to accelerate development of a pandemic influenza vaccine that could be used to treat bird flu in people, as concern grows about cases in dairy cows across the country, federal officials announced Tuesday. Moderna already has a bird flu vaccine in very early-stage testing that uses the same mRNA technology that allowed rapid development and rollout of vaccines to protect against COVID-19. The new funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services include continued development of the vaccine, including a late-stage trial next year if those early study results are positive.But the project can be quicky redirected to target another form of influenza if a different threat than the H5N1 form of bird flu emerges, HHS officials stressed.The award was made through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics. The H5N1 virus was detected earlier this year in dairy cows and has spread to more than 135 herds in 12 states and infected three people to date, all with mild cases. Federal health officials stress that the risk to the wider population remains low. __The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Pharmaceutical laboratories are researching new applications for mRNA vaccine technology—and Moderna is hoping to integrate COVID, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus immunization into a single jab. David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty ImagesA single vaccine has been shown to protect people from both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses — and with a higher effectiveness than vaccines that target one or the other, the pharmaceutical company Moderna has announced.Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said earlier this month that it had successfully completed phase-III clinical trials for the drug, which — like the company’s pioneering COVID-19 vaccines — is based on mRNA. In a statement to its investors, Moderna said that the vaccine was more effective at providing immunity to adults over the age of 50 than competing flu and COVID-19 shots.Moderna is now planning to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to bring the vaccine to market.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Moderna’s latest rapid success shows that RNA can help to overcome some of these difficulties, says James Thaventhiran, a clinical immunologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, “This is a great example of why the technology is exciting,” he says, adding that the combination vaccines using mRNA are “just the beginning” for RNA technology.The RNA effectVaccination helps people to build immunity to a disease by exposing their immune cells to an antigen, such as a protein, a snippet of DNA or even a whole pathogenic organism that has been inactivated. When the real pathogen comes along, the immune system is quickly able to recognize the threat and mount a resistance.Creating antigens is a difficult process, and combining different antigens into one vaccine increases its complexity further. “It sounds like it should be so easy, right? You just mix them together,” says Jacqueline Miller, a paediatrician and head of development for infectious disease at Moderna. “But it’s actually much more complicated than the development of individual components.”The chemical components that make up single-target vaccines can sometimes react with one another when combined, running the risk of making the individual drugs less effective. mRNA-based vaccines don’t face as much of a hurdle, however, because the drug components for different antigens tend to be the same.mRNA is a molecule made of nucleic acids, and its main purpose is to tell cells what proteins to make. mRNA-based vaccines inject mRNA into cells to make copies of antigens for the immune system to recognize. So, rather than having to make a bunch of different components, mRNA vaccines simply wrap up a set of instructions in a layer of lipids and then send them into the body for cells to pop out their own antigens.The result is a strong immune reaction based on drug components that don’t compete with one another — even if they are targeting different pathogens.That might explain why the risk of combination vaccines being ineffective is “clearly” not a problem with the new COVID-influenza vaccine, says Thaventhiran, because the shot seems to boost immunity more than single immunizations do.The vaccine’s code can also be quickly changed to keep up with evolving variants. One of the issues with current, non-mRNA influenza vaccines is that the antigen is grown in chicken eggs, a process that takes six months. During that time, the virus can mutate and change. By contrast, “with RNA it literally takes weeks to make a new variant”, says Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the Perelman School of Medicine University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Modern mRNA immunizationResearchers have been testing the limit for the number of antigen instructions they can fit into an mRNA vaccine; one group has fit mRNA instructions for all 20 variants of influenza into a lipid layer. Moderna is hoping to add the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — which causes cold-like symptoms — as a third pathogen to its current COVID–influenza pair.For most people, FDA approval of the Moderna shot “means one visit to the pharmacy”, says Weissman. “One shot will be enough to protect you from both the flu and COVID.”COVID-19 booster uptake has dropped in the United States since the first rounds of vaccinations. However, as of this year, around 47% of adults have received the flu shot, according to the US Center for Disease Control. Combining immunizations could help to ensure that more people are protected from COVID-19, says Miller.And looking forward, mRNA combination vaccines could help to reduce the burden of immunizations for parents of young children. Infants are currently the primary targets of available combination vaccines, but they are still given multiple rounds of shots in the first few years of their lives. “Parents would be ecstatic” to reduce the number of shots their children must get, says Weissman. And having just a few shots — which could be administered at the same time — would also help to ease that burden of immunization in rural communities in low-income countries.Researchers will have to work out how to deal with the delicate nature of mRNA to see these benefits expand outside of high-income nations, says Thaventhiran. Part of the challenge of rolling out COVID-19 vaccines was the need to keep doses in deep freeze to protect the mRNA from breaking down.But overall, the development of mRNA combination vaccines is evidence “that RNA has a positive future”, says Weissman. “It isn’t just a fluke.”This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on June 28, 2024.Freda Kreier is a freelance journalist who likes writing about the natural world, DNA and the distant past.

Experts call on the WHO to prepare for an avian influenza pandemic The US and EU’s action has been spurred by increasingly urgent warnings from industry professionals, international medical bodies and academics. In April, the World Health Organization (WHO) said H5N1 avian influenza has pandemic potential, calling for thorough epidemiologic investigation in the case of human exposure to avian influenza. The WHO’s chief scientist Dr Jeremy Farrar said the disease has had an extremely high mortality rate among the several hundred people known to have been infected with it since 1996. “H5N1 is an influenza infection, predominantly started in poultry and ducks and has spread effectively over the course of the last one or two years to become a global zoonotic – animal – pandemic,” Farrar said in April. Why is WHO concerned about Avian Influenza or Bird Flu?Who is at risk?How can you protect yourself and which foods are safe to eat during an outbreak ?Dr Wenqing Zhang explains in Science in 5 pic.twitter.com/lBXJtNgaNv— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) May 13, 2024 Industry professionals have urged the WHO to prepare more effectively for a potential H5N1 pandemic than it did during the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. Academics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis unpacked avian influenza’s pandemic potential in a paper last month, while scientists from countries around the world this week cautioned that an H5N1 pandemic is ‘unfolding in slow motion’, Reuters reported. The first known cases of H5N1 date as far back as 1959, with the current dominant strain having evolved at the turn of this century. H5N1 has now been detected on every continent – including Antarctica – spreading from poultry farms to cattle herds to domestic pets. As of 1 July, more than 97 million farmed birds have been infected across 48 US states. While no human-to-human H5N1 transmission has been recorded, animal-to-human transmission is becoming increasingly prevalent. Total infections since 2003 hit 889 in June, of which 463 were fatal. The majority have been in Cambodia, China, Laos and Vietnam. There have also been five human cases reported in the US. CDC declares “moderate” risk of an avian influenza pandemic The most recent known US case of H5N1 avian influenza, identified by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Colorado yesterday (3 July) came through exposure to dairy cows which had tested positive for the disease. A spokesperson tells Pharmaceutical Technology that CDC believes circulating H5N1 viruses pose a moderate risk of pandemic emergence and of having an impact on public health should sustained human-to-human spread occur. CDC assesses potential pandemic risk of novel influenza viruses with its Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). “A new IRAT is underway for the virus isolated from the human infection in Texas,” the CDC spokesperson says. “The decision is based largely on the fact that the virus has emerged in a new host in the United States.” H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in 48 of the US’ 50 states. Credit: Nathan Howard / Getty. During its last IRAT last July, CDC concluded the H5N1 virus was associated with an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain in 2022. Experts will use the results from these latest IRAT studies on ferret transmissibility and pathogenicity to inform the overall IRAT risk assessment score. “While CDC believes that the immediate threat to the public posed by this virus remains low, the outcome of the IRAT will assess potential public health risk that this virus will change to cause human-to-human spread and the potential public health impact that would occur if that were to happen,” the spokesperson adds. “This would help inform pandemic preparedness planning.” Meat, eggs and milk supply chains under strain A comparatively trivial headline-snatcher in this week’s press has been a forced shortening of breakfast serving hours in Australian McDonald’s franchises due to H5N1-inflicted egg shortages. But the reports point to more serious concerns about supply chains in the food industry. In the past two months, several strains of avian influenza have been detected in at least eleven poultry facilities across southeast Australia – a trend indicative of the thousands of farms struggling with infections globally. More than 97 million wild aquatic birds and commercial poultry have been affected by H5N1 in the US alone, causing poultry and egg prices to rise drastically. A US Department of Agriculture (USDA) spokesperson tells Pharmaceutical Technology, however, that it remains confident that the meat supply is safe, adding that, to date, the agency has received no reports of clinical signs in cattle other than dairy cattle. The dairy industry was slow to identify the outbreak of avian influenza among dairy cows, with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirming its presence in raw milk in April. Nonetheless, the UK-based FSA still identifies H5N1’s risk as ‘very low’, while the US Food and Drug Association (FDA) says it has conducted studies which provide strong assurances that the commercial milk supply is safe. All eyes in the pharmaceutical, medical and food industries will be fixed on the rollout of human vaccines, first in Finland, then more widely in Europe, then the US. It remains to be seen whether the global community has learnt how to nip any potential pandemic in the bud from the uncoordinated, unequitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines.

Colorado health officials have identified the state's first human case of avian flu in in connection to an ongoing dairy cattle outbreak. Hyoung Chang/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Getty Images/File CNN — A fourth person in the United States has tested positive for H5 bird flu in connection to an ongoing outbreak among dairy cattle across the country. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced Wednesday that it has identified the state’s first human case of H5 avian influenza associated with the multistate outbreak of the virus in dairy cattle. This case is the fourth identified nationally in connection to the outbreak; two other human cases have been reported in Michigan and one in Texas.

As of Wednesday, federal data shows that seven states have confirmed cases in the past 30 days, and 40% of them are in Colorado — more than any other state. The infected person in Colorado had mild symptoms, reporting only conjunctivitis, or pink eye, as a symptom, according to state health officials. He worked at a dairy farm in northeast Colorado and had direct exposure to dairy cattle infected with avian flu. After testing positive, the man was treated immediately with the antiviral medication oseltamivir, and he has recovered, according to the state health department. “The risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist at the CDPHE, said in Wednesday’s announcement. The last human case of H5N1 in Colorado was in 2022 in a person who was exposed to infected poultry. PETALUMA, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 26: Cows graze in a field at a dairy farm on April 26, 2024 in Petaluma, California. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) before the animals are transported to a different state following the discovery of the virus in samples of pasteurized milk taken by the Food and Drug Administration.

The third human case in the US reported more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, congestion, sore throat and watery eyes. None of those three people had contact with each other, but all worked with cattle, suggesting that they are instances of cow-to-human transmission of the virus. On the national level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that it continues to monitor the situation carefully, using its flu surveillance systems to watch for H5N1 activity in people. The agency said Wednesday that the human case in Colorado “does not change CDC’s current H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which the agency considers to be low.” However, the case “underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected animals,” according to the CDC. “People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.” The CDC repeatedly has recommended that dairy workers wear personal protective equipment to reduce their risk. The US Department of Agriculture has offered financial support to farms with infected animals to provide workers with protection. Research is ongoing into how infections are transmitting between cows and from cows to people who work with them.

CDC officials said Tuesday that the United States has enough H5 bird flu tests to respond to the outbreak. “We have an ample number of H5-specific tests in the public health system for the current outbreak. As of right now, there are roughly 750,000 H5-specific tests available today and another 1.2 million such tests coming online in the next two to three months,” Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said at a news conference Tuesday. “This is on top of a robust supply of influenza A tests, the general tests that are available at doctor’s offices around the country,” Shah said. “The way that our system works is such that if someone tests positive for influenza A at the doctor’s office, their specimen is sent to a public health laboratory for what’s called subtyping. That tells us if the influenza A virus is a common seasonal one, or a rarer version like H5N1. That subtyping happens more commonly than you might think.” CNN’s Deidre McPhilips contributed to this report.

GSK on Wednesday announced it is restructuring an existing collaboration agreement with German biotech CureVac, focusing on their investigational mRNA vaccines for influenza and COVID-19 while withdrawing from other infectious disease projects.Under the amended contract, GSK will pay CureVac €400 million—or approximately $430 million upfront—and has pledged up to $1.13 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as tiered royalties in the high-single to low-teens range. The new deal will supersede all previous financial considerations from the prior agreement.GSK will gain full global rights to develop and commercialize CureVac’s investigational mRNA vaccines for influenza and COVID-19, including combination formulations. The partners currently have seasonal flu and COVID-19 shots in Phase II development, and an avian flu candidate in Phase I. All three of these candidates have best-in-class potential, according to the companies.GSK CSO Tony Wood in a statement said that the pharma is “excited” for its flu and COVID-19 programs, as well for the opportunity to advance these “best-in-class mRNA vaccines to change the standard of care.” The amended agreement will combine CureVac’s technology with GSK’s intellectual property, machinery and capabilities “to deliver these promising vaccines at pace,” Wood said.CureVac and GSK inked their original collaboration in July 2020, with the pharma putting down almost $130 million upfront and a making a nearly 10% equity stake in the biotech. At the time, the companies announced that they would “combined their mRNA expertise” to develop up to five vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies for “a range of infectious disease pathogens,” though they didn’t disclose specific target programs.With the new contract, CureVac will retain the exclusive rights to the other undisclosed and preclinical-validated targets from the previous agreement. The German company will also have the freedom to advance or partner these mRNA vaccine candidates, as it sees fit, in other infectious disease indications.The restructured deal comes as CureVac undergoes a sweeping strategic restructuring initiative, also announced on Wednesday.Aiming to “focus its resources on high-value mRNA projects” in cancer and other therapeutic areas, CureVac is laying off around 30% of its staff to “create a leaner, more agile organization,” according to the company. By refocusing its resources and R&D efforts, CureVac now anticipates delivering at least two clinical candidates by the end of 2025, along with at least two new Phase I studies by the end of 2026.Wednesday’s reorganization—combined with the maximum value it can receive under the amended GSK deal—should extend CureVac’s runway into 2028.

It says it wants to be "better prepared" for public-health crises, having learned lessons from Covid. Bird flu is not a big threat to people, despite outbreaks in poultry and cattle. But experts want a working vaccine that could be quickly rolled out, in case the virus mutates and becomes a problem.Vaccines using mRNA technology - which the Moderna's Covid jab is also based on - can be produced more quickly.And the US government says adding this technology to its pandemic-flu toolkit enhances its ability to be "nimble and quick" against bird flu.The $176m, from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, will be used to complete late-stage development and testing of Moderna's vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza.Potentially fatalThis strain has been around for years in birds - but some other animals, including cattle, have become infected in recent outbreaks.Some believe the virus might one day change and start spreading easily among humans, with potentially serious consequences. So far, there is no sign of this. There have been some rare cases of people catching it after coming into contact with sick animals. In people, the virus can cause symptoms ranging from mild illness, such as upper-respiratory and eye infections, to potentially fatal disease such as pneumonia, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.Moderna began early tests of its mRNA bird-flu vaccine in 2023, with healthy adult volunteers. The results, expected later this year, will inform the next steps, it says.

Prior to this, the last case of HPAI in Swift County was confirmed on June 18, while Otter Tail County has not had an instance of HPAI since November 2023.Other Minnesota counties to have positive cases of HPAI in commercial poultry in 2024 include Pipestone, Stearns, Lyon, Meeker, Morrison and Dodge. Meeker County has had the most flocks affected with six.No state has had more flocks struck by HPAI during the 2022-24 outbreak. In 2022, virus appeared in 81 flocks, and in 2023, it appeared in 34 flocks.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

What we know.Health officials are urging caution with where consumers get their milk as they investigate bird flu deaths in humans. Here's what we know.The claim: Bird flu diagnosis 'made up' for patient who died in MexicoA June 25 Instagram post (direct link, archive link) claims a dead man who health officials said was infected with a certain strain of bird flu did not actually have the virus."The dude who supposedly died of bird flu in Mexico had 'chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes' and 'had no history of exposure to poultry,'" reads the post, which is a screenshot of a post on X, formerly Twitter. "Oh, so basically they made up the bird flu part. Because of course they did."The post was liked more than 900 times in a week. The original X post was reposted thousands of times.More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook pageOur rating: FalseA lab confirmed through genetic analysis that the man in Mexico was infected with a strain of bird flu not found before in humans, according to the World Health Organization. The man died due to underlying medical conditions, not the virus.Man died from underlying conditions, but still had bird fluIn late April, a 59-year-old man hospitalized in Mexico died after he was confirmed to be the first person infected with a strain of bird flu not previously found in humans. Mexican authorities said the man died from complications related to multiple underlying health conditions, not the virus, the WHO said in a June 14 statement.The man's relatives reported he had been bedridden for three weeks for other reasons before experiencing bird flu symptoms. However, there is no evidence the man's bird flu infection was "made up," as the post claims. His was the first laboratory-confirmed human case of the H5N2 strain of bird flu reported globally.Fact check: Viral post misrepresents Texas STD dataExperts who investigated the man's cause of death concluded that "although the patient had a laboratory-confirmed infection with (the H5N2 strain of virus), he died due to complications of his comorbidities," the WHO statement says.A genetic analysis confirmed the strain of the virus and found it had a "99% similarity" to a strain taken from poultry in Mexico earlier in 2024, though the exact source of the man's exposure is "currently unknown," according to the WHO. The post correctly notes the man had no known history of exposure to poultry.Genetics allow researchers to identify virus strainsBird flu, or avian flu, is a virus that spreads among wild birds and can also infect domestic poultry and other animal species. It doesn't often spread to humans, but sporadic infections have been reported. There have been fewer than 1,000 reported cases globally since it was first identified in humans in 1997, according to the Cleveland Clinic.In humans, symptoms can resemble a typical flu – fever, sore throat, muscle aches, nausea and congestion, among others – but can also progress into more serious respiratory symptoms.Researchers identify strains of viruses through a process called genetic characterization, said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health. It involves comparing genetic sequences of different viruses, according to the CDC.In the case in question, Mexico's National Institute of Respiratory Diseases confirmed the strain of virus was H5N2."Therefore, this is not 'made up,'" Blumberg told USA TODAY. "The report of H5N2 infection is based on genetic sequencing."Three cases of a different strain of bird flu have been detected in humans in the U.S. as of early July 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.USA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.Our fact-check sources:Dr. Dean Blumberg, June 28, Email exchange with USA TODAYWHO, June 14, Avian Influenza A(H5N2) - MexicoWHO, June 5, Avian Influenza A(H5N2) - MexicoCleveland Clinic, accessed June 28, Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)CDC, June 22, How CDC is monitoring influenza data among people to better understand the current avian influenza A (H5N1) situationCDC, accessed June 28, Influenza Virus Genome Sequencing and Genetic CharacterizationThank you for supporting our journalism.

Only one meat farm has been affected and there are no reported shortages or buying limits on chicken meat.But experts warn the outbreaks could continue, and the financial impact on egg farmers, who are still paying off the clean-up costs for the last high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in 2021, could be severe.This is what you need to know.Is there an egg shortage?There are fewer eggs, and you may have noticed fewer cartons on shelves.Australia takes a zero-tolerance approach to HPAI outbreaks, which means the protocol after any reported infection is the euthanasia of all birds on the farm. The avian influenza outbreaks in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT have resulted in the destruction of about 2 million chickens.According to peak body Australian Eggs, the reported losses – and not all jurisdictions have reported up-to-date numbers – represent about 7% of the national flock of more than 20 million laying hens.Rowan McMonnies, the managing director of Australian Eggs, says the losses are “significant and causing disruption” but that “most suppliers are able to fulfil contracts”.“The recent avian influenza outbreaks have caused significant disruption but there are still over 21 million chickens laying eggs every day and the community can take comfort that nation-wide supply has not collapsed,” he said.View image in fullscreenWorkers clean a truck in a quarantine zone after an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria. Photograph: Supplied By Department Of Energy/AAPBoth major supermarkets have said they are experiencing temporary delays in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. Woolworths introduced a two-carton limit in those three jurisdictions last Thursday 27 June. A spokesperson for Woolworths said the short-term delay was due to the temporary closure of an egg-packing shed which adjoins one of the affected farms, and they are expecting supply to recover toward the end of the week.“Right now, the majority of customers are only buying one carton of eggs at a time, and there’s no reason that should change,” the spokesperson said. “We encourage shoppers to be mindful of others and continue to only buy what they normally would.”Coles has had a two-carton limit in every state except Western Australia since 9 June.Other retailers also moved to limit their sale of eggs after the ACT case last week, and the subsequent impact on the packing shed. McDonald’s temporarily shortened its breakfast menu hours to wrap up at 10.30am, instead of 12pm.Importantly, all three companies have a commitment to free-range eggs. McDonald’s only uses free-range eggs in its products. Both Woolworths and Coles have stopped selling cage eggs under their house brands and have committed to phase out all cage eggs by 2025, so many of their suppliers are also free range. All the farms affected by HPAI outbreaks so far have been free-range egg farms, with one a mixture of free range and caged eggs.View image in fullscreenThe egg shelves of an Aldi supermarket in Ashfield mall in Sydney. Photograph: Richard Milnes/REX/ShutterstockWhy is it affecting free-range egg farms?HPAI infections in commercial flocks come from interactions with wild birds, mainly ducks. It can also be passed by contaminated faeces or other material.McMonnies said free-range production systems are more exposed to the risk of avian influenza because of the increased opportunity for coming into contact with wild birds.“Wild bird spillover of avian influenza is one of a number of biosecurity threats to commercial farms and can still impact barn and cage systems through contact with vehicles and equipment,” he said.Third-generation egg farmer Brian Ahmed operates a 30,000-bird caged egg farm on the outskirts of Melbourne. He says free-range production systems will always be more vulnerable and that’s why Australia needs a mix of cage, barn, and free-range producers.Last year, Australia’s agriculture ministers made a commitment to ban cage eggs by 2036, in response to decades of consumer pressure.Dr Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne, said managing HPAI risk in free-range flocks is “a real challenge”.“Free range is a good thing for animal ethics but biosecurity becomes extremely challenging as its very hard to prevent wild birds interacting with poultry which are outdoors,” she said.Is this the virus that’s causing problems overseas?There is a global outbreak of a strain of bird flu identified as H5N1, which has not yet been detected in birds in Australia, although its arrival is considered inevitable.The current outbreaks in Australia are different strains. The H7N3 strain was detected at an egg farm near Meredith in western Victoria in May, and has since spread to every other egg farm in the area – that’s seven infected properties in total. Another property at Terang has been infected with the H7N9 strain. It was connected via contact tracing to the first Meredith property.Two farms in the Greater Sydney Basin – one egg farm and one meat farm – last month reported the H7N8 strain. And last week the H7N8 strain was detected at a commercial poultry farm in the ACT.One possible reason for the confluence of outbreaks is the triple-dip La Niña that Australia experienced in 2020, 2021 and 2022.Australian research published in 2021 analysed avian influenza outbreaks dating back to 1970 and found the risk of an outbreak in poultry farms increases after periods of high rainfall, with the peak risk two years after the onset of the high rainfall period. That’s due to waterfowl breeding on temporary wetlands. When the temporary wetlands dry up, large numbers of young, “immunologically naive” birds retreat to more established waterways, and that concentration of juvenile birds with no immunity increases avian influenza prevalence in wild flocks.View image in fullscreenA warning sign about an avian influenza outbreak affecting poultry in Meredith, Victoria, last month. Photograph: Supplied By Department Of Energy/AAPAnd the higher the rate of low pathogenicity avian influenza in wild flocks, Wille explains, the higher the risk of spillover to commercial poultry farms, where it then evolves into high pathogenicity avian influenza or HPAI.University of Western Australia associate professor Parwinder Kaur, the director of DNA Zoo Australia, said that if H5N1 reaches Australian wild bird populations at the same time that H7 viruses are circulating, there is a risk that the two strains could mix in the same commercial flock. If two strains inhabit the same host, Kaur said, something called an “antigenic shift” could occur, which would be the creation of a new strain of the virus.What about the farmers?Australia’s commercial poultry producers are still paying off the cost of cleaning up after the last HPAI outbreak, which occurred in the Meredith-Lethbridge area in 2020-2021.The destruction and disposal of potentially infected birds and the cleanup of properties is conducted by state agriculture departments, covered by a levy which is added on to the cost of buying new chickens. As of July 2021, the Emergency Animal Disease Response (EADR) levy is 1.1c per laying chicken. Added to other levies, the it totals 15.27c per bird.There are only two suppliers of commercial laying chickens in Australia, as the genetics are tightly controlled. They are distinct from the chicken breeds used by back yard chicken owners.McMonnies said the EADR system reduces the cost of disease outbreaks.Farmers who have to euthanise their birds are compensated for their value at the time of death, but that is usually less than the replacement cost. A new layer may cost $20 and produce eggs for 12 to 15 weeks, but a hen which has been laying for 10 weeks already will be valued lower because they have fewer productive weeks remaining.Back yard poultry owners have been urged to keep their birds confined or otherwise separated from wild birds to reduce the risk of infection.Explore more on these topicsRural AustraliaThe rural networkEggsexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Moderna, Inc. Tue, Jul 2, 2024, 8:30 PM 4 min read In This Article: MRNA CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 2, 2024 / Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) today announced a project award of $176 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines. The RRPV is a Consortium funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The project award will support late-stage development for an mRNA-based vaccine to enable the licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine against H5 influenza virus. This subtype of influenza virus causes a highly infectious, severe disease in birds called avian influenza and poses a risk for spillover into the human population. The agreement also includes additional options to prepare and accelerate aresponse to future public health threats. "mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. "We are pleased to continue our collaboration with BARDA to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks." In 2023, Moderna initiated a Phase 1/2 study to generate safety and immunogenicity data of investigational pandemic influenza vaccine (mRNA-1018) in healthy adults 18 years of age and older. The study includes vaccine candidates against H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses. Results from the study are expected in 2024 and will inform Phase 3 development plans. This project is being funded with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR); Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under Other Transaction (OT) number: 75A50123D00005.

Learn about our editorial policies Published July 03, 2024 12:49 PM EDT Idrees Abbas / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images Key Takeaways GSK has purchased the rights to COVID-19 and flu vaccines being developed in collaboration with German biotechnology company CureVac.GSK said it will pay CureVac as much as $1.56 billion to assume full control of the treatments.The companies have been working together on mRNA vaccines since 2020. Drug maker GSK (GSK) agreed to pay up to $1.56 billion for the rights to develop, manufacture, and market COVID-19 and influenza vaccines being worked on in collaboration with German biotechnology company CureVac (CVAC). GSK said CureVac would receive EUR400 million ($432 million) up front, and up to an additional EUR1.05 billion ($1.13 billion) in development, regulatory, and sales milestones. The companies teamed up during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 to create mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases. GSK said its efforts have produced “candidates for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in phase II and avian influenza in phase I clinical development” based on CureVac’s mRNA technology. The updated deal means GSK will “assume full control of developing and manufacturing these candidate vaccines," the company said. CureVac Shares Rise After Deal Announcement CureVac shares initially rose on the announcement Wednesday, but dropped by 5% near closing in Independence Day holiday-shortened trading. The deal "puts us in a strong financial position and enables us to focus on efforts in building a strong R&D pipeline," said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Zehnder. The news came a day after Moderna (MRNA) received a $176 million U.S. government grant to come up with a vaccine to prevent avian flu in humans. GSK's American depositary receipts (ADRs) are up about 3.6% year-to-date. They were slightly higher at $38.40 near early closing on Wednesday.

The meeting was followed by a five-day training of trainers’ workshop on EID hospital preparedness and a national meeting with health workers from 36 provinces on the WHO operational framework for PRET. EIDs such as MERS-CoV, avian influenza, mpox and Nipah virus have in recent years caused significant outbreaks in one or more countries globally. Some 60% of EIDs are zoonoses, which every year cause an estimated 1 billion cases of illness and millions of deaths. In 2023 Indonesia reported cases of several EIDs, including COVID-19 and mpox. Avian influenza continues to be endemic among the country’s poultry.Participants of the 6–7 June meeting included representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the National Disaster Agency (BNPB), the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture, and the Ministry of Home Affairs. This was in addition to key members of surveillance, community protection, clinical management and access to medical countermeasures working groups. Group work session during stakeholder meeting on preparedness and resilience for emerging threats (credit: MoH Indonesia)On the first day, participants discussed Indonesia’s current operational framework for EIDs and the risk of respiratory pathogens of pandemic potential, guided by the WHO PRET initiative. Launched in 2023, the PRET recognizes that the same systems, capacities, knowledge and tools can be applied for groups of pathogens based on their mode of transmission. On the second day, participants focused on vaccine deployment and access to and procurement of medical countermeasures. This was followed by a series of working group presentations on how best to shift from one phase of the EID preparedness and response cycle to the next, covering five key pillars: emergency coordination, collaborative surveillance, community protection, clinical care and access to medical countermeasures.“Multisectoral collaboration is key to increasing Indonesia’s capacity to prevent, detect and respond to potential public health emergencies of international concern,” said dr Achmad Farchanny Tri Adryanto, Director, Surveillance and Health Quarantine, Ministry of Health, Government of Indonesia. “Adopting and adapting the WHO PRET initiative is therefore essential”. The two-day stakeholder meeting was followed from 10–14 June by a five-day training of trainers’ workshop. The workshop aimed to strengthen hospital preparedness planning, case management, infection prevention and control, and specimen handling, among other key areas of work. A total of 28 health workers from 14 EID hospital network facilities participated in the training, which was delivered through interactive discussions, hands-on activities and table-top exercises.Later in the month, from 25–27 June, the Ministry of Health and WHO convened a national meeting with health workers from 36 provinces, where the WHO operational framework for PRET was disseminated. The meeting also deliberated on EID risk mapping, as well as the risk of EIDs related to international travel, including for the Hajj. “Working collaboratively to minimize the risk of pathogens spilling over from animals and the environment does not mean merely acknowledging the need for working beyond human health. But, actually using the power and platform of the human health sector to advocate for the animal, wildlife and environmental health sectors,” said David Stanton, Deputy Health Director, USAID Indonesia. “A gram of prevention is worth a kilogram of cure, and we should continue investing in prevention and preparedness efforts and capacities in Indonesia as the diseases know no boundaries.” Each activity will support Indonesia’s ongoing efforts to strengthen health security, reflected in the successful conclusion of the country’s second Joint External Evaluation of International Health Regulations core capacities in October 2023. They will inform the country’s next National Action Plan for Health Security, which will come into effect in 2025, and will complement the forthcoming One Health Joint Plan of Action.These activities were supported by the US Government through USAID.Written by Endang Widuri Wulandari, National Professional Officer (Epidemiologist), WHO Indonesia Media Contacts Indonesia Communication Team Email: seinocomm@who.int Quick links Media centre Head of WHO Office Careers in WHO Indonesia Regional links Data Publications Help Contact us Integrity Hotline Privacy legal notice © 2024 WHOUS government inks a deal with Moderna to make pandemic flu vaccine | CNN CNN values your feedback 1.

The government has 4.8 million doses of an H5 vaccine with a traditional platform under production, O’Connell said. The vaccine is tailored to the currently circulating strains of the H5N1 bird flu virus and should come off the finishing line starting in the middle of this month — ahead of schedule, she said. The new $176 million contract with Moderna will help the government stay “nimble” in case it needs to act quickly against any kind of circulating strains of a pandemic flu virus, officials said. The mRNA vaccines wouldn’t be available any time soon, O’Connell said. Moderna has a vaccine candidate in early stage testing, and results should be available in the coming weeks, but late-stage testing of its vaccine wouldn’t start until 2025.

If something changes with the current H5N1 bird flu outbreak — for instance, if there is human-to-human transmission or if the severity of cases gets worse — there are options to “accelerate the timeline,” O’Connell said. However, such a vaccine may not be necessary. “The risk to the general population right now remains low and CDC’s assessment of that has not changed,” said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. H5N1 bird flu has been identified in dairy cows in 12 states, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Three farm workers in the US who worked with infected cattle have tested positive for bird flu. Daskalakis said that even if a vaccine were available, the CDC isn’t entirely sure that vaccination is the best approach to protect farm workers right now, given that uptake might be limited, the virus hasn’t spread widely and illnesses haven’t been severe.

Biosecurity safety measures that many farms already have in place have been essential to keep the virus from spreading, said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for H5N1 response at the US Department of Agriculture, but the country needs to be prepared for anything. “We do know that the vast majority of farms practice biosecurity and that includes dairy farms,” Deeble said at Tuesday’s news conference. “But this is a new and emerging disease that calls for a different set of biosecurity practices or enhancements of specific ones.” More than 780 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected cows, and at least 53 have been tested, the CDC said.

(Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Public health officials have diagnosed a Colorado farm worker with the country’s fourth human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state’s department of health reported Wednesday. The Colorado case, the state’s first this year related to spread from dairy cattle to humans, was reported after an adult man working on a farm in the northeast region of the state experienced conjunctivitis or pink eye. The unidentified man, who has since recovered, was being monitored by public health officials after dairy cattle on the farm he worked on tested positive for H5N1, or bird flu. Dr. Rachel Herlihy, an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, wrote in a statement announcing the diagnosis that the “risk to most people remains low.” “Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person,” Herlihy wrote in the statement. “Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals.” Nationwide, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported bird flu in 139 dairy herds throughout a dozen states, including Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. In Colorado, there have been 27 dairy herds where at least one cow has tested positive for H5N1 since the outbreak began, according to data from the USDA. The other three human cases reported this year include two dairy farm workers in Michigan and one in Texas. Two of the cases were pink eye, while one of the Michigan patients experienced mild respiratory symptoms. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment wrote in its announcement Wednesday that 2022 was the last time a person within the state was diagnosed with bird flu. That time it was the result of infected poultry. Bird flu continues to spread in the country’s poultry flocks as well, though that industry has had much more time to adjust and get its workers used to wearing personal protective equipment than dairy farmers have. More than 97 million poultry throughout 48 states have tested positive for H5N1 since this outbreak began in January 2022, according to reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unlike dairy cows, which generally recover from bird flu, poultry flocks are culled after a diagnosis, making response and recovery to H5N1 vastly different. The USDA began a voluntary pilot program for dairy farmers in late June that gives them the option to have their herd’s bulk milk tanks tested. The program is designed to make it easier for farmers to transport their cows across state lines. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday that it would direct $176 million to Moderna to develop a vaccine that would inoculate people against the virus.

Read more Number of deaths from infectious diseases Japan 2022, by type Published by Catharina Klein, Jul 3, 2024 Among infectious diseases that were recorded in Japan, the highest number of deaths was caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which amounted to approximately 47.6 thousand deaths in 2022. The number of deaths from infectious enterogastritis followed with around two thousand cases. Seasonal influenza in Japan The influenza season in Japan typically begins in November or December and reaches its peak in the first two months of the following year. The number of deaths caused by seasonal flu in Japan has been increasing in recent years. Since 2010, more than 25 million influenza vaccine units were supplied in the country annually. Citizens aged 60 years and over are eligible to receive free periodic influenza vaccines from their municipality. In recent years, more than 20 million elderly have received such a free vaccination yearly. Receding flu infections during COVID-19During the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, a partial decrease in monthly flu patients was observed in Japan. This development has by some been attributed to a phenomenon called viral interference, making people less susceptible to influenza viruses in areas where the coronavirus is predominant. In case of an infection with the novel virus, infected cells secrete so-called interferon proteins which block other viruses. Moreover, nationwide preventive measures such as face masks, home office implementation, and regulations of gastronomy opening hours have shown to have a positive influence on reducing infection numbers of diseases like influenza.

Print Federal officials suspect that live bird markets in San Francisco may be the source of bird flu virus in area wastewater samples. Days after health monitors reported the discovery of suspected avian flu viral particles in wastewater treatment plants, federal officials announced that they were looking at poultry markets near the treatment facilities.Last month, San Francisco Public Health Department officials reported that state investigators had detected H5N1 — the avian flu subtype making its way through U.S. cattle, domestic poultry and wild birds — in two chickens at a live market in May. They also noted they had discovered the virus in city wastewater samples collected during that period. Climate & Environment Signs of avian flu found in San Francisco wastewater Samples of San Francisco wastewater tested positive for bird flu; authorities have yet to determine the source.June 29, 2024 Two new “hits” of the virus were recorded from wastewater samples collected June 18 and June 26 by WastewaterSCAN, an infectious-disease monitoring network run by researchers at Stanford, Emory University and Verily, Alphabet Inc.’s life sciences organization. Advertisement Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the source of the virus in those samples has not been determined, live poultry markets were a potential culprit.Hits of the virus were also discovered in wastewater samples from the Bay Area cities of Palo Alto and Richmond. It is unclear if those cities host live bird markets, stores where customers can take a live bird home or have it processed on-site for food.Steve Lyle, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Food and Agriculture, said live bird markets undergo regular testing for avian influenza. He said that aside from the May 9 detection in San Francisco, there have been no “other positives in Live Bird Markets throughout the state during this present outbreak of highly-pathogenic avian flu.”San Francisco’s health department referred all questions to the state. Climate & Environment What you need to know about the bird flu outbreak, concerns about raw milk, and more Answering the basics on Bird Flu 2024May 15, 2024 Even if the state or city had missed a few infected birds, John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian epidemiologist, seemed incredulous that a few birds could cause a positive hit in the city’s wastewater. “Unless you’ve got huge amounts of infected birds — in which case you ought to have some dead birds, too — it’d take a lot of bird poop” to become detectable in a city’s wastewater system, he said. Advertisement “But the question still remains: Has anyone done sequencing?” he said. “It makes me want to tear my hair out.”He said genetic sequencing would help health officials determine the origin of viral particles — whether they came from dairy milk, or from wild birds. Some epidemiologists have voiced concerns about the spread of H5N1 among dairy cows, because the animals could act as a vessel in which bird and human viruses could interact.However, Alexandria Boehm, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and principal investigator and program director for WastewaterSCAN, said her organization is not yet “able to reliably sequence H5 influenza in wastewater. We are working on it, but the methods are not good enough for prime time yet.”A review of businesses around San Francisco’s southeast wastewater treatment facility indicates a dairy processing plant as well as a warehouse store for a “member-supported community of people that feed raw or cooked fresh food diets to their pets.” More to Read Bird flu virus found in Los Angeles County wastewater Nov. 1, 2024 A deadly fungus that has killed millions of bats may have arrived in Southern California Oct. 31, 2024 A concerning development: H5N1 bird flu has infected a pig in Oregon, officials say Oct. 30, 2024 Climate & EnvironmentCaliforniaScience & MedicineAnimals & PetsBreaking News Susanne Rust Follow Us X Instagram Email Facebook Susanne Rust is an award-winning investigative reporter specializing in environmental issues.

By: Jeff Morgan Posted BALTIMORE — Concern for cat owners as their furry friends might be at risk of getting avian influenza, better known as the bird flu. ​Researchers at University of Maryland's School of Public Health say the bird flu infecting cats could also put humans at risk.​​So, how are cats getting the virus?​​​"Small animals like rodents and birds, they may prey upon them. Also on farms, cats may consume unpasteurized milk byproducts," said Ian Bemis, UMD School of Public Health, PHD candidate.​​The researchers found this out while scouring over 20 years of data. ​​"This is preliminary research for the stuff we'll be doing in the future. Looking at avian influenza and animal shelters," said Bemis.​​Bird flu isn't currently contagious between humans. ​​But, the research showed an increase in domestic cat infections starting in 2023. ​​Something researchers theorize could allow the virus to mutate and become infectious to people. ​​"There is a risk and there has been documented cases of that. However, for all the cats and people in the world it's a very rare event," said Bemis.​​So, what should cat owners do with a sharp increase in bird flu infections impacting cats?​​"The best thing that can be done is keeping your cat indoors or avoid your cats being unsupervised outdoors," said Bemis.​​The signs of bird flu in cats are neurological issues, difficulty walking or breathing.​​If you notice them in your cat the best plan of action is to take it to the vet.

The funding flows through BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, as part of a new Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) Consortium. The program is intended to set up partnerships with industry to help the country better prepare for pandemic threats and develop medical countermeasures, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a press announcement Tuesday. In its own announcement on Tuesday, Moderna noted that it began a Phase 1/2 trial of a pandemic influenza virus vaccine last year, which included versions targeting H5 and H7 varieties of bird flu viruses. The company said it expects to release the results of that trial this year and that those results will direct the design of a Phase 3 trial, anticipated to begin in 2025. The funding deal will support late-stage development of a "pre-pandemic vaccine against H5 influenza virus," Moderna said. But, the deal also includes options for additional vaccine development in case other public health threats arise. "mRNA vaccine technology offers advantages in efficacy, speed of development, and production scalability and reliability in addressing infectious disease outbreaks, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic," Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the announcement. "We are pleased to continue our collaboration with BARDA to expedite our development efforts for mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines and support the global public health community in preparedness against potential outbreaks." US health officials have said previously that they were in talks with Moderna and Pfizer about the development of a pandemic bird flu vaccine. The future vaccine will be in addition to standard protein-based bird flu vaccines that are already developed. In recent weeks, the health department has said it is working to manufacture 4.8 million vials of H5 influenza vaccine in the coming months. The plans come three months into the H5N1 dairy outbreak, which is very far from the initial hopes of containment. Botched response The US is badly fumbling its response to the unprecedented outbreak, drawing criticism from US-based and international experts alike. Genetic analyses suggest that the virus has been spreading among the country's dairy cattle since late last year. But, it wasn't until months later, on March 25, that the US Department of Agriculture confirmed the first four infected herds in two states (Texas and Kansas). Since then, the outbreak has spread to around 140 herds in 12 states—at least. Some farms are refusing to test, and experts expect that there is a significant number of undocumented herd infections, particularly given the widespread detection of inactivated H5N1 in the commercial milk supply. Further, of the 140 herds with documented infections, federal officials do not know how many are still actively infected rather than recovered. It is unclear if infected cows can become reinfected, and if so, how quickly after an infection. While the risk to the general public is considered to be low currently, farm workers are at higher risk of contracting the infection. To date, there have been three confirmed infections among dairy farm workers—one in Texas and two in Michigan, which has had a uniquely robust response to the outbreak. Still, with hundreds to thousands of farm workers at risk of contracting the virus, only 53 people in the country to date have been tested for H5 influenza. In a presentation in London last month, global health leader Seth Berkley said it was “shocking to watch the ineptitude" of the US response to the H5N1 outbreak. He, like other experts, questioned whether the US public health community has learned or improved from the failures of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to problems during the pandemic, a key barrier to the H5N1 response is resistance from farmers and farm workers to partner with state and federal health officials. Federal agencies have limited authority within states, but they have announced an array of assistance programs for dairy farms, including compensatory funding and access to personal protective equipment for farm workers. They have also issued guidance and restrictions to tighten biosecurity measures. But there has been little voluntary participation on both fronts. For instance, officials figured out early in the outbreak that the movement of cattle, workers, and equipment between farms is the main way H5N1 is spreading among dairies. In April, the USDA required testing of a portion of cows prior to their movement across state lines. But movement within states is governed by states. In a survey last month, which captured data from 54 percent of affected farms at the time, more than 60 percent of farmers said they continued to move cattle off their infected farms after the onset of clinical signs of infection in their animals. The more the virus expands its footprint across US dairy farms, adapts to its newfound mammalian host, and comes in contact with humans, the more and more chances it has to leap to humans and gain the ability to spread among us. In HHS's Tuesday announcement of the Moderna award, Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for Preparedness and Response, spoke to the growing concern that the H5N1 outbreak could spark another pandemic. "The award made today is part of our longstanding commitment to strengthen our preparedness for pandemic influenza," O’Connell said. "Adding this technology to our pandemic flu toolkit enhances our ability to be nimble and quick against the circulating strains and their potential variants."

While fewer than 500,000 birds in domestic flocks have died last month from avian flu as compared to April’s losses (more than 8.5 million) and May (nearly 6 million), by no means has bird flu taken a break this summer. During the month of June alone, 20 states saw detections in poultry livestock flocks (largely commercial turkey meat birds), wild birds, dairy milking cattle, and/or other mammals. More than 50 dairy herds in seven states became infected with H5N1 virus in a 30-day period alone, bringing the total number of dairy cow herds infected since March to more than 130 herds of varying sizes, from 45 to 10,000. Additionally, agriculture experts and others say for a variety of reasons, the outbreaks in dairy cattle throughout the country may be significantly underreported. This nefarious virus, which has been around for about 20 years in numerous countries and deemed by some sources as somewhat “defanged” over time, is gaining teeth again and striking an unprecedented number and range of hosts. Information about the subject from Dr. Lynn C. Klotz and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is here: https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Beat-Goes-On-reorganized-v-8-10-2023.pdf. Bird flu infected alpacas, bald eagles, black vultures, cracklings, crows, domestic cats, herring gulls, house mice, house sparrows, mourning doves, ravens, red foxes, raccoons, red-tailed hawks, striped skunks, starlings, and turkey vultures within the last two months. For reasons which are unclear, many of the diseased animals that were collected in December 2023 as well as during January, February, and March of this year were first listed as confirmed cases the last week. The latest mammal detections are found on Page 33 of the following document: https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals. The most recent go-round of infected species did not include any confirmed H5N1 avian influenza cases in Wisconsin, however, we know that most, if not all, of the aforementioned species make their homes in our area, which is why we all need to stay informed and be alert. What about alpacas? In May, the USDA announced that bird flu was detected for the first time in alpacas on a U.S. farm. The Idaho location which lost 22% of its herd reportedly had experienced infected birds, which interacted closely with the animals, a couple weeks earlier. Information regarding the alpaca infections is here: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 Detections in Alpacas | Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (usda.gov). Alpacas, like llamas, are members of the camelid (camel) family, and according to the Alpaca Owners Association, Inc., more than 260,000 registered alpacas currently reside in the United States. Wisconsin Agriculture Statistics indicate 300 operations with alpacas and 339 with llamas, for a total of 5,181 animals. Information about alpacas living in Wisconsin is here: https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Wisconsin/Publications/Annual_Statistical_Bulletin/2019AgStats-WI.pdf. Alpaca owners, some of whom make Jefferson County home, have been advised to use only pasteurized milk from dairy cows and goats, if they are using milk as a feeding supplement. Information offering such guidance is here: https://www.alpacainfo.comews/article/6260/alpacagram-11.34–potential-risk-for-bird-flu. ‘Funky’ foxes, raccoons Like a lot of things in life, one might not be able to tell what’s what merely by looking. Last year, a number of folks on social media posted about red foxes which looked a bit funky and in some instances, behaved unusually unafraid of humans. Some speculated it could be the mange. While true, there is information available suggesting that foxes can have mange and avian influenza at the same time, which could complicate the differential diagnosis process. Starting late winter 2022 and into the spring, Wisconsin red foxes were infected with avian influenza in Jefferson County, along with some in Adams, Dane, Grant, Lincoln, and Waushara counties. Neighboring Dane County also saw red foxes impacted by H5N1 bird flu in both January and April of last year. Over the last three months, raccoons were confirmed as having avian influenza in Colorado, New Mexico, and New York, and in Michigan on May 28, roughly 225 miles from our area. Recently, a few residents of Lake Mills discussed concerns about raccoons they’ve been seeing, which could be ill, some theorizing on social media that the animals might have rabies. Wisconsin DNR Wildlife Disease Specialist Nancy K. Businga recently weighed in, saying: “We have not had a documented case of rabies in raccoons in Wisconsin since the early 1980’s based on historical data. Most likely the raccoons have canine distemper which is very common in Wisconsin, though we can’t be sure without testing. People should avoid sick raccoons as the signs of distemper and rabies are similar and it is not possible to tell what is wrong with a sick raccoon without testing. If any person or domestic animal has physical contact with a raccoon (bite or scratch), they should contact their county health department for directions and DATCP for domestic animal concerns.” Residents who have observed a sick or dead wild animal or wild bird are asked to contact the Wildlife Switchboard by email: DNRWildlifeSwitchboard@wisconsin.gov, or phone: 608-267-0866, and/or by submitting a survey using the following form: Sick or Dead Bird Reporting Form.

(Supplied)In short:Poultry farmers are being required to kill tens of thousands of their chickens to stop the spread of bird flu.The industry says it gets minimal financial support from government.What's next?Victoria's chief veterinary officer says farms infected with avian influenza need to be in quarantine for at least three months.abc.net.auews/chicken-egg-farmer-compensation-bird-flu-outbreak/104017858Link copiedShareShare articleAs Victorian farmers continue to battle the nation's largest-ever outbreak of bird flu, the business owners who have lost their poultry are facing a grim recovery period.More than a million chickens have been killed in south-western Victoria since May to combat avian influenza, in line with national biosecurity protocols.Seven farms near Meredith and one near Terang have been found to have infected birds.Avian influenza has also been detected at two commercial poultry farms near Sydney, and one in the ACT.Linda Fahy, Agriculture Victoria's regional manager for animal health and wellbeing for south-west Victoria, said compensation for livestock losses was available for farmers who were required to cull animals due to emergency diseases.A farm near Terang was found to have a different strain of avian influenza called H7N9. (ABC South West Victoria: Jean Bell)There is no other financial support available from the state government for businesses that will be without an income for months or years while their flocks rebuild to a point where they can re-enter the egg supply chain."Unfortunately, disaster recovery funding arrangements don't apply to biosecurity emergencies," Ms Fahy said."There is no compensation for consequential loss, loss of market or production loss."Farmers and businesses might have individual [private] insurance arrangements including income protection."Long recoveryVictoria's chief veterinary officer Graeme Cooke said once a farm became infected with avian influenza, it would need to be in quarantine for at least three months."Every farm is different, [quarantine time] depends on size and scale," Dr Cooke said."The first stage is to remove the infected birds and prevent the spread and then the farms go through a period of cleaning and disinfection — then they need to be empty for a period of time as well."The shortest possible time is three to four months, but in many cases it may be much longer than that due to the scale of the operation required."All seven farms affected by bird flu have been put into quarantine, including this property near Meredith. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)Farmers are compensated by the state government for birds that are killed during this time, but after that point are left to rebuild their businesses without fiscal assistance.Premium egg-laying chickens range from four months to two years old and are valued at approximately $25 per bird, according to industry estimates.After this, the hens produce lower-quality eggs, which decreases the chickens' monetary value and therefore how much compensation is paid to the farmer.Agriculture Victoria would not confirm this with figure with the ABC, but said "the [compensation for] livestock was calculated based on farm-gate value, and it's determined as if they were disease-free.""We take into account lots of different factors — age, sex, breed, body condition, live weight and also production records, and any other relevant factors at the time," Ms Fahy said.Is protection possible?Australia has a nationally agreed response plan and cost-sharing arrangements in place to respond to animal diseases, including avian influenza.The cost of the clean-up of bird flu is billed to the poultry industry through levies.Dr Cooke said, despite vaccines for emergency animal diseases being available, inoculating Australia's chicken population was unlikely to be an effective management or prevention tool."This is a virus that changes a lot, and very rapidly," Dr Cooke said.Agriculture Victoria staff on site at an egg farm in Meredith managing an outbreak of bird flu. (ABC News: Rochelle Kirkham)"While there are some avian influenza vaccines available in the world, they're not very effective and it takes a long time to get a vaccinated population."The national approach, and global approach, is to find the disease and remove it."At the moment, we have no other evidence that would leave us to even contemplate vaccines at present."Dr Cooke said vaccinating could also encourage the disease to further circulate among the country's bird population.Victoria's chief veterinarian Dr Graeme Cooke has confirmed more than one million birds will be killed to prevent the spread of avian influenza in the state.

Picture: Federation UniversityScientists examining the spread of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAIV H5) infections on Antarctic wildlife have found the virus has spread in Antarctica.A team of international scientists have been on the southern continent examining the presence and impact of bird flu on wildlife when they made the discovery in the Northern Weddell Sea area.HPAIV H5 was first detected in South America at the end of 2022 and was confirmed in Antarctica in February this year.The most affected species on the continent was skuas birds, with scientists concerned their high mortality levels may have long-term consequences for their survival.The virus has caused significant mortalities of wild birds and mammals. Picture: Federation UniversitySince 2020, the unprecedented spread of avian influenza has caused significant mortalities of wild birds and mammals on an almost global scale.Scientists hold grave concerns about the effect of avian influenza on wildlife populations in Antarctica particularly for species that are near threatened to critically endangered.Federation University expedition leader Meagan Dewar said setting up surveillance on Antarctica could help monitor the impact of HPAIV H5 in coming years.A team of scientists have confirmed the spread of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza of the H5 subtype (HPAIV H5) infections on Antarctic wildlife. Picture: Federation UniversityThe dangerous strain of avian influenza had wreaked havoc on every continent except Australia and the rest of Oceania.Millions of wild birds around the world have been affected, with about 650,000 wild birds reported dead in South America alone.Doherty Institute senior research fellow Dr Michelle Wille said it was only a matter of time before the virus arrived in Australia, with experts predicting the highest risk period between August and November when millions of migratory birds arrived from northern Asia.The current HPAIV H5 of interest initially evolved in poultry but has recently adapted to betterspread in wildlife. Picture: Federation University.“Penguins in Antarctica, pelicans in Peru, sea lions in South America and dairy cows in the United States have all been hit by fast-spreading and often lethal high pathogenicity avian influenza, known as HPAI H5N1,” Dr Wille said.“It’s since been found in penguins, elephant seals, fur seals and Antarctic terns.“This virus is threatening the survival of entire species.“Some populations of birds and even entire species may never recover.”Dr Wile said when the virus did arrive black swans would be highly susceptible.“Overseas, pelicans, cormorants, penguins, gannets, terns, gulls and seals have been amongst the hardest hit,” she said.“This spring, please look out for sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals and report it.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link Reuters Updated On Jul 3, 2024 at 12:30 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals By Maggie Fick and Yadarisa ShabongLondon: British drugmaker GSK said on Wednesday it is restructuring a partnership with German biotech CureVac and will take control of several vaccines the two companies were jointly developing. GSK said it will pay CureVac 400 million euros ($429.44 million) upfront and up to an additional 1.05 billion euros ($1.13 billion) in development, regulatory and sales milestones as well as tiered royalties. The partnership began in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and saw the two companies work together to develop vaccines for infectious diseases using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. Advt GSK is one of the world's leading vaccine manufacturers. Wednesday's agreement reflects CEO Emma Walmsley's focus on vaccines and infectious diseases as a strategy to counter patent expiries and declining revenue from current bestselling medicines by the end of this decade. CureVac is selling its major vaccine development projects, taking the upfront payment from GSK to boost its cash position and to focus on new cancer treatments. It said in April it is laying off workers as it tries to move beyond its failure to develop an mRNA-based COVID vaccine during the pandemic. GSK will now take forward the development of a vaccine for flu and another for COVID-19 that are in phase II trials and another for avian flu that is in phase I, or early stage, trials. The licensing agreement announced Wednesday does not affect the size of GSK's stake in CureVac, which stands at 130 million euros, a GSK spokesperson said.

He reported his symptoms to state health officials, who tested him for influenza at the State Public Health Laboratory. Specimens forwarded to CDC for additional testing were positive for H5N1. CDPHE gave the individual antiviral treatment with oseltamivir in accordance with CDC guidance, and the patient has recovered.“The risk to most people remains low. Avian flu viruses are currently spreading among animals, but they are not adapted to spread from person to person. Right now, the most important thing to know is that people who have regular exposure to infected animals are at increased risk of infection and should take precautions when they have contact with sick animals,” said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist, CDPHE.Coloradans should not touch sick or dead animals. If you must handle sick or dead animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment, including an N95 respirator, eye protection and gloves. If possible, wash your hands with soap and water afterward. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.“We continue to work closely with the Colorado Department of Agriculture, local public health agencies, and CDC as we monitor this virus to protect all Coloradans,” said Scott Bookman, senior director of public health readiness and response, CDPHE. “While it’s rare for people to become infected with avian flu viruses, direct exposure to infected animals increases that risk.” RecommendedSponsoredFeed mill optimization: Balancing efficiency, nutrition and costLatest NewsAlltech’s warns of rise in mycotoxin contaminationRelated StoriesAvian InfluenzaStudy: H5N1 stable on milking equipment for at least 1 hourAvian InfluenzaIowa, Minnesota report H5N1 in dairy herdsAvian Influenza3rd human case of H5N1 exhibits respiratory symptomsSponsoredFeed mill optimization: Balancing efficiency, nutrition and costMore in Avian InfluenzaAvian InfluenzaCDC to intensify prevention of HPAI spread among farm workersThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says serologic testing of a small sample group indicated that 7% of dairy workers had evidence of recent infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) virus.Brand InsightsPrecision Poultry Nutrition for Peak PerformanceADM Corp.Ensure high stability and increased bioavailability with innovative mineral solutions.

ACT Health said the deaths did not occur during the current reporting period, but it has brought this year's death toll up to 34. As of July 5, there were 37 people in hospital with COVID-19, one person in the intensive care unit and one person on a ventilator.Flu seasonThe ACT also saw 60 per cent more recorded cases of influenza in the week ending July 4 as the one before.Meanwhile, cases of both RSV and COVID-19 dropped slightly. The ACT has reported an increase in influenza cases. Picture by Gary RamageOver a longer period, all three viruses have been on the rise since May this year.NSW also saw a sharp increase in patients with influenza-like illnesses turning up to emergency departments in June.NSW Health said "influenza activity is at a high level and continues to increase".The state is experiencing an early flu season, experts say.Influenza is particularly dangerous in young children and older people.By the end of May this year, 152 Australians had died from influenza, 114 from RSV and 1785 from COVID-19.Influenza and RSV can also cause pneumonia.ACT data showed 227 cases of pneumonia cases in children under the age of 18 in March and April 2024. There were only 47 cases were recorded in the same period in 2023.Low vaccination rateAs of June 30, only one quarter of ACT children between six months and five years were immunised against the flu.Children aged between five and 15 have the lowest influenza vaccination rate at only 13.7 per cent.Head of the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control, Professor Paul Kelly, said people need to get vaccinated from the flu."It is a serious virus that can cause severe illness, hospitalisation and death among otherwise healthy children and adults," he said.Professor Paul Kelly. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong"I encourage everyone six months of age or over to get vaccinated against the flu. It could save your life."Viral illnesses spread more easily in colder months for several reasons. People are more likely to be in close proximity indoors, dry weather can allow virus droplets stay in the air longer, and immunity may be adversely impacted by cold weather.- with Anna McGuinness, Bageshri SavyasachiShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyLanie TindaleReporterI am City reporter at The Canberra Times.

We have to wait for results.”Rebecca said her son’s completely unexpected death had devastated his whole family, his friends, fellow students at Upper Hutt College, and the wider community.He was farewelled a week later with his funeral attended by schoolmates, former teachers and others in the Upper Hutt community.“William was an amazing, talented and very bright kind boy who we love so very much,” she said.“He was a talented musician and had his future all planned out.”“It is an incredibly hard and devastating time for us.”A friend of Rebecca’s set up a Givealittle page to help pay for funeral costs and to relieve the financial pressure to give Rebecca and William’s two brothers time to grieve.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.William Jones proudly passed his driver's licence a month after his 16th birthday in 2023.Friends, former teachers and community members had donated to the page and left heartfelt messages for William describing him as “a wonderful friend” and “sweet young man.”Rebecca said William was an amazing son with great plans for his future.“Life will never be the same without my gorgeous 16-year-old boy.”The tragedy comes as health experts have been urging Kiwis to be aware of the risks of respiratory viruses over winter, including influenza, Covid-19, RSV and rhinovirus, which causes the common cold.While Covid-19 has become New Zealand’s number one infectious-disease killer, flu remained a major burden - accounting for about 2% of deaths annually.But flu-related deaths among younger, healthy people were highly uncommon, with the vast proportion of mortalities annually reported among our over-65 population.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.In February, six residents of Whitianga Care Centre and Village died within two weeks of each other during an outbreak of influenza A.ESR surveillance showed national rates of influenza-like illness was running at normal rates for the time of year, with A/H1N1 or “swine flu” – a strain known to hit elderly people and young children particularly hard – making up the bulk of sampled cases.H1N1 was among the strains targeted by this year’s flu vaccine, now freely available to people over 65 and other higher-risk groups.To donate to Rebecca’s Givealittle page click here.Kirsty Wynn is an Auckland-based journalist with more than 20 years’ experience in New Zealand newsrooms.

This comes as there has been a notable increase in influenza cases, with over 1,300 confirmed infections reported so far this winter, predominantly in high-density suburbs such as Mbare, Glen View, Budiriro, Tafara, and Glen Norah. In an interview with ZBC News on July 1st, Dr. Chonzi clarified that despite flu symptoms resembling those of COVID-19, testing has confirmed cases of Influenza A. He said: We are indeed seeing several flue cases or flue-like cases throughout the country, particularly in Harare. It’s not uncommon though that as you transition from the warm season into the cold season like we are doing right now you get an increase in flu-like symptoms.Buy Samsung, itel, Redmi smartphones in Zimbabwe WhatsApp: +263715068543 There will be circulation of many viruses and some of those viruses are the ones that cause the flu. We have isolated Influenza A type virus in most of the cases that we are seeing right now. Of course, the symptoms are COVID-19-like symptoms because most of us have experienced it before. We have been testing, doing PCR testing to confirm whether or not we are dealing with the same strain of COVID-19, but what we are seeing is on the contrary, it still appears like what is circulating is the influenza virus. We encourage people to still practice what we were teaching them the last time we were experiencing COVID-19. Good personal hygiene keep warm, and seek medication early if you are unwell so that we avoid complications. People have a role to play in terms of personal health, but as it is we have not confirmed that this is COVID-19 as we experienced it from 2019 to 2022. Chonzi warned that young children (that is those under the age of 5), the elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most susceptible to severe flu complications. He said: Influenza normally affects children, so those that are under five or under four years are mostly affected. Those who have comorbidities and the elderly are also severely affected. If you are fit if you exercise regularly and if your immunity is okay you may have symptoms, but they are not as severe as the ones that you are seeing right now. So, many individuals who are succumbing or experiencing severe illness likely have other underlying health conditions or may not be as resilient as they should be. Children, on the other hand, because their immune systems are still developing, may also suffer from severe disease. Similarly, the elderly and those who are immunocompromised are prone to experiencing severe illness as well. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. It is caused by influenza viruses and typically manifests with symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. Influenza can range from mild to severe illness and can lead to complications. Prevention of influenza includes practising good hand hygiene, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and staying home from work or school when experiencing flu-like symptoms to prevent spreading the virus to others.

THE Ministry of Health and Child Care will this week embark on an awareness campaign on the new flu virus that has claimed lives as the government moves to allay fears it is a reincarnation of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with NewsDay yesterday, Health and Child Care deputy minister Sleiman Timios Kwidini said his ministry would begin moving around conscientising the public on how to protect themselves from the virus that has been reportedly claiming lives since its outbreak a few months ago. “The wave going around is a general flu virus and at present we are not vaccinating but would like to conscientise the public to be aware and to protect themselves. We have our team which should be starting awareness campaigns this week to remind people to prevent themselves from the flu,” Kwidini said. Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association president Johannes Marisa said few COVID-19 tests were being done as most available kits had expired. He added that the few tests that had been done produced negative results ruling out the fact that the current wave is related to COVID-19. “This is ordinary flu, it kills if complications are not attended to early. It exacerbates underlying illnesses for example asthma and diabetes. It also kills those above 65 and below five,” Marisa said. “In other age groups, people get killed mainly because they don’t pay attention to their underlying problems. People should take note of their underlying conditions and keep them under control.” Kadoma City Council director of Health and Environmental Services Daniel Chirundu said they were recording a noticeably high incidence of flu cases in the city.Keep Reading Young entrepreneur dreams big Chibuku NeShamwari holds onto ethos of culture Health talk: Be wary of measles, its a deadly disease Macheso, Dhewa inspired me: Chinembiri “Generally, like all areas, we are experiencing an increase in flu cases. We are treating them symptomatically and we are encouraging people to live in well-ventilated houses and to keep warm during this cold spell,” he said. Community Working Group on Health executive director Itai Rusike said there was a need to upgrade the surveillance system to strongly monitor the seasonal strains in circulation. “As a country with considerable health challenges and a very weak health delivery system we require strengthening of preventive measures and for the population to be in the know of mitigative measures,” he said. He said lessons from COVID-19 remained relevant in terms of maintaining a clean safe environment to reduce infectivity which includes hand washing, social distancing and wearing of face masks around those with flu. “Following vaccination against COVID-19 there would have been concerted efforts to ensure population protection against influenza given that there had been several seasons of severe flues in the lead up to the pandemic. “These include case management guidelines for the seasonal flu at most providers and the plethora of pharmacies which dispense antibiotics for flu when it’s a viral and not bacterial illness. This is contributing to yet another simmering pandemic of microbial resistance,” he said. Rusike said Zimbabweans should improve compliance with the international health regulations, (IHR, 2005, 2012) and also join South Africa and other progressive countries in contributing to the Global Influenza Surveillance Network to better improve preparedness and effectiveness to seasonal influenza and future emerging pandemics. Public Health Adviser to the President, Agnes Mahomva, said the government had maintained its routine surveillance of flu, adding that recent ones by the Health and Child Care ministry indicated that the influenza going around is not COVID-19. “Government is not vaccinating for the flu virus. Note that when and if vaccines are given, they are usually given before the flu season to prevent the disease. Vaccines are not given to cure the disease. People should seek medical attention soon when flu symptoms get worse to avoid complications or to get complications treated on time. This is very important especially for the elderly, the very young and those with underlying medical conditions,” she said. Mahomva urged the public not to panic. “They must instead step up their home flu prevention and management measures such as drinking lots of fluids and resting when one has flu,” she said, adding that good hygienic practices such as wearing a face mask if one has flu to avoid spreading the virus and covering one’s nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing were also key. Mahomva urged people to stay away from crowded places where the flu virus spreads easily. Since the onset of the winter season, a deadly flu wave has been going round, resulting in deaths, creating worry among the public.

THE City of Harare had recorded more than 1 300 cases of influenza by the weekend since the onset of the winter season, with 40% of the victims being children under the age of four, a top council official has said. In a statement, Harare epidemiology and disease control officer Michael Vere said more than 70% of the cases were from high-density suburbs. “Harare has recorded more than 1 300 influenza cases. Seventy percent are from high-density areas such as Mbare, Glen View, Budiriro, Tafara, Glen Norah topping the list. Forty percent of cases are children below four years,” Vere said. “Preliminary results so far show that Influenza A virus may be the cause of the current surge in influenza cases. “Influenza symptoms range from mild to severe. Treatment of influenza is mainly supportive since this is a viral infection. Respiratory distress may warrant administration of oxygen and, therefore, those with severe diseases may require admission. Most cases are, however, mild.” Vere said prevention is mainly through vaccination. Government has since allayed fears that the wave currently going around could be a COVID-19 strain after tests concluded that it was a general flu strain. According to the latest report from the Health and Child Care ministry,cases of the flu bug continue to escalate.Keep Reading Boom times for poultry farmers Boom times for poultry farmers Gweru debtors’ bill soars to $3bn Bird flu: Nigeria is on major migratory bird routes, new strains keep appearing “The ministry advises people to wear warm clothes and take extra precautions, as the virus is still active.
