Tuesday, October 4, 2022— Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) kicked off the 2022-2023 flu vaccination season during a press conference held in person at the National Press Club for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading infectious disease experts, including CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, emphasized the importance of flu vaccination and getting up to date on other routine immunizations, including pneumococcal vaccination. Dr. Walensky presented an overview of last flu season, reviewed the most recent flu vaccination coverage data, and discussed the upcoming flu season, including a notable change to the flu vaccine recommendations for this season; the preferential recommendation for specific vaccines for people 65 years and older. Overall, during the 2021-2022 flu season, about 51% of the U.S. population 6 months and older received a flu vaccine, which has changed little compared to the previous two flu seasons and even prior to the pandemic. However, there were some concerning findings in flu vaccination coverage estimates, including: decreases in coverage among children and pregnant people that have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that only about 43% of adults 18-49 years with a chronic health condition got a flu vaccine last season, and persistent racial and ethnic disparities. Expert panelists at the 2022 NFID Influenza/Pneumococcal Disease News Conference on Tuesday, October 4, 2022. During most seasons people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease, accounting for the majority of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. For the 2022-2023 flu season, there are three flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older. These are Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccine and Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine. This preferential recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggested that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. People 65 years and older should try to get one of these three preferentially recommended vaccines. If none of these three vaccines is available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead. While COVID-19 vaccines have been rightfully the focus of much attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts at the press conference urged the public to remember the ongoing importance of flu and pneumococcal vaccination. Dr. Walensky noted that CDC is preparing for the return of flu this season and reminded attendees that flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can be given in the same visit if the timing coincides. Both vaccines have been shown to reduce illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Flu continues to pose a serious potential public health threat, and annual flu vaccination remains a critical tool to prevent flu and its potentially serious outcomes. CDC and its many partners work to improve flu vaccine uptake each year. CDC has launched a digital campaign called “Help Them Fight Flu” to encourage parents of young children to get them vaccinated against flu. CDC’s “Help Them Fight Flu” communication activation is available for everyone to participate in. (Upload your own flu vaccination photos in one of the customizable frames and share with your family, friends and followers.) CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. CDC also is continuing its collaboration with the AMA and the Ad Council to raise awareness among general population about the importance of flu vaccination, with a focus on Black and Hispanic audiences. This is one of the ways CDC is addressing persistent racial and ethnic disparities. CDC will release updated vaccine coverage and hospitalization data by race and ethnicity as well as more information on how CDC is working to address barriers to vaccination on October 18 in a Vital Signs MMWR report. CDC is already tracking flu vaccine distribution and coverage for the 2022-2023 flu season. As of September 24, 2022, approximately 91 million doses of flu vaccine had been distributed while as of September 10, 2022, 3.7 million doses had been administered to adults in pharmacies and physician offices. Over the course of the 2022-2023 flu season, CDC will share some preliminary, within-season, weekly flu vaccination data and coverage estimates using existing and new data sources through the Weekly National Flu Vaccination Dashboard. The dashboard will be updated regularly throughout the flu season as new data become available. CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu each year. Flu vaccination reduces the burden of flu illness, hospitalization, and death and getting vaccinated could also help protect those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like babies and young children, older people, and people with certain chronic health conditions. If you have questions about which flu vaccine is right for you or getting your flu vaccine at the same time as another vaccine, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or health care provider.

According to the CDC, every year in the United States, millions of children get sick with flu like illnesses and thousands of them are hospitalized due to complications from influenza viruses. Also, the risk of complications from the flu virus increases for those 65 years and older. According to the World Health Organization, there are about 3 to5 million cases of severe illness annually due to influenza viruses and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths. While influenza and COVID-19 are both typically considered winter viruses, they can occur at anytime. “In other words, there is an increased risk of infection rate during the winter season compared to any other period in the year,” said Army Public Health Nurse Regional Consultant Lt. Col. Simeon Smith. “During this winter season, we have to be vigilant to protect our families, friends, communities and ourselves from the spread of both influenza viruses and COVID-19.” According to health experts, influenza viruses and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses and can affect the upper airway and sometimes the lungs. “Without being protected by the influenza and COVID vaccines, no one is immune from these viruses,” added Smith. Health officials warn that being infected with one, or both, of these viruses can cause mild to severe illnesses and could lead to death. According to Smith, both of these viruses have similar symptoms, and it can be difficult to tell the difference just by looking at or experiencing the symptoms. Smith recommends to consult with a healthcare provider and get tested when you feel sick or display symptoms. “As we enter into the winter season, it is increasingly important to take the necessary precautions to protect ourselves against influenza viruses and COVID-19,” said Smith. The FDA recently approved COVID-19 vaccine for those who are six months old and above. Studies show that since the development and implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine, there has been a sharp decline in the death rate and hospitalization in the United States and Europe. According to Smith, the influenza vaccine is an approved seasonal vaccine that is administered every year. Tricare beneficiaries can contact their MTFs in order to receive the vaccines. “There are things we all can do in protecting our family, friends, our communities and ourselves,” said Smith. Smith offered the following recommended preventive measures to protect families, friends and ourselves: Get vaccinated. Vaccines Save lives. Stay home when you are not feeling well; do not send your child to school or daycare when he or she is feeling sick, consult with your healthcare provider. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water; if water is not available, use alcohol based hand sanitizer. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with these viruses. Cover your nose and mouth with tissue or the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze Limit your contact with others when you are sick and avoid close contact with people who are sick. When possible, have more outdoor activities instead of indoor activities. “We all have a role to play in protecting ourselves and love ones and limiting the spread of viruses within our schools, work environments and communities,” added Smith. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that individuals should get vaccinated because it is the best protection against the influenza and COVID-19 viruses. Individuals are encouraged to contact their local MTF in and arrange to get their flu and COVID-19 vaccines.

They can cause acute and chronic infections, suppress, or exacerbate immunity, or dysregulate survival and growth of cells. To identify chemical agents with pro- or antiviral effects we conducted arrayed high-content image-based multi-cycle infection screens of 1,280 mainly FDA-approved compounds with three human viruses, rhinovirus (RV), influenza A virus (IAV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) differing in genome organization, composition, presence of an envelope, and tropism. Based on Z’-factors assessing screening quality and Z-scores ranking individual compounds, we identified potent inhibitors and enhancers of infection: the RNA mutagen 5-Azacytidine against RV-A16; the broad-spectrum antimycotic drug Clotrimazole inhibiting IAV-WSN; the chemotherapeutic agent Raltitrexed blocking HSV-1; and Clobetasol enhancing HSV-1. Remarkably, the topical antiseptic compound Aminacrine, which is clinically used against bacterial and fungal agents, inhibited all three viruses. Our data underscore the versatility and potency of image-based, full cycle virus propagation assays in cell-based screenings for antiviral agents.Measurement(s)transmission of virus • drug toxicityTechnology Type(s)fluorescence microscopyFactor Type(s)virus genotype • cell line • incubation temperature • number of cells seeded/ seeding density • inoculation time • virus input FFU • drug concentrationSample Characteristic - OrganismHomo sapiens • Rhinovirus A • Influenza A virus • Human alphaherpesvirus 1Sample Characteristic - EnvironmentepitheliumSample Characteristic - LocationSwitzerland Similar content being viewed by others Drug repurposing screens identify chemical entities for the development of COVID-19 interventions Article Open access 03 June 2021 A high-content image-based drug screen of clinical compounds against cell transmission of adenovirus Article Open access 12 August 2020 Accelerating antiviral drug discovery: lessons from COVID-19 Article 12 May 2023 Background & SummaryViruses pose major threats to human health beyond SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The World Health Organization lists at least 15 potentially epidemic or pandemic infectious diseases, mostly viral1. While vaccination has been very effective to limit many viral diseases, important viruses lack approved vaccines. Considering that viruses require host and viral factors for replication and maintenance, it is likely that all viruses are susceptible to antiviral compounds. A majority of approved antiviral agents targets viral factors, and is subject to evasion by mutations2. Hence, the search for host targeting antivirals is increasing3,4. One approach is to revisit compounds approved for human use in nonviral disease, and assess their anti-viral potency for repurposing5,6,7,8,9.We present pro- and antiviral effects of mostly FDA-approved chemicals on three different human viruses: rhinovirus (RV) type A16, influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 WSN strain, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (Table 1). RVs belong to the family Picornaviridae and comprise more than 160 genotypes10. Their particles are non-enveloped and have a positive-sense single-stranded (+)ssRNA genome of about 7.2 kb11. RVs are highly prevalent and infect the upper respiratory tract, typically with common cold symptoms and exacerbated disease in patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions12,13,14. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies against RVs15. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family with four genera A, B, C, and D, and cause seasonal and sporadic flu pandemics16. They contain a 10–14.6 kb segmented negative-sense (−)ssRNA genome in enveloped particles. Influenza viruses are clinically treated by direct-acting antivirals against the cap-dependent endonuclease or the neuraminidase, or antibodies against the hemagglutinin, albeit subject to viral evasion17. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus causing recurrent cutaneous lesions. It forms enveloped particles containing an icosahedral protein capsid with a double-stranded DNA genome of about 150 kb delivered and replicated in the cell nucleus18,19. Acyclovir and some of its derivatives are used against HSV but not against the cancer-causing gamma-herpesvirus Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), although Ganciclovir has been used against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)20,21,22,23.Table 1 Characteristics and screening conditions for the different viruses tested against the PCL compounds. The viruses differ in their genome composition, size, envelopment, tropism, and plaque shape. The screening conditions were optimized for each virus individually. FFU = focus forming unit, GFP = green fluorescent protein, NP = nucleoprotein, BafA1 = Bafilomycin A1, GCV = Ganciclovir.Full size tableHere, we conducted three parallel image-based virus infection screens on a platform that we previously used for adenovirus5. We employed the Prestwick Chemical Library (PCL) containing 1,280 mostly FDA-approved compounds targeting a broad range of diseases, including cancer and infections5,24,25. Cells were seeded onto the pre-spotted compounds at 1.25 μM final compound concentration. A single concentration of 1.25 μM risks to miss those compounds that have an antiviral efficacy <1.25 µM and toxicity >1.25 µM. We estimated, however, that the number of such compounds would be very low, based on our earlier image-based screen with coronavirus 229E-GFP using a library of 5440 mostly FDA approved compounds (including the PCL compounds) at 1.67 µM9. This screen yielded only five of 5440 compounds (0.1%) with tox50 > 1.25 µM and EC50 < 0.25 µM. Assuming a similar frequency of low EC50 and high tox50 compounds in the PCL, this would amount to 1–2 compounds. Seeded cells were subsequently infected for several rounds of replication, fixed and analyzed by Plaque2.0 software26, followed by scoring the number of infected and total cell nuclei, infection index (ratio of infected nuclei over total nuclei), number of plaques (fluorescent foci), and integrated signal intensity of infection markers (Table 1, Fig. 1, and Supplementary Fig. 1). Four replicate screens with RV and IAV demonstrated high quality indicated by mean Z’-factors of 0.13–0.53 determined at two institutions, UZH and EPFL, while the HSV-1 screen was performed in three replicates and imaged and analyzed at one institution. All the raw and scored data are available at the Image Data Resource (IDR, idr.openmicroscopy.org) with the accession numbers idr0128 (IAV)27, idr0129 (RV)28, and idr0130 (HSV)29. The structure of the data is described in Fig. 2 and scores in Tables 2 and 3.Fig. 1Screening pipeline. (a) Prior to screen execution, several assay parameters were optimized. Stability and quality were verified with pre-plates and Z’-plates. The subsequent screening was followed by image acquisition and analysis at two independent institutions UZH and EPFL. Identified hits were compared and best hits were selected. (b) Timeline for the wet-lab pipeline. A549 or HOG cells were seeded on 384-well plates pre-spotted with PCL compounds and control compounds through an Echo acoustic liquid handling system, yielding a final concentration of 1.25 μM upon cell seeding in 80 μl. On the next day, the adherent cells were inoculated with virus, PFA-fixed after 48 h for RV, 34 h for IAV, and 26 h for HSV-1, and stained with Hoechst 33342 and antibody, if necessary. Plates were then imaged using a high-throughput epifluorescence microscope, and analyzed with the Plaque2.0 software. (c) Exemplary overviews of one screening plate for each virus screen. Individual images of each well were stitched yielding the overviews. First two columns of each plate contained DMSO control solvent, the following 20 columns PCL compounds, and the last two columns the positive controls (BafA1 for RV and IAV, and GCV for HSV-1). Scale bar represents 10 mm.Full size imageFig. 2Structure of data available at the Image Data Resource. (a,c) Data provided for download are organized in three folders 1-prePlates, 2-ZPlates, 3-Screen, and contain parameters, result files, images, and analyses of the plates. (b,d) The data for viewing are divided into five screens, where screenA contains the pre-plates, screenB and -C contain the Z’-plates imaged at UZH and EPFL, respectively, and screenD and -E hold the images acquired of the screening plates at UZH and EPFL, respectively. For HSV (d), images of the screening plates can be accessed under screenC. Note that image acquisition and analyses for HSV-1 were performed at UZH only, not at EPFL.Full size imageTable 2 Representation of the Z’-factor plates. To assess the quality of the screening platform, Z’-factors were determined in dedicated plates before conducting the drug screens. For each virus, two plates with 192 technical replicates of each positive and negative control were infected, and Z’-factors determined for the five screen read-outs by independent imaging at UZH and EPFL (RV and HSV-1 only at UZH) using the formula given in Eq. (1) for 3σ and 2σ.Full size tableTable 3 Compilation of Z’-factors derived from screening plates. Z’-factors are used to assess the quality of the screens. Based on 32 technical replicates of each positive and negative control compounds the Z’-factors were determined for each virus and screening plate considering the five imaging read-outs determined independently at UZH and EPFL using the formula given in Eq. (1) for 3σ. Note HSV-1 was assessed at UZH only.Full size tableUpon exclusion of toxic compounds, the highest scoring antiviral agents were 5-Azacytidine for RV, Clotrimazole for IAV, and Raltitrexed for HSV, while Clobetasol-propionate enhanced HSV-1 infection transmission, as indicated by Z-score analyses and dose-response validation tests (Fig. 3, Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 1). Aminacrine (9-aminoacridine) scored as top hit for RV, HSV, and was previously reported for AdV-C25. We found that Aminacrine, Raltitrexed, 5-Azacytidine, Clobestasol, and Clotrimazole applied in the micromolar range had no significant effect on the induction of phospholipidosis, unlike the positive control compounds Amiodarone and Ammonium chloride (Supplementary Fig. 2), in agreement with the notion that the latter compounds lead to accumulation of phospholipids in lysosomes30,31. In summary, while vaccination is the gold standard in viral disease prevention, not all people can be vaccinated, and disease progression may be rapid and unaccessible to vaccination, which requires alternative treatment options. Direct-acting antivirals raise rapid viral resistance, unless applied in combination treatment, but agents targeting host functions essential for virus propagation offer a vast range of opportunities for novel treatment, also in the context of drug repurposing.Fig. 3Compound ranking according to Z-scores for each virus tested. Ranked compound scores for the parameter ‘number of plaques’ are displayed. Top hits are highlighted (red = inhibitors; purple = enhancers). Dotted lines indicate the Z-score cut-off for analysis RV (−3), for IAV-WSN (−2) and for HSV-1 (−0.5). A Z-score of −3 or less for a particular compound means that this value was less than the mean of the negative controls minus three standard deviations. Note that Aminacrine inhibited IAV-WSN infection but did not score below the Z-score cut-off of −2 in the screen.Full size imageTable 4 Top hits with effects on RV, IAV, or HSV infection. The summary includes positive and negative controls. A compound was labelled toxic if scored as such by the PrestoBlue toxicity assay or by the Z-score for the parameter ‘nuclei’ in the screens. Mean read-outs were calculated by averaging four biological replicates (three for HSV) for PCL compounds, and 32 technical replicates over four biological replicates (three for HSV) for positive and negative controls. Normalized values are mean read-outs relative to the mean of the corresponding positive control over all replicates. Compounds that showed low toxicity and high inhibitory or enhancing effects on viral infection were selected as best hits depending on their clinical potential.Full size tableMethodsCell cultureA549 cells (human adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA), and HeLa Ohio cells (HOG, human cervix carcinoma epithelial cells) were obtained from L. Kaiser (Central Laboratory of Virology, University Hospital Geneva, Switzerland) and used as described32,33. Cells were cultured at 95% humidity, 37 °C, 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and 1% penicillin streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Cells were split regularly upon reaching 90% of confluence by washing with PBS followed by Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) treatment, not surpassing a passage number of 20.VirusesRV-A16-GFP was kindly provided by Dr. James Gern (University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, USA). The virus was expanded by inoculation of HeLa Ohio cells with a lysate from cells infected at 33.5 °C overnight. At occurrence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in 80–90% of cells, the cells were harvested and pelleted. Lysis was performed by three freeze and thaw cycles, and subsequent addition of 1% v/v NP40 and use of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was treated with 150 μg of RNase per 10 ml at 37 °C for 30 min. Purification of the virus was performed on a CsCl gradient before dialysis against 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgCl2. The purified virus was stored at −80 °C32,34. IAV-WSN (H1N1) was grown in MDCK cells, and purified on a sucrose gradient35,36. The recombinant strain HSV-1-C12-CMV-GFP, referred to as HSV-1-GFP, was kindly provided by S. Efstathiou (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK)37,38. Virus was expanded on A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection) upon inoculation of supernatant from cells infected at 37 °C for 24 h. At 2 dpi, when strong CPE was visible, supernatant was collected, cleared from debris by centrifugation at 1,500 × g, 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 22,000 × g, 4 °C for 90 min to pellet virions. The pellet was agitated overnight in MNT buffer (30 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, resuspended and virus was purified by centrifugation through a nycodenz gradient of 25% and 30% w/v in MNT buffer at 20,000 rpm, 4 °C for 2 h. All purified viruses were stored at −80 °C. Virus titers were determined by TCID50 titration according to the Spearman-Kärber method.Prestwick chemical library, control compounds, and Z’-platesThe Prestwick Chemical Library (PCL) was obtained from Prestwick Chemical (Illkirch, France). Compounds for controls and validations were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, USA), MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, USA), and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at concentrations of 10, 50 or 100 mM. For each virus, a set of four microscopy grade 384-well plates (Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland) containing the negative and positive controls (columns 1, 2 and 23, 24) as well as the PCL compounds (columns 3–22) were prepared at a final concentration of 1.25 μM using an Echo acoustic dispenser (Labcyte Inc., Indiana, USA) in four biological replicates. Positive controls were spotted at a concentration of 0.625 nM BafA1 for RV, 1.563 nM BafA1 for IAV, and 25 μM GCV for HSV, respectively. DMSO was spotted at equivalent volumes as negative control. This way, each screening plate contained 32 technical replicates of each positive and negative control, and 320 of PCL compounds in single technical replicates. To assess the assay quality, Z’-factors were determined for the optimized screening conditions for each virus. For this, 192 wells of each Z’-plate were spotted with the DMSO control and 192 wells with the positive control compounds. All plates were stored at −20 °C until use.High-throughput compound screeningNumber of seeded cells, virus stock dilution, and incubation time were optimized prior to the execution of the compound screening. Determined parameters for the three viruses are summarized in Table 1. Cell seeding, virus infection, fixation, and staining were performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and the corresponding Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Prior to use, plates were thawed for 30 min at room temperature (RT), briefly centrifuged, and 10 μl of PBS were added to each well to dissolve the compounds. Subsequently, cells were seeded in 60 μl culture medium, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. On the next day, virus was added in a volume of 10 μl culture medium per well. Plates were incubated for 24–48 h, before they were fixed with 26.6 μl 16% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in PBS for 1 h at RT, followed by three washings with PBS, and final addition of 0.02% NaN3 in PBS for storage at 4 °C. For IAV, cells were incubated with 50 μl of NH4Cl for 10 min at RT, followed by treatment with 0.25% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 30 min at RT. Staining with primary mouse monoclonal anti-IAV NP antibody HB-65 was carried out at a dilution of 1:15 in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA in a volume of 30 μl per well for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) in a 1:1000 dilution in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in a volume of 30 μl for 1 h at RT. After three washes with PBS, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS was added to the cells for storage at 4 °C. For all steps, standard bore tubing cartridges were used, and tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved ddH2O and PBS before and after use, and autoclaved before next use.ImagingImages of individual wells were acquired with the DAPI channel (nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342) and the FITC channel (viral GFP or NP). The plates for RV and IAV were imaged at UZH and EPFL, while plates for HSV were imaged at UZH only. At UZH, we used an IXM-C automated inverted epifluorescence microscope (Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) at 4x magnification39. At EPFL, plates were imaged using an IN CELL 2200 automated high-throughput fluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA)5.Image analysis and data processingFive main parameters were scored using the software Plaque2.026 to quantify the infection phenotype: number of nuclei, number of infected nuclei, infection index (ratio between total number of nuclei and number of infected nuclei), total virus intensity, and number of plaques (infection foci). Each of the institutions optimized Plaque2.0 parameters according to the acquired data, and all read-outs can be found in the Plaque2.0 output files ImageData.csv and ObjectData.csv. The obtained results were then processed in R version 4.0.240 at UZH, and in KNIME version 3.5.341 together with the EPFL-BSF in-house LIMS at EPFL. For each of the four biological replicates of the 1,280 PCL compounds as well as for the 32 technical replicates on 16 biological replicates of the positive and negative controls, the mean scores for the five main read-outs were calculated. Each compound score was then normalized by the mean score of the DMSO negative control for each plate individually. All compounds within a threshold of μ- (mean of the negative control) ± 2σ (SD of the negative control) for number of nuclei were filtered for toxicity, and beyond a threshold of μ+ ± 1.5–3σ for the infection scores (number of infected nuclei, infection index, number of plaques or integrated GFP intensity) for efficacy.Z’-factor calculationAccording to Eq. 1, Z’-factors42 were determined using R version 4.0.2:$${Z}^{{\prime} }{\rm{=\; 1}}-\frac{\left({{\rm{3\sigma }}}_{+}+{{\rm{3\sigma }}}_{-}\right)}{\left|{\mu }_{+}-{\mu }_{-}\right|}$$ (1) where σ+ is the SD of the positive control, σ- is the SD of the negative control, μ+ the mean of the positive control and μ- the mean of the negative control.Z-score calculationZ-scores were computed in Python version 3.7.143 according to Eq. 2:$${\rm{Z}}=\frac{{\rm{X}}-{\rm{\mu }}}{{\rm{\sigma }}}$$ (2) where X is the plaque number or infection index of the compound, and µ and σ are the mean and SD of the negative control of the plate where the compound was spotted.PrestoBlue toxicity assayWhile toxicity of the PCL compounds on infected cells was assessed with the screening read-out ‘total number of nuclei’, toxicity of the compounds on uninfected A549 and HOG cells was determined using the PrestoBlue Cell Viability reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). PrestoBlue44,45 indicates the viability of cells via conversion of non-fluorescent resazurin to a strongly fluorescent resorufin during cellular respiration. Specifically, cells were treated with the compounds in duplicates for 24 h (A549) or 48 h (HOG) at the same concentrations and cell densities as used in the screening. Then, PrestoBlue was added to each well to a final concentration of 10%, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C (A549) or 33.5 °C (HOG) for 1 h. A multi-well plate-reader (Tecan Infinite F500, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) was used to measure fluorescence intensity at an excitation of 560/10 nm and emission at 590/10 nm. As positive control for cytotoxicity, Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Prestwick Chemical, Illkirch, France) at a final concentration of 10 μM was used, with corresponding volume of DMSO as negative control. Data processing and statistical validation were performed using the EPFL-BSF in-house Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Raw values were normalized to the positive (=1) and negative (=0) control, before averaging. Compounds were classified as toxic if the normalized value for both replicates was higher than the average + 3σ (standard deviation, SD) of the DMSO negative control for the same plate.Phospolipidosis assayThe phospolipidosis assay was performed as previously described31. Briefly, 15,000 A549 ATCC cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well imaging plate and grown overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1x NEAA. On the next day, medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1x NEAA, 7.5 µM NBD-PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), cells treated with compounds at 37 °C for 24 h, stained with a solution of DMEM, 100 mM sodium pyruvate, 200 mM L-Glutamine, 10% FCS, 1x NEAA, 10 µg/mL Hoechst 33342, and 2 µM Ethidium homodimer-2 (EthD-2, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. Microscopy images were acquired at ImageXpress Micro confocal (Molecular Devices). For image analyses, nuclear area was expanded to a diameter of 50 µm and the integrated NBD-PE fluorescence measured in the EthD-2-negative, intact cells. Drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) scores were normalized to the mean integrated intensity of the positive control Amiodarone used at 10 µM dosage.Data RecordsData structure and repositoriesData was deposited to the Image Data Resource (IDR) (https://idr.openmicroscopy.org) under accession numbers idr0128 (IAV)27, idr0129 (RV)28 and idr0130 (HSV)29.

This data was not acquired for HSV. Technical ValidationAssay stabilityHigh assay stability and reproducibility were ensured by optimization of the screening procedure. The optimization of the screening pipeline included liquid handling, cell seeding, virus inoculum, infection time, controls, exposure times and other parameters during imaging, and parameters for image analysis. All compounds and reagents were prepared as large batches from a single lot and split to single-use aliquots. Virus stock dilutions were tested regularly for efficacy, and adjusted if necessary. Pre-plates were assessed prior to every experiment to control for the functionality of the pipeline.Assay qualityTo assess the accuracy of the screening pipeline, we determined Z’-factors for the five parameters that we used for scoring the infection phenotype. Two Z’-factor plates were imaged and analyzed independently at UZH and EPFL for RV and IAV, and only at UZH for HSV (Table 2). For RV, mean 3σ Z’-factors ranged between 0.49–0.53 for the read-outs numberOfInfectedNuclei, infectionIndex, numberOfPlaques, and totalVirusIntensity, scoring excellent. For IAV, mean 3σ Z’-factors ranged between 0.13–0.37 for the same readouts, scoring good. HSV read-outs ranged between 0.15–0.37 for numberOfInfectedNuclei, infectionIndex, numberOfPlaques, scoring good. The mean 3σ Z’-factor for totalVirusIntensity was 0.1, rendering the parameter unsuitable for read-out. For all three viruses, mean 3σ Z’-factors of the Z’-factor plates as well as for the screening plates for the parameter numberOfNuclei were negative, confirming that there was no significant cell death caused by the viruses or control compounds. The 3σ Z’-factors were determined for each of the 16 screening plates per virus, and averaged. The mean 3σ Z’-factors of the screening plates for RV and HSV were in the range of 0.36–0.66, scoring good to excellent, and the Z’-factors of the screening plates for IAV ranged from 0.1–0.37, scoring good.Independent analysis and filteringTwo independent research groups, at UZH and EPFL, performed acquisition of plate images, image analysis, and data processing (Fig. 1) for the RV and IAV screens. We compared the variance between the measurements of the two institutions by correlating the compound ranks based on the Z-scores of each compound. For the computed parameters number of plaques and infection index the Pearson correlation coefficients were the following: IAV (infection index) = 0.922, IAV (number of plaques) = 0.818, RV (infection index) = 0.852, RV (number of plaques) = 0.407, indicating good to excellent correlation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Since we achieved high reproducibility and correlation of results from the two institutions in the screenings of these viruses, we decided to further perform the imaging and analysis of HSV plates only at UZH. Both analysis pipelines confirmed high assay quality (Tables 2 and 3). Compounds that were identified as toxic in uninfected cells (PrestoBlue assay) were excluded during hit filtering. This resulted in the following top virus inhibitory hits: 5-Azacytidine (Prestw-338) for RV, Clotrimazole (Prestw-267) for IAV, and Raltitrexed (Prestw-1793) for HSV-1 (Table 1).Usage NotesFive parameters were used to score the infection phenotype of each well: the number of nuclei (numberOfNuclei), number of infected nuclei (numberOfInfectedNuclei), the ratio between number of infected and total nuclei (infectionIndex), the number of multi-round infection foci termed plaques (numberOfPlaques), and the extend of viral GFP reporter expression as integrated GFP intensity (totalVirusIntensity).Infection scoring using the Plaque2.0 GUIA detailed manual for Plaque2.0-based infection phenotype scoring is available at http://plaque2.github.io/.

In previous years, no cases or only a few cases were detected during the summer period. The overall 2021–2022 HPAI season has produced the largest epidemic A widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time so far observed in Europe.Between 11 June and 9 September 2022, 788 HPAI virus detections were reported in 16 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with 56 in poultry, 22 and 710 in captive and wild birds, respectively. The unusual persistence Persistence refers to the ability of harmful organisms like bacteria to survive and thrive despite regular cleaning and disinfection efforts, potentially lingering in hidden places for months or even years in wild birds continued throughout the summer and occurred in 15 European countries. The virus reached sea bird breeding colonies on the north Atlantic coast, causing massive mortality, particularly in Germany, France, Netherlands, and the UK.Heavily infected wild birds presented an ongoing risk of infection for domestic birds too. From June to September, the number of outbreaks in domestic birds declined compared to previous months, but was more than five times higher compared to the same period the year before.“With cases detected in poultry and wild birds up to September, the current epidemic is clearly still ongoing. As autumn migration begins and the number of wild birds wintering in Europe increases, they are likely at higher risk of HPAI infection than previous years due to the observed persistence of the virus in Europe”, said Guilhem de Seze, Head of the Risk Assessment Production Department at EFSA.EFSA recommends the rapid implementation of suitable and sustainable HPAI mitigation strategies, including appropriate biosecurity measures and surveillance strategies for early detection. Medium to long-term prevention strategies should be considered in densely populated areas and in poultry production systems highly susceptible to avian influenza exposure Concentration or amount of a particular substance that is taken in by an individual, population or ecosystem in a specific frequency over a certain amount of time.Unprecedented geographical reachThe ongoing HPAI season has produced the largest epidemic seen so far in Europe, with a total of 2,467 outbreaks in poultry and 47.7 million birds culled in affected establishments. In addition, 187 detections were notified in captive birds and 3,573 HPAI events were recorded in wild birds. The geographical reach of this year’s epidemic is unprecedented, with reported cases ranging from the Svalbard islands in Norway to southern Portugal, and as far east as Ukraine, affecting 37 European countries in total.In autumn 2021, the HPAI A(H5N1) virus also crossed the Atlantic Ocean for the first time, spreading from Europe to North America along migration routes and causing a severe epidemic in poultry in several Canadian provinces and US States as well as causing mortality in wild birds.Low risk for peopleThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), having also contributed to the report, concludes that the risk of infection for the general human population Community of humans, animals or plants from the same species in the EU/EEA is low, and low to medium for occupationally exposed people, with high uncertainty Scientific concept used in risk assessment to describe all types of limitations in available knowledge at the time an assessment is conducted, with the agreed resources, that affect the probability of possible outcomes to the assessment due to the high diversity of circulating avian influenza viruses in bird populations. The risk of transmission to humans by exposure to contaminated poultry products is considered negligible.In addition, ECDC has published a technical report on ‘Testing and detection of zoonotic influenza virus infections in humans in the EU/EEA’, to which EFSA, the EU reference laboratory and the European Agency for Safety and Health at work have also contributed. This news story has been updated to correct the figure about the number of birds culled in affected establishments. The correct figure is 47.7 million birds not 47.5 million birds as stated previously.Links to scienceAvian influenza overview June – September 2022How to contact usEFSA Media Relations OfficeTel. +39 0521 036 149E-mail: press [at] efsa.europa.eu (Press[at]efsa[dot]europa[dot]eu)(Only if you are a member of the press)Ask a Question ServiceYou have a question about EFSA’s work?

Identifying the factors that affect influenza vaccination uptake can help improve the prognosis in patients with CVD. This study aimed to evaluate the secular trends of influenza vaccination uptake and factors associated with lack of vaccination in individuals with CVD. Materials and methods: We analyzed the annual trends and factors associated with influenza vaccination among 3,264 patients with CVD, included from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey which reflect the health and nutritional status of the nationwide population of Korea conducted between 2007/2008 and 2018/2019. We used a stratified, multistage sampling method. Results: The influenza vaccination rate was greater in patients with CVD (53–74%) than in those without CVD (28–40%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age <50 years [odds ratio (OR), 16.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.72–34.07], 50–64 years (OR, 6.71; 95% CI, 4.37–10.28), male sex (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.14–1.65), and asthma (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22–0.92) were independently associated with a lack of influenza vaccination. Among patients aged <65 years, smoking (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.31–4.04), college graduation status (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.16–2.82), and hypertension (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.95) were independently associated with influenza vaccination. For individuals aged 65years, there was no significant determinant of lack of vaccination. Conclusion: In patients with CVD, a continuous increase in the secular trend of influenza vaccination was demonstrated in Korea. Young age, male sex, and non-asthma status were independently associated with lack of influenza vaccination uptake. Highlights What is new? - This cross-sectional survey explored the long-term secular trend and the factors influencing influenza vaccination uptake in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). - We found the greater influenza vaccination rate in patients with CVD than their counterpart and these results were consistent in stratified analyses by age (<65 and 65 years) and sex (female and male). - Age ≥65 years and asthma were positively associated, male sex was inversely associated with the influenza vaccination in patients with CVD. What are the clinical implications? - Our findings highlight that a national immunization program (NIP) for high-risk population can attribute to higher influenza vaccination rate and attenuate the health, behavioral, and sociodemographic disparities. Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally (1). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 17.9 million people died from CVD in 2019, accounting for 32% of the global deaths (2). Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza are known to increase the risk of development of CVD (3). It is also known that underlying CVD is associated with an increased risk of complications from influenza, including increased morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization (4, 5). Therefore, it is important to prevent influenza in patients with CVD. In individuals with CVD, influenza vaccination significantly reduced all-cause mortality, recurrence of CVD, cardiovascular death, and hospitalizations for heart failure (6). Therefore, influenza vaccines are considered essential in CVD management and prevention. Considering that influenza is vaccine-preventable, international guidelines recommend that high-risk populations with CVD receive an influenza vaccine every year (7, 8), and the incorporation of vaccination into routine patient care for CVD prevention requires a paradigm change in clinical practice. However, despite the importance of influenza vaccination in patients with CVD, few studies have investigated the coverage of influenza vaccination and the factors that affect vaccination in such patients (9). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the secular trend of influenza vaccine uptake and factors associated with the lack of vaccination in individuals with CVD, using a recent nationwide observational study. Materials and methods Study population The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population-based nationwide survey conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KCDC) to assess the health and nutritional status of the non-institutionalized population of Korea. We used data from NHANES IV (2007–2009), V (2010–2012), VI (2014–2015), VII (2016–2018), and VIII (2019). Data from NHANES V (2013) were excluded because vaccination data were not available. The study population was investigated using a stratified, multistage sampling method. Between 2007 and 2019, there were 1,05,732 participants, of which 22,684 aged <18 years, 10,008 with missing weighted variables (n = 10,008), and 16,460 with missing survey data on influenza vaccination coverage were excluded; thus, 69,673 subjects were included. Among them, 3,264 (9.7%) had CVD and were classified into vaccinated (n = 2,277) and unvaccinated (n = 987) groups (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Chungbuk National University Hospital (application no. 2022-05-002). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Flow chart of the study population. CVD, cardiovascular disease; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. *Data from NHANES V (2013) were excluded because vaccination data were not available. Exposure: Cardiovascular disease The main exposure in this study was CVD, which was defined as a self-reported physician’s diagnosis of any of the following: stroke, myocardial infarction, or angina (9). Outcomes: Influenza vaccination The main outcomes of our study were the trend of influenza vaccination and the factors associated with influenza vaccination in patients with CVD. Influenza vaccination was investigated using the following question: “Have you ever been vaccinated against influenza in the past year?” Confounding variables Data on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, alcohol consumption, marital status, income, area of residence, education, and cardiac symptoms were obtained from the NHANES database. Comorbidities of stroke, asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease were self-reported based on previous physician diagnoses (10–13). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was defined based on pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7 (14). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined as the presence of any of the following: (1) history of diagnosis of DM by a physician, (2) fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dl, (3) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% (15), or (4) intake of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin (16). Hypertension was defined as follows: a self-reported physician diagnosis, the use of antihypertensive medication, systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg (13, 17). Dyslipidemia was defined through a self-reported physician diagnosis, the use of lipid-lowering medication, a total cholesterol level ≥ 240 mg/dl, or a fasting triglyceride level ≥ 200 mg/dl (10, 13). Marital status was classified into three groups (unmarried, married, widowed/separated/divorced) and household income level was classified into four groups by quartile division (9). Drinking behavior was divided into two groups (non-heavy drinker, heavy drinker) by using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (≥12 scores: heavy, <12 scores: non-heavy) (18). Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using survey commands in STATA (version 15.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) to account for complex sampling design and survey weights. All data are presented as weighted percentages with standard errors (SE). The data were compared using Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Pearson’s χ2 test for categorical variables. Multivariate analyses were performed by adjusting for significant variables in the univariate logistic regression analyses. All tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Baseline characteristics In this study, 3,264 (3.1%) of 1,05,732 individuals had CVD, of which 1,871 had coronary artery disease (CAD) (1.8%) and 1,393 (1.3%) had ischemic stroke (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with CVD are summarized in Table 1. Nearly one-third of patients with CVD were not vaccinated against influenza. A lack of influenza vaccine uptake was significantly higher among younger individuals, males (65.4 vs. 50.5%, p < 0.001), those who smoke (28.3 vs. 13.1%, p < 0.001) and drink heavily (15.7 vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001), households with high income (23.2 vs. 12.3%, p < 0.001), those who live in urban areas (79.3 vs. 75.5%, p = 0.024), unmarried status (5.2 vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001), and college graduates (20.4 vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001). In contrast, the influenza vaccine uptake rate was higher in individuals with comorbidities, including asthma (6.2 vs. 4.1%, p = 0.045), DM (35.2 vs. 28.9%, p = 0.005), hypertension (71.1 vs. 57.8%, p < 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (18.1 vs. 10.1%, p < 0.001) than in individuals without comorbidities. TABLE 1 Table 1. Baseline characteristics of the study population. Secular trends of influenza vaccination uptake The vaccine uptake rate in individuals with CVD was significantly higher than that in individuals without CVD (p < 0.01). Regardless of the presence of CVD, influenza vaccination coverage displayed an upward trend from 2007/2008 to 2018/2019 (Figure 2). The influenza vaccination uptake rate in individuals with CVD increased from 53% in 2007/2008 to 74% in 2018/2019. However, in individuals without CVD, the influenza vaccination coverage rate was 40% in 2019. Similar trends were observed in stratified analyses by age group and sex (Figure 3). Within the CVD category (i.e., among individuals with or without CVD), individuals aged ≥65 years had a higher vaccination rate than individuals aged <65 years, and females had a higher vaccine uptake rate than males. The influenza vaccine uptake rate of individuals with CVD during the 2018/2019 season reached 91.4% for individuals aged ≥65 years but was less than 47.3% for individuals aged <65 years.

Influenza vaccination trends over 9 years according to the cardiovascular disease history. (A) Age (<65 and ≥65 years). (B) Sex (male and female). CVD, cardiovascular disease. Predictor of the lack of influenza vaccination uptake Multivariable logistic analysis (Table 2) showed that the clinically independent factor with the highest odds of lack of influenza vaccination was age <50 years [odds ratio (OR), 16.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.72–34.07], followed by age of 50–64 years (OR, 6.71; 95% CI, 4.37–10.28), and male sex (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.14–1.65). In contrast, asthma was independently and positively associated with influenza vaccination (for the lack of vaccination OR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22–0.92). TABLE 2 Table 2. Factors associated with influenza unvaccinated status in patients with cardiovascular disease. Tables 3, 4 show multivariate logistic analyses after stratification for age (<65 and ≥65 years). Individuals <65 years, current smokers (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.31–4.04), and college graduates (OR, 1.81, 95% CI, 1.16–2.82) were significant independent predictors for the lack of influenza vaccination uptake, but hypertension was positively associated with influenza vaccination (OR, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.51–0.95). For individuals aged ≥65 years, there was no significant determinant of lack of vaccination uptake. TABLE 3 Table 3.

Factors associated with influenza unvaccinated status in patients aged ≥65 years with cardiovascular disease. Discussion We examined the secular trend and determinants of influenza vaccine uptake in individuals in South Korea. Overall, the vaccination uptake rate in individuals with CVD increased by 21% during 12 seasons (2007/2008 to 2018/2019), reaching 74% in the 2018/2019 season. Although the influenza vaccine uptake rate in individuals with CVD was suboptimal considering the goal of 90% in high-risk conditions, proposed by the Healthy People 2020 initiative of the United States (US) (19), it almost meets the vaccine uptake goal of 75% proposed by the European Union (EU) Council (20). Moreover, this proportion in South Korea was higher than that of chronically ill individuals in the EU (ranging from about 20% in Norway to 60% in Northern Ireland) (20) and the US (67%) (21). However, in this study, the vaccination rate in patients aged <65 years was only 47%. The influenza under-vaccination trend in younger individuals has been well-elucidated in many studies (22–24), with older individuals being more likely to visit clinics, have chronically ill status, and frequently recommended for vaccination uptake by health care providers (25). However, the relative odds of those aged 18–49 years (OR, 16.22) and 50–64 years (OR, 6.71) for lacking vaccine uptake was three to seven times higher than that of individuals with CVD aged 40–64 years in the US (OR, 2.32; 95% CI 2.06–2.62) (26). The prominently higher influenza vaccination uptake in CVD patients aged ≥65 years in South Korea can be attributed to a substantial national immunization program (NIP) for those aged ≥65 years, which was continuously developed for two decades (27), and not merely by the effect of age as a sociodemographic factor. As influenza vaccination was provided free of charge to all individuals aged ≥65 years in 2005, the influenza vaccination rate among individuals aged ≥65 years gradually increased from 40% in 2005 to 60% in 2009. However, during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, the government of South Korea had difficulty in meeting the sudden increase in vaccine demand and thereafter ramped up the domestic production system to meet 70% of the vaccine requirement. This production and supply innovation in influenza vaccination has resulted in a second increase in the influenza vaccine uptake rate by improving access to vaccination. Recently, the expansion of the influenza NIP to primary care clinics has enhanced the influenza vaccination rates to 82.4% in individuals aged ≥65 years, in the 2016–2017 season. Moreover, as indicated by the multivariable analysis in this study, the series of NIP administered to all individuals aged ≥65 years can reduce the effect of disparity in health, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors on influenza vaccination uptake. A 25% reduction in all-cause mortality of CAD patients by influenza vaccination was comparable to the effect of beta-blockage and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality reduction of 20–25% (28). In a subgroup analysis of a recent intervention trial, influenza vaccination in patients with acute myocardial infarction was beneficial in preventing potential serious complications including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis regardless of age (29). Therefore expanding the free coverage of vaccination to CVD individuals aged <65 years may be a robust measure to attenuate the complication of influenza infection in individuals with CVD. However, studies on the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination have been limited to children, pregnant women, and the elderly (30), and have not focused on individuals with CVD aged <65 years (31). Recently, a remarkable study comparing the effect of influenza vaccination to placebo administered shortly after acute coronary syndrome demonstrated the considerable risk reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death without increased adverse effect of influenza vaccination (29). In this regard, as same manner of prescribing antiplatelets or statins, it can be considered to add the clinical routine practice of checking whether CVD patients were vaccinated against influenza before discharge and recommending vaccination uptake during hospitalization. Moreover, the guideline revision to place the priority of influenza on an equal position with pharmacotherapy including antiplatelets and statins for secondary prevention in CVD patients and policy interventions to support influenza vaccination before discharge can contribute to improving influenza vaccination uptake rate and cardiovascular mortality. However, given the meta-analysis that statins mitigate short-term (30 days) and mid-term mortality (90 days) in patients infected with influenza by their pleotropic effect mediating anti-inflammation and immunomodulation (32), it should not be underestimated that other pharmacotherapy including statins are also important in ameliorating the health effects of influenza in CVD patients. As the influenza vaccination uptake rate was greatly influenced by age group, we analyzed the determinants of the lack of influenza vaccination according to the subgroup stratified by the cutoff value of 65 years. This study showed that individuals with CVD aged <65 years with current smoking habits were likely to lack influenza vaccination, which is in line with the results of previous studies based on the Korea NHANES database (33–35) and studies conducted in the US (36), United Kingdom (37), and Italy (38). This can be explained by positive health-seeking behaviors and motivation in individuals with smoking cessation or negative health-seeking behaviors in current smokers (39). Smoking-induced disruption of respiratory epithelial cell lining increases susceptibility to influenza (40), which leads to a higher risk of hospital or intensive care unit admission after influenza infection (41). The effect of smoking on CVD recurrence can be exacerbated by inflammatory release of cytokines, thrombogenic status, hypoxia, and tachycardia after influenza infection (42). Therefore, a government campaign or healthcare provider’s direct recommendation to motivate the influenza vaccine uptake tailored for current smokers is needed to prevent the harmful interaction of influenza, smoking, and CVD. In this study, the educational status of college graduates was another determinant of the lack of influenza vaccination in CVD individuals aged <65 years. Moreover, a paradoxical statistical trend was observed between low household income and higher vaccination rates. These findings can be attributed to the financial reimbursement for influenza vaccination provided by local municipalities to the lower quartile income bracket of individuals aged 50–64 years (43). On the contrary, the decreased opportunity for influenza vaccination associated with lower educational level was identified in Austria and Poland where there is no public reimbursement for influenza vaccination (23). A recent study in the US similarly showed that lower education levels and lower household incomes were related to a lack of vaccination (26). These observations suggest that socioeconomic factors, including education and income level, are modifiable variables that depend on the degree of public reimbursement, and are not an independent determinant for lack of influenza uptake in individuals with CVD. The lower rates of influenza vaccination in men as seen in this study has been observed in previous studies conducted in Korea (33, 44, 45). Although the reasons for this phenomenon are being speculated, a probable cause could be unhealthy lifestyle in men. It is also possible that women comply more than men with clinicians’ recommendations for influenza vaccination. Supporting this hypothesis, a previous study in Korea showed that medication adherence was higher in women than in men (46). Among the comorbidities, asthma had a significant influence on vaccination in individuals with CVD. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination in patients with asthma. Vaccination against influenza prevented nearly half of influenza infections and about 60–80% of asthma attacks (47, 48). Therefore, the current guidelines recommend that subjects with asthma should be vaccinated against the influenza virus every year (49–51). As a result, a study using national data from Korea reported that the influenza vaccination rate of subjects with asthma was significantly higher than that of the general population. The vaccination rate increases with age; in particular, 81.5% of asthmatic patients aged >65 years receive the influenza vaccine (52, 53). This study had several limitations. First, several variables were not included in the NHANES database, such as the perception of benefits and adverse effects of influenza vaccine, access level to vaccine, provider recommendation, and exposure to media, and were therefore not evaluated. Second, the study based on the NHANES database can imply the possibility of recall bias, as there was a gap between the survey period conducted year-round and the vaccination period from September to December. Third, the causal relationship between the lack of vaccination and variables could not be determined due to the cross-sectional design of this study. Forth, we acknowledge that this study did not demonstrate whether policy implemented by Korean government directly improved mortality in patients with CVD. However, this study has strength in that it showed a secular trend of influenza vaccination during long term follow-up, and it analyzed more detailed individual-level factors in patients with CVD based on a nationwide survey statistically reflecting the entire population of South Korea compared to previous similar study (9). Moreover, this study demonstrated an example that comprehensive and long-term measures implemented by national interventions could increase the coverage of influenza vaccination uptake. Conclusion In conclusion, this study showed a continually improving secular trend in influenza vaccine uptake among individuals with CVD in South Korea. This can be attributed to the organized national influenza vaccination program, which underscores public support for influenza vaccination and reduces socioeconomic disparity at the individual level among high-risk individuals vulnerable to influenza infection. However, it is still necessary to develop measures for improving influenza vaccine uptake in individuals with CVD aged <65 years.

Expert tips on how to spot symptoms of canine influenzaAnna Kaufman USA TODAYFlu season for humans can be a doozy. Doctors advise vaccination, with shots available at many local pharmacies and drug stores. But, what about your pup? Turns out dogs have their own flu season. And it's year-round!Canine Influenza is highly contagious and can be spread not only through the air but across surfaces like leashes and collars. In conversation with veterinarian Lisa Lippman, Director of Virtual Medicine at New York City's Bond Vet, we cover everything you need to know about "dog flu" from treatment to early signs. What is "dog flu"? Canine influenza is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause your dog to get sick, materials from Bond Vet explain. Lippman describes it as very similar to the human flu, only without any real seasonality to it. It can happen at any time. "It's really important to know where it's endemic," Lippman explains, urging pet owners to consult their veterinarian in order to find out the risk in their local area. Dogs who are in the agility or show circuit, and are therefore more likely to interact with lots of other dogs are also at a higher risk, she explains. Just like humans with COVID, the more potentially infected individuals you are around the higher your likelihood is to get sick. What are the symptoms of dog flu?CoughRunny noseFeverLethargyEye dischargeReduced appetiteCoughing and sneezing are some of the main symptoms of canine influenza, and also one of the main forms of transmission. In some cases your pup will run a fever. A trip to the vet can help confirm a case as they will take your dog's temperature and possibly run chest x-rays and a PCR test. "It's always nice to know what we're dealing with," Lippman explains. Is there a vaccine for the canine flu?Yes. There is a vaccine, Lippman reports, but it's not 100% effective. It can, however, help prevent your pet from contracting "dog flu" and potentially limit the severity of their illness. How long does canine influenza last?Materials from Bond Vet estimate that most dogs who get sick will usually recover within two to three weeks with the help of supportive care and antimicrobial treatments prescribed by your vet. Can canine flu spread to humans?No, there is no evidence of that. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that, to date, no evidence exists of the spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to humans. There has not been a single reported case of human infection from canine influenza worldwide. Among dogs, however, the virus is highly infections, spreading mostly through aerosols Lippman reports, as dogs cough, bark, or sneeze near one another. On some occasions, canine influenza can also be spread through fomites. These are inanimate objects like leashes or collars that the virus can live on if there isn't sufficient disinfection. How do you treat dog flu?"For any viral infection, we usually prescribe supportive care unless there's evidence of a secondary bacterial infection," Lippman explains, adding that she doesn't like to jump to antibiotics immediately if there's no need. If your dog is energetic, eating well and otherwise themselves, then it isn't usually an emergency. You can treat their influenza by putting them in a bathroom and turning on the shower really hot to let the steam run over them for a few minutes at a time. Do this two to three times a day.Though Lippman assures it is never wrong to go to the vet, canine influenza is so highly contagious that it is good to be cognizant of other pets and perhaps make a telehealth appointment instead.

Back to Healio Following last year’s mild influenza season, U.S. officials are emphasizing the importance of influenza, pneumococcal and COVID-19 vaccinations as they expect a much more severe season in the weeks to come. “Flu is not just a bad cold. In fact, the words ‘just’ and ‘flu’ should never be in the same sentence,” National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) President Patricia (Patsy) A. Stinchfield, RN, MS, CPNP, said during the organization’s annual influenza and pneumococcal news conference. “Flu can cause mild to severe symptoms and life-threatening complications including hospitalization and death in children and adults and those with or without chronic conditions. The key message that you will hear today is the most important thing that each of you can do is to get your annual influenza vaccine get that flu vaccine.” Data courtesy of NFID. CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH, who attended the news conference virtually, reflected on the last two influenza seasons, which she said had different timing and severity compared with typical influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. “Last year’s flu season was relatively mild; however, there was more activity during the 2021-2022 flu season than during the prior season,” she said. “Influenza activity last season began to increase in November and remained elevated until mid-June, making it the latest season on record.” According to Walensky, during the last influenza season, 51% of the U.S. population aged 6 months and older received a vaccine, which is similar coverage to what has been observed in previous seasons and prior to the pandemic. However, she added, there was a drop in coverage among certain groups including pregnant women and children who are at higher risk of serious complications. Additionally, vaccine coverage for children aged 6 months to 17 years was 58%, a nearly 6 percentage point decrease from the 2019-2020 flu season and the lowest vaccination coverage observed in children in the last eight seasons. Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH “As we look toward the 2022-2023 flu season, even though we do not know what will happen exactly, we do expect for flu viruses to spread this fall in winter and we know that flu vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against flu and its potentially serious complications,” Walensky said. According to results from a survey by the NFID, only 49% of U.S. adults plan to get an influenza vaccine during the 2022-2023 season. People who said they did not plan on getting vaccinated cited not thinking influenza vaccines work very well (41%), concerns over side effects (39%), never getting influenza (28%) and concerns over getting influenza from the vaccine (24%) as their top reasons. In addition to influenza data, the NFID survey also explored attitudes towards COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease. Survey data showed that only 32% of U.S. adults are extremely/very confident about the safety of receiving influenza and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time. Walensky said that influenza and COVID-19 vaccines can absolutely be given at the same time if the person is eligible — which she said most people are — and if the timing coincides. She added that people who got their vaccines at the same time were only slightly more likely to experience mild side effects in the day following vaccination including soreness at the injection site, headache and fatigue. “COVID-19 has interfered with many of our routines including our routine immunizations,” she said. “However, we know that staying up to date on all recommended routine vaccinations remains critically important.” Panelists at the conference added that influenza season is also a great time to make sure you are up to date on pneumococcal vaccination, as pneumococcal disease can be a serious complication of influenza. The experts said this is important to note as only 29% of adults aged 65 years and older said that they have been advised to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. They agreed that these data underline the importance of health care professionals talking to their patients about the safety of coadministration. Additional data from the survey regarding influenza mitigation showed that the majority (69%) of adults understand that annual vaccination is the best preventive measure against influenza-related hospitalization and deaths. Also, similarly to what was shown in NFID’s survey last year, most U.S. adults (58%) report that they will wear a mask at least sometimes during the influenza season: 40% if influenza and/or COVID-19 activity is high in their community, 35% in crowds and large groups of people, and 22% indoors. William Schaffner, MD These measures could help mitigate what Infectious Disease News Editorial Board Member William Schaffner, MD, says could be in store based on what has been observed so far in parts of the Southern hemisphere. According to Schaffner, influenza season in the Southern hemisphere is already well under way and has been proven to be severe. He said that Australia, for example, has had its worst influenza season in 5 years. “People have asked me how severe it will be. Don't think about that. Just focus on the fact that flu will be with us,” Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the NFID, said at the news conference. “So, perhaps a moderately severe influenza season is on the way, we'll have to see, but prepare for the worst, while we hope for the best.” Walensky said that while she cannot be sure what this influenza season will hold, she and other experts agree that the best way to protect yourself and those around you from influenza is to get your annual flu vaccine. “I am here to strongly urge everyone who has not already been vaccinated to find the time and go get vaccinated,” she said.

Learn More Transcript Transcript Unger: Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast, an ongoing series covering a range of health care topics that affect the lives of physicians and patients. Today's topic: flu vaccination, including new recommendations for those that are over 65.I'm joined today by Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, the AMA's in-house vaccine subject matter expert. Dr. Fryhofer is also the AMA's liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and serves on the ACIP's influenza vaccine workgroup. She's also chair of the AMA Board of Trustees.I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer in Chicago. Dr. Fryhofer, thanks for joining us today.Dr. Fryhofer: Todd, thanks for having me.Unger: So let's talk about the news for flu vaccination. Tell us what's new. Why don't we start with recommendations for those that are 65 and older.Dr. Fryhofer: Well, everyone six months and older needs flu vaccination every year. That hasn't changed. But recommendations for those 65 and older have.Three vaccines are now preferred for these older adults. Two of them are higher-dose flu shots. The third one is an adjuvanted flu vaccine. Of the two higher-dose options, the highest-dose flu vaccine currently available, is abbreviated HD for high dose vaccine and is sold under the brand name Fluzone High-Dose. It's four times stronger than regular standard dose flu shots.The recombinant influenza vaccine, abbreviated RIV and sold as Flublok is also higher dose. It's three times stronger than regular flu shots. The adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine, abbreviated aIIV, sold as Fluad, is the same strength as regular, standard dose flu shots. But it adds an adjuvant called MF59 to boost its immune response.This preferential recommendation is for those 65 and older. For everyone else, any age- and health condition-appropriate vaccine is fine. The high dose shot and the adjuvanted shots are limited to those 65 and older. The recombinant vaccine Flublok can be given to adults 18 and older. And for older adults, a regular flu shot is fine if a higher dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine is not available. It's better to get any flu shot than no flu shot at all.Unger: Dr. Fryhofer, what about timing? I hear a lot of questions about that. When is the best time to get a flu shot? How long does it take for the flu shot to work?Dr. Fryhofer: It takes about two weeks after vaccination to build up those protective antibodies. And for most people, the ideal time to get your flu vaccine is September, October. Vaccination should continue as long as flu is circulating and vaccine is available.But understand that vaccine-induced immunity wanes with time. So getting vaccinated in July and August is a little early. Getting your flu shot too early could mean protection may not last the entire flu season. But understand each flu season is different. And the timing of when flu season begins, peaks and declines cannot be precisely predicted. And we don't want to miss opportunities to vaccinate.As a reminder, both COVID and flu are now circulating. And it's fine to get a flu shot and any COVID vaccine dose at the same time. In fact, CDC is encouraging it. It's also fine to give both flu vaccines and COVID vaccines, including these new bivalent boosters, with other needed vaccines, with one exception, and that's monkeypox. You should not give monkeypox vaccine and COVID vaccine at the same time due to myocarditis risk concerns.Unger: What about pregnancy? What's the best time during pregnancy to get vaccinated? And is there a certain kind of vaccination that's best?Dr. Fryhofer: All pregnant women should receive a flu shot. During pregnancy, changes in the immune system, heart and lungs make pregnant women more prone to severe illness from flu. And flu vaccination has been shown to cut risk of flu-related respiratory infections in pregnant women in half. Also, flu shots can reduce a pregnant woman's risk of being hospitalized with flu by an average of 40%.Any age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine may be given to pregnant women. However, LAIV, the Live Attenuated Vaccine, aka the nasal flu vaccine, should not be used during pregnancy because it is made from live virus. But it's fine to give LAIV postpartum.As for timing, getting your flu shot during pregnancy is best. That way, mom's antibodies can be passed on to baby and provide protection to the infant during the first months of life, when the baby is too young to be vaccinated. The same goes for Tdap. Pregnant women are also supposed to get a Tdap during pregnancy to protect mom and baby from pertussis, aka whooping cough. And the best time for getting Tdap is also between 27 and 36 weeks and for the same reason, to maximize mom's antibody response as well as passing antibodies to the baby.And pregnant women also need protection from COVID and should get COVID vaccination. Both CDC and ACOG, the American College of Obsetrics and Gynecology, recommend that pregnant women receive flu and Tdap vaccination as well as any needed COVID vaccine doses.Unger: Let's go back just to the beginning because that was a lot of news on this 65 and older side. What is the evidence behind making a change like this for older adults? Any concerns about side effects? Is there any difference here?Dr. Fryhofer: Older adults are at increased risk for severe influenza-associated illness, hospitalization and death. And flu vaccines are often less effective in older adults. Our flu work group's comprehensive evidence review revealed higher dose vaccines and adjuvanted vaccines were more effective than standard dose vaccines in protecting these older patients. And that's the basis for this new preferential recommendation. And this is why ACIP now prefers a higher-dose or an adjuvanted influenza vaccine over a standard dose vaccine for those 65 and older.So again, the standard dose inactivated vaccine contains 15 micrograms of antigen per virus strain covered. The recombinant vaccine contains 45 micrograms per virus strain. So that's triple the antigen dose. And the high dose vaccine quadruples the dose to 60 micrograms per virus strain. The adjuvanted vaccine contains the same amount of antigen per virus strain as standard, which is 15 micrograms. But it also contains that adjuvant MF59, which boosts immune response.And Todd, you asked about side effects. There were more injection site and systemic reactions with the high dose and adjuvanted vaccines as compared to the standard dose vaccine. However, injection site reactions after the recombinant vaccine were about the same or less as compared to standard dose inactivated vaccine.Unger: Now, Dr. Fryhofer, you mentioned every year is different. What do this year's flu shots contain? And how do they differ from prior year? So the vaccines cover multiple strains, obviously, based on learning from other parts of the world?Dr. Fryhofer: Well, all flu vaccines available this year are quadrivalent, meaning they cover four flu strains—two flu As and two flu Bs. And the exact formula for flu vaccine is reevaluated each year and often changes depending on which strains are predicted to be circulating. And the current vaccine composition has been updated to better protect against flu viruses expected to circulate this season.Influenza A viruses are divided into two subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus. H is for hemagglutinin and N is for neuraminidase. And the flu A subtypes that routinely circulate in people include H1N1 and H3N2. So you'll hear some of these terms as flu is discussed throughout the season.Influenza B viruses don't have subtypes. They're classified into lineage, B Yamagata and B Victoria. Both A and B viruses can be further divided into clades and subclades, also called groups and subgroups. Influenza A viruses are the only flu viruses known to cause flu pandemics, which are global epidemics. Influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in terms of their genetic and antigenic properties.And today's quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine covers one influenza A H1N1 virus, one influenza A H3N2 virus, as well as one influenza B Victoria-lineage virus and one influenza B Yamagata-lineage virus. Flu vaccines can protect against these flu viruses as well as other flu viruses that are antigenically similar. But understand, flu is not the only virus that circulates during flu season. There are many other viruses that can result in influenza-like illnesses.Unger: Gosh, I think we could do a whole other segment just on that one question. That's a lot of great information there. What about people who've got a history of egg allergy? Can they get a flu vaccination?Dr. Fryhofer: Well, most available flu vaccines are grown in eggs, and thus might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, with two exceptions. There are two flu vaccines which are not grown in eggs and are totally egg free—RIV, the recombinant vaccine, brand name Flublok, licensed for those 18 and older; and cell-cultured inactivated influenza vaccine, abbreviated CCIIV, brand name Flucelvax. And it's licensed for those as young as six months and older. Again, these two vaccines are totally egg free.Here are the recommendations for those with egg allergy. People with a history of hives-only egg allergy symptoms can receive any age- and health status-appropriate influenza vaccine. The same applies to those with more severe egg allergy reactions. Remember that the amount of egg protein in flu vaccines—even those grown in eggs—is very, very small.Anyone with egg allergy reaction more severe than just hives—and this would include angioedema, swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness or recurrent vomiting, as well as anyone who might have needed epinephrine or some other emergency medical intervention—can also receive any licensed, recommended influenza age-appropriate and health status-appropriate vaccine, with one caveat.If the vaccine is not one of the totally egg-free shots—which, remember, are the cell culture CCIIV, the Flucelvax, or the recombinant RIV vaccine Flublok—it must be administered in a medical setting, under the supervision of a health care provider who's able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.And a reminder that all vaccination providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and should be certified in CPR. But no prolonged post-vaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic patients. However, ACIP does recommend observing patients for 15 minutes after administering any vaccine.Unger: What about for folks out there that don't like needles? And there are a lot of those people out there. What should they do in regard to flu vaccination?

Subscribe Now Dr. Fryhofer: Well, there's only one nasal flu vaccine available, the LAIV, the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, brand name Flumist. Live attenuated means it contains live but weakened virus. And that weakened virus is grown in eggs.Its age approval range is age 2 through 49. But it's not for everyone. There are many medical conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and precautions.For example, it's not recommended during pregnancy. It's not recommended for young children aged two, three, four with asthma or wheezing. It's not recommended for anyone of any age with an immunocompromising condition, including those on immunocompromising medications. It's also not recommended for close contacts and caregivers of those who are severely immunosuppressed. It's not recommended for anyone with cochlear implants or for anyone with an active communication between cerebrospinal fluid and the oropharynx, nasopharynx, nose or ear, or any other cranial CSF leak.And since the vaccine virus is live, recent use of flu antivirals can make the vaccine ineffective. So timing of taking any flu antivirals can also be a contraindication. Also, underlying medical conditions, including chronic heart, lung, kidney, liver, neurologic, as well as blood disorders and metabolic disorders, including diabetes, are also considered precautions for this live attenuated flu vaccine.ACIP's comprehensive flu update document has all these listed for these patients. It's better and safer to get the shot. But you can also ask for a smiley-face Band-Aid. And the shot's not that bad. It only lasts a second.Unger: It is very, very fast. This has been really informative. I can't imagine there is a more comprehensive preview of this flu shot and season. Dr. Fryhofer, any final thoughts before we close?Dr. Fryhofer: Everyone six months and older needs flu vaccination every year. We've been fortunate the last two flu seasons have been mild. But we have no way of knowing what to expect for this season. We've managed so far to avoid a twindemic of both COVID and flu. But news reports from the southern hemisphere say Australia is experiencing its worst flu season in five years, which may serve as a warning for us here in the United States.Your best way to protect yourself and those around you is to get vaccinated. Now's the time. Get your flu shot. And also stay up-to-date on recommended COVID vaccinations. Please get vaccinated.Unger: Absolutely. That wraps up today's episode. Dr. Fryhofer, thanks again for being here and sharing all of this important information about flu vaccination. We'll be back soon with another AMA Update.

Its purpose being to support pandemic preparedness for influenza and other infectious disease threats, this is the first award from BARDA – part of the US Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) – for pre-exposure prophylaxis for influenza. VIR-2482 is an investigational intramuscularly administered influenza A-neutralising mAb. It has been shown in vitro to cover all major influenza A strains that have arisen since the 1918 ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic and is designed as a universal prophylactic for influenza A. Furthermore, VIR-2482 could have the potential to overcome the limitations of current flu vaccines and result in higher levels of protection, given it does not rely on an individual to create their own protective antibody response. Additionally, the incorporated Xencor Xtend Technology is half-life engineered, meaning a single dose could potentially last an entire flu season. Seasonal influenza (or flu) is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can cause severe illness and life-threatening complications. In just the past few years, seasonal influenza has resulted in around 4 million hospitalisations and circa 500,000 global annual deaths. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is a contagious airborne respiratory disease with unpredictable timing and severity and against which humans have little or no immunity. Four such pandemic influenzas have occurred in only the past century, with the 1918 ‘Spanish flu’ alone having resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide. Given the past two years’ and ongoing experience with SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, the BARDA multi-year contract - potentially an investment of up to $1 billion in total - aims to continue the Authority’s efforts in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. Currently, there is a significant unmet need to address shortcomings in preventative and therapeutic options for influenza, the efficacy of the present options that do exist ranging from only 10% to 60%. Therefore, this initial $55 million investment aims to address these shortcomings. It includes for a phase 2 pre-exposure prophylaxis trial, to begin this second half of the year, with initial data expected by mid-2023. The balance of the award is subject to up to 12 options being exercised by BARDA in further support of the development of pre-exposure prophylactic antibodies, including and beyond VIR-2482. This extended area, beyond prevention of influenza illness, will potentially be for supportive medical countermeasures for up to 10 “other pathogens of pandemic potential”, whether they be “chemical, biological, radiological [or] nuclear”. Dr Rajesh Gupta, vice president, global health portfolio and public-private partnerships at Vir Biotechnology, said: “COVID-19 reinforced the ever-present global threat of infectious diseases, and the critical need for readily available solutions in advance of the next pandemic.” A commercial-stage immunology company, Vir Biotechnology’s current development pipeline includes product candidates targeting hepatitis B and hepatitis D viruses and human immunodeficiency virus, in addition to influenza A and COVID-19, the latter of which Vir (together with GSK) previously delivered the antibody sotrovimab (Xevudy) for. The company also co-discovered ansuvimab-zykl for addressing the Ebola crisis. Bolyn Hubby, PhD, executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer at Vir Biotechnology, said: “Just as the COVID-19 pandemic required unprecedented cross-sector collaboration around the globe, tackling the outbreaks and pandemics of tomorrow will require an ‘all hands on deck’ approach that unites a broad array of public and private organisations.” Under a collaboration agreement signed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 2021, GSK holds an exclusive option to lead post-phase 2 development and commercialisation of VIR-2482.

Last Modified: October 04, 2022 Heart Health Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. Influenza impacts as many as 45 million Americans each year, resulting in between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So what happens when these two conditions intersect? We asked Mark O’Shaughnessy, MD, PPG – Cardiology, to share more about flu risk for patients with heart disease and the best tools for prevention. Why is contracting the flu dangerous for those with heart conditions? Several studies have shown a significant increase in cardiovascular complications with the onset of flu, such as a worsening of congestive heart failure or decompensation of arrhythmias. This could mean the patient has a loss of control of chronic atrial fibrillation (Afib) or even a myocardial infarction (heart attack). A study published in 2020 that looked at over 80,000 patients over eight years demonstrated 12% of the patients had cardiac complications with the flu. A 2018 study demonstrated a six-fold increase in heart attack within a week of a flu diagnosis. Basically, the stress of influenza can result in decompensation of stable heart disease or even an increase in the incidence of heart attack, likely an inflammatory pathophysiology. Are there certain conditions that pose a greater risk? Likely congestive heart failure patients have the highest risk for developing complications with the flu, but any patient with heart disease has an increased risk for complications. The additional stress from a respiratory infection (which is what influenza is at a fundamental level) puts additional stress on the cardiovascular system. It’s all connected. Is contracting influenza dangerous for your heart if you don’t have a preexisting heart condition? Without documented heart disease there is likely less of a chance for significant cardiac complications, however some heart disease is occult (silent) and manifests from significant stress, like the type generated by influenza. Also, patients can get a viral cardiomyopathy, which is inflammation of the heart, that causes congestive heart failure related to the viral illness (influenza). What can those with heart conditions do to protect themselves from the flu? Everyone should get a flu vaccine! This is especially important for those with preexisting heart disease as outlined above, but influenza can still be a very serious illness even in those without documented prior disease, so vaccination is important. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Thorough hand washing and mask wearing are also important measures that can be used to prevent infection. When should someone seek emergency care? Individuals should seek emergency medical attention if they have progressive symptoms such as shortness of breath, fast heart rates that are causing symptoms and, of course, with any chest pain. Patients with chest pain need to call 911 and never drive themselves to the hospital.

ByAlan YuOctober 6, 2022 The influenza virus. (Frederick Murphy/CDC) Public health officials in Delaware will start collecting data from rapid flu tests this year, in anticipation of what could be a bad flu season across the country. The U.S. often looks to Australia and the southern hemisphere to see what the flu season here could be like, and this year Australia had one of the worst flu seasons in recent years. It is hard for public health officials to get an accurate count of flu cases, because people will often stay home and treat the symptoms rather than go to a clinic or a hospital where they might get tested for the flu. The last flu season was unusual. Typically, cases die down by around March. Last year, flu activity in the U.S. increased early in the year and stayed high until June, with two distinct waves. Earlier this year, Westside Family Healthcare, which has five medical offices in Delaware, started doing rapid flu tests for patients who show up with flu symptoms, said Megan Werner, associate medical director of population health and quality. They did that so they can tell if a patient has the flu, COVID-19, or some other virus like respiratory syncytial virus. They swab a patient’s nose quickly on both sides for a few seconds, then run the sample in an analyzer that can test for flu and COVID-19 within 15 minutes. That way, medical staff can treat a patient with medicine that’s specific to flu or COVID-19 when appropriate. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Previously, health officials received flu data from patients who get lab tests for the flu because they end up in the hospital. Those lab tests take longer, but are more sensitive. This week, the Delaware Division of Public Health started a program to collect data from clinics, like Westside Family Healthcare, that do rapid flu tests on patients. This would help officials keep track of less severe flu cases that would not have been recorded in the past, said Camille Moreno, an epidemiologist at the Delaware Division of Public Health. “We’re hoping that this year we’ll have a better understanding (of) the burden of influenza in the community.” Related Content NPRHealth Flu is expected to flare up in U.S. this winter, raising fears of a ‘twindemic’ After virtually disappearing for the last two years, there are troubling clues that the flu could come roaring back this year. 2 years ago Having more timely data is important because there are two– and potentially more – respiratory viruses circulating at the same time, said Thersa Sweet, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Drexel University who specializes in flu. “We’re going to have essentially two epidemics going on at the same time— one with flu and one with COVID-19. And so it’s going to be important to be able to differentiate between the two.” She added that because of masks and social distancing measures in the past two years, people have not been exposed to flu viruses as much, so their immunity will have waned. But now, most of those measures are no longer in place. She said it would be good if more clinics collected real-time flu data to fill in the picture of what is happening overall. She’ll be watching what strains of flu show up in the U.S. cases. If the strains match the ones seen in Australia, that could be an issue because those same strains led to many cases of flu that strained their health systems. Both local and federal health officials recommend that everyone get their flu shots.

They say the woman had been vaccinated. Never miss a moment with the WHYY Listen App!

First, cleaning surfaces using soap and water and disinfectant sprays can decrease the number of germs and lower the chances of spreading them around. Second, disinfecting commonly touched surfaces can kill germs and help lower the chances of getting sick. Avoid touching used tissues or other waste when emptying your trash, and wash your hands afterward to avoid getting those germs. What are the biggest germ culprits in your home, and how should you disinfect them? Commonly touched surfaces such as countertops, doorknobs, computer keyboards, toys, phones and faucet handles are major culprits for carrying germs. Make sure the product you are using is EPA-registered to both clean (remove germs) and disinfect (kill germs). Read the directions on the product on how to use it because different chemicals have different procedures on how many wipes are needed or how long to keep the surface wet — usually three to five minutes. How can a humidifier or air filter help keep your home flu-free? Dry air can cause scratchy throats, congestion and nosebleeds. While there are no scientific guidelines about the use of humidifiers to prevent flu, the germs may be able to survive in the drier air conditions. So the thought is that, if you keep the humidity level up in a room, the virus is less likely to survive. Just be careful of warm mist humidifiers because, if not cleaned properly, they can grow bacteria and mold, which can cause serious illness. Suzanne Judd, Ph.D.How often should you wash sheets and towels during flu season? Most studies have shown that the flu virus can live on surfaces for up to 48 hours. However, it is not necessary to wash surfaces every day. Using harsh chemicals to wipe every surface that often can irritate the eyes, nose, throat and skin and aggravate asthma if you suffer from it, so you may cause more harm than good. In general, the important thing is to make sure you wash regularly and do not share towels or sheets with those who are sick without washing them first. Remember, the virus is killed by hot temperatures, so if you do clean your sheets and towels, use the hot temperature setting instead of warm. What are the best tips to protect yourself if someone in your house already has the flu? Avoid sharing glasses and silverware with the person who is sick. If you are serving food from a common dish, serve the person who is sick first and allow them to eat separately from other family members. Don’t forget, wash your own hands before you eat. If it is possible, choose a bathroom for the sick person to use and their own bedroom to sleep in. Plan to clean these rooms daily. Have some disposable facemasks at the house for other members, especially those who have other medical conditions that make them more likely to get sick.

But that is not the case for older adults.​ “Even though people over 60 are less than 20 percent of the population, they account for over 80 percent of the serious complications of influenza,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “So what you do when you get the flu turns out to be very important for this age group.” The same goes for what you don’t do. Here are eight ways to hasten your recovery from the flu. 1. Call your health care provider ASAP Not everyone who gets the flu needs to see their doctor, but people over 65 do. That’s because age itself — along with many other conditions that often come along in later years, such as diabetes and heart disease — puts you at risk for serious complications from the flu, namely pneumonia. “As we age, our immune system responds less vigorously than it does when we’re younger,” explains Stuart Ray, M.D., professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital. “Both antibodies and T cells play important roles in protecting against infection and severe disease from influenza. And those tend to decrease during late adulthood.” Your doctor will likely prescribe an antiviral medication that helps your body fight off the influenza virus. Research shows that taking an antiviral, like Tamiflu, at the first sign of the flu can reduce symptoms and shorten your bout of the flu by one day. How Well Does a Flu Shot Work? The influenza vaccine can help keep you from getting the flu in the first place. It can also lower your risk of getting sick if you do get infected by between 40 and 60 percent, according to the CDC. Don’t delay: The best time to get your flu shot, experts say, is in September or October. Don’t postpone treatment With antivirals, time is of the essence. You should take them within 48 hours after symptoms kick in. “What we adults tend to do is say, ‘I’d rather not go to the doctor. Let’s see if I feel better tomorrow,’ ” Schaffner says. “When we get what we think is influenza, it’s important to contact our health care provider, because the sooner we get the treatment, the better the success of the treatment.” Keep in mind: You don’t have to make an in-person appointment. Your doctor should be able to assess your symptoms virtually. Miss your 48-hour window? There’s still some benefit to taking an antiviral “beyond the 48 hours, but it diminishes day by day,” Schaffner says. 2. Stay home The flu is highly contagious, spreading through droplets in the air when you cough, sneeze or talk. And that’s true even before you feel fluish. According to the National Institute on Aging, people with the flu can spread it a day before and up to a week after feeling sick. Don’t leave home until your fever is gone The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends staying home until you’re fever free — without the help of fever-reducing meds — for 24 hours. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT 3. Wash your hands Disease-causing germs are easily spread by dirty hands. You know the drill: Throughout the day, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with regular soap and water — antibacterial soaps have no added benefit, according to the CDC — for at least 20 seconds. Don’t expect alcohol-based hand sanitizer to get the job done Sure, in a pinch it’s better than nothing. But research shows that soap and water are far more effective than hand sanitizers in removing certain kinds of germs. That said, if you’re nowhere near a bar of soap and running water, reach for the hand sanitizer. Just make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. 4. Drink plenty of fluids “It’s important to stay well-hydrated when you have a fever,” Ray says. “Hydration will also help alleviate general malaise.” To that end, keep a big glass of water on the nightstand — juice, broth, decaffeinated herbal tea all work, too. Don’t reach for that morning mug of coffee Same goes for any caffeinated beverage and also alcohol. All of these are dehydrating, which will slow your recovery. “Dehydration means you can’t get your secretions up,” Schaffner says. “It’s more difficult to mobilize [the secretions] out of your chest and cough them up, and that can predispose you to the development of pneumonia.” 5. Rinse and moisten your sinuses A neti pot is one way to clear out built-up mucus in your sinuses. But if you’re not comfortable using the little teapot-looking container, here’s another way to relieve congestion and keep your nasal passages moist. “A warm — not hot — shower will immerse you in warm moisture, and that will lubricate your mucous membranes, particularly if you can cup some warm water into your hands, snuffle that up into your nose, and then very gently blow your nose,” Schaffner suggests. Don’t use a humidifier If your humidifier is just-out-of-the-box brand new, that’s one thing. But if you’ve had yours for a while, it’s probably best to skip it, Schaffner says. “They’re usually not cleaned very well, so bacteria grows and suddenly you’re aerosolizing contaminated water.” ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT 6. Consider over-the-counter pain relievers Acetaminophen and ibuprofen aren’t cures, but they can help reduce fever and alleviate aches and pains. Just “be sure to read the label carefully because these medications are not without risk — they can injure the liver, kidneys, intestines and cause other side effects — and these risks rise with age and complex health history,” Ray says. “Moreover, they don’t reduce the risk of hospitalization or death.” Don’t take decongestants Or at least not without consulting your health care provider. Here’s why: “Decongestants contain a combination of ingredients, some of which can increase your heart rate, even raise your blood pressure, and possibly interfere with sleep,” Schaffner says. 7. Stay physically active Forget what your mother said about staying in bed 24/7. “You have to listen to your body. But the more time you spend horizontal, the worse it is — physically and psychologically,” Schaffner says. Don’t overdo it That said, now is not the time to try for your personal best — for example, turning that daily power walk into a run or trying that hot yoga class you’ve been curious about. “Although gentle exercise, even just walking around, will make you feel better,” Schaffner says. 8. Pay attention to symptoms If your symptoms are getting progressively worse — you’ve got chest pain, your temperature is going up, you’re coughing up yellow phlegm — call your doctor, “particularly if you have any underlying illnesses and you’re worse today than you were yesterday,” Schaffner says. Don’t try to tough it out on your own You may be in the early stages of pneumonia, the most common complication of the flu. It can cause severe illness in people of every age, but older adults are among the most vulnerable. ﻿Research published in 2018 found that more than ﻿1 in 6 adults 65 and older who are hospitalized with pneumonia die from the infection.

For this purpose, it is crucial to develop molecular probes that respond selectively to physiological changes in live cells. We report stimuli-responsive light-emitters built on a T-shaped benzimidazole platform, and consecutive borylation reactions to produce a library of homologs displaying systematic changes in fluorescence quantum yield and environmental sensitivity. We find that certain fluorophores localize selectively at the endoplasmic reticulum, and interact with proteins involved in the stress signaling pathways. Notably, the mono-borylated compound responds selectively to the stress conditions by enhancing fluorescence, and detects avian influenza virus infection at the single-cell level. Our findings demonstrate the unprecedented practical utility of the stress-responsive molecular probes to differentiate cellular states for early diagnosis.

With appropriate structure design, such optical probes can respond to spatiotemporal changes in the cellular environments, so that biologically important information can be obtained by tracking shifts in the emission energy, intensity, or a combination of both1,2,3,4,5. For example, simultaneous use of multiple fluorescent probes, each responding sensitively and selectively to different types of physiological parameters, could be useful for an early diagnosis of disease. In particular, modern high contents screening (HCS) studies have demonstrated the usefulness of chemical probes for biological functional study, toxicology, and screening of bioactive molecules6,7,8.Despite significant advances, however, there still remain great demands for functional probes that can discriminate specific cellular states, in which a single biomarker alone cannot perform perfectly. For instance, the differentiation of virus infections is a complex biological process that is orchestrated by many transcriptional and translational controls. As such, markers for cellular states can be detected by antibody-based method only after lysis or under fixation conditions. Within this context, environmentally sensitive and live-cell compatible fluorescent probes that discriminate cellular states have significant scientific implications and practical impacts. For biological applications, fluorogenic molecules need to have bright emissions for high signal-to-noise ratio imaging, optical responsiveness to environmental changes, and low cytotoxicity for in vivo studies as well. The fluorogenic benzimidazole platform9,10,11 could be one such candidate. From a structure–properties point of view, structural rigidification of the π-conjugation would enhance the fluorescence quantum yield12,13, but the removal of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor (HBD–HBA) motifs might effectively shut down environment-sensitive emissive pathways such as excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)14,15,16.In this paper, we report the chemistry of T-shaped fluorogenic molecules EliF (= Extended and Ligating Imidazolyl Fluorophore, Fig. 1). Key features of the EliF molecules include (i) high modularity in synthesis to facilitate systematic variation of the electronic properties of the π-skeleton, and (ii) straightforward main-group coordination chemistry to convert the free ligands to the mono- and bis(BF2)-adducts having distinctively different photophysical properties. Even without installing organelle-targeting functional groups, certain EliF derivatives are taken up by live cells to become localized selectively at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, an ER localizing probe responds to early-stage of avian influenza (AI) virus infection by recognizing upregulated proteins in the ER stress signaling pathway of live cells.Fig. 1: Design principles of EliF.Main-group coordination chemistry converts non-covalent N–H···N hydrogen-bonding contacts to rigid B–N coordinate bonds, which profoundly impacts the environment-sensitivity and emission quantum yield of the fluorogenic skeleton.Full size imageResults and discussionConstruction of orthogonal π-conjugation: oxidative cyclization and borylationAs shown in Fig. 1, The EliF-1 series molecules are built by appending two pyridyl groups to the central N-aryl benzimidazole unit. In addition to laterally extending the π-conjugation to define the overall T-shape, these pyridyl groups take part in a contiguous array of N–H···N and C–H···N hydrogen bonds to help planarize the π-conjugation. We anticipated that structural changes here, either (i) by modulating the strength of hydrogen bonds by local dielectric or (ii) by more drastic covalent modification such as borylation of the N-donor groups, could profoundly impact the photophysical properties of EliF. To realize these ideas with actual molecules, a modular synthetic strategy was devised. As outlined in Fig. 2, the diamine compound 2, derived from the benzothiadiazole precursor 1, was employed as a common intermediate, and subjected to oxidative condensation reactions with various aryl aldehydes. With EliF-1a having a 4-ethylphenyl substituent as a reference system, 4-cyanophenyl (EliF-1b), 4-dimethylaminophenyl (EliF-1c), and 2-pyridyl (EliF-1d) groups were installed as electron-withdrawing, electron-donating, and heteroatom-containing aryl substituent, respectively, onto the common benzimidazole core.Fig. 2: Modular construction of EliF molecules.a Synthetic routes to free ligands and stepwise borylation. b Representative single-crystal X-ray structures. Et ethyl, DMF N,N-dimethylformamide, Me methyl, DIPEA N,N-diisopropylethylamine.Full size imageBy design, the two [N,N]-bidentate pockets of EliF-1 could function as donor groups for the coordination of electrophilic anchoring groups, such as {BF2}+, to serve as proton surrogates. Through variations in the choice of solvent, temperature, and reaction time, we were able to convert selectively each of the EliF-1 free ligands into the corresponding mono(BF2)-adducts EliF-2, and bis(BF2)-adducts EliF-3 (Fig. 2). A total of 12 compounds having different substitution patterns and overall charges were thus prepared in a straightforward fashion, by taking full advantage of the high modularity in fragment assembly and minimal synthetic operations. In large part, the success of our synthesis benefits from the differential reactivity of the two N-donor groups, and the overall charge of the boron adducts. After installation of the first {BF2}+ unit at the anionic and more reactive [N,N]-pocket of the deprotonated EliF-1 to afford charge-neutral EliF-2, the second borylation step occurs at the remaining charge-neutral (and thus less reactive) [N,N]-pocket to produce cationic EliF-3 (Figs. 1 and 2). During the course of this stepwise transformation, the cationic bis(BF2)-adducts form ionic salts with the BF4– anion generated in situ, and precipitate out of the reaction mixture. A simple filtration and washing cleanly afforded analytically pure bis(BF2)-adducts, without further purification by anion metathesis or recrystallization.As shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1–7, the single-crystal X-ray structures unambiguously establish the presence of multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the free ligands, either N–H···N or C–H···N. Upon coordination of an increasing number of {BF2}+ fragments, the number of HBD–HBA contacts decreases systematically. This trend correlates nicely with the decrease in the number of rotatable C–C bonds along with the series EliF-1 → EliF-2 → EliF-3 (Fig. 1), with the coordinated {BF2}+ functioning as a conformational lock. We anticipated that this structural rigidification would produce brighter light-emitters, whereas replacing the hydrogen bonds could attenuate environmental sensitivity. To probe the photophysical consequences of this tradeoff model (Fig. 1), we proceeded to carry out comparative photophysical studies.Structure-dependent and environment-sensitive fluorescence propertiesAs summarized in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1, installation of the first {BF2}+ unit (i.e., EliF-1 → EliF-2) dramatically enhances the emission quantum yields by as much as 70%. At the same time, the solvatochromic response of the fluorophore is diminished significantly as a tradeoff (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8–10). The most noticeable change is a complete disappearance of the dual emission (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8a) from ESIPT. For EliF-1 having N–H···N hydrogen bond, the ESIPT reaction is under kinetic control (Supplementary Fig. 12), allowing both tautomers to take radiative pathways to produce dual emission. This theoretical prediction is supported by a relatively short fluorescence lifetime of the local emission and a double-exponential fitted decay of the tautomer emission of EliF-1b (Supplementary Table 1). The strikingly different photophysical properties of EliF-1 vs. EliF-2 series are consistent with the anticipated structure–property correlation in Fig. 1. Replacement of the N–H···N hydrogen bonds with rigid B–N coordinate bonds simplifies both the conformational space and excited-state structural dynamics to produce a brighter emitter, but lowers its sensitivity to the environment.Fig. 3: Structure-dependent light-emitting properties.Changes in the fluorescence emission quantum yield (ΦF) of EliF-a (blue line), EliF-b (red line), EliF-c (green line), and EliF-d (black line) series molecules in CHCl3 (T = 293 K; λexc = 350 nm) with progressive installation of {BF2}+ fragments onto the [N,N]-bidentate pocket.

DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide, iPr isopropyl.Full size imageUpon installation of the second {BF2}+ unit (i.e., EliF-2 → EliF-3), however, a rather counterintuitive behavior was observed. While the solvatochromic response of the bis(BF2)-adducts is comparable to that of mono(BF2)-adducts (Supplementary Figs. 8–10), the fluorescence quantum yields become significantly lowered (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 11). Apparently, overborylation of EliF-2 to EliF-3 not only rigidifies the structure, as reflected on the evolution of well-resolved vibronic features in the emission spectra (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8–11), but also opens up undesired non-radiative channels that diminish the fluorescence efficiency, as reflected on the increased knr values determined by lifetime measurements (Supplementary Table 1). As a result, EliF-3 becomes less responsive to the environment than the free ligand EliF-1, and less emissive than the mono(BF2)-adduct EliF-2.To gain a detailed understanding of the structure-dependent changes in the light-emitting properties (Figs. 3 and 4), we carried out time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computational studies (Supplementary Figs. 13–16). A close inspection of the shapes of the FMOs suggests that the electronic excitation of EliF-3 has a significant vertical-to-horizontal intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 16). The absence of bathochromic shifts in polar solvents (Fig. 4c, and Supplementary Figs. 8c, 9c, and 10) implicates that the charge-transfer leading to a dark 1ICT state is responsible for the diminished emission quantum yield of EliF-3 (Fig. 3). By suppressing this deleterious ICT pathway, electron-withdrawing aryl substituents in the vertical π-conjugation tend to produce brighter emission, as supported by the plot of fluorescence quantum yields vs Hammett constants σp (Supplementary Fig. 17)17,18.With a better understanding of the photophysics of EliF molecules, we proceeded to test their practical utility. It was anticipated that the less-bright-yet-more-responsive EliF-1 (Figs. 3 and 4a) could be useful as fluorescence sensors, whereas bright-and-robust EliF-2 (Figs. 3 and 4b) as bio-imaging agents. As detailed in the following sections, our exploratory studies have revealed that certain EliF molecules selectively target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).Fluorescence live-cell imaging and discovery of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localizationTo evaluate the practical application of EliF molecules for biological imaging, we initially checked the toxicity of each compound using a luminescence-based cell viability assay (Supplementary Fig. 18). None of the compounds exhibit significant dose-dependent toxicity at the micromolar level. While the EliF-1 series molecules become more toxic under UV irradiation (λ = 350 nm) conditions, photo-toxicity diminishes with increasing level of borylation: EliF-1 ≫ EliF-2 > EliF-3 (Supplementary Fig. 19). Since the photophysical properties of the EliF system are yet to be optimized for conventional fluorescence microscopy, we customized the excitation/emission filters for optimum signal acquisition by incubating each compound in HeLa cells and monitoring live-cell staining patterns (Supplementary Fig. 20).Among the twelve EliF compounds listed in Fig. 2, three molecules (EliF-1a, 1c, and 3c) showed no or very dim fluorescence staining, possibly due to their low quantum yield and/or low cell permeability. On the other hand, the remaining nine compounds were successfully permeabilized and stained the cytosolic part of HeLa cells. Since the EliF scaffold itself is charge-neutral and contains multiple aromatic units, we initially anticipated that their cellular accumulation pattern might be similar to that of BODIPY-like fluorophores, which tend to have high staining signals and localize at hydrophobic membranes20,21. Unlike our expectation, however, EliF series molecules exhibited dimmer signals under the microscope but unique staining with larger Stokes shifts. Moreover, similar staining patterns were observed despite the structural distinctions of each compound. The fluorescence cell images revealed interconnected network sacs and tube-like structures throughout the individual cell’s cytosol region (Fig. 5). Based on the stained structural characteristics, we suspected that EliF was accumulated in subcellular organelles.Fig. 5: Fluorescence co-localization images of live HeLa cells stained with ER-RFP and EliF probes.Panels a–e correspond to EliF-1b; f–j to EliF-2c (sample concentration = 10 μM; cell incubation time = 30 min). Panels b, g: fluorescence images of EliF probes obtained using F1 filter-set (λexc = 350/50 nm, λem = 527/30 nm). Panels c, h: fluorescence images of ER-RFP obtained using RHOD filter-set (λexc = 546/10 nm, λem = 585/40 nm). In panels, b, c, g, h, white arrows mark sac or tube-like structures of ER. Panel d is the merged image of b and c; panel i is the merged image of g and h. Co-localization patterns shown in e and j are plotted as fluorescence intensity profiles of ER-RFP (magenta line) and EliF probes (green line) in the regions of interest, which are indicated by white lines in the images d and i, respectively (scale bar = 25 µm). Imaging experiments were conducted on at least three independent biological replicates; all replicates produced similar results.Full size imageTo verify which organelle was labeled by the EliF dyes, we conducted a co-localization experiment using a series of organelle trackers. Compounds that show fluorescence signals from all microscope filter sets could not be examined by a co-staining method. We thus ruled out four such compounds (EliF-2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b), and focused on the remaining five (EliF-1b, 1d, 2c, 2d, and 3d). To visualize organelles, HeLa cells were transfected with each CellLightTM organelle tracker (Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-RFP, Mitochondria-RFP, Golgi-RFP, Lysosomes-RFP, Peroxisome-GFP, and NUCLEAR-ID Red) for 24 h to express fluorescent proteins, and the EliF dyes were administrated into the cells for imaging (Supplementary Figs. 21–25).Our co-localization images unambiguously established that the EliF dyes are localized in the ER. ER is a subcellular organelle that plays crucial roles in protein glycosylation, folding, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium homeostasis22,23,24. As such, ER dysfunction is related to multiple diseases, including type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, ischemia, and virus infections25,26. Due to the difficulty of controlling ER selectivity, few organic fluorescent probes are currently available that can target ER27. These conventional probes are categorized into two classes. One class is glibenclamide conjugated fluorophores that are designed to bind to an ER protein, ATP-sensitive potassium channel28,29,30. The other class has been empirically discovered, such as 2,5‐diphenyloxazoles derivative that was dubbed ER blue-white DPX31. These organic dye trackers have practical merits, such as short incubation time (24 h for expression of fluorescent protein (FP) vs 30 min for cellular distribution of dye) and ease of dose control, compared with FP expression-based CellLightTM organelle trackers. However, their organelle selectivity and photostability differ depending on the structure of the ligands and fluorophores. As shown in Fig. 5, EliF clearly visualizes ER network structures. As the EliF probes showed prominent ER localization, we further compared their photostability with a commercial organic dye tracker, ER-TrackerTM Green. Both EliF-1b and EliF-2c showed comparable stability with the commercial tracker (Supplementary Fig. 26).Cellular targets of EliF probesWhile fluorescence co-localization studies suggested ER localization, it was not straightforward to understand the sub-organelle specificity of the EliF probes. We thus proceeded to identify the cellular targets of EliF-1b and EliF-2c. As the EliF molecular scaffold has not been investigated for cellular target proteins, unbiased target engagement profiling was needed. For this purpose, several identification strategies are currently available, such as affinity matrix, in situ labeling, and label-free methods32,33. We chose a label-free target identification using thermal proteome profiling (TPP)34,35, since it does not require structural modification of the probe molecules that could potentially alter its cellular localization.A given composition and sequence of protein has its unique thermal tolerance. In other words, each protein has a distinctive melting temperature. Ligand binding alters such property, and it is possible to deduce ligand–protein interactions based on melting temperature shift. Using multiplexed tandem mass-tag (TMT), TPP measures changes in the melting temperatures of proteins in cellular conditions. TPP experiments were conducted according to the previously reported procedure36. Briefly, HeLa cells were preincubated with EliF-1b, EliF-2c, or vehicle, and each sample was divided into ten fractions. A heat shock condition from 37 to 67 °C was applied to each fraction to induce thermal denaturing. Non-denatured proteins were subsequently recovered, digested into peptides, and labeled with 10-plex TMT. Since TMTs have identical chemical structures but differ in mass by substitution of 13C and 15N isotopes, it is possible to compare the thermal stability of each protein quantitatively.From TPP experiments using nanoLC coupled to Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid MS with collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher energy CID (HCD), we identified 5512, 5245, and 6352 proteins from the cells treated with vehicle, EliF-1b, and EliF-2c, respectively (Supplementary Data 1). After applying filters based on distinctive Tm values, 29 and 36 protein hits were discovered by EliF-1b and EliF-2c, respectively, with ten common hits from both compounds (Fig. 6a). The average Tm difference of the primary hit proteins were 3.5 °C (Fig. 6b), and there are four proteins (PSPH, PDXDC2P, PDXDC1, and NCAPG) that exhibited Tm shift larger than 7 °C. Among these four proteins, PDXDC2P and PDXDC1 are previously known for their cellular localization in ER. Further analysis indicated that 64% of the 55 primary hits are either found in ER, or involved in ER-related signaling pathways (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Data 1).Fig. 6: Label-free target identification for EliF-1b and EliF-2c.a A Venn diagram of target proteins identified by TPP. b Tm shift plot of TPP with target proteins of EliF-1b in blue, EliF-2c in green, and the common hits in orange color, respectively. c ER-related functional annotation of target proteins. d Gene ontology enrichment analysis of 55 target proteins using the cellular component term. Thermal protein melting curves of four major target proteins, NCAPG (e); PDXDC1 (f); PDXDC2P (g); PSPH (h) treated with EliF probes (green solid line) and control groups (green dashed line).Full size imageWe next examined the hit proteins by bioinformatic methods that interpret the functional profile of the enriched gene sets using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The GO analysis (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Data 1) also revealed that the top three cellular component keywords for our hit proteins are related to the terms cytosolic and membrane-bound organelle with exceptionally high statistical significance. A combination of chemical proteomics and gene annotation analysis thus establishes that the primary target proteins of EliF probes are indeed enriched in ER, which is consistent with their selective localization confirmed by fluorescence imaging (Fig. 5).It is noteworthy that 15 out of 55 primary hits (seven out of ten common hits) proteins are related to ER stress signaling (Supplementary Data 1). This observation led to our subsequent investigation of potential bioassay development with EliF-1b and EliF-2c for ER stress monitoring in live cells. Since many diseases or pathological conditions of acute viral infections are highly related to ER stress leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, there exists a high demand for simple experimental protocols to measure ER stress.EliF-1b and EliF-2c as ER stress-responsive probesSeveral research groups have recently reported ER stress assays using luciferase reporter37, qPCR38, and transcription activation39. A few molecular probes are also available that can detect environmental changes of ER by fluorescence imaging40,41,42. Since image-based quantification methods are inherently prone to the choice of analysis parameters and algorithms employed, their response was subtle and only qualitative. In this regard, there are no molecular probes to monitor ER stress quantitatively. We envisioned that EliF has the potential to discriminate ER status because overloading of misfolded protein accumulation could lead to micro-environmental changes resembling solvatochromic effects (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 8–10).To evaluate the fluorescence response of EliF upon ER stress, we designed a model condition using two ER stress-inducing agents, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, which operate by distinct mechanisms. Thapsigargin (TG) causes ER stress by inhibiting ER Ca2+-ATPase activity43,44, whereas tunicamycin (TN) inhibits N-linked glycosylation of nascent proteins, thus leading to an accumulation of hypoglycosylated proteins in the ER lumen45,46. HeLa cells were preincubated with varying concentrations of TG and TN (0–30 µM) for 12 h to induce ER stress, and subsequently treated with EliF molecules. To obtain quantitative fluorescence response profiles at the individual cell level, we conducted flow cytometry-based screening (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 27).Fig. 7: ER stress responses.Flow cytometry analysis of a, b EliF-1b (10 μM), and c, d EliF-2c (10 μM) in ER stress-induced HeLa cells. ER stress was chemically induced by increasing concentrations (0–30 μM) of either thapsigargin (TG; for a and c) or tunicamycin (TN; for b and d) preincubation for 12 h, and monitored by cell population shifts in flow cytometry using FL10 filter (λexc = 405 nm; λem = 550/40 nm). Based on the mean fluorescence intensity, EliF-1b showed 1.55- and 1.45-fold increment with TG and TN, respectively (concentration = 30 µM). EliF-2c showed 1.79- and 3.31-fold increment with TG and TN, respectively (concentration = 30 µM). e RT-PCR analysis of major target proteins (NCAPG, PDXDC1, and PSPH) upon ER stress induction. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 7, both EliF-1b and EliF-2c display dose-dependent fluorescence responses upon ER stress. Intriguingly, both TG and TN induced a significant increase in the high fluorescence population of the cells stained with EliF-1b and EliF-2c. In particular, EliF-2c exhibited a remarkable fluorescence increase for the TN treatment. The major cell population was shifted prominently to higher fluorescence at higher concentrations (> 3 µM) of ER stress-inducing agents, and the mean fluorescence intensity increased up to 3.31-fold for the treatment of TN (30 µM). Such response was apparently distinctive compared with other EliF compounds (EliF-1d, EliF-2d, and EliF-3d; Supplementary Fig. 27) or commercial ER trackers (ER-TrackerTM Blue-White, and ER-TrackerTM Green; Supplementary Fig. 28), which do not show noticeable shifts in fluorescence intensity under identical conditions. Additionally, major target proteins (NCAPG, PDXDC1, and PSPH) that exhibited significant Tm shift upon binding to EliF-1b or EliF-2c were upregulated under ER stress conditions (Fig. 7e). The results from these control experiments implicate that the fluorescence responses of EliF-1b and EliF-2c (Fig. 7) do not originate from toxicity-induced non-specific cellular uptake.We also examined whether EliF-1b and EliF-2c respond to other organelle perturbation conditions. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) is a well-known agent for mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization47,48. Neither EliF-1b nor EliF-2c showed fluorescence response to CCCP in flow cytometry experiments (Supplementary Fig. 29). These observations support that EliF-1b and EliF-2c respond selectively to ER stress signals.Early diagnosis of avian influenza infection by EliF probesDuring the last decades, several global pandemic emergences of RNA viruses have been reported, including the 2009 H1N1 influenza and 2019 SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many techniques are currently available to diagnose RNA virus infections, but continuous infection monitoring at the individual cell level remains challenging. Our group has been investigating the host cell response to influenza virus infection using fluorescent probes and demonstrated successful discrimination of avian influenza subtypes using fluorescent imaging49. From the previous study, it has become apparent that a versatile host response needs to be measured to better understand the infection process at the individual cell level.We were intrigued by the possibility of using the ER stress-responsive fluorescence of EliF molecules to distinguish the early infection stage of avian influenza (AI) in host cells. The current gold standard protocol for AI virus diagnosis involves a two-step workflow50. In this method, the egg-based virus amplification step is required to obtain hundreds of microliters of sample volume for hemagglutination assay (HA). Using ROS chemosensors, we have previously demonstrated that the cell-based assay has significant advantages over conventional assay: cell culture is more cost-effective than egg-based amplification; single-cell-based assay is more sensitive than serologic assay49. Since molecular probes capable of distinguishing infected cells by distinct cellular mechanisms have enormous value, we tested the practical utility of EliF dyes for an early diagnosis of AI infection in a cell-based assay.To validate cell-based AI infection profiling, three cell lines (HeLa, SK-OV3, and SH-SY5Y) exhibiting significantly different infectability patterns were chosen (Fig. 8a). Among the final two candidates, EliF-2c was employed as the probe because of its stronger fluorescence response than EliF-1b under ER stress conditions (Fig. 7); an added bonus was its lower photo-cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. 19). During the infection process, changes in the emission were monitored every 12 h at the single-cell level on flow cytometry (Fig. 8b, c). After 24 h, a significant fluorescence enhancement was observed only in HeLa cells with a high infectability level. Without any ER stress-inducing agents, influenza infection triggered host cell response that altered fluorescence emission of EliF-2c.Fig. 8: Response to H1N1 AI infection.a H1N1 virus infectability in HeLa (black), SK-OV3 (red), and SH-SY5Y (blue) cells after 24 h. b Bar graphs showing the mean fluorescence intensity of EliF-2c with 1.46-fold enhancement in the HeLa cell after 24 h infection. a, b Data were representative of two replicate experiments. c Flow cytometry analysis of EliF-2c (10 µM) in HeLa, SK-OV3, and SH-SY5Y cells using FL10 filter (λexc = 405 nm; λem = 550/40 nm). RFU relative fluorescence units.Full size imageEncouraged by this distinctive response depending on the infection level, we further examined additional model cells from respiratory-related organ origin: human tracheal epithelial cell (HTEpC), and nasal septum origin carcinoma cell (RPMI 2650). Normal cells from humans (HUVEC) were also subjected to the test. We found that EliF-2c consistently presented clear fluorescence increment in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 30). It is also noteworthy that the cellular expression of major target proteins was also upregulated upon AI infection (Supplementary Fig. 31). Considering that the conventional egg-based assay requires 3–5 days for virus amplification, EliF-2c can shorten the diagnosis time to 24 h by detecting early AI infection at the single-cell level. These results clearly demonstrate that ER stress responding EliF can be used to monitor the early-stage of AI infection.Our observation of ER stress induction in early AI virus infection is consistent with the previous report on differential transcriptome changes of several RNA virus infections51. Interestingly, we found that three proteins (NCAPG, PSPH, and PDXDC2P) exhibiting the highest Tm shifts for EliF also showed significant expression perturbation upon RNA virus infection. In addition, a recent multi-omics analysis of unfolded protein response also revealed that ER stress induces the up-regulation of NCAPG, PDXDC1, and PSPH, which is consistent with our observation52. Taken together, we postulate that EliF-2c responds to ER stress by interacting with these proteins. A detailed molecular-level understanding of this tantalizing prospect will be a topic of future studies.We have constructed π-extended benzimidazole fluorophores that localize selectively at ER, respond to ER stress, and detect AI virus infection. Our synthesis involves modular construction of the core π-skeleton, and stepwise installation of {BF2}+ units to diversify the structure. A balancing tradeoff between environment-sensitivity and fluorescence quantum yield was observed, when the N–H···N hydrogen bonds were replaced consecutively by the {N–BF2–N} dative bonds.Even without specific subcellular organelle-targeting functional groups, certain EliF molecules are taken up by living cells and localized selectively at ER. Moreover, they also detect ER stress by changing the fluorescence characteristics of individual cells. To the best of our knowledge, EliF represents the only class of ER-targeting and ER stress-responding molecular probes that diagnose the early-stage of AI virus infection within a day by avoiding lengthy and complicated sample preparation steps.Influenza infection is a highly heterogeneous process even in homogeneously cultured cells. As such, fractionation of infected cells at the single-cell level, despite its technical challenge, has a significant impact on elucidating the mechanism of influenza infection, possibly by employing multi-omics techniques. We have demonstrated the robustness of EliF-2c in FACS-based counting assay or fractionation sorting assay, which is an important first step to obtain detailed information on influenza infection. Efforts are currently underway in our laboratories to establish robust cell-based AI virus screening applications with structurally more elaborate fluorophores.MethodsSynthetic procedures and characterization of EliF fluorophores reported in this work are provided in Supplementary Information.Physical measurements1H NMR, 13C NMR, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Bruker Advance DPX-300, a 400 MHz Agilent 400-MR DD2 Magnetic Resonance System, or a 500 MHz Varian/Oxford As-500 spectrometer.

To screen live-cell imaging applicability, each EliF probe (10 μM) was incubated in the HeLa cells for 30 min (final DMSO concentration = 1%). Prior to obtaining fluorescence images, cells were washed twice using fresh DMEM media. Images were obtained under different microscope filter settings (DAPI, λexc = 325–375 nm, λem = 435–485 nm; F1, λexc = 325–375 nm, λem = 512–542 nm; F2, λexc = 325–375 nm, λem = 565–605 nm; FITC, λexc = 460–500 nm, λem = 512–542 nm; RHOD, λexc = 541–551 nm, λem = 565–605 nm) using Leica DMi8 microscope (Leica Inc., Germany) with ×40 dry lens.For the investigation of the subcellular organelle localization, HeLa cells were plated in a black transparent 96-well plate. To stain cellular organelles, cells were transfected with CellLightTM organelle trackers for 24 h. Different organelle trackers were used, namely, CellLightTM ER-RFP (Thermo Fisher, C10591), CellLightTM Mitochondria-RFP (Thermo Fisher, C10505), CellLightTM Golgi-RFP (Thermo Fisher, C10593), CellLightTM Lysosomes-RFP (Thermo Fisher, C10597), and CellLightTM Peroxisome-GFP (Thermo Fisher, C10604). Following the transfection, cells were treated with probes (10 μM) for organelle localization imaging (final DMSO concentration = 1%). The nucleus was stained with NUCLEAR-IDr Red DNA stain (Enzo, ENZ-52406; λexc = 590–650 nm, λem = 662–738 nm) for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice with fresh DMEM media, and the fluorescence images of the probes and organelle trackers were captured by using a Leica DMi8 microscope (Leica Inc., Germany) with a ×40 dry lens. The image acquisition settings were optimized by providing the excitation light from a mercury lamp (ECL6000, Leica Inc., Germany) with mild intensity (25%) during imaging. The images were processed in Leica Application Suite X (LAS X Version: 3.7.0.20979) software. The co-localization analysis of the indicated lines in the images was performed by using Fiji/ImageJ (version 1.46r).Cell culture, heating, and cell lysis for thermal proteome profilingHeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HeLa cells were plated in a 10 cm cell culture dish for 24 h, and treated with 10 μM of each EliF probe (EliF-1b and EliF-2c) for 30 min (final DMSO concentration = 1%). To harvest the cells, trypsin (0.05%) was added to the plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, the reaction was terminated by PBS. The resulting samples were pelleted and resuspended in PBS to a final count of 2 × 106 cells/mL. The samples were pelleted again and resuspended in 1.1 mL of cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. The cell suspensions were transferred (100 μL each to ten PCR tubes), and centrifuged at 300 g for 3 min at T = 4 °C to pellet the cells. After removing 80 μL of PBS, each 20 μL of the concentrated cells were heated at ten designated temperatures (37, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 63, and 67 °C) for 3 min in C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, 1841000). After heating, the samples were incubated in the PCR tubes at r.t. for 3 min. The cells were lysed by freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 20,000×g for 20 min at T = 4 °C. Finally, 80 μL of each supernatant with the soluble protein fraction was carefully transferred to a new tube for further analysis.In-solution protein digestionCell lysate samples were mixed with 100 μL of 8 M urea in 3 K filter units (Millipore, UFC500396), and centrifuged at 14,000×g for 15 min. The step was repeated once. After collecting the supernatants, dithiothreitol (10 mM) was added to the filter units and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, iodoacetamide (50 mM) was added to the filter units and incubated for 20 min in dark. Final buffer exchange was performed by adding 100 μL of ammonium bicarbonate buffer (50 mM), followed by a 14,000×g spin for 15 min. After two additional buffer exchanges, the samples were digested with trypsin (Promega, V5280) overnight at 37 °C. The trypsin digestion was terminated with 1% formic acid, and the samples were desalted with C18 cartridges (Waters, WAT054955). The C18 cartridges were conditioned with acetonitrile, and equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid. The peptides bound to the C18 cartridges were washed with 0.1% formic acid and eluted by elution buffer (70% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid).TMT-10-Plex labeling and off-line fractionation at basic pHDigested peptides were resuspended in 100 μL of triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (100 mM). Each sample was mixed with a separate TMT (Thermo Scientific, 90110) label suspended in 41 μL of acetonitrile. Samples were incubated at r.t. for 1 h. Labeling was quenched with 8 μL of 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min. Samples were combined and dried in SpeedVac. The labeled peptides were resuspended in 300 μL of 0.1% formic acid and desalted by C18 cartridges with standard procedures. The C18 cartridges were conditioned with acetonitrile and equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid. The peptides bound to the C18 cartridges were washed with 0.1% formic acid and eluted by elution buffer (70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The samples were separated by XBridge BEH130 C18 column (Waters, 186003128); the basic pH fraction of the eluent was gradually increased from 3 to 60% over 85 min; flow rate = 40 μL/min. The eluted fractions were collected for each 1 min into low binding tubes. After collecting the first 20 fractions, the 21st fraction was collected into the same tube as fraction #1, the 22nd fraction was collected into fraction #2, and so on. As a result, four fractions, i.e., ith, (i + 20)th, (i + 40)th, and (i + 60)th, were collected into each tube.LC-MS/MS analysisAll LC-MS/MS data were collected by an UltiMateTM 3000 RSLCnano System (Thermo Scientific, 5200.0356) equipped with a 50-cm C18 analytical column (Thermo Scientific, ES903), a 2-cm trap column (Thermo Scientific, 164535), an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, FSN04–10000), and Xcalibur software (version 4.1). The analytical column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. Each fraction was eluted by using a 180 min method over a gradient from 5 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Full-scan MS spectra (400–2,000 m/z) were acquired in the FT-Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000, followed by the selection of the twenty most intense ions for HCD-MS2 fragmentation. Directly after each MS2 experiment, the ten most intense fragment ions of the precursor m/z were selected for HCD-MS3. The resulting MS/MS/MS data were searched using Uniprot (Taxonomy: Homo sapiens, 2020.05.19) and analyzed by Proteome Discoverer software (v.2.4). TMT-plex (K) and Carbamidomethylation (C) were set as static modifications, and oxidation (M) and acetyl (N-terminus) were set as variable modifications. The precursor and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.6 Da, respectively. The maximum peptide and site false discovery rates were specified as 0.01 using Percolator.Fluorescence responses of EliF-2c in the monitoring of cells infected with avian influenzaTo monitor AI infection at the early-stage, different cells were infected with the H1N1 virus (EID50/mL; 107.167) for 12 and 24 h, and treated subsequently with EliF-2c (10 μM) for 30 min. The cells were trypsinized, harvested, and centrifuged for 5 min at 136×g. The supernatants were discarded, and the remaining cell pellets were resuspended in PBS. The resulting samples were subjected to flow cytometry analysis on a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA) by counting 10,000 events for each sample using Kaluza software (version 2.1). The fluorescence signals were recorded by FL10 (λexc = 405 nm and λem = 530–570 nm). The data was processed with FlowJo Single-Cell Analysis Software v10.7.2 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA) by using histogram offset plots. The fluorescence intensity fold changes were calculated by comparing the virus-treated and control groups.Cell line susceptibility profiling of H1N1 virus using immunocytochemistryFor avian influenza (AI) infection profiling, HeLa, SK-OV3, and SH-SY5Y cells were used. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h and infected with AI virus strain H1N1 (A/NSW/33) in a 1/10-fold serial dilution starting with Embryo Infectious Dose 50 value (EID50/mL) 107.167 for 24 h49. For the staining of AI-infected cells, a 1:100 dilution of anti-matrix protein 1 (M1) antibody (mouse; Abcam, cat. no. ab22396; clone number: GA2B) was used. Prior to antibody staining, the infected cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min, and permeabilized by using 0.25% Triton-X100 for 10 min. After blocking with 2.5% BSA for 1 h with gentle shaking, cells were immunostained with an anti-M1 antibody for 2 h. Unbound antibodies were washed out with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20) three times and incubated 1:3000 dilution of anti-mouse Alexa488 (rabbit; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. A-11011; RRID: AB_143157) for 1 h. The cells were subsequently washed with PBS-T three times, and the nuclei were stained by Hoechst34580 for 15 min. After three additional washings with PBS-T, immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed with Operetta High Contents Image System (PerkinElmer) and analyzed by Harmony 3.1 software (PerkinElmer).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The three cases where infection has been found have been due to close contact with dust raised during the handling of affected poultry. Ursula Höfle 05/10/2022 - 10:58 CEST Versión en castellano An employee of the XinRong pigeon hatchery moves pigeons in Shanghai (China) / EFE Avian influenza viruses are bird-specific influenza A viruses. Their HXNX names derive from two types of spicules (Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase) on their surface, of which there are a large number (17 H and 9N) and of which there are all sorts of combinations. These spicules or antigens are also what the antibodies (in all species) that infected individuals develop are directed against. Historically, avian influenza viruses circulated silently among waterfowl, mainly ducks and gulls, and indeed most still do (so-called low pathogenic avian influenza viruses). Only the H5 and H7 subtypes are capable, after introduction into poultry farms and chain transmission between many individual chickens or turkeys, of developing into much more aggressive (highly pathogenic) versions causing high mortality. Historically, avian influenza viruses circulated silently among waterfowl, mainly ducks and gulls These changes occur either by small errors in virus replication in each new host (mutations), or by exchanges of gene segments with other avian influenza viruses when two different viruses (e.g. of a different subtype) infect the same individual at the same time. This is because the genes of these viruses consist of eight segments that are easily exchanged if two viruses infect the same cell. In the historical scenario, the risk period only covered the winter and the introduction of the virus in a farm was related to a contact of waterfowl with poultry. In the case of a farm outbreak, the spread of the virus could be stopped by culling all poultry on the affected farms, implementing strict movement control and poultry health surveillance. The risk period covered only the winter and the introduction of the virus into a farm was linked to contact of waterfowl with poultry It was also extremely rare for a person to become infected, as these viruses are adapted to grow in cells of the respiratory or digestive tract of birds and in principle lack the ability to attach to and enter the cells of the respiratory and digestive epithelium of humans. However, even so, in the past there have been some exceptional cases of infection of a person after prolonged exposure, e.g. to dust in a shed full of affected poultry (notably in the Netherlands by an H7N7 virus in 2003 which mainly caused conjunctivitis in the affected persons). With the emergence of a new genotype of H5N1 virus in Guangdong (China) in 1997 two fundamental things changed: this particular virus became deadly also for many wild bird species and, in cases of intensive exposure (people in Asia living continuously with their birds) it had the capacity to infect humans (first cases in Hong Kong in 2003). This virus that arrived in Europe in 2005 via migratory birds (among other routes) never developed the capacity to spread easily from person to person. However, in most of the people it infected, it caused a very severe process, with a high lethality (a high percentage of infected people die), probably because its replication developed in the cells of the lung instead of the cells of the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract (nose or trachea). With the emergence of a new genotype of H5N1 in Guangdong in 1997, it became deadly to many wild birds and had the capacity to infect people living continuously with their birds The current H5N1 virus that is circulating globally and causing an unprecedented epidemic among wild and domestic birds, especially in Europe and North America, contains fragments of this H5N1 ancestor, but also many other subtypes and numerous mutations. At present, its ability to infect humans is very low, as it is a virus that is highly adapted to birds. In the three cases in which infection has been found to date, these have been extreme and prolonged exposures. Specifically, these are situations of close contact with dust raised during handling or depopulation of affected poultry. In none of the three cases (one in the USA, one in the UK and the last one in Spain) have symptoms of disease been observed, nor has there been any transmission to other people. In other words, as explained by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) and the Ministry of Health, the risk to humans is currently very low. In none of the three cases (one in the USA, one in the UK and the last one in Spain) have symptoms of the disease been observed, nor has there been any transmission to other people That said, the development of this virus needs to be closely monitored as the possibility of reassortment (exchange of genetic material) between this H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses or a seasonal influenza virus is remote, but cannot be completely excluded. Even if it happens, again it would most likely not result in a more lethal or more transmissible virus, but it is not totally excluded that it could happen. The advantage is that it is known and the tools exist for integrated surveillance. What is very real and important is the risk to poultry farms, as the virus has become established in wild birds affecting many more species and with much greater virulence than ever before and also in summer, outside the usual periods of circulation. This makes strict biosecurity measures particularly important as they are the main way to protect farms.

To promote the health and safety of our campus and local community, West Virginia University is encouraging all students, faculty and staff to get an influenza vaccination this fall. Watch a video from the School of Pharmacy about the importance of flu shots. In addition to getting a flu shot from a primary care provider, walk-in appointments are available for students, faculty and staff through WVU Medicine Student Health during regular business hours from 7:45 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 9:45 a.m. to 4 p.m on Saturdays. WVU Medicine Urgent Care and Primary Care locations are currently offering appointments. To make an appointment, call 855-WVU-CARE (855-988-2273) or self-schedule through MyWVUChart. If you are a WVU Medicine employee, the annual flu shot campaign hosted by WVU Medicine Employee Health begins Tuesday (Oct. 4). Students, faculty and staff can receive their flu shot from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday (Oct. 5) or from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 12, 18 and 20 at the WVU Student Recreation Center. Individuals with insurance should bring their insurance card. Following two mild flu seasons, due in part to COVID-19 safety guidelines such as masking and social distancing, experts are predicting more widespread infection this year. While seasonal flu viruses are detected year-round, it’s recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October in order to provide protection during the peak of flu season in fall and winter. The CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone six months and older. This includes individuals with conditions that could put them at higher risk for flu complications as well as pregnant women. WVU Medicine requires all staff, providers, residents, students and volunteers to have a flu vaccination unless they have an approved medical or religious exemption. This includes WVU faculty and staff (state employees) whose job duties bring them into contact with patients as well as those whose work requires them to enter patient care areas intermittently, even if their main work location is elsewhere. Individuals who are uncertain if this requirement applies to them should ask their supervisor for clarification. Students working in WVU Medicine clinical areas or on clinical rotations elsewhere should contact their student services office for additional information. Proof of immunization must be provided to Employee Health by Wednesday, Dec. 28. If requesting medical or religious exemption for the flu vaccine, you will need to submit an exemption form to HROneSource by Wednesday, Nov. 2. If you are requesting a medical exemption, your primary care provider will need to sign a medical exemption form. Both the WVU Medicine Student Health and WVU Medicine Urgent Care clinics also offer COVID-19 vaccination opportunities. First, second and booster doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are available at these clinics, and individuals may choose to get their flu shot at the same time as their COVID-19 vaccine. Flu shots are fully covered under PEIA and The Health Plan for insured WVU employees, spouses and dependent family members. Flu shots also are covered for students under the Aetna Student Health insurance plan. Those not insured through these providers also may bill their insurance. Note: A $30 cash payment option also is available for the flu vaccine. However, most insurance providers fully cover the cost. The COVID-19 vaccine is offered free of charge. Visit the Talent and Culture or WVU Medicine Student Health websites for more information. Students should contact Student Health at 304-285-7200 with any questions. Employees should contact their primary care physician.

Produced by Twitter Facebook Email A Cincinnati Children’s Vaccine Research Center nurse administers a vaccine during a clinical trial visit.Credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical CenterIn 1883, Nellie Phillips Dayton, Isabelle Hopkins and Mary Emery envisioned a hospital for children in Cincinnati. Within a year, they opened what is now Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in a three-bedroom house, just a few miles northeast of downtown. Over the next 140 years, this local children’s hospital grew into one of the world’s top medical centres. Its 1.5 million annual patient visits include children from all 50 states and around the world, including those with complex or rare disorders. At the centre of this success is that nearly one-third of the 17,300 people who work at Cincinnati Children’s are engaged in research that helps advance medical care. Cincinnati Children’s is a leading centre for vaccine research and development, and the results of this work have been felt around the world. Immunization against disease is described as “one of the most significant advances in child health over the past century” in a paper1 co-authored by Tina Cheng, Cincinnati Children’s chair of pediatrics, director of its research foundation, and chief medical officer. Contributions to this global research effort have supported many past milestones at Cincinnati Children’s — and set the stage for its future goals. A legacy of vaccine innovationCincinnati Children’s was the first paediatric hospital in the United States to have a centre dedicated solely to research. The hospital, which dates to 1883, launched its research foundation in 1931.Credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical CenterIn 1931, the Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation was launched, demonstrating the hospital’s commitment to innovation. World-renowned scientists were recruited, including Albert Sabin, developer of the oral polio vaccine in 1960. “Sabin developed that vaccine here, and Cincinnati Children’s performed some of the first US clinical trials of the Sabin vaccine,” says Paul Spearman, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children’s. “That put Cincinnati Children’s on the map as a place for excellence in vaccine science.”Over the next 50 years, scientists at Cincinnati Children’s pioneered additional vaccines. Gilbert Schiff, former director of the hospital’s Vaccine Research Center, developed vaccines for rubella and influenza. David Bernstein, the next director of the Vaccine Research Center, and virologist Richard Ward led the development of Rotarix, one of two internationally licensed rotavirus vaccines.A clinical research coordinator observes a pharmacist prepare a syringe of COVID-19 vaccine in the Cincinnati Children’s Vaccine Research Center.Credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical CenterIt’s a legacy that lives on in the hospital’s work today. Cincinnati Children’s is one of only 10 Vaccine Treatment and Evaluation Units (VTEUs) in the United States and the only VTEU that is a free-standing paediatric hospital. That sets Cincinnati Children’s apart from other paediatric institutions. The centre has been at the forefront in investigating vaccines to prevent or control epidemics, such as swine flu, Ebola and COVID-19. Cincinnati Children’s Vaccine Research Center, led by Robert Frenck, served as a key site for the testing of multiple COVID-19 vaccines2 in participants ranging from six months to 85 years of age, which played a leading role in providing access to life-saving vaccines for the American public and the world.With ongoing vaccine studies focused on COVID-19, Ebola, norovirus, Shigella, influenza and more, the projects underway at Cincinnati Children’s are intentionally wide-ranging, Spearman says. “We like to be comprehensive when it comes to vaccinology and vaccine development.”In addition to developing its own projects, Cincinnati Children’s advances vaccine science through collaboration. Spearman is currently working with a start-up company on intranasal vaccines for COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Advancing the fight against paediatric influenzaMany scientists and clinicians at Cincinnati Children’s are actively engaged in influenza research. “Flu kills people every year, including babies,” says Mary Allen Staat, an infectious disease expert at the hospital. As part of their work studying the flu’s impact on infants, Staat and her team ran the PREVAIL Cohort Study, which enrolled 265 mothers and their newborns. The mothers collected weekly samples from their babies, reported on their infant’s health via text messages, and visited Cincinnati Children’s every six weeks for a baby exam and blood draw. PREVAIL reported that the study “will contribute unique data to guide vaccine recommendations”3. Staat and her colleagues are expanding on this work with the Influenza IMPRINT Cohort Study. IMPRINT will enrol 2,000 mother-child pairs from Cincinnati and Mexico City, who will be tracked for flu. The scientists start collecting data at delivery. The mother-child pairs also provide nasal swab, blood and saliva samples several times a year, which are thoroughly analysed, including genetic testing.“We want to better understand how a child will respond to their first flu exposure, and hopefully from that we can learn to develop a better vaccine,” says Staat. Ultimately, she hopes this work will lead to a universal flu vaccine that covers any strains that may emerge.The vaccine development ecosystemBuilding a successful combination of research and children’s healthcare requires more than understanding the science. Thomas Boat, who is director of Cincinnati Children’s CF (cystic fibrosis) WELL Program as well as former chair of pediatrics and head of the research foundation, points out that much of the hospital’s success comes from having leaders from Cincinnati-based businesses on its board. “They insisted that good business practices had to be married to good research and clinical practice, and that you grow because you have better products,” Boat says.Developing those products depends on personnel. “For our leadership, we look to recruit the best people in the country for our programmes and give them enough resources to create teams that contribute across the whole spectrum, from basic science to clinical research,” Boat says. “Those teams drive clinical care innovation and improvement at Cincinnati Children’s that reaches through our community and around the world.”Albert Sabin (pictured) developed his oral polio vaccine at Cincinnati Children's, where some of the first US clinical trials of the vaccine also took place.Credit: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical CenterAs part of that team building, Cincinnati Children’s has developed a vaccine innovation ecosystem that aims to nurture the great vaccine pioneers – the Sabins and the Bernsteins – of the future. “We have outstanding core laboratories, a strong basic and translational science community, state-of-the-art facilities, internal funding for new projects, and training opportunities for students and fellows,” says Spearman. “This creates an environment that helps us translate from basic research all the way through clinical trials.”Cincinnati Children’s is already laying the foundation for future vaccine advances. In addition to expanding research facilities, the hospital is exploring new approaches to vaccine development. Clinical trials based on systems immunology – looking at the entire innate and adaptive immune response to a pathogen – “could lead to personalized vaccines and the ability to predict the efficacy of a vaccine”, Spearman says. And the hospital’s culture of collaboration continues with a company that is using nanoparticle technology to develop a universal flu vaccine candidate, among others. As Spearman says: “We will keep working with other organizations and developing faculty who are passionate about creating the next generation of vaccines.” Learn more about the legacy of vaccine research at the Cincinnati Children’s Research Foundation and how you can be a part of this world-class team.

Here’s what to know. “Fewer people have gotten flu in the last couple of years, and that's always a little bit of a warning sign." By Dialynn Dwyer October 3, 2022 FacebookTwitterEmailEmail42 After two years of not much activity, the flu could come roaring back this year. The return of a potentially robust or even severe flu season has health experts concerned that we could finally see the arrival of a long-feared “twindemic” of COVID-19 and influenza, which would burden an already strained health care system. But flu seasons are notoriously difficult to predict. (Despite worries, a “twindemic” never emerged in recent years.)Still, headed into the 2022-2023 flu season, local infectious disease experts say there is cause for concern that this year could buck the trend. How bad could it be and why?An employee shows the new box of the flu vaccine “Vaxigrip Tetra” at French pharmaceutical company Sanofi’s laboratory in Val-de-Reuil. – LOU BENOIST/AFP via Getty ImagesWhile it’s difficult to predict how a flu season will shape up compared to prior years, one of the mechanisms health experts use for forecasting what could be seen in North America is by monitoring how influenza is circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. Advertisement:“Sometimes that’s an accurate reflection … but it doesn’t 100 percent predict what will happen here,” Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the state Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences, said. People look to countries like Australia and New Zealand to see which strains are circulating and how severe their flu season, which is typically from April to September (their winter), is. Preliminary data indicates flu cases in 2022 peaked earlier and higher in Australia than in any of the previous five seasons, and children and teens were more likely to have been affected than adults, according to a recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association. But even though the country saw a high number of cases, the impact was measured as “low to moderate” by the government. Advertisement:The number of patients hospitalized with flu also peaked early, but not higher, than in the previous five seasons, according to the publication.The early season and high volume of cases seen down under is being eyed by Dr. Erica Shenoy, associate chief of Massachusetts General Hospital’s Infection Control Unit, as a potential indicator for what we could see in Massachusetts and the Northern Hemisphere. The flu trends from recent years are also a factor.“We’ve seen very, very little flu,” she said. “And with most of society kind of back to normal activities as the cooler air sets in and people are indoors more, we would expect increases, not just in flu, but other respiratory viruses, which are circulating.”Social distancing and other COVID pandemic measures resulted in Massachusetts seeing hardly any flu in 2020, according to Madoff. Then in 2021, it was “unusual,” with influenza popping up early and late, but with not much in between.“Fewer people have gotten flu in the last couple of years, and that’s always a little bit of a warning sign because when people get the flu, they develop some immunity to it,” Madoff said. “And when they don’t get the flu, there’s less immunity around, and that’s particularly true for kids who haven’t seen very many flu seasons. So that is somewhat worrisome — that this year fewer people are going to be immune to the flu and that might tend to give us a more severe flu season.”Advertisement:The fact that many of the COVID-19 mitigation measures (like social distancing and mask mandates) that aided flu prevention in previous years are now relaxed also means more influenza could be seen this year. Those factors — relaxed pandemic measures and less immunity to the flu — are likely at least partly behind the “extra severe flu season” being seen in the Southern Hemisphere, Madoff said.“We won’t be surprised if we have more influenza in the Northern Hemisphere this year,” he said.Will we really see the long-feared ‘twindemic’?Margaret LaRaviere gets an influenza vaccine during a September event hosted by the Chicago Department of Public Health. – Scott Olson/Getty ImagesMadoff said it is possible that the flu season could be worse, either in severity or by the numbers, than COVID this year, given that there’s probably less immunity for influenza because of the last few years. The state epidemiologist said the possibility of a “twindemic” is a concern and one that the state is watching closely. “It’s something to be aware of, and it’s a really good reason people should get vaccinated for both COVID and the flu,” he said. “There’s the new bivalent booster vaccine, for which almost everyone is eligible and should get as soon as they can. And also, every year, it’s time for a flu vaccine, for everyone six months of age and older.”Advertisement:The bottom line, Madoff said, is that no one wants either of the diseases to be circulating, since they both can cause severe illness and spread among close populations, like at school. Shenoy, who noted that she was asked about the possibility of a twindemic for the last two years, said it’s hard to say whether it could emerge this year. “Each year we have lots of people who could be vaccinated for flu, who just choose not to,” she said. “And so if we have a combination of an earlier flu season, a more robust flu season, less immunity from prior exposure the last two years, and add to that perhaps not as good vaccination as we would like, then we could certainly see a more impactful flu season.” She pointed out that in the Northeast, there continues to be “pretty substantial levels of COVID circulating.”“If flu comes back with a vengeance this year, then we’ll just have that on top of it and need to manage it,” Shenoy said. “And hopefully people will take the time over the next month or so and get vaccinated so that they’re protected.”Madoff and Shenoy agreed the concern with a twindemic is that it could cause more strain on an already burdened health care system. “Our health care system is already under a lot of stress,” Madoff said. “There are very high volumes of patients in our health care facilities already, and every flu season, even before the pandemic, the flu season always stretched capacity in our health care system. So we see this every winter that there are more people hospitalized during the flu season, so we won’t be surprised at all to see if that happens again — and that’s adding to volumes already caused by COVID.”Advertisement:Preventing a swamping of the health care system is another important reason for people to get their flu vaccine and COVID booster, the doctors said.The question of how viral interference — a phenomenon where contracting one virus reduces the risk of being infected with another — could factor into the 2022-2023 season remains to be seen. Madoff said viral interference may have been a factor for seeing less flu during the omicron surge last year.But while he said it can be difficult to get two viruses at the same time, it does happen. “We are seeing some people do get co-infections with multiple viruses, and that’s particularly dangerous,” he said. “That’s something that can cause more severe disease. And so while viral interference is something our body uses to protect us from getting a second viral infection, it can still happen. You can get viral co-infections, and those infections can be more severe.”What should you do?Both Madoff and Shenoy stressed the best thing you can do to protect against the flu season — no matter how it shapes up — is to get vaccinated. It’s important every year, but Madoff said given the increased risk of seeing a more severe season this year, it is even more essential. He recommended rolling up both sleeves and getting your flu shot along with your COVID booster, one in each arm, at the same time.“This is the time to get a flu vaccine,” he said last week. “Normally we really urge people to get vaccinated in October. That way their immunity is up before the flu season hits. We’re already starting to see some flu activity in southern states, which is where it typically begins. Texas, Georgia are already seeing some upticks in their influenza rates. And we won’t be at all surprised to see it come here.”Advertisement:Since both flu and COVID are expected this year, and both viruses have symptoms that can’t always be distinguished, Madoff said it is important for people to stay home if they’re sick to prevent spreading the diseases. People should also get tested if they have a respiratory infection, both for COVID-19 and the flu, he said.Shenoy said if you do develop symptoms of the flu or COVID-19 to get in touch with your doctor about potential treatment. “If you’re a patient who’s at high risk for severe disease, we can provide treatment, even without a flu test if you’re at high risk for complications and clinically it appears that you have flu,” she said. “So people should definitely be in touch with their physicians if they are concerned that they have the flu.”Those who are typically most severely affected by the flu are people over the age of 65, pregnant women, and young children, particularly under the age of 6. Children under the age of 2 are at even more risk for severe complications from the flu. Shenoy urged parents to get started on getting their littles vaccinated, particularly if it’s their first season, since they will need multiple shots. “You want to get started on that as soon as you can,” she said. “I know some pediatrician offices don’t have it yet, but you should be checking in to see if it’s available to get started on getting vaccinated.”Advertisement:Madoff said this year, for the first time, the Centers for Disease Control is also recommending people over the age of 65 to get either the high dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine, which induce more of an immune response and offer better protection for the most vulnerable populations. “Really everyone should get a flu shot,” Madoff said. “And the reason is not just to protect yourself, but to protect people around you. So if you don’t get the flu, you won’t give it to your elderly parent or grandparent or your immunocompromised neighbor.” The state epidemiologist noted that Massachusetts has a trend of doing well with vaccination rates, both for COVID and for the flu.“We want everybody to keep up the good work,” he said.

She is joined by Kenneth Anderson of North Carolina State University and Dan Hougentogler of Hougentogler Enterprises. Philip Gruber Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link OCEAN CITY, Md. — The avian influenza outbreak has elevated interest in a controversial depopulation method that, done right, might strike a balance between efficiency and animal welfare.Ventilation shutdown was used during the last major avian influenza outbreak in 2015, but it has been much more common during this year’s outbreak, which has hit more than 200 commercial poultry houses nationwide.Researchers and veterinary officials discussed the role for the practice Oct. 4 at the National Meeting on Poultry Health, Processing and Live Production. Ventilation shutdown involves sealing up the house, creating a low-oxygen environment in which the birds die. Many animal welfare activists deplore the process, saying it causes the birds prolonged suffering.And indeed, simply closing the ventilation system doesn’t work very well at killing the birds.“Physiologically it doesn’t work, and it’s not proper,” said Kenneth Anderson, a poultry science professor at North Carolina State University.As a result, the process is generally sped up with heat and humidity, and is called Ventilation Shutdown Plus. Until Anderson took up the topic a few years ago, scant information was available on how to do ventilation shutdown well — to kill the birds quickly so that the virus stops reproducing and, crucially, to limit the birds’ suffering.The poultry industry pushed for Anderson to take on the project, in part because other depopulation methods like foaming and gassing aren’t very good for cage houses.The first thing Anderson found was the main existing guidance on ventilation shutdown, from 2009, was impractical. It called for providing water to the birds during ventilation shutdown, but the birds were able to cool themselves enough through evaporation that they survived.Anderson also found that as birds begin to die, the loss of body heat lowered the temperature in the house. Simply getting the building to the recommended minimum of 104 degrees wouldn’t keep conditions right.Since then, Anderson has found that each type of poultry responds differently to ventilation shutdown. Under ideal conditions, laying hens go unconscious within 30 minutes and spend two-thirds of the depopulation period unconscious. Turkeys barely go unconscious before dying, he said.Why Ventilation ShutdownVentilation Shutdown Plus is currently not the first choice for depopulating birds.The American Veterinary Medical Association’s preferred methods are suffocating the birds with foam or a gas like carbon dioxide. To use Ventilation Shutdown Plus, the farm must show that other options are not workable.Depopulation is the killing of a population of animals in response to a disease outbreak (or another emergency, such as a natural disaster). Animal welfare is considered as much as possible, but the emphasis is on speed to prevent the multiplication of virus particles that could infect other farms.Farm-to-farm transmission, a serious issue in 2015, has been rare this year, and that might be only partly because of increased biosecurity.“The major difference is rapid depopulation,” said Julie Gauthier, assistant director for poultry health at USDA Veterinary Services. “We have eliminated that source of virus, which is the live bird, extremely rapidly in this outbreak.”Ventilation Shutdown Plus has been a much more common depopulation method than in 2015, in part because bulk shipments of carbon dioxide can’t be obtained within the 24 to 48 hours after the flagging of the outbreak that USDA wants depopulation to happen.With increased use of Ventilation Shutdown Plus during this year’s avian influenza outbreak, depopulation is taking half the time it did in 2015, Gauthier said.Depopulating turkeys houses now takes a day and a half. Layer farms now take a week.“We’ve been able to limit the suffering of millions of birds by using this method,” Gauthier said. Kenneth Anderson, a poultry science professor at North Carolina State University, speaks Oct. 4, 2022, at the National Meeting on Poultry Health, Processing and Live Production. Philip Gruber Change Could Be ComingThough it’s a second choice at the moment, Ventilation Shutdown Plus might not stay that way.Next year the American Veterinary Medical Association plans to start revising its depopulation guidance, which provides the technical background for USDA’s depopulation policy. The process will take 18 months or more.If the panel of veterinarians doing the revision makes Ventilation Shutdown Plus a preferred depopulation method, on par with foaming and gassing, USDA would no longer require field teams to document extenuating circumstances before using the protocol, Gauthier said.If, on the other hand, the panel deems Ventilation Shutdown Plus to be unacceptable, flocks killed with that method would not qualify for federal indemnity, she said.The panel’s work is designed to be entirely scientific, said Cia Johnson, director of the animal welfare division at the American Veterinary Medical Association. The association will solicit comments on the draft document from its members but does not accept lobbying from outside entities like politicians, industry or activists.The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture last week asked USDA to reconsider its stance with an eye to expanding use of Ventilation Shutdown Plus.The best practices for the procedure will likely continue to develop as Anderson proceeds with his research. He is preparing to study using plentiful nitrogen gas as an alternative to less available carbon dioxide.USDA has also learned from the instances when ventilation shutdown was used this year.“When it’s done well, it’s very quick,” Gauthier said. “When it’s done poorly, we’ve needed to step in and say, ‘Stop. Let’s back up and get Plan B going.’”Even if technical advancements make Ventilation Shutdown Plus a less unpleasant experience for birds, it’s not clear if animal welfare activists will be satisfied. Their displeasure is never far from the minds of the people who work on Ventilation Shutdown Plus.Johnson has an email filter to manage the hundreds of protestor messages she gets. Anderson keeps a file of the hate mail he has received, though he said he’s most annoyed when people threaten the technicians who work in his lab.“I wouldn’t do the research I’m doing now 10 years ago because of family,” Anderson said. “But now my children are grown. They’re on their own. I don’t worry about them as much.”Have a PlanNo matter the method used, having a depopulation plan can help a farm take organized and swift action after an avian influenza infection.In Minnesota and Iowa, the states hit hardest by the 2015 avian influenza outbreak, it’s common for farmers to have such plans ready to go. Elsewhere, Gauthier said, few farmers appear to have thought about writing such a plan.“I think there’s a general perception that the cavalry is coming, and I can tell you that the cavalry is not coming. Folks need to take care of themselves for at least the first 72 hours,” Gauthier said.Anderson said the companies he works with in North Carolina generally have depopulation plans, in part because the state that has seen its share of hurricanes.The American Veterinary Medical Association offers a decision tree that farms can use to evaluate their options, Johnson said.

More than 2,600 outbreaks have been reported among domesticated flocks, as well as more than 3,500 cases in wild birds from 37 European countries, according to the latest overview of the epidemic from European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).“I’m a scientist by training, and like all scientists, I’m used to taking a measured approach and don’t take the language I use lightly,” Jeff Knott, director of policy for the UK conservation charity, the RSPB, tells National Geographic. “But the severity of the situation and scale of the impact is unprecedented and very, very scary. It’s a huge crisis that could turn into a catastrophe unless we get ahead of it.”See “Avian Flu Case Numbers Soar in Europe”The strain, a clade of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza called 2.3.4.4b that emerged in the early 2010s, usually follows a seasonal cycle, with infections detected in winter and case numbers dropping off by summer. This year, however, things were different. Mass deaths of seabirds in spring foreshadowed a record-breaking summer, with the number of outbreaks from June to September five times higher in 2022 than during the same period in 2021, The Guardian reports. And for the first time, the virus spread along migration routes to North America, the EFSA states in a news release.“Unfortunately we expect the number of cases to continue to rise over the coming months as migratory birds return to the UK, bringing with them further risk of disease that can spread into our kept flocks," Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief veterinary officer, says in a statement.The scale of the epidemic has experts concerned that the infection has become an endemic, year-round risk to birds, Reuters reports. According to Knott, more than 60 species of birds, including raptors, have tested positive for the virus, as have some wild mammals. In the US and Canada, infections have been detected in marine mammals and terrestrial carnivores, the EFSA notes in its overview, raising concerns that the virus “may adapt further to mammals.”See “Bird Flu Hits US Hard”Still, according to the EFSA, the risk to the general public’s health remains low, and the risk from consuming poultry is “negligible.” Those working with birds are at increased risk of exposure and should continue to take precautions, director of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Andrea Ammon tells the BBC. “Vigilance is needed to identify infections with influenza viruses as early as possible and to inform risk assessments and public health action,” she adds.See “Predicting Future Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks”CDC (PDF VERSION)ShareKeywordsavian fluavian influenzabird flubird populationschickenscullingepidemicfluH5N1H5N1 virusinfectioninfectious diseaseinfluenzamigrationnutshelloutbreakpoultrypublic healthvirologyviruszoologyMeet the AuthorChristie Wilcox, PhDChristie is a seasoned science journalist and cell and molecular biology PhD; her debut book Venomous: How Earth’s Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry, received widespread acclaim.

Unfortunately, it was brought to us through animal surrenders and we are now dealing with the aftermath."The Humane Education Society says canine influenza spreads through:Direct contact.Coughing, barking, and sneezing.Contaminated objects such as clothing, kennel surfaces, bowls, collars and leashes.People handling and moving between infected and non-infected dogs.Symptoms range from mild to severe: persistent coughing, sneezing, nasal or eye discharge, lethargy and reduced appetite and fever.To prevent canine influenza, HES recommends:Talking to your veterinarian about you're dog's risk of exposure and if the canine influenza vaccine is right for them.Avoid exposing your dog to sick dogs,If there's an outbreak in your area, avoid taking your dog to places where other dogs gather.If your dog shows signs of illness, isolate them from other dogs and take them to the vet.Wash your hands after handling any dog.Don't share equipment or toys between sick and healthy dogs.HES is still conducting adoptions and say these animals deserve to have a home where they can be free from the threat of canine influenza or recover comfortably in a loving home environment.If the dog you would like to adopt is one who has canine influenza, HES will walk you through it and give you the medication to make the pup healthy again.Marissa Schulman is the Medical Director at Riverview Animal Hospital.Schulman says the canine disease is spreading rapidly but there are precautions you can take.Keep your dog at home and maybe not board them. Maybe not go to doggy daycare or go to the dog park. It is probably not a bad idea to limit that exposure, says Schulman.Dr. Schulman says the canine influenza vaccine is on backorder. So in the mean time she recommends you call your vet to check availability.Tuesday wewent to Barkmore Pet Hotel & Daycare to speak with the owner Heather Frost about this outbreak.It's hitting so hard.

Both new HPAI locations are in non-commercial mixed species flocks, and KDA is working closely with USDA–APHIS on a joint incident response. KDA officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on both properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Find guidance on biosecurity on the KDA Division of Animal Health webpage at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza. Going forward, any additional confirmed cases will be shared directly with local communities and announced on the KDA Avian Influenza webpage, rather than through a statewide news release. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds. This outbreak has seen illness and mortality in a wider scope of bird species than past outbreaks, including wild and domestic waterfowl. Attentively monitor your birds for symptoms of HPAI which include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren’t showing other symptoms. If these symptoms are observed in your birds, immediately contact your veterinarian. If you don’t have a regular veterinarian, contact KDA’s Division of Animal Health office toll-free at 833-765-2006. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. Birds and eggs from the infected flock will not enter the food system. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 ˚F is recommended as a general food safety precaution. As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest avian influenza surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations and live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations. For more information about HPAI, including current status of the confirmed cases in other states as well as more information about biosecurity for your flock, go to KDA’s avian influenza webpage at agriculture.ks.gov/AvianInfluenza or call KDA at 833-765-2006.

After flu hit historically low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be poised for a comeback. The main clue: A nasty flu season just ended in Australia. While there’s no way to predict if the U.S. will be as hard-hit, “last year we were going into flu season not knowing if flu was around or not. This year we know flu is back,” said influenza specialist Richard Webby of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Annual flu shots are recommended starting with 6-month-old babies. Flu is most dangerous for people 65 and older, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health problems including heart and lung diseases. Here’s what to know: Revved-up shots for seniors As people get older, their immune system doesn’t respond as strongly to standard flu vaccination. This year, people 65 or older are urged to get a special kind for extra protection. There are three choices. Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok each contain higher doses of the main anti-flu ingredient. The other option is Fluad Adjuvanted, which has a regular dosage but contains a special ingredient that helps boost people’s immune response. Seniors can ask what kind their doctor carries. But most flu vaccinations are given in pharmacies and some drugstore websites, such as CVS, automatically direct people to locations offering senior doses if their birth date shows they qualify. WATCH: White House Monkeypox Response Team says vaccine appears effective Webby advised making sure older relatives and friends know about the senior shots, in case they’re not told when they seek vaccination. “They should at least ask, ‘Do you have the shots that are better for me?’” Webby said. “The bottom line is they do work better” for this age group. If a location is out of senior-targeted doses, it’s better to get a standard flu shot than to skip vaccination, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All flu vaccines in the U.S. — including types for people younger than 65 — are “quadrivalent,” meaning they guard against four different flu strains. Younger people have choices, too, including shots for those with egg allergies and a nasal spray version called FluMist. Why flu experts are on alert Australia just experienced its worst flu season in five years and what happens in Southern Hemisphere winters often foreshadows what Northern countries can expect, said Dr. Andrew Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. And people have largely abandoned masking and distancing precautions that earlier in the pandemic also helped prevent the spread of other respiratory bugs like the flu. “This poses a risk especially to young children who may not have had much if any previous exposure to influenza viruses prior to this season,” Pekosz added. NEWS WRAP: New York City lifting vaccine mandate for private sector workers “This year we will have a true influenza season like we saw before the pandemic,” said Dr. Jason Newland, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. He said children’s hospitals already are seeing an unusual early spike in other respiratory infections including RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and worries flu likewise will strike earlier than usual — like it did in Australia. The CDC advises a flu vaccine by the end of October but says they can be given any time during flu season. It takes about two weeks for protection to set in. The U.S. expects 173 million to 183 million doses this year. And yes, you can get a flu shot and an updated COVID-19 booster at the same time — one in each arm to lessen soreness. Flu shots of the future The companies that make the two most widely used COVID-19 vaccines now are testing flu shots made with the same technology. One reason: When influenza mutates, the recipes of so-called mRNA vaccines could be updated more quickly than today’s flu shots, most of which are made by growing influenza virus in chicken eggs. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are recruiting 25,000 healthy U.S. adults to receive either its experimental influenza shot or a regular kind, to see how effective the new approach proves this flu season. Rival Moderna tested its version in about 6,000 people in Australia, Argentina and other countries during the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season and is awaiting results.

A 2021 study from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that adults who got vaccinated were 26 percent less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and 31 percent less likely to die from the flu compared to those who were unvaccinated. There seems to be protection from illness even when vaccines aren’t perfectly matched to the strain of flu virus circulating (which happens because the shot is formulated months in advance). ﻿ But evidence suggests other payoffs beyond defense from fever, fatigue, chills and aches. “People don’t really appreciate the other potential benefits of flu shots,” says Michelle Barron, M.D., senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth in Aurora, Colorado. “It’s actually arming your immune system to fend off other problems.” Here are four unexpected ways a flu vaccine can benefit the body and the brain. 1. A boost for the brain? Previous research has suggested that flu vaccines may protect the brain from dementia, and an August 2022 study from the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston makes the case even stronger. This study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, compared more than 47,000 people age 65 and older who were vaccinated against flu to a similar group of nearly 80,000 people who were not vaccinated. The findings: Those who got a flu shot were 40 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease over a four-year period. “We weren’t actually expecting it to be that high,” says study coauthor Avram S. Bukhbinder, M.D., now a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT Bukhbinder has several theories for the vaccination’s potential effects on the brain. Perhaps by preventing the flu, the shot quells inflammation that can lead to harmful brain changes. His most intriguing hypothesis is that vaccines alter the brain’s overall defenses. “There’s good evidence that when we get these vaccines, they help us make antibodies to the specific pathogen — the influenza virus,” he says. “But they may also modify the immune system in such a way that it’s better at either cleaning up amyloid and tau [the proteins responsible for the plaques and tangles that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s] or by preventing these proteins from building up in the first place.” 2. The shot is linked to a stronger heart A history of heart disease or a stroke can make flu more likely and more dangerous. In addition, flu can be a trigger for heart attacks and strokes in people at high risk for them. According to a 2018 Canadian study, people who got the flu were six times more likely to have a heart attack within a week of getting the diagnosis. And Columbia University researchers saw a significant jump in strokes in the month after flu cases, according to July 2022 research published in the American Heart Association’s journal Stroke.

A 2022 study led by the University of Toronto that incorporated six previous studies covering more than 9,000 patients showed that people who received a flu vaccine had a 34 percent lower risk of a major cardiovascular event in the 12 months following vaccination. Higher-risk vaccinated individuals with acute coronary syndrome — a group of conditions that abruptly stop blood flow to the heart — had a 45 percent risk reduction of major cardiovascular event, and a 56 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease in the year after they got the shot, according to the findings, which appear in JAMA Network Open. ﻿ How the flu shot protects the heart isn’t fully known, but it may have to do with the plaques that build up on artery walls of people with heart disease. The body’s immune response to the flu creates inflammation that is believed to disrupt these fat deposits, causing blood clots that may trigger heart attacks and strokes. “The vaccine may interact with the body’s immune system and inflammatory processes to help stabilize plaques that might be present in blood vessels, thus preventing these plaques from rupturing and causing further problems,” says lead study author Bahar Be﻿hrouzi Homa. ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT 3. It could curb complications from other chronic conditions Like heart disease, some chronic health conditions make you more prone to flu and its harmful effects. For people with diabetes or chronic lung diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an annual flu shot is one of the best ways to avoid aggravating these underlying health problems. Evidence comes from researchers at the University of Minnesota Medical School and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis who followed people ag﻿e﻿ 65 and older in a large health plan who had respiratory diseases over three flu seasons. Their findings, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, show that patients who got vaccinated were 52 percent less likely to be hospitalized for pneumonia or flu and 70 percent less likely to die from these diseases during that period. Similarly, a UK study showed that when people with diabetes got the jab, it reduced their chances of being hospitalized by almost 80 percent during the two flu seasons that were studied.﻿ 4. It may make for a longer life The flu shot might even increase your life span. The evidence: In a recent study out of Toronto, researchers looked at more than 54,000 people age 65 and older who had been tested for the flu between 2010 and 2016. They found that those who received the flu shot were less likely to die from any cause over the multiyear period. “In large databases from Ontario, we found that influenza vaccines may reduce the chances of older adults dying by as much as 34 percent,” says study author Jeff Kwong, M.D., associate director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto. Flu shots likely protect older adults from dying simply by preventing the infection in the first place and by preventing those who do get infected from getting very sick from the virus, Kwong says. While getting the jab is critical, Kwong also recommends wearing face masks indoors, washing hands and avoiding sick people during flu season to prevent complications from both flu and other respiratory illnesses that tend to cause problems in the fall and winter, such as COVID-19﻿. “In many places in the world, when mask-wearing was made mandatory, influenza basically disappeared,” Kwong says. “Vaccines should be thought of as one layer of protection, and the more layers one has, the better.” ﻿ ﻿Editor’s Note: This story, first published Oct. 3, 2022, has been updated to reflect new information.﻿ %{postComment}% Beth Howard is a North Carolina–based health and lifestyle writer.

Continue Cancel Health 7 Risk Factors That Make Flu More Deadly What to know if you have heart disease, diabetes, cancer and more By Michelle Crouch, AARP Comments En español Published October 03, 2022 vitapix, nimis69, Peter Dazeley / Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn COVID-19 may still be top of mind — along with other virus-caused illnesses that are popping up, like monkeypox and polio — but health experts warn it’s just as important to guard against the regular seasonal flu this year, especially if you’re in a group that’s at higher risk for severe or deadly complications. A big reason: Experts worry the flu season could be worse than normal this year, based on trends in the Southern Hemisphere. “We always look to the Southern Hemisphere because they have winter during our summer, and Australia had a very substantial influenza season,” says William Schaffner, M.D., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. “There is not always a 1-to-1 correlation, but I’m concerned.” And while anyone can have a bad bout of flu, certain groups are more likely to experience dangerous complications, ranging from pneumonia and dehydration to heart failure and death. Here are seven common factors that put you at risk for a severe case of flu, and what you can do — beyond getting that all-important flu shot — to blunt, or eliminate, flu’s worst effects. ﻿1. Risk factor: You’re age 65 or older Older adults are the demographic most affected by both flu and COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 70 to 85 percent of flu-related deaths and up to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. About half of adults age 65-plus also have a second risk factor that makes them vulnerable, according to National Foundation for Infectious Diseases estimates. But even healthy older adults are at risk, because “your immune system simply is not as robust as it was when you were 25 years old,” Schaffner says. In addition, typical flu symptoms don’t always show up in older adults, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment. “The most important symptom that may not be present in older people is fever,” Schaffner says. “People can develop a cough, feel weak, and they may even get confused, but they don’t have a fever, so family members don’t think they have the flu.” 2. Risk factor: You have heart disease or a history of stroke Researchers in recent years have uncovered a concerning link between the flu and heart complications. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT A CDC study published in 2020, for instance, found that 1 out of 8 older patients hospitalized with flu had a serious cardiac event (and the study looked at a big group of patients — 80,000 overall). Another study, published in 2018, found that you are six times as likely to have a heart attack during the week after being diagnosed with influenza as at other times. In both studies, a history of heart disease and stroke boosted the likelihood of a sudden heart complication. Doctors think the flu triggers an inflammatory response in your body, which in turn can create dangerous clotting in your blood vessels. “It’s like collateral damage in a war,” Schaffner says. “For up to a month after you recover from the flu, your body’s inflammatory response is still ginned up and having an effect on your body, putting you at increased risk for heart attack and stroke.” The flu vaccine is key here. In a recent study, adults over 50 who got a flu vaccine during a hospitalization had a 28 percent lower risk of a heart attack over the next year. They also had a 47 percent lower risk of a mini stroke, an 85 percent lower risk of cardiac arrest and a 73 percent lower risk of overall death. 3. Risk factor: You have diabetes Diabetes weakens your immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off disease, says Joseph Gastaldo, M.D., system medical director of infectious diseases at OhioHealth in Columbus. Influenza can also make it more difficult to control your blood sugar levels: They may rise in response to the infection, or they may fall if you don’t feel like eating while you’re sick. Meanwhile, your symptoms can make it difficult for you to recognize the signs of high or low blood sugar. “It’s very easy for diabetics [who get the flu] to become dehydrated or have issues with their kidneys,” Gastaldo says. Diabetics are three times as likely as other people to die of flu-related complications, and six times as likely to be hospitalized. The good news is, getting a flu vaccine reduces your risk of hospitalization by up to 79 percent, studies show. 4. Risk factor: You have a lung disease or asthma If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, the flu can cause your airways to swell and become blocked with mucus, making it harder to breathe. If you have asthma, even if it’s controlled, the virus will likely inflame your airways and trigger asthma attacks. Adults with both COPD and asthma are at greater risk of developing pneumonia or another respiratory infection as a result of the flu. You can end up hospitalized or with severe and permanent damage to your lungs. Getting the flu vaccine can help. It’s associated with a 38 percent reduction in influenza-related hospitalizations among patients with COPD, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Chest. 5. Risk factor: You have a chronic condition or a weak immune system In addition to things like heart and lung disease, many other conditions increase your chance of a poor outcome from flu. Those include liver disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, metabolic disorders and neurological conditions. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT Some chronic conditions leave you vulnerable because they weaken your immune system or require you to take medicine that does, Gastaldo says. “A lot of older adults today take immunosuppressants for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or cirrhosis,” Gastaldo says. “And there are more people living with transplants — heart, kidney, bone marrow — who take those types of medications.” Immunocompromised patients may not get a fever with the flu, so it’s important to pay attention to even mild symptoms. They are at especially high risk for a secondary infection like pneumonia, according to the CDC. 6. Risk factor: You’ve had cancer Many cancer treatments suppress the immune system, so it may not be surprising that cancer patients are three to five times as likely to be hospitalized for influenza as the general population. But studies show you also face a greater risk if you’ve had cancer in the past, especially leukemia or lymphoma. In addition, some types of chemotherapy alter your immune system for the long term, making you more vulnerable to a severe case of the flu. If you’re undergoing cancer treatment now, the American Cancer Society recommends talking to your oncologist about the best time to get the flu shot — but do get it. In a 2019 study that analyzed data on more than 26,000 cancer patients, those who got a flu shot were significantly less likely to get the flu and to be hospitalized from the virus. 7. Risk factor: You have obesity Anyone with a body mass index (or BMI) greater than 40 is at increased risk of flu complications, according to the CDC, even adults with obesity who have no other health issues. It’s unclear exactly why obesity is a factor, Gastaldo says, but it may be because the vaccine is less effective in people with excess weight, because obesity itself impairs the immune response or because the extra weight makes it more difficult to take the deep breaths necessary to aerate your lungs. Studies show people with obesity also carry the flu virus for longer and are more likely to spread it to others. Editor’s note: This article was published on Oct. 19, 2020. It was updated in October 2022 with new information about the 2022-2023 flu season. How to protect yourself from flu if you’re at higher risk Two vaccines you need, and why this season you shouldn’t hesitate to call a doctor If you’re in a high-risk group, you can strengthen your immune system by eating healthy, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. In addition, the precautions you have practiced for two years to guard against the coronavirus — handwashing, wearing a mask and staying 6 feet away from others — will help protect you from the flu. But experts agree that the three most important steps you can take to reduce your risk from influenza are these: Get your annual flu shot. Being vaccinated is by far the most effective way to protect yourself from the flu. The vaccine is safe for nearly everyone over 6 months old, and study after study show that it significantly reduces the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalization and death. This year, the CDC says ﻿﻿older adults should specifically ask for the high-dose vaccine or one with an ingredient called an adjuvant because they help boost the immune response. And the best time to get the shot is September or October, the CDC says. Get the pneumonia vaccine. The most common complication of the flu is pneumonia, and you can help guard against it and other dangerous infections by getting the pneumonia shot. The CDC recommends that all people over 65 get the pneumonia vaccine. Contact your doctor at the first sign of symptoms. Getting in touch with your medical provider right away is especially important because COVID-19 and the flu share many of the same symptoms, so your doctor may want to test you to see which illness you have. The good news: Both diseases can be treated with antiviral medications that can keep your symptoms from progressing to a more severe state. However, these drugs are most effective if they are taken shortly after symptom onset. “We want you to have your antenna up really high for symptoms,” Gastaldo says. “If you have more trouble breathing, less energy, a low-grade fever, shortness of breath or if you’re a diabetic and your blood sugars are all of a sudden very high, don’t wait to call.” %{postComment}% ​Michelle Crouch is a contributing writer who has covered health and personal finance for some of the nation’s top consumer publications.

But it warned that figure could be an underestimate.While there have been no recorded cases of human transmission in the EU, there was one case in south-west England in January.But Andrea Ammon, director of the ECDC, warned those working in farming and the animal sector were still at "increased risk of exposure" and called for employers to improve biosecurity and health and safety measures."Vigilance is needed to identify infections with influenza viruses as early as possible and to inform risk assessments and public health action," she added.More on this storyWater birds on Broads may have died from bird fluPublished1 October 2022Bird flu virus out of control warn farmersPublished29 September 2022Avian flu having 'devastating' impact on seabirdsPublished26 September 2022High levels of bird flu very concerning says expertPublished26 September 2022Fourth case of bird flu found in county in a weekPublished25 September 2022Top storiesStarmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with MacronPublished35 minutes agoHouse vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsarPublished1 hour agoEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south dividePublished2 hours agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south divideâCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Energy smart meter issues creating north-south divide2House vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsar3Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron4âCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâ5Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'6âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director7Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards8Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale9Starmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with Macron10Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacksBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

Design by Lane Rozin Phifer Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save When Watkins Health Center announced they would be hosting several free flu clinics, they added the fact that COVID-19 booster shots would also be available at that time.Dr. Dana Hawkinson, medical director of Infection and Prevention Control at the University of Kansas Health System, said that their official recommendation was to get both shots at the same time.“That is even a recommendation by the CDC,” Hawkinson said. “You can get both of them at the same time.”Testing and questioning of the vaccine's effects on each other arose when COVID vaccines for those under 18 were still being tested, according to Hawkinson.“There are no safety signals that would show us that it’s more dangerous or there’s higher levels that have side effects at all,” Hawkinson said.Hawkinson said patients could even get two or three vaccines at the same time and that the question of the vaccine’s effects on each other was brought up last year.“Getting these two vaccines together is not going to reduce any efficiency of the vaccine,” Hawkinson said.Hawkinson said that determining when the best time to get the flu shot depends a lot on personal factors, such as how old a person is, whether they are traveling or staying home.“The other component is to understand the influenza activity in your community,” Hawkinson said. “We take a lot of our cues from the southern hemisphere because they go through influenza season six months before we do.”There are too many factors to accurately predict when influenza will begin to affect a certain community, according to Hawkinson. Usually, they will not see flu activity until January and some years it begins in November. However, Hawkinson said that members of the community should get their flu shot towards the end of October.“If you can push out the influenza vaccine further, say to late October or early November, you will probably have more of that maximal immunity for the duration of the influenza season,” Hawkinson said.Watkins Health Center will be giving out both flu shots and COVID-19 boosters at the clinics. To get a booster, it must be two months since ones' last shot. You can find a schedule and more details on the Watkins’ website.Matthew Petillo contributed to this report.

Marko Geber/Getty Common flu shot side effects can include muscle soreness, fever, and headaches. If you get the nasal spray, side effects may also include a runny nose, wheezing, or sore throat. Seek medical attention if you have trouble breathing after a flu shot, which could indicate an allergic reaction.

Advertisement The flu shot has some side effects like soreness around the injection site and headaches, but these are short-lived and should not deter you from getting vaccinated.On rare occasions, the flu shot could trigger an allergic reaction that needs to be treated by a doctor. Here's what you need to know about the side effects of the flu shot and how to tell the difference between a normal response and an allergic reaction. Advertisement Common flu shot side effects Not everyone has side effects from their flu shot. But some of the most common side effects of the flu vaccine can include: 1. Soreness or swelling at the site of injectionYou might experience soreness, swelling, redness, or a slight rash at the site of your flu shot. To avoid arm soreness, try taking ibuprofen (Advil) two hours before you receive your vaccination. Advertisement 2. Mild feverA mild fever (less than 101°F) can be a normal response to your flu shot. As with other side effects, it's best to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help manage these symptoms. 3. Muscle aches Soreness in the arm where you got your flu shot is expected. But it's also common to feel muscle aches throughout your body in the next day or two after your flu shot. Advertisement 4. HeadacheHeadaches are another possible side effect, and though irritating, you should not feel alarmed by these symptoms. "Headache, fever, and sore muscles are not a sign of allergic reactions," says Michael McNeil, Team Lead for Vaccine Safety Datalink at the CDC's Immunization Safety Office. "These reactions can occur as a result of the patient's immune system responding to a vaccine."Important: While some people believe you can catch influenza from the flu shot, this is not true, since the flu vaccine does not contain any active viral particles. Advertisement 5. Nausea It's also common to experience nausea, stomach pain, or an overall feeling of sickness as your immune system responds to the vaccine. Overall, these side effects typically begin shortly after injection and should only last a few days at most, according to the CDC. Advertisement Are there side effects of the flu vaccine nasal spray? Getting a nasal spray flu vaccine may help you avoid some side effects of the flu shot, like arm soreness, but it comes with its own share of side effects.Possible side effects from the nasal spray vaccine include:Runny noseWheezingSore throatHeadachesFeverNauseaNasal vaccines are safe for most individuals between the age of 2 and 49, according to the CDC. But some groups who should not get the nasal spray include:People with a weakened immune systemAdults who are 50 or olderChildren ages 2-4 who have had severe asthma within the past yearChildren ages 2-17 who are taking medications such as aspirin and salicylate-containing therapiesPregnant womenIn addition, those who should exercise an abundance of caution when receiving the nasal spray vaccine include:People over 5 with asthmaPeople with lung disease, heart disease, or diabetesPeople who currently have an acute illnessQuick tip: Find a complete list of who should avoid the nasal spray and who should take precautions on the CDC's website. Advertisement When to see a doctor about your flu shot side effects Though the side effects listed above are normal reactions to the flu vaccine, it's important to monitor your response to the vaccine to make sure that you are not having an allergic reaction.Though allergic reactions are rare — they occur in an estimated 1.3 of every 1 million vaccinations — they can be serious. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction to a flu vaccine include:Trouble breathingHoarseness or wheezingPallor/palenessWeaknessFast heartbeatDizzinessAccording to McNeil, these symptoms usually occur "within a few minutes to a few hours after receiving the shot and they require immediate medical evaluation and treatment."The flu shot, like all vaccines, contains several components that can cause an allergic reaction. Most allergic reactions are caused by an allergy to egg protein, gelatin, or other additives in the vaccine. While the flu shot contains trace amounts of egg, research has shown that most people with mild egg allergies can receive influenza vaccines. Advertisement Serious non-allergic reactionsIn extremely rare cases, the influenza vaccine can trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder that causes paralysis. It is estimated that only one-or-two individuals develop GBS for every 1 million people vaccinated. GBS can occur days or weeks after a vaccination, and is experienced as an acute muscle weakness, difficulty controlling eye muscles, or difficulty swallowing. Anyone presenting these symptoms should contact their doctor. Advertisement Insider's takeawayThe flu vaccine — as a shot or nasal spray — can come with side effects including headache, fever, and nausea. However, it's still important to get vaccinated each year."Flu vaccines have a good safety record," says McNeil. "Hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccines over the past 50 years, and there has been extensive research supporting the safety of flu vaccines."Influenza is a dangerous disease, particularly for the young, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems. Getting a flu shot will reduce your chance of catching the disease yourself, or passing it to those that are vulnerable. While there are potential side effects, they are minor and short-lived for most people and should not influence your plans to get a flu shot.

Study: Intranasal delivery of NS1-deleted influenza virus vectored COVID-19 vaccine restrains the SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory response. Image Credit: WESTOCK PRODUCTIONS/Shutterstock *Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Background Nearly 38 currently used COVID-19 vaccines are delivered using intramuscular injection. They confer protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly by triggering neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting viral spike (S) antigen. Mass vaccination has effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and death. However, SARS-CoV-2 uniquely displays anatomical escape in the upper respiratory tract (URT), where nAb titers are 200 to 500 times lower than in the circulation, which makes it impossible to completely block SARS-CoV-2 infection post the peak vaccine-induced immune response period is over. Furthermore, immunity escaping variants are continuously emerging yet (e.g., Omicron), and SARS-CoV-2 has several animal host reservoirs (e.g., cats, minks, deer). All these factors make SARS-CoV-2 viable to co-exist with humans for many years and pose a continuing threat. Thus, there is a need to continually develop broad-spectrum COVID-19 vaccines that work via different immune mechanisms and delivery routes. In particular, there is a greater need for vaccines that protect URT locally to respond to SARS-CoV-2 in a timelier manner. Thus, several vaccines that work via respiratory inoculation are under testing in preclinical animal experiments. For instance, an Ad-vectored trivalent intranasal COVID-19 vaccine developed by Zhou Xing et al. has shown broad-spectrum protective effects against several SARS-CoV-2 variants. With demonstrated broad-spectrum efficacy in preclinical experiments, respiratory mucosal vaccines have become an area of great interest for researchers exploring new COVID-19 vaccine candidates. About the study In the present study, researchers investigated the immune response triggered by an intranasal spray vaccine based on the non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-deleted H1N1 influenza vector carrying the gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) called dNS1-RBD. This vaccine demonstrated a good safety profile in phase I and II clinical trials but a weak peripheral immune response. It prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced pathological changes without triggering significant neutralizing antibodies, which is different from the protective mechanism of traditional vaccines. Since a vaccine could induce a protective immune mechanism via four routes, innate immunity, trained immunity, cellular immune responses covering the URT and LRT, and RBD-targeting antibodies, the researchers evaluated dNS1-RBD efficacy from all four aspects. The team used ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to explore the innate immune response elicited by dNS1-RBD. They collected 15 samples of mouse lung tissue for RNA-seq analysis. The study group comprised 12 samples from vaccinated mice, collected on 7-, 14- and 28 days post-vaccination (d.p.im). The remaining three samples from unvaccinated mice served as the control group. The team harvested lung immune cells and analyzed them at different time points by flow cytometry (FC).

They also plotted heatmaps to showcase differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the dNS1-RBD vs. the control group. Study findings The primary study finding was that dNS1-RBD vaccination helped the host maintain tissue homeostasis, which provided pathological protection against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing trained immunity with broad-spectrum antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, dNS1-RBD activated alveolar macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and remodeled the chromatin openness of these cells. Since the gene governing the anti-infection immunity of these cells remained open for several months, they remained protected against SARS-CoV-2. The dNS1-RBD vaccination also effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers by approximately 155-fold, 84-fold, and 10-fold on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Briefly, dNS1-RBD reshaped the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response pattern by training immune cells and structural cells to attenuate inflammation and confer protection. Studies have also demonstrated that intranasal immunization with attenuated Bordetella pertussis conferred protection against two influenzas A viruses, further highlighting the importance of trained immunity in non-specific protection at a higher speed. Another remarkable effect of dNS1-RBD vaccination was that it provided good protection within 24 hours. Since it used a truncated NS1, it induced faster and stronger cytokine production. These properties make dNS1-RBD a great emergency vaccine that could be administered early during an endemic outbreak to reduce the COVID-19 burden and cease onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells provide durable and broad-spectrum immune protection. They are critical for controlling respiratory viral infections and provide timely and stronger protective immunity than circulating T cells. It is of great significance in the context of asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dNS1-RBD vaccine triggered RBD-specific cellular immune responses in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and lungs on the fifth day after vaccination, which persisted for at least six months in the periphery. Conclusions The current study highlighted that dNS1-RBD-like intranasal vaccines could work as a booster in heterologous COVID-19 vaccination regimens. Although dNS1-RBD showed the limited potential of viral clearance, it favorably remodeled the immune microenvironment and trained the immune and structural cells to confer adequate protection in the respiratory tract. Furthermore, it helped maintain the immune balance between the innate immunity arm and the respiratory tissue to attenuate immune-induced tissue injury. Most importantly, it induced broad-spectrum local cellular immunity and trained immunity in the respiratory tract, which is beneficial for coping with newly emerged SARS-COV-2 variants. *Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

Adults and children as young as 6 months old are urged to get the flu shot by the end of October. Brandi Falk, M.D. at Cook Children’s Pediatrics McKinney emphasizes the importance of coming in for a flu vaccine before the flu typically starts spreading. Flu season generally extends from November through May. Shots are available now by appointment at pediatrician offices, neighborhood clinics and pharmacies. “The flu is a virus, and we actually pass it through tiny droplets that we make when we cough or sneeze or talk,” Dr. Falk said. “It's important that parents know that everyone is at risk.” Flu is a contagious respiratory infection that can cause fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, dizziness, loss of appetite, tiredness, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea or vomiting, weakness, ear pain or diarrhea. Dr. Falk pointed out that it can last two weeks or more, and it’s worse than having a cold. Sinus problems, ear infections, dehydration and difficulty breathing also can develop, potentially requiring hospitalization.“A question I get asked from parents a lot is, ‘Why do I need to do the flu vaccine?’ I tell them that it can lead to life-threatening symptoms like pneumonias and inflammation around your heart, around your brain and your muscles,” she said.In the 2021-2022 flu season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 31 pediatric deaths caused by flu. Most of those cases -- ranging in age from 2 months to 16 years -- involved at least one underlying medical condition that put those patients at higher risk for flu severity, such as asthma, heart disease or weakened immune system.Last year saw a drop in the percentage of children and teens protected against the flu. The CDC reports that 55.3% of those eligible received their flu shots, down from 57.3% previously. Dr. Falk explained a few key points: You can’t catch the flu from the flu shot. “The flu shot is an inactive vaccine. So that means that the viruses inside it are killed.”Potential side effects, usually mild, include soreness, redness or swelling in the arm or leg where the injection went in. The vaccine might also cause brief headaches, fever, nausea and muscle aches. After the vaccine, it takes two weeks to build up the antibodies that fight off the flu. That’s why it’s important to get immunized early. “By the time the flu starts getting more prevalent, you're already protected,” Dr. Falk said.It’s important for the whole family to receive a flu vaccine annually, she said. Patients can receive the vaccine in combination with other vaccines at their checkup or by scheduling a nurse visit. First-timers who are younger than age 9 will need two doses, a month apart. Kids 9 and older need only one dose.For those who want to avoid needles, the nasal spray flu vaccine might be an option. The flu mist cannot be given to children under age 2 or to people with asthma, certain chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems. Flu vaccines protect against two influenza A viruses, and two influenza B viruses. The vaccine’s composition is updated each year to protect against what is expected to be the most common viruses in circulation. In addition to vaccination, Cook Children’s recommends these hygiene practices for flu prevention:Wash hands with soap thoroughly and often, especially after using the bathroom, after coughing or sneezing, and before eating or preparing food.Never share cups and eating utensils.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then put the tissue in the trash.Cough or sneeze into your upper arm, not your hands, if a tissue isn't handy.And … If your child is sick, stay home from daycare or school. Make sure your child drinks lots of liquids, gets plenty of sleep and takes over-the-counter meds to alleviate symptoms.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There’s no guaranteed way to avoid the flu. But getting the vaccine every year can help. At Cook Children’s, we believe that flu vaccinations are the safest, easiest way to protect everyone age 6 months and older from serious flu symptoms. And a flu vaccination during pregnancy helps protect your newborn baby from flu for several months after birth.Immunizations and other services are available at Cook Children’s neighborhood clinics and primary care sites across Fort Worth and beyond.

Even 1 in 5 of those who are at higher risk for influenza-related complications say they won't get vaccinated. People who are more likely to have severe outcomes from a flu infection include those over the age of 65, pregnant people, children younger than five years old, and individuals with underlying conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."We know flu vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself and your family from flu," said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, during the NFID's conference on Tuesday.Most Americans agree. Nearly 70% believe that getting an annual flu vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, the NFID found. And yet many people remain hesitant to get their vaccine.Instead, more U.S. adults are gravitating towards masking as a form of protection against the flu. A higher percentage of Americans (58%) plan to mask at least sometimes this flu season than intend to get vaccinated.Why more Americans are skipping the flu shot — and what they're doing insteadHere are some of the top reasons adults gave for not getting vaccinated this season:41% think flu shots don't work very well 39% are concerned about the vaccine's side effects 28% say they never get the flu 24% are concerned about getting the flu from the shot 20% do not think influenza is a serious illness"With Covid, people have forgotten about influenza. This is another serious winter respiratory virus, it can do bad damage to you," William Schaffner, medical director of NFID, said at the conference. "The key to prevention is vaccination." The altered approach this flu season may be partly due to the timing of the omicron-specific booster and people's concerns with getting both the updated Covid booster and the flu shot. Just 32% of U.S. adults are very confident that it is safe to receive the vaccines at the same time, the survey shows.The CDC affirms that doing so has proven to be safe. Studies of over 450,000 people indicate that only mild symptoms are experienced after receiving the immunizations simultaneously, says Walensky, adding that, "Most of those are resolved really quite quickly."Meanwhile, choosing to get one vaccination over the other is not a wise decision, Walensky warns. It's useful to increase your body's defenses against both viruses.And, she reiterates, bundling them together is easy as well as safe: "You want to make sure you get both, and it's often more convenient to get them both at the same time."Common symptoms after receiving a Covid vaccine and flu shot at the same time typically include:Soreness at the injection site or in the arm where the shot was administeredFatigueHeadache"Flu vaccines work. For more than 50 years, hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received their vaccines," said Patricia Stinchfield, president of NFID.

Here’s what the experts say.Published: Oct. 08, 2022, 9:00 a.m.Clinicians should defer flu vaccination for symptomatic coronavirus patients until they are no longer moderately or severely ill and have completed their COVID-19 isolation period, the National Institute of Health recommends. (Staten Island Advance/Frank J. Johns)Staten Island AdvanceBy Ann Marie Barron | ABarron@siadvance.comSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — If you’ve recently tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), you’ll need to observe a short waiting period before receiving the flu vaccine, according to federal medical experts.Clinicians should defer flu vaccination for symptomatic patients with COVID-19 until these patients are no longer moderately or severely ill and have completed their COVID-19 isolation period, the National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends.And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its 2021-2022 guidance also says patients should defer until their isolation period has passed, whether or not they have symptoms, and should warn the provider if they currently have symptoms of COVID-19.The isolation period recommended for those with COVID is currently five days, beginning with the first full day after testing positive, plus an additional five days of mask wearing and social distancing, according to the CDC. If you had no symptoms, yet develop symptoms within 10 days of when you were first tested, the clock restarts at day 0 on the day of symptom onset. Those with COVID who are in a healthcare setting can receive the flu vaccine sooner, the NIH advises.The regulations are in place to protect providers, the NIH says on its website. The CDC has further guidance about when someone who has had COVID can be around others, including getting a vaccination.Yet, some vaccine providers, including CVS Pharmacy, are requiring those seeking the flu shot to wait 14 days from their last positive COVID test before scheduling a flu shot in the pharmacy. At Walgreens, there is no mention of COVID while registering for a flu shot online. The same is true at Rite Aid.TRUE FLU SEASONMedical experts are predicting a “true” flu season, like we’ve seen before the COVID-19 pandemic kept us inside, masked and socially-distanced, and they are urging all Americans to get vaccinated against the flu.Australia just experienced its worst flu season in five years. Since what happens during Southern Hemisphere winters often foreshadows what the United States can expect, medical experts are bracing for a brutal flu season this winter.And since people have largely abandoned masking and social distancing precautions that earlier in the pandemic also helped prevent the spread of other respiratory bugs like the flu, more transmission is expected, doctors warn.The United States expects 173 million to 183 million doses of flu vaccine to be distributed this year.The CDC advises all eligible people receive a flu vaccine by the end of October, but it also says the vaccine can be given any time during flu season. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine’s flu protection to set in.FLU SHOT AND COVID BOOSTERAnd yes, you can get a flu shot and an updated COVID-19 booster at the same time — one in each arm to lessen soreness.All flu vaccines in the U.S. — including types for people younger than 65 — are “quadrivalent,” meaning they guard against four different flu strains.Those over age 65, whose immune systems don’t respond as strongly to standard flu vaccination, are urged to get a vaccine offering extra protection.There are three choices. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine and Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccine each contain higher doses of the main anti-flu ingredient. The other option is Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine, which has a regular dosage but contains a special ingredient that helps boost people’s immune response.If none of the three flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group can get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead, the CDC says.Young people have choices, too, including shots for those with egg allergies and a nasal spray version called FluMist.According to the CDC, everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza. A full listing of people at Higher Risk of Developing Flu-Related Complications is available on the CDC website.REDUCES ILLNESSEven if it doesn’t prevent the flu, vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor’s offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths, the CDC says.Flu shots also are recommended for those who are pregnant and people with certain chronic health conditions.RECOMMENDED•silive.comThe Old Guy: My post-election thoughtsNov. 9, 2024, 11:00 a.m.Costco recall: Toss or return these frozen wafflesNov. 5, 2024, 10:15 a.m.The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in people 2 years through 49 years of age. People who are pregnant and people with certain medical conditions should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.There are many vaccine options to choose from.More information is available at the CDC website: Who Should and Who Should NOT Get a Flu Vaccine.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Scully and Nicole BonaccorsoOctober 06, 20221/8Arrow LeftArrow RightNurses care for victims of a Spanish influenza epidemic in tents during an outdoor fresh air cure, Lawrence, Mass., ca. 1918. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images)Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.In 1918, it is estimated that about 500 million people — or about one third of the world’s population — caught influenza, otherwise known at the time as the “Spanish Flu." It was the deadliest flu outbreak in recorded history, with between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide being killed. In the United States alone, 675,000 died and the average life expectancy fell by about 12 years between 1917 to 1918.The virus spread quickly because of World War I, with soldiers in close quarters passing the disease to one another then traveling far and wide, spreading the disease throughout the world. There was no vaccine at the time to protect against infection (the first licensed flu vaccine didn’t appear in the US until the 1940s) and there was no antiviral medication to treat it once infected. All that people could do to try to avoid catching the disease was wash their hands, isolate themselves, avoid public settings, and quarantine the already-sick. Citizens were also ordered to wear masks to try to slow the spread of the disease, and many schools, theaters and businesses shut down. In New York City, an ordinance was passed to fine or jail people that failed to cover their coughs. AdvertisementThe first wave of the 1918 pandemic hit in the spring and was considered relatively mild, but later that fall, a second, much deadlier wave hit. Some victims died within hours or days of developing symptoms. Hospitals became so overloaded with patients that schools, private homes, and other buildings had to be converted into makeshift, emergency substitutes. There was also a doctor shortage back home due to the war, so medical students sometimes stepped in to try to treat patients. In some places, so many people got sick that there weren’t enough farmers to harvest crops or enough workers to collect garbage and deliver the mail.Today, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), scientists now know that the 1918 influenza pandemic was causes by the H1N1 virus. While the epidemic did die down by the summer of 1919, that same H1N1 virus continued to come back seasonally for about 38 years, and, according to a study in Emerging Infectious Diseases, all influenza A pandemics since 1918 have been caused by descendants (or mutated versions) of that same 1918 virus. There have been other flu pandemics since 1918, but none have been quite as deadly. This is partly due to the fact that there have been huge advancements in our understanding and treatment of the flu. There is now a global influenza surveillance system that include 114 countries. Seasonal flu vaccines are also available every year to help protect people from getting sick and there are antiviral drugs available for treatment. There are also antibiotics to help treat secondary infections, such as pneumonia. Still, according to the World Health Organization, the seasonal flu still severely affects three to five million people a year and kills between 290,000 and 650,000 worldwide. That’s why it’s very important to get the vaccine every year and take other steps — like staying home from work when you’re sick — to help minimize the risk of spreading the disease to others.

(WPDE) — As we are in the peak of flu season, some doctors have reached a peak point of research, as they're working to roll out an improved influenza vaccine.Myrtle Beach is one of the first locations where Trial ManagementAssociates is looking for people to participate in their clinical trial.The current influenza vaccine injects an inactive piece of the flu virus into the body, essentially teaching a person's immune system to react and fight the virus.Now, this new version of the flu vaccine includes messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is the same ingredient used in vaccines to fight against COVID-19.NEW: Scotland County deputies remember fellow K-9 officerDr. Evan Lucas, the site pharmacist for TMA in Myrtle Beach and Wilmington, NC said mRNA technology has been around since the early 2000s."Instead of us having to give a piece of the flu virus, what it will do is it will say, 'okay, I'm gonna send instructions to your own cells and to the protein builders of the cell,'" said Lucas.He said COVID actually provided an opportunity to use this existing research and data when creating vaccines for the pandemic, and after seeing surprising, but successful results with COVID shots, Lucas said they then saw the opportunity to further utilize mRNA to improve current vaccines for other diseases, like the flu shot.TRENDING:Conway marks Breast Cancer Awareness Month by hanging pink pumpkins outside hospital"With flu, being able to see the same types of effects or the same types of results would be a really big win for the medical community. Be able to prevent long-term infection, be able to reduce hospitalizations, reduce risk of death and things; especially in our vulnerable populations like anyone that's elderly and may be at increased risk or complications from influenza," explained Lucas.Myrtle Beach and Wilmington are the two locations where TMA is launching the third phase of its clinical trial.Lucas said Myrtle Beach was selected because the area is healthy, vibrant and overall cares about health improvement."These are gonna be your largest study with thousands of patients and they are reasonable, they feel really good about the product at that point and about its safety and all those things," said Lucas. "They're just making sure it's continuing to do what it's supposed to do."Lucas said the end goal is to reinvent the wheel of an already existing vaccination to have longer periods of protection and to protect people against multiple strains of the flu.If you haven't gotten your flu vaccine yet this year, TMA is currently looking for people who live in Myrtle Beach or Wilmington to participate in testing these vaccines.TRENDING:Human remains found by Kent Road appear to be male according to Georgetown County CoronerDr. Lucas said it's important to note that everyone who takes part in the clinical trials will be given some sort of flu vaccination, so no matter what, you'll be given some level of protection against influenza this season.If selected, you could be paid up to $1,000.The trial will require one to four visits, depending on the trial.For more information on the trial or to submit your interest in participating you can reach out to TMA via email or by calling their office.Email:volunteers@trialmgt.comPhone: 910-247-4580Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOWPDEWPDEWWMBWWMBPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Sjögren's Patients More Likely to Need Hospital Care for Infections | Risk of Hospitalization May Be Reduced With Preventive Measures | Sjogren's Syndrome News Skip to content Toggle navigation Home About Sjögren's Toggle menu What is Sjögren’s syndrome?

Hospitalizations for opportunistic infections, such as the chickenpox/shingles virus (zoster) and mycobacterial infections, also are higher in this patient population, the study found. Overall, the incidence of hospitalization for a first infection was 98% higher for those with Sjögren’s than among healthy people. Researchers suggested that preventive measures and vaccination campaigns may decrease the burden of infections in Sjögren’s patients. The study, “Hospitalizations for infections in primary Sjögren’s syndrome patients: a nationwide incidence study,” was published in the journal Annals of Medicine. Recommended Reading March 1, 2022 News by Yedida Y Bogachkov PhD Increased Cardiovascular Issues, Sleep Apnea Seen in Hospitalized Patients Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease primarily marked by inflammation of the tear and salivary glands, which leads to its hallmark symptoms of dry eyes and mouth. The condition also is associated with joint pain, skin rashes, vaginal dryness, dry cough, fatigue, and chronic pain. Life-threatening complications of Sjögren’s include blood cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and infections, especially in the airways (bronchopulmonary). In fact, infections account for about 30% of Sjögren’s-related hospitalizations. Inpatient hospital care for Sjögren’s patients Although the impact of infections on outcomes associated with other autoimmune diseases has been widely described, little is known about the incidence of severe infections requiring hospitalization in people with Sjögren’s, according to the researchers, from the University of Montpellier, in France. “A better description of the risks of specific infections in [Sjögren’s syndrome] patients could help to tailor preventive strategies,” the scientists wrote. To learn more, the team collected data from the French Health insurance database regarding newly hospitalized Sjögren’s patients between 2011 and 2018. The researchers then compared the incidence of hospitalization for several types of infections between 25,661 Sjögren’s patients and 252,543 age- and sex-matched hospitalized patients without Sjögren’s who served as controls. Most participants were female (87.7%), with a mean age of 60 and a median follow-up of about four years. Those with Sjögren’s were more likely to be obese, require dialysis, and have high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, blood cancers, and neuropsychiatric conditions. Lung diseases also were more prevalent among Sjögren’s patients than controls, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.72% vs. 0.48%), a chronic inflammatory lung disease, and interstitial lung disease (2.71% vs. 0.06%), which is characterized by lung inflammation and scarring. Within the study period, 2,254 individuals with Sjögren’s (8.78%) had at least one hospitalization for an infection acquired in the community. Overall, the incidence of hospitalizations for a first community infection was 29% higher in Sjögren’s patients compared with controls, after adjusting for socio-economic status, past cardiovascular or lung diseases, and blood cancer factors. Leading causes of hospitalization included infections of the intestines, airways, kidneys, teeth, and earsosehroat (ENT). The incidence of hospitalizations due to intestinal infections was 18% higher in Sjögren’s patients than in controls. Similar results were seen for airway infections, with a 50% increased incidence for pneumonia, 70% for bronchitis, and 98% for influenza (flu). Hospitalization rates for kidney infections were also 55% higher in Sjögren’s patients. Hospitalization rates for skin infections were almost four times higher in Sjögren’s patients, and for dental and ENT infections were 27% higher compared with controls. The team then evaluated the incidence of opportunistic infections, which are those that typically arise in people who have a weakened or compromised immune system but may not cause disease in a healthy person. Over the course of the study, 104 Sjögren’s patients (0.04%) experienced at least one opportunistic infection. The hospitalization incidence for a first opportunistic infection was 98% higher in people with Sjögren’s than in controls. Hospitalizations for zoster (chickenpox/shingles) were 3.32 times higher in Sjögren’s patients than in controls, 4.35 times higher for mycobacteria, and 2.54 times for tuberculosis. Notably, the hospitalization rate for interstitial lung disease was more than nine times higher in Sjögren’s patients. The incidence of in-hospital mortality in Sjögren’s patients was similar to that of controls for pneumonia, and infections of the kidney, intestines, or dental and ENT, regardless of adjustments. “In this large nationwide study, hospitalized [Sjögren’s syndrome] patients showed a higher risk of hospitalization for community infections, especially bronchopulmonary infections and intestinal infections, compared with matched controls,” the team wrote. “A targeted vaccination campaign against respiratory pathogens and strict management of sicca syndrome could be beneficial in reducing this risk,” they concluded.

Doctors are saying there are two strains: Flu A and Flu B. They have slight differences, but officials say you don't want to have either of them.The influenza virus targets your respiratory system. It's a package deal with symptoms like fever, chills head and muscle aches, and congestion.“Flu in and of itself typically makes you feel like you're going to die for about 3 days,” said Dr. Richard Oyler at Compass Urgent Care. "Feels like you get hit by a freight train it just hits you."Oyler tells me within the last 3 weeks he's seen about 4 people every day with the flu. He says there are two different strains of the flu and normal people won't be able to distinguish the two."Type B has a little more gastrointestinal side effect. You might have a little more vomiting a little more diarrhea. Type A has a little more body aches but they're both no fun," says OylerHe tells me with both, you'll generally have around a 101 fever. Dr. Wes Stubblefield with the Alabama Department of Public Health tells me Flu A is what they call the “epidemic flu” because it causes the most problems.“It's the one that was the H1N1. It's the one that most people think about," says Stubblefield.Stubblefield tells me Flu B has caused significant outbreaks in the past and it can also contribute to a longer flu season."In pediatrics the B strain is a generally more tolerated than the A strain and that doesn't mean if you get the flu you don't feel bad because a lot of people do generally feel poorly when they get the flu," says Stubblefield.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...The Deadliest Pandemics in US History - WorldAtlas The Deadliest Pandemics in US History The COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in 2019 in Wuhan, China has hit our global society harder than any pandemic in recorded history; however, it is far from the first of its kind. Though daily world travel has undoutedly exacerbated the spread of the virus, plagues have long been a component of recorded human history. What follows are the deadliest plagues in American history. Read More10 Pandemics Throughout History The American Plagues Smallpox was introduced into Mexico by the Spanish expedition of Panfilo de Narvaez and raged through the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in late 1520, via Wikipedia In the sixteenth century, a cluster of illnesses, including smallpox were transmitted when European colonizers passed them along upon landing in what would become the United States. The hardest hit population were the Indigenous Peoples. Historians believe it is possible that as many as 90% of the Indigenous Population of the Western Hemisphere was wiped out by this group of viruses. The American Plagues directly lead to the collapse of the Inca and Aztec civilizations. Read MoreWhen Did The Inca Empire Fall? Philadelphia Yellow Fever Yellow Fever Memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery, via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yellow_Fever_Memorial_in_Laurel_Hill_Cemetery.jpg Yellow fever, which is thought to have originated in Africa, wrought havoc on America. Philadelphia in particular was hard hit by the virus, which is transmitted by mosquito bites. Approximately 5,000 people lost their lives; unfortunately, slaves made up the majority of those who died, because they were wrongly thought to be immune. Though a safe and effective vaccine now exists, the Philadelphia Yellow Fever epidemic didn't end until winter came to Philadelphia and the mosquitos died out. Polio People in Columbus, Georgia awaiting polio vaccination during the earlier days of the National Polio Immunization Program 1916 is the year that poliomyletitis was first recorded in New York City. It is a highly contagious disease that killed around six thousand people and was a mass disabling event of many survivors of the illness. As with many viruses, the hardest hit by disability seemed to be young children. A vaccine was developed for polio in 1954 and the disease was largely controlled by an aggressive vaccine program in the United States.

Spanish Flu Emergency hospital during influenza epidemic, Camp Funston, Kansas Caused by the H1N1 Influenza A virus, the Spanish Flu lead to as many as 100 million deaths worldwide between 1918 and 1920. The virus came in four distinct waves, was first reported by Spanish media, which is where the term “Spanish Flu” originated, even though the origin of the virus was not Spain. In fact, the first documented case was in Kansas. Possibly the spread of the Spanish Flu was made worse by a climate anomaly that made it very easy for the virus to spread, but certainly the spread and fatalities in Europe were made worse by living conditions and close quarters during World War I. In America, the death toll was between 500,000 and 850,000 with Indigenous communities among the hardest hit. Asian Flu (influenza) 168 sick conscripts by asian flu in a sport arena att F 21 in Lulea, Sweden, Picture was taken in 1957 In the winter of 1957 a blend of avian flu viruses called H2N2 originated Singapore and hit the United States hard the following summer. There were more than 1.1 million fatalities from infections worldwide, with 116,000 deaths occuring in the United States. A vaccine for H2N2 was developed, which slowed the pandemic, though the virus is thought to now be extinct among the human population. Read MoreWhat Is A Pandemic? Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) St Vincent's Hospital, New York, was one of many Catholic health institutions to pioneer AIDS treatment The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the virus that causes AIDS was thought to originate in the chimpanzee population and transferred to humans in west Africa in the 1930’s. It found its way to America in the late 1970's and was first discovered by doctors examining clusters of pneumonia and certain types of skin cancer in the gay communities in New York and San Francisco in the early 1980's. Though modern treatments have decreased the death toll of HIV and AIDS, the death toll in America as of 2018 was thought to be approximately 700,000 people.

Flu is most dangerous for people 65 and older, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health problems including heart and lung diseases. Telegram Facebook Copy Link AP Published On Oct 3, 2022 at 04:45 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Doctors to have a message for vaccine-weary Americans: Don't skip your flu shot this fall -- and seniors, ask for a special extra-strength kind. After flu hit historically low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be poised for a comeback. The main clue: A nasty flu season just ended in Australia. While there's no way to predict if the U.S. will be as hard-hit, "last year we were going into flu season not knowing if flu was around or not. This year we know flu is back," said influenza specialist Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Annual flu shots are recommended starting with 6-month-old babies. Flu is most dangerous for people 65 and older, young children, pregnant women and people with certain health problems including heart and lung diseases. Advt Here's what to know: REVVED-UP SHOTS FOR SENIORS As people get older, their immune system doesn't respond as strongly to standard flu vaccination. This year, people 65 or older are urged to get a special kind for extra protection. There are three choices. Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok each contain higher doses of the main anti-flu ingredient. The other option is Fluad Adjuvanted, which has a regular dosage but contains a special ingredient that helps boost people's immune response. Seniors can ask what kind their doctor carries. But most flu vaccinations are given in pharmacies and some drugstore websites, such as CVS, automatically direct people to locations offering senior doses if their birth date shows they qualify. Webby advised making sure older relatives and friends know about the senior shots, in case they're not told when they seek vaccination. "They should at least ask, 'Do you have the shots that are better for me?'" Webby said. "The bottom line is they do work better" for this age group. If a location is out of senior-targeted doses, it's better to get a standard flu shot than to skip vaccination, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All flu vaccines in the U.S. -- including types for people younger than 65 -- are "quadrivalent," meaning they guard against four different flu strains. Younger people have choices, too, including shots for those with egg allergies and a nasal spray version called FluMist. Advt WHY FLU EXPERTS ARE ON ALERT Australia just experienced its worst flu season in five years and what happens in Southern Hemisphere winters often foreshadows what Northern countries can expect, said Dr Andrew Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. And people have largely abandoned masking and distancing precautions that earlier in the pandemic also helped prevent the spread of other respiratory bugs like the flu. "This poses a risk, especially to young children who may not have had much if any previous exposure to influenza viruses before this season," Pekosz added. "This year we will have a true influenza season as we saw before the pandemic," said Dr Jason Newland, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. He said children's hospitals already are seeing an unusual early spike in other respiratory infections including RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and worries flu likewise will strike earlier than usual - like it did in Australia. The CDC advises a flu vaccine by the end of October but says they can be given any time during flu season. It takes about two weeks for protection to set in. The U.S. expects 173 million to 183 million doses this year. And yes, you can get a flu shot and an updated COVID-19 booster at the same time - one in each arm to lessen soreness. FLU SHOTS OF THE FUTURE The companies that make the two most widely used COVID-19 vaccines now are testing flu shots made with the same technology. One reason: When influenza mutates, the recipes of so-called mRNA vaccines could be updated more quickly than today's flu shots, most of which are made by growing influenza virus in chicken eggs. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are recruiting 25,000 healthy U.S. adults to receive either its experimental influenza shot or a regular kind, to see how effective the new approach proves this flu season. Rival Moderna tested its version in about 6,000 people in Australia, Argentina and other countries during the Southern Hemisphere's flu season and is awaiting results.

Here's what parents need to know.Oct. 5, 2022, 8:11 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 6, 2022, 5:15 PM UTCBy Caroline KeeChildren’s hospitals in major U.S. cities around the country are reaching capacity due to an unprecedented spike in respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 is not the main culprit. Common respiratory viruses that typically cause mild, cold-like symptoms in children — such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), rhinovirus and enterovirus — are hitting harder and earlier than expected, multiple experts told TODAY, prompting concern ahead of the winter season.As hospitals report unusually high pediatric case numbers for this time of year, many physicians are sharing anecdotes about packed emergency rooms and intensive care units on social media. Dr. Maya Maxym, a pediatric hospitalist at Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women and Children in Hawaii, posted a tweet on Sept. 27, 2022, that went viral.“We are inundated with multiple simultaneous respiratory viruses (lots of RSV, rhino/enterovirus, others). Kids can not breathe,” Maxym wrote in a reply to her original tweet.RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, per the CDC, but it can lead to more serious complications like bronchiolitis (a type of lung infection) or pneumonia. It causes close to 60,000 hospitalizations in kids every year, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar told TODAY.Rhinoviruses typically cause the common cold, and enteroviruses often cause mild, respiratory symptoms, but in rare cases, they can both cause severe illness, according to the CDC.“Many children are visiting the emergency department and being admitted to the medical center with respiratory illnesses. ... Some of them are sicker than what we usually see,” Maxym told TODAY via email. “Cases appear to be higher than ‘busy seasons’ prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, these viruses followed seasonal trends, peaking each year during the fall and winter, according to a recent CDC report on respiratory virus surveillance among children in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021.“Although Hawai‘i overall has less seasonality than other states, it is very early in the season to be seeing this much respiratory disease,” Mayxm added.On the mainland, the same trends are holding true in major cities in the Northeast.“The children’s hospitals, at least in our area, are very full right now,” Dr. Thomas Murray, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in Connecticut, told TODAY.Last week, RSV numbers (in adults and kids) almost doubled compared to the week before, and rhinovirus cases also increased over the same period, Murray said, referencing Yale’s clinical virology seasonal virus reporting website. “And rhinovirus is making kids quite sick,” he added. “We have seen more children in our intensive care unit with rhinovirus than we typically see.” He pointed out that prior to COVID, this increase would usually start in November, but “the seasonality is kind of gone at the moment."“Our hospital and others are really preparing for a surge that could get much worse … but the other thing I’ve learned over the past few years is the unpredictability of things that used to be predictable,” Murray added.Farther north in Boston, two major hospitals — Boston Children’s Hospital and MassGeneral Hospital for Children — are full right now, according to Boston-area pediatrician Dr. Daniel Summers. “I’m doing all I can to keep my patients out of the emergency department unless it’s absolutely necessary because I know, no matter where they go, it’s going to be hours before they’re going to be seen,” Summers told TODAY. Connecticut Children's hospital has also had to rely on temporary units to accommodate all of its RSV cases, and it may need support from state and federal agencies to address the surge, NBC Connecticut reported.Another children’s hospital in Indiana has been experiencing a surge of RSV cases and hospitalizations since the summer. “RSV is notorious for causing infections in young infants, especially those under 6 months, and in children that have bad lungs or a bad heart,” Dr. John Christenson, associate medical director of infection prevention at Riley Children’s Health in Indianapolis, told TODAY.Although RSV usually peaks in the middle of January or in February, Christenson explained, cases have tripled in the last three weeks. “We have tons of kids with bronchiolitis, a respiratory condition you tend to see caused by this virus,” he continued.“Our numbers of rhinovirus and enterovirus are probably double what we usually (see),” Christenson said, adding that the hospital's also dealing with kids in the ICU due to COVID-19 complications.“It’s putting stress on health care systems, and this is problematic because … what happens if we have RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and then we have influenza season on top of it?” Christenson said.Nebraska is also experiencing a steep increase in positive RSV tests much sooner than anticipated — this comes after the state saw RSV cases all summer long, which is "unheard of," according to Dr. Stephen Dolter, chief medical informatics officer at Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha.Across the South, children’s hospitals are either at capacity or close to capacity right now, Dr. Mark W. Kline, infectious disease specialist, physician-in-chief and chief academic officer at Children’s Hospital of New Orleans, told TODAY. “That’s just the tip of the iceberg of what’s happening in the community,” said Kline.“We’re being inundated with several viruses that typically we only see in large numbers during the winter,” said Kline. Among these is influenza A. “Our test positivity rate over the past week for influenza A has been 30%. … It’s very unusual to see that in September or October,” said Kline, adding that this may be an early indication that the flu will hit hard this year.“We have a lot of adenovirus right now. Our test positivity for adenovirus is 17% ... but maybe the biggest concern to us at the moment is enterovirus,” said Kline, adding that the test positivity rate for enterovirus at Children’s Hospital New Orleans is an unusually high 37%. (Adenovirus is another family of viruses that typically cause mild, flu-like symptoms, but the CDC is currently investigating if a type of adenovirus, adenovirus 41, is linked to a recent swath of kids developing hepatitis with an unknown cause.) The positive tests Kline's been seeing include enterovirus D68, which can lead to severe respiratory disease that can land a child in the hospital or ICU, he said. “Enterovirus D68 is associated with acute flaccid myelitis, an immune reaction to the virus that affects the spinal cord, and that can lead to paralysis."In a report issued last week, the CDC warned about increased circulation of enterovirus D68 in kids.RELATED: Enterovirus, which can cause paralysis in kids, on the rise in US: What parents should knowTexas Children's, the largest children's hospital in the U.S., is also seeing cases surge across the state ahead of schedule. “We are certainly seeing a high volume of respiratory illnesses in our patients coming into our offices — and earlier,” Dr. Stan Spinner, vice president and chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics and Texas Children’s Urgent Care in Houston, told TODAY. “We’ve seen (RSV) all through the summer, and it’s increased even more since school has started ... and it continues to increase our hospital census for sick kids,” Spinner added. “We’re (also) seeing a lot of rhinovirus that started this summer, and some of the kids get sick enough to be hospitalized,” said Spinner. Although COVID-19 numbers have leveled off in Texas, Spinner said the flu is already spreading in Texas and other states. "It's only going to get worse,” Spinner said. Why are these respiratory viruses surging now?There are several possible reasons, according to the experts. “One is the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself being introduced into the environment and how that’s affected the circulation of other respiratory viruses,” said Murray.As Kline explained it, “COVID has has changed a lot of things, and one of the things is what we thought we knew about the epidemiology and the seasonality of respiratory viruses. I think we’re going to have to relearn how these viruses manifest themselves in the era of COVID."Mitigation measures like masking and social distancing have also suppressed these respiratory viruses for the last few years, leaving many children vulnerable, Christenson said.According to a recent report from the CDC, many of these seasonal respiratory viruses circulated at lower-than-expected levels between April 2020 and May 2021. Kline noted that prior to the pandemic, "these viruses would come through every winter, and lots of kids would experience them, so they’d have some degree of immunity that would persist and help protect them in subsequent seasons. This time around, we haven’t had as many of those exposures." He added that there is now a "big susceptible pool of hosts."Children being back in school without mask mandates and "being exposed to this barrage of viruses that they weren’t getting these past two years" also plays a role, Spinner said, adding that kids often get sick a lot more frequently until their immune system builds up their defenses.Fortunately, Murray had some words of reassurance: “I think in due time, everybody is going to get their regular immunity back, but there’s just a lot of things circulating right now."What are the symptoms to look out for?The symptoms of RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus (and even COVID-19) are often indistinguishable, said Murray, and typically include a runny nose, cough or a fever. “The majority of kids will be sick for a few days with a cold and then get better,” he added. The treatment for these viruses is largely "supportive," meaning lots of hydrating and managing the airway, Azar explained. For RSV specifically, there's also an antibody treatment available to high-risk groups.If a child has influenza A, they may experience more body aches and a medium or high-grade fever, said Kline. Rapid tests can be used at home to rule out COVID-19, but beyond that you would need to go to a doctor’s office or a hospital that can test for the other viruses, said Kline.“When your child gets sick, just keep a close eye on them and make sure you’re reaching out to your health care provider to get instructions,” said Murray, adding that parents should be extra vigilant with infants, young children and children who are immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions.Things to watch out for include a fever that does not get better after a few days or does not respond to over-the-counter fever reducers, said Murray, as well as signs of respiratory distress (rapid breathing, wheezing, bluish lips), refusal to eat or drink, persistent vomiting and lethargy. Azar also suggested looking out for irritability and shortness of breath, especially for caregivers of kids who can't communicate yet.If you've got a sick child on your hands, you may also want to be on alert for signs of AFM, as a child with AFM needs to be hospitalized right away, per the CDC. The main AFM symptoms include sudden onset of arm or leg weakness or loss of muscle tone and reflexes. Some people also develop pain in the legs, neck or back; facial drooping or weakness, including in the eyes; and difficulty swallowing or slurred speech.“If a child is really just looking or acting worse than they typically would in previous types of similar situations … be sure that your child gets checked out,” said Spinner.Although most children will recover from these respiratory viruses, a portion will end up in the hospital, and some will end up in an intensive care unit, Kline said.“Most of the time, it’s a relatively short hospitalization to give them a little bit of extra support (such as oxygen or fluids),” said Murray, adding that children who end up in intensive care may require a breathing tube.“Hospitalization can happen even in a very healthy kid, and there’s no way of predicting that,” said Spinner, which is why all parents should take steps to keep their child safe. How to prevent these respiratory illnessesThere is no vaccine for RSV, rhinovirus or enterovirus. So, “protect your kids against what you can protect them from, so vaccinate them against COVID and the flu,” said Spinner, adding that these help prevent serious illness and keep people out of the hospital. The COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccine are both recommended for children aged 6 months and older, the experts noted. And some children may need multiple flu shots this year.Other preventive actions include frequent hand-washing, sanitizing frequently touched surfaces and wearing a mask, said Christenson.Maxym said she's continuing “to recommend using a high-quality mask in crowded, indoor spaces to minimize exposure to all respiratory viruses, not just COVID-19."Additionally, try to keep your children away from other kids who have respiratory symptoms, said Murray. “For younger babies, you know they’re at the highest vulnerability, so you really want to keep them away from sick individuals.”And of course, sick children should stay home."Kids going to school with respiratory infections perpetuates and exacerbates these outbreaks," said Kline. “Unfortunately, the viruses are not relenting … so to the extent that parents can continue to give this some attention and do some simple things to help keep their kids safe, I think it will be very beneficial.”Caroline KeeCaroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.RelatedGetty Images/iStockphotoThese are the best cold remedies according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Nov. 8, 2024Mindful Media / Getty ImagesHow to make yourself sneeze, according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Oct. 15, 2024Getty ImagesAre your fall allergy symptoms worse this year?

Here's what parents need to know.Oct. 5, 2022, 8:11 PM UTC / Updated Oct. 6, 2022, 5:15 PM UTCBy Caroline KeeChildren’s hospitals in major U.S. cities around the country are reaching capacity due to an unprecedented spike in respiratory illnesses, and COVID-19 is not the main culprit. Common respiratory viruses that typically cause mild, cold-like symptoms in children — such as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), rhinovirus and enterovirus — are hitting harder and earlier than expected, multiple experts told TODAY, prompting concern ahead of the winter season.As hospitals report unusually high pediatric case numbers for this time of year, many physicians are sharing anecdotes about packed emergency rooms and intensive care units on social media. Dr. Maya Maxym, a pediatric hospitalist at Kapi‘olani Medical Center for Women and Children in Hawaii, posted a tweet on Sept. 27, 2022, that went viral.“We are inundated with multiple simultaneous respiratory viruses (lots of RSV, rhino/enterovirus, others). Kids can not breathe,” Maxym wrote in a reply to her original tweet.RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, per the CDC, but it can lead to more serious complications like bronchiolitis (a type of lung infection) or pneumonia. It causes close to 60,000 hospitalizations in kids every year, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar told TODAY.Rhinoviruses typically cause the common cold, and enteroviruses often cause mild, respiratory symptoms, but in rare cases, they can both cause severe illness, according to the CDC.“Many children are visiting the emergency department and being admitted to the medical center with respiratory illnesses. ... Some of them are sicker than what we usually see,” Maxym told TODAY via email. “Cases appear to be higher than ‘busy seasons’ prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.”Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, these viruses followed seasonal trends, peaking each year during the fall and winter, according to a recent CDC report on respiratory virus surveillance among children in the U.S. from 2016 to 2021.“Although Hawai‘i overall has less seasonality than other states, it is very early in the season to be seeing this much respiratory disease,” Mayxm added.On the mainland, the same trends are holding true in major cities in the Northeast.“The children’s hospitals, at least in our area, are very full right now,” Dr. Thomas Murray, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in Connecticut, told TODAY.Last week, RSV numbers (in adults and kids) almost doubled compared to the week before, and rhinovirus cases also increased over the same period, Murray said, referencing Yale’s clinical virology seasonal virus reporting website. “And rhinovirus is making kids quite sick,” he added. “We have seen more children in our intensive care unit with rhinovirus than we typically see.” He pointed out that prior to COVID, this increase would usually start in November, but “the seasonality is kind of gone at the moment."“Our hospital and others are really preparing for a surge that could get much worse … but the other thing I’ve learned over the past few years is the unpredictability of things that used to be predictable,” Murray added.Farther north in Boston, two major hospitals — Boston Children’s Hospital and MassGeneral Hospital for Children — are full right now, according to Boston-area pediatrician Dr. Daniel Summers. “I’m doing all I can to keep my patients out of the emergency department unless it’s absolutely necessary because I know, no matter where they go, it’s going to be hours before they’re going to be seen,” Summers told TODAY. Connecticut Children's hospital has also had to rely on temporary units to accommodate all of its RSV cases, and it may need support from state and federal agencies to address the surge, NBC Connecticut reported.Another children’s hospital in Indiana has been experiencing a surge of RSV cases and hospitalizations since the summer. “RSV is notorious for causing infections in young infants, especially those under 6 months, and in children that have bad lungs or a bad heart,” Dr. John Christenson, associate medical director of infection prevention at Riley Children’s Health in Indianapolis, told TODAY.Although RSV usually peaks in the middle of January or in February, Christenson explained, cases have tripled in the last three weeks. “We have tons of kids with bronchiolitis, a respiratory condition you tend to see caused by this virus,” he continued.“Our numbers of rhinovirus and enterovirus are probably double what we usually (see),” Christenson said, adding that the hospital's also dealing with kids in the ICU due to COVID-19 complications.“It’s putting stress on health care systems, and this is problematic because … what happens if we have RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and then we have influenza season on top of it?” Christenson said.Nebraska is also experiencing a steep increase in positive RSV tests much sooner than anticipated — this comes after the state saw RSV cases all summer long, which is "unheard of," according to Dr. Stephen Dolter, chief medical informatics officer at Children's Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha.Across the South, children’s hospitals are either at capacity or close to capacity right now, Dr. Mark W. Kline, infectious disease specialist, physician-in-chief and chief academic officer at Children’s Hospital of New Orleans, told TODAY. “That’s just the tip of the iceberg of what’s happening in the community,” said Kline.“We’re being inundated with several viruses that typically we only see in large numbers during the winter,” said Kline. Among these is influenza A. “Our test positivity rate over the past week for influenza A has been 30%. … It’s very unusual to see that in September or October,” said Kline, adding that this may be an early indication that the flu will hit hard this year.“We have a lot of adenovirus right now. Our test positivity for adenovirus is 17% ... but maybe the biggest concern to us at the moment is enterovirus,” said Kline, adding that the test positivity rate for enterovirus at Children’s Hospital New Orleans is an unusually high 37%. (Adenovirus is another family of viruses that typically cause mild, flu-like symptoms, but the CDC is currently investigating if a type of adenovirus, adenovirus 41, is linked to a recent swath of kids developing hepatitis with an unknown cause.) The positive tests Kline's been seeing include enterovirus D68, which can lead to severe respiratory disease that can land a child in the hospital or ICU, he said. “Enterovirus D68 is associated with acute flaccid myelitis, an immune reaction to the virus that affects the spinal cord, and that can lead to paralysis."In a report issued last week, the CDC warned about increased circulation of enterovirus D68 in kids.RELATED: Enterovirus, which can cause paralysis in kids, on the rise in US: What parents should knowTexas Children's, the largest children's hospital in the U.S., is also seeing cases surge across the state ahead of schedule. “We are certainly seeing a high volume of respiratory illnesses in our patients coming into our offices — and earlier,” Dr. Stan Spinner, vice president and chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics and Texas Children’s Urgent Care in Houston, told TODAY. “We’ve seen (RSV) all through the summer, and it’s increased even more since school has started ... and it continues to increase our hospital census for sick kids,” Spinner added. “We’re (also) seeing a lot of rhinovirus that started this summer, and some of the kids get sick enough to be hospitalized,” said Spinner. Although COVID-19 numbers have leveled off in Texas, Spinner said the flu is already spreading in Texas and other states. "It's only going to get worse,” Spinner said. Why are these respiratory viruses surging now?There are several possible reasons, according to the experts. “One is the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself being introduced into the environment and how that’s affected the circulation of other respiratory viruses,” said Murray.As Kline explained it, “COVID has has changed a lot of things, and one of the things is what we thought we knew about the epidemiology and the seasonality of respiratory viruses.

DiabetesDiabetes and the Flu: What You Need to KnowPeople with diabetes are at an elevated risk for flu complications, making the flu vaccine imperative. Check out this expert insight for preventing the flu and recovering if you end up getting sick.ByKate RuderMedically ReviewedbyKacy Church, MDPublished on October 6, 2022Fever is one of several potential symptoms of the flu.ShutterstockThe 2022–2023 flu season could start earlier and be more severe than in years past. As a result, public health officials and doctors alike are urging people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, who are at risk for more serious complications, to get their flu shots as soon as possible.“The flu shot is already available, so I would highly recommend people with diabetes get them as soon as they can,” says Hanah Polotsky, MD, an endocrinologist and internist at Kaiser Permanente in Denver.Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a respiratory virus affecting an average of 8 percent of Americans each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The flu causes symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and runny nose, and can progress to more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia, and death.Tips to Prevent the Flu and PneumoniaNobody wants to get the flu or pneumonia, especially if you have diabetes. Here are a few ways to protect yourself!Next up video playing in 10 seconds“People with diabetes have difficulty fighting off all sorts of infections, and likewise have difficulty mustering an appropriate inflammatory response to fight off an early pneumonia,” says William Schaffner, MD, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) and professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Center in Nashville.How the Flu Can Affect People With DiabetesThe flu virus infects cells at the back of the nose and throat, causing congestion or a sore throat. Inflammation of the mucus membranes inside the bronchial tubes, which carry air in and out of your lungs, can cause a cough, Dr. Schaffner says.Inflammation also creates an opportunity for bacteria, normally present in our throats, to infect the lungs themselves, called pneumonia, says Schaffner. This can cause difficulty breathing, a cough, and chest pain, and, if not treated, it may become deadly.A more serious infection like pneumonia can make it hard to control blood sugar, which can increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous health emergency where the blood contains high levels of ketones, says Schaffner. People with type 2 diabetes are more likely to be overweight, an added risk factor for respiratory diseases such as pneumonia.How to Prevent the Flu and Its ComplicationsGetting a yearly flu vaccine is the best way to prevent flu and its complications, say Schaffner and Dr. Polotsky. During the 2019 to 2020 season, flu vaccines prevented 7.5 million flu illnesses and 6,300 flu-related deaths, according to the CDC.Scientists develop a new flu vaccine each season to closely match circulating viruses and its efficacy can therefore vary, anywhere from 19 to 60 percent from 2009 to 2022, according to CDC data.Keep in mind that getting vaccinated is beneficial even if you get the flu. In 1,670 people with diabetes, getting a flu vaccine reduced hospitalizations for the flu by 46 percent, compared with not getting a flu vaccine, according to a study published in July 2021 in Clinical Infectious Diseases. In a separate study published in 2021 in Vaccine, among people who went to the hospital for the flu, adults who were vaccinated had a 26 percent lower risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit and a 31 percent lower risk of dying prematurely compared with adults who were unvaccinated.Schaffner and Polotsky recommend that people 65 and older, including those with diabetes, receive specific flu vaccines such as Fluzone high-dose quadrivalent, Flublok quadrivalent, or Fluad quadrivalent, per recent CDC recommendations.You can get your flu shot at your doctor’s office or pharmacy, and the CDC’s Vaccines.gov allows you to search for nearby flu vaccine locations by ZIP code. Medicare, Medicaid, and most private health insurance cover the cost of flu vaccination, and some health providers such as local public health agencies offer free flu vaccines.Tips to Prevent the Flu and PneumoniaThese steps apply to anyone looking to prevent the flu and complications like pneumonia, but they can be especially important for people with diabetes.Get a yearly flu vaccine shot. (Opt for the high-dose version if you’re over age 65.)Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are eligible for the pneumococcal vaccine, which protects against the bacteria that cause pneumonia.Avoid physical contact with others who are coughing or sneezing.Wash your hands frequently.Flu virus can live for 24 to 48 hours on surfaces, so wash surfaces with soap or other disinfectants.Wear a face mask to indoor events during flu season.Keep tabs on influenza spread in your community, and consider staying home if cases are high.“The vaccine moves the equation in your favor, but it’s not 100 percent protective, so anything you can do to avoid exposure [to the virus] is a good thing,” Schaffner says.What to Do if You Get the Flu as a Person With DiabetesEven when taking precautions, including getting vaccinated, you may still get the flu. Flu can spread when an infected person up to six feet away coughs or sneezes and their infected droplets land in our noses or mouths, according to the CDC. Less frequently, it spreads when you touch a doorknob or other surface infected with the flu virus.Polotsky says Tamiflu or other prescription antiviral medications can be helpful for people with diabetes, particularly if they are 65 or older, and at higher risk for complications from the flu.Tips to Recover From the Flu While Managing DiabetesStay hydrated by drinking plenty of sugar-free fluids like water.If you take insulin, you may need to check your blood glucose levels more often.Be aware of severe low blood glucose episodes, called hypoglycemia, if you take insulin and are not eating as regularly.If you use cough syrup, choose one that is sugar-free.When to Seek Care From a Medical ProfessionalSymptoms of the flu typically peak around days 2 to 3, but improve by days 5 to 7, Polotsky says. “If you're coughing more and your fever is persistent, it's a sign of the most common complication from influenza, which is bacterial pneumonia. And that could be very serious.”Polotsky says you should call your healthcare team immediately if you have those symptoms or any of the others listed below.Signs or Symptoms of a Medical EmergencyBeware these warning flags:Fainting or passing outSevere chest painDifficulty breathingPersistent, worsening fever of 101 degrees F or higherCoughing that becomes worse after five to seven daysUncontrollable blood glucose levels“If you feel sick disproportionately to how you feel when you get a cold and you’re just not getting better, you are always safer to call [your provider] than not to call,” Polotsky adds.A Final Word on Flu and COVID-19 Vaccines for People With DiabetesOver the past two years, there have been fewer cases of the flu due to measures adopted during the pandemic such as social distancing and wearing a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Now, people are traveling, going back to work and school, and returning to normal activities that could increase the spread of flu.In fact, the upcoming season could mean increasing cases of both flu and COVID-19, Polotsky says. Conveniently, you can get both your COVID-19 vaccine or booster at the same time as your flu vaccine, Schaffner says.The CDC recommends updated bivalent COVID-19 boosters, at least two months out from completion of a person’s primary vaccination or last booster shot, for anyone age 12 or older. Those 12 to 17 years old can only receive the Pfizer bivalent booster.People with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, are at higher risk for getting sick, being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19, so it is particularly important to them to stay up-to-date on their vaccinations and booster.Schaffner says many people have vaccine fatigue, at this point, and are still focused on COVID-19, so he worries about this year’s flu vaccination rates. “We have to make an extra effort to remind people that there’s yet another really nasty respiratory virus out there and it’s the flu,” he says. “For that we also have a vaccine, and you should get both.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkKacy Church, MDMedical ReviewerKacy Church, MD, practices as a clinical endocrinologist with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation in Burlingame, California.

Now that COVID-19 guidelines have relaxed in most public places and many people are leaving special measures like physical distancing and wearing face masks behind, the flu is expected to make a big comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older receive a flu vaccination. It is especially important for people who are at higher risk of health complications, hospitalization or death from influenza. People at higher risk include those who work in health care, have a chronic health condition or are over age 65, but everyone is encouraged to get vaccinated. To make getting flu shots quick and easy, a drive-through flu vaccination event will be offered for Samaritan patients from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 8, at 3011 NE 28th St. in Lincoln City – across the parking lot from the hospital and near Samaritan Physical Rehabilitation – Lincoln City. If you have had any visit with a Samaritan health care provider – whether in a clinic, hospital, laboratory or imaging test – and have a Samaritan Health Services medical record, you are eligible to get your flu vaccine at one of Samaritan’s drive-up vaccination events. Regular and high-dose flu vaccines will be available for ages 6 months and older and no appointment is needed. Everyone age 2 years and older is asked to please wear a face mask. If you are not a Samaritan patient or can’t make it to one of the drive-through events, check in with your primary care provider about flu vaccination. Additional flu vaccination opportunities in the community may be found by calling 211 or visiting vaccinefinder.org.

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 38 & 39 are also shown. Please refer Seasonal Influenza for regional updates. Actual increase in the number of ILI cases is seen in Fiji, Wallis & Futuna, and Kiribati. The increase seen in Solomon Islands and New Caledonia may be due to the increased number of sites reporting for the week. Reduction in the number of ILI cases is seen in Samoa, CNMI, Tonga and Palau. The decrease seen in Vanuatu may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week. No ILI cases were reported from Cook Islands and Pitcairn Islands for the week. No reports were available from French Polynesia, RMI, Niue, Tokelau and Tuvalu for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease.

IrelandScotlandWalesIsle of ManGuernseyJerseyLocal NewsBird flu: Poultry in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex to be kept indoorsPublished8 October 2022Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, PA MediaAll poultry in Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Essex must be kept indoors from Wednesday, as part of a ramping-up of measures to prevent avian flu spreading, the government has said.The affected areas were placed in an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone last month, after a series of outbreaks.There have been 161 cases in captive birds detected in the past year - the UK's largest ever outbreak.In Staffordshire, birds are due to be culled after the disease was found.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the (HPAI) H5N1 strain of avian influenza was found in captive birds at a property on Friday and a monitoring and controlled zone has been set up around the premises.The previous record of cases in captive birds was 26 cases detected in 2020/21.All birdkeepers in affected areas will be legally required to keep their flocks indoors and follow stringent biosecurity measures to help protect them from the disease, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.The measures apply regardless of type or size of the flock of captive birds.Around 48m birds have been culled in the UK and the EU this year, amid the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza. The government has said the 3.2m birds culled in the UK were a "small proportion" of total production - about 20m birds a week.More than 1,700 cases have also been recorded in the UK's wild bird population, in 406 locations involving 59 species.In previous years, the virus has mostly died out during the summer months but this outbreak has persisted all year round, and spread more easily.The mandatory housing measures for all poultry and captive birds will be introduced after a decision by the UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss.She is encouraging all birdkeepers in the affected regions to prepare over the next few days, including taking steps to protect animal welfare, consult their vet and expand housing where necessary.Ms Middlemiss said there was a growing number of bird flu cases on "commercial farms and in backyard birds" in the three affected counties, adding that she expects the "risk to continue to rise over the coming months as migratory birds return to the UK"."We are now taking further action to help protect flocks from this highly infectious and devastating disease."Image source, DefraImage caption, The eastern part of the prevention zone covers all of Norfolk and Suffolk and nine of the more easterly districts in EssexThe prevention that was declared by the Defra on 28 September also covered Devon, Cornwall and parts of Somerset - but these areas have not yet been told to keep birds indoors.Instead, all poultry gatherings - such as fairs or markets are banned - and bird keepers are told to cleanse and disinfect clothing and equipment before and after contact with birds.The latest bird flu figures covering both Europe and the UK, which track outbreaks from October 2021 to 9 September, were published on Monday. They showed that there have been 3,573 findings in wild birds, with the virus affecting 37 countries, spreading from Svalbard to south Portugal and eastward to Ukraine. But it warned that figure could be an underestimate.While there have been no recorded cases of human transmission in the EU, there was one case in south-west England in January.Related topicsBirdsEssexMore on this storyRecord avian flu outbreak sees mass cull in UK, EUPublished3 October 2022Bird flu restrictions imposed across three countiesPublished27 September 2022Birds to be culled after avian flu outbreakPublished8 October 2022Top storiesStarmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with MacronPublished36 minutes agoHouse vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsarPublished1 hour agoEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south dividePublished2 hours agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south divideâCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Energy smart meter issues creating north-south divide2House vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsar3Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron4âCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâ5Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'6âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director7Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards8Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale9Starmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with Macron10Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacksBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

The treatment was required because the influenza was spreading to army camps across North America. [U.S. NATIONAL ARCHIVES]In October 1918, about 1,000 Canadians a day were dying of the Spanish flu. There is great debate about how the scourge arrived in Canada. Did it come north with U.S. soldiers shipping out through Canada? The epidemic hit Camp Funston in Kansas in January. Since it was contagious before symptoms first appeared, it spread along rail lines from camp to camp, then to troopships bound for Europe. Did it arrive with the 94,000 Chinese Labour Corps workers bound for the front lines in Europe, who crossed Canada in sealed cars in March 1918? Cases with similar symptoms—patients turning blue from lack of oxygen and coughing up blood—were recorded in northern China in 1917. The initial wave of the disease in the spring of 1918 was mild. The first record of a Canadian death was that of Marjory MacDonald on Sept. 1, 1918, in Nova Scotia, as the epidemic rapidly spread across the province. The Chinese labourers, as well as thousands of soldiers from the U.S., shipped out of Halifax bound for Europe. Deaths were recorded in Quebec on Sept. 16, and in Ontario on Sept. 18. The military was ideal for incubating and spreading the disease. Soldiers on both sides of the conflict were easy prey because they lived and travelled in large groups in abominable conditions. Crowded spaces and life in the trenches wreaked havoc on their immune systems, which were already coping with stress, dirt, hunger and cold. “It struck all the armies and might have claimed toward 100,000 fatalities among soldiers overall during the conflict, while rendering millions ineffective,” according to Dutch military historians Peter C. Wever and Leo van Bergen. More than a quarter of the U.S. army was sickened, and 30,000 men died in training camps. More than 14,000 German troops died from influenza. During the last four months of the war, 11,496 Canadian soldiers fell ill at home (some 400 died), as well as 46,000 members of the Canadian Expeditionary Force overseas, 776 of whom died, reported Andrew MacPhail in his 1925 book, The Official History of the Canadian Army Medical Service 1914-19. Information was slower to travel than the bug itself. It might have been worse for troops in combat, but Canada noted infectious diseases arrived with new recruits, causing isolation camps to be put in place in 1916, wrote MacPhail. Not only did the epidemic force the original camps to expand, a new one was also established. But there was no such hurdle back home. The plague spread across Canada in just one week in September. The first contingent of the Siberian Expeditionary Force, headed west to Russia to help quell the Bolshevik revolution, left New Brunswick on Sept. 27, and sick men were offloaded in every major city along the rail line from Toronto, wrote Captain Eric Elkington. On Oct. 2, 1918, the soldiers, and the flu, arrived in Vancouver. The disease seemed to be everywhere at once and moved so rapidly local health officials were taken by surprise. The sick were isolated and provinces and municipalities banned large gatherings, and closed schools, businesses and churches and issued mask mandates. Information was slower to travel than the bug itself. News was widely censored, and the epidemic only became public knowledge once it was front-page news in neutral Spain when King Alfonso was infected. Though it did not originate there, the disease became known as the Spanish flu. Pundits, such as Frank Oliver of the Edmonton Bulletin, wrote of criminal negligence of military authorities, who “refuse to allow information to be given out as to the number of deaths.” And Calgary newspaperman, William Irvine, asked, “where was the Order-in-Council prohibiting all travel until such time as the plague subsided?” The pandemic took a back seat to the war effort in Canada, where troops continued to be recruited and enlist—and were transported across the country, along with the flu. Jesse Brinson of Western Arm, Nfld., was one of the few soldiers to blame himself for spreading the infection. He was in a military hospital where “there was a soldier buried every day for eight days. I wrote a letter, had no better sense…[and sent] the disease right in the family to take the whole lot of them out the one day,” he said in a Heroes Remember video produced by Veterans Affairs Canada. The pandemic took a back seat to the war effort in Canada, where troops continued to be recruited and enlist—and were transported across the country, along with the flu. The flu spread not with “injured soldiers returning home from the muddy battlefields of Europe, but with new recruits bound for a new front in Asia,” wrote historian Mark Osborne Humphries in The Last Plague: Spanish Influenza and the Politics of Public Health in Canada. In response, the federal Department of Health was created in 1919 to co-ordinate policies and procedures across the country. Each province and territory subsequently developed pandemic response plans, which included plans for mass vaccinations, quarantine guidelines and stipulations for public health measures, such as mandatory masks and social distancing guidelines. About 50,000 of Canada’s eight million people died during the two years the Spanish flu raged at the end of the First World War. As of Oct. 1, 2022, of Canada’s 38 million population, the COVID-19 pandemic had claimed a little more than 45,000 people. This time around, the military did not contribute to spread of the disease, but helped deal with it.

Signs it could be pneumoniaKalpana Sharma / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Updated: Oct 6, 2022, 13:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us Fever, in Influenza as well as dengue, is often abrupt onset and high grade. In influenza, the common accompanying symptoms include dry cough, severe myalgia, nasal symptoms, sore throat, and headache. In dengue, commonly associated symptoms include myalgia, body ache, headache (particularly retro-orbital area), skin rash, etc. In COVID-19, fever is usually low grade and can be associated with symptoms such as dry cough, myalgia, headache, smell and taste abnormalities, diarrhea, skin rash, conjunctivitis, etc. 50-year-old Mansi suffered from high fever with bouts of severe body ache. On the third day of fighting fever that refused to settle, she got tested for dengue, typhoid and the results came negative. Even COVID test was negative. A detailed examination at the physician revealed she had pneumonia. So letâs first understand what pneumonia is. Pneumonia is a medical term for infection of the lungs.Pneumonia is one of the most common and morbid conditions encountered in clinical practice. It is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, significant morbidity, and substantial mortality. India accounts for around 23% of the global burden of pneumonia cases. The case fatalities vary between 14 - 30 percent in pneumonia patients, explains Dr Rohit Kumar Garg, consultant, department of infectious diseases, Amrita Hospital, Faridabad. Symptoms of pneumoniaWhile it is believed that pneumonia will present classic lung symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain and cough, thatâs not always the case. According to Dr Praveen Pandey, Director â Pulmonology, Max Hospital, Patparganj, âSymptoms of pneumonia vary from very mild to severe. Sometimes a person may have only cold or flu-like symptoms. In elderly patients, the presentation may be like confusion, altered mental status and low temperature. The patient may also have associated loose motion or local chest pain.â In extreme cases patients may require hospitalization or oxygen support or ventilatory support. Fever is the commonest presenting symptom for various infectious and non-infectious diseases. In the initial stages of illness, the character of fever is non-specific, and therefore, it may be difficult to differentiate the cause of illness based on fever alone. Other non-specific symptoms include myalgia, headache, body ache, fatigue, and sore throat. However, symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and anorexia point towards pneumonia and warrant medical evaluation, adds Dr Rohit. How to differentiate pneumonia from flu, COVID, dengueFever is the common symptom for all of them. âHowever, certain symptoms may provide important clues to the etiology. Fever, in Influenza as well as dengue, is often abrupt onset and high grade. In influenza, the common accompanying symptoms include dry cough, severe myalgia, nasal symptoms, sore throat, and headache. In dengue, commonly associated symptoms include myalgia, body ache, headache (particularly retro-orbital area), skin rash, etc. In COVID-19, fever is usually low grade and can be associated with symptoms such as dry cough, myalgia, headache, smell and taste abnormalities, diarrhea, skin rash, conjunctivitis, etc. Symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain may point toward pneumonia,â explains Dr Rohit. Dr. Shivanshu Raj Goyal, Consultant Respiratory, Pulmonology & Sleep Medicine, Artemis Hospital, Gurugram further adds, âPneumonia is as such a lung infection with white patch in chest X-ray. COVID on the other hand is a viral infection, it may or may not develop pneumonia. Patients mainly get coughs with fever and drop in oxygen levels. Flu such as seasonal or swine flu is more related to sore throat and headache with bodyache. Dengue cardinally comes with fever, headache and body ache. Drop in platelet count usually is seen after fever settles but a normal platelet count does not exclude dengue.âRead more: Which COVID symptoms are lasting the longest and shortest right now? Here's what experts say- Risk factorsThose in the age group of above 65 years and below 3 years are at an increased risk of pneumonia. There can be a host of reasons behind a person getting pneumonia. Virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites, there are many micro organisms that can be held responsible. âThe cause of pneumonia varies for community-acquired infections (infections outside settings) and nosocomial pneumonia (i.e., infection in hospital settings),â adds Dr Rohit. Other risk factors are old age, alcohol consumption, smoking, comorbidities like diabetes, chronic lung and heart disease, immunocompromised conditions and even epidemiological exposure to certain organisms like bird exposure, bat or bird dropping, contaminated water etc. Vaccination status is another risk factor- like Streptococcal pneumoniae, Influenza virus, SARS CoV-2.Read more The most common COVID symptom right nowPrevention is keyJust like any other illness, prevention is the main component to reduce morbidity and mortality related to pneumonia.

File photo Article continues below advertisement ↴ Along with reminders to keep COVID-19 vaccines up to date, the Saskatchewan Health Authority is reminding Saskatchewan residents not to forget about flu season. In a release, the SHA says early indications are that influenza 2023 is likely to return to pre-COVID-19 levels or higher. COVID restrictions kept flu outbreaks in check, but the concern is that flu cases, in tandem with ongoing COVID-19 transmission, will put additional pressure on the system. "The flu shot will not protect you from COVID-19, and the COVID-19 vaccine will not protect you from influenza. Right now both viruses are circulating, which is why it is important to be up to date with both vaccines, protecting yourself and those around you,” noted Dr. Tania Diener, Medical Health Officer for Regina and COVID-19 Immunization Co-Chief, for the Saskatchewan Health Authority. Indications from southern countries like Australia, who are just emerging from their flu season, are showing data that this was the worst in five years. Getting a flu shot is especially important for people at high-risk of influenza complications (pregnant women, young children, elderly residents 65 years of age and older, persons with underlying health conditions, immune-compromised) and their caregivers, notes the Health Authority. Seniors often have chronic health conditions, like heart or lung disease or diabetes, and weaker immune systems which makes them more vulnerable to complications from influenza. This year, a high dose influenza vaccine is available to all residents age 65 and older. Any resident aged six months and older are eligible to get the flu shot and immunization against COVID-19.

More penguins have died from avian flu at the colony at Cape Town’s Boulders beach, a popular tourist attraction and an important breeding site in South Africa, raising concerns for the species and for other seabirds. David Roberts, a clinical veterinarian at the South African Foundation For The Conservation Of Coastal Birds, said at least 28 out of around 3,000 penguins in the colony had died from the disease since the middle of August. “We have confirmed avian influenza in 14 African penguins since the middle of August,” Roberts said, adding that at least another 14 penguins were also affected but not tested for the virus. “This is a continuation of the outbreak that happened last year and it affects several different species of sea birds and at the moment we are quite concerned because the numbers of penguins that are being affected and dying from the disease is going up,” Roberts added. South African environmental authorities said on Sept 16 that the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza was similar to that detected last year among a range of wild seabirds, including Cape cormorants and common terns. Roberts said scientists were monitoring the situation because it was not clear how the outbreak would evolve. Daily Newspaper published by GPPC Doha, Qatar.

Starting October 11, flu shots will be administered at public health clinics, local pharmacies and some physician and nurse practitioner offices. “Getting your flu shot is a simple thing you can do to stay healthy and prevent transmission to friends and family – especially those most at risk for severe outcomes,” Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said. Residents will have the convenience of booking and receiving their flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same appointment again this year. All vaccinations are voluntary. Being up-to-date on your COVID-19 booster doses is the best way to limit COVID-19 transmission rates this fall and winter. Children aged six months to five years can only be immunized at a SHA public flu clinic, public health office or by a physician or nurse practitioner. Only select physicians’ offices offer influenza and/or COVID-19 vaccines. This year, all residents 65 years of age and older are eligible to receive the Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccine. Previously, this vaccine was only provided to residents in long-term care and personal care homes. “Helping older adults maintain their health and wellness is a priority for our government,” Mental Health and Addictions, Seniors and Rural and Remote Health Minister Everett Hindley said. “We’re investing more than $4 million this year to expand access to free high-dose flu shots to all seniors in Saskatchewan.” Also new this year, residents will have the option of booking vaccinations for the entire family in one appointment through the SHA’s online booking tool available at www.4flu.ca. Individual and group bookings can also be made by telephone at 1-833-SASKVAX (1-833-727-5829). Participating Saskatchewan pharmacies will once again have influenza vaccinations available free of charge to any eligible resident of the province five years of age and older. Residents can also receive the COVID-19 vaccine at participating pharmacies at the same time.

Image Credit: Gulf News archives Dubai: Doctors in the UAE are reminding residents to take the flu shot now to get protected against the seasonal virus before the onset of winter. “Producing antibodies against influenza, a viral infection that attacks one’s respiratory system [nose, throat and lungs], will take around two weeks to develop. Getting a flu vaccine will not protect us 100 per cent from the virus, but it is the best way to prevent flu and avoid its complications,” Dr Zrinka Zderic Savatovic, general practitioner at HealthBay Polyclinic Dubai, told Gulf News. Dr Zrinka Zderic Savatovic She noted the best time to take flu vaccine is October. “It is this time of the year to get your best shot to avoid flu,” said Dr Savatovic, adding: “Influenza is a respiratory infection that is a potentially serious disease and can cause complications, particularly in young children, older adults and people with certain medical conditions leading to hospitalisation and sometimes even death.” Six months and above Dr Savatovic continued: “Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October those six months and older should get an influenza vaccine every season with rare exception. Babies younger than six months and people with severe allergic reactions to previous flu vaccine should not be vaccinated.” Dr Brijesh Bhardwaj, specialist and head of department - Internal Medicine at NMC Royal DIP, Dubai, also said: “Influenza vaccination is recommended for all people above six months of age and older, health care workers, young children with asthma and other respiratory diseases, heart disease, people with diabetes, patients with weak immunity, pregnant female.” Dr Brijesh Bhardwaj “Vaccines for the 2022-2023 season are quadrivalent vaccines, meaning they are against four different flu viruses, including influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and two influenza B viruses,” he added. Both doctors also advised that people with egg allergies and those who have had Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a severe paralysing illness) should talk to their doctor regarding flu vaccine recommendations for them. Side effects According to doctors, “common side effects from a flu shot include soreness, redness, and/or swelling where the shot was given, headache (low grade), fever, nausea, muscle ache and fatigue. The flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. “Life-threatening allergic reactions to flu shots are very rare. Signs of serious allergic reaction can include breathing problems, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after receiving the shot. This is why it is recommended to stay in the clinic for some time after the jab.” Lowering the risks Dr Nuran Nergiz, specialist family medicine at Canadian Specialist Hospital Dubai, noted anyone can get sick with flu – even healthy people. Serious complications related to flu can happen to anyone, at any age. But some people (65 years and older, those with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. She reiterated: “Seasonal flu vaccines are meant to protect against influenza that will be most common in the upcoming season. Everyone older than six months old is recommended to have one. Even though the vaccine is suggested to be given around September and October. It is possible to have it done until December or end of March.” “The jab does not only protect us from flu for six to eight months, but it also prevents people at risk from getting seriously ill from flu. In healthy adults the vaccine provides protective antigen rate in 80 per cent of the patients. Even though the rate is somewhat lower in elderly people, it is known that the vaccine reduces the complications and mortality of the flu,” Dr Nergiz underlined. Flu vs COVID-19 The three doctors also noted that it is “especially important to get the flu vaccine this season because the flu and COVID-19 cause similar symptoms. Flu vaccination could reduce symptoms that might be confused with those caused by COVID-19.” Influenza or flu and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus first identified in 2019 while flu is caused by infection with a flu virus. Flu vaccine is given to arm muscles or thighs for babies. Children who are getting a flu vaccine for the first time will need two doses at least four weeks apart, while children over nine years old are recommended to take one dose of a flu vaccine. The doctors reiterated: “Preventing flu and reducing the severity of flu illness and hospitalisations could also decrease the number of people needing to stay in the hospital. So, roll up your sleeves and get the flu jab now.” Flu symptoms Fever or malaise with chills and shivering, nasal congestion to runny nose. Sore throat, cough, myalgia (muscle aches and pain), headache, tiredness, fatigue and weakness. Some people may have vomiting and diarrhoea, though this is more common in children than adults. It is important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. Flu complications Most patients with flu recover in a maximum of two weeks, but some patients develop complications-like sinusitis, ear infection, pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, inflammation of heart muscles, brain, and muscles. Sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from flu, while pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either flu virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. People with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have flu, and people with chronic heart disease may experience a worsening of this condition triggered by flu.

The 54 cases are of a total 190 suspected cases countrywide. “The cases were reported mainly from Otjozondjupa region (24 out of 37 suspected cases), Khomas Region (24 out of 138 suspected cases), and Kavango East Region (6 out of 15 suspected cases). The cases were reported from July 2022 to date, of which some had been investigated for COVID-19 but tested negative,” said health executive director Ben Nangombe. Nangombe said the ministry is on high alert as it continues with surveillance activities across the country. “The Ministry underscores that there is no H1N1 or Swine Flu outbreak in Namibia, but rather an increase in seasonal Influenza A H1N1 cases, and this is expected,” he said, while appealing for calm. “The fact that we are in the flu season, it is expected that there will be more cases of flu and people should also note that this is a self-limiting disease in most cases, meaning it will resolve by itself,” he added. The ministry is thus urging people exhibiting signs and symptoms of the disease should have bed rest, take plenty of fluids and manage fever and cough with over-the-counter medication, seek medical attention only if you have a severe flu-like illness or if you develop difficulty in breathing. If infected, limit contact with others to prevent the spread of the infection. Namibia experienced a large-scale H1N1 outbreak in 2009-2010, where over 8000 suspected cases were reported, out of which 102 cases tested positive. One death was reported. The highest burden of epidemiologically linked cases was experienced in the northern regions of Ohangwena and Omusati, as well as //Kharas Region. Since then, sporadic upsurge of cases have been reported especially in 2018 to 2019 and of recent between August 2022 to present date, said Nangombe. “It is worth noting that this seasonal influenza is not a new flu virus, and equally important to note that there is no need for panic. The public is urged to remain calm and comply with the control measures put in place in order to contain and prevent further transmission. There is no need for panic, as this is not a new subtype of the flu strain,” he reiterated. H1N1 influenza is a viral acute respiratory infection in humans, often characterized by fever, headache myalgia and other flu-like symptoms. According to the ministry, H1N1 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral respiratory infections and can only be laboratory confirmed. Sporadic seasonal transmission has been encountered globally, including in Namibia. Influenza A H1N1 has been reclassified as a seasonal influenza virus after the 2009 pandemic. “H1N1 has been circulating globally all year round, however, cases peak from the winter season. Thus, it is not an uncommon occurrence for people to fall ill with flu-like symptoms from this particular strain. With the change in weather that Namibia is currently experiencing, a rise in cases is expected as well,” Influenza A H1N1 was previously referred to as ‘Swine flu’ during 2009 as it was of zoonotic origin and was transmitted from pigs to humans. However, after the 2009 outbreak, the pandemic transitioned into an epidemic and transmission evolved to the point where H1N1 is now being transmitted from humans to humans, and therefore it is now reclassified as a seasonal flu and not Swine flu. “The seasonal influenza vaccination is the best protection available against flu. The Influenza A H1N1 strain is included in the seasonal flu vaccine which is available in Namibia. However, the vaccine is only available in the private sector at the moment,” said Nangombe.
