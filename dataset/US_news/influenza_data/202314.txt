Understanding the dynamics of individual transmission is crucial to design effective control measures and ultimately reduce the burden caused by influenza outbreaks. In this study, we analyzed surveillance data from Kamigoto Island, Japan, a semi-isolated island population, to identify the drivers of influenza transmission during outbreaks. We used rapid influenza diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed surveillance data from Kamigoto island, Japan and estimated age-specific influenza relative illness ratios (RIRs) over eight epidemic seasons (2010/11 to 2017/18). We reconstructed the probabilistic transmission trees (i.e., a network of who-infected-whom) using Bayesian inference with Markov-chain Monte Carlo method and then performed a negative binomial regression on the inferred transmission trees to identify the factors associated with onwards transmission risk. Pre-school and school-aged children were most at risk of getting infected with influenza, with RIRs values consistently above one. The maximal RIR values were 5.99 (95% CI 5.23, 6.78) in the 7–12 aged-group and 5.68 (95%CI 4.59, 6.99) in the 4–6 aged-group in 2011/12. The transmission tree reconstruction suggested that the number of imported cases were consistently higher in the most populated and busy districts (Tainoura-go and Arikawa-go) ranged from 10–20 to 30–36 imported cases per season. The number of secondary cases generated by each case were also higher in these districts, which had the highest individual reproduction number (Reff: 1.2–1.7) across the seasons. Across all inferred transmission trees, the regression analysis showed that cases reported in districts with lower local vaccination coverage (incidence rate ratio IRR = 1.45 (95% CI 1.02, 2.05)) or higher number of inhabitants (IRR = 2.00 (95% CI 1.89, 2.12)) caused more secondary transmissions. Being younger than 18 years old (IRR = 1.38 (95%CI 1.21, 1.57) among 4–6 years old and 1.45 (95% CI 1.33, 1.59) 7–12 years old) and infection with influenza type A (type B IRR = 0.83 (95% CI 0.77, 0.90)) were also associated with higher numbers of onwards transmissions. However, conditional on being infected, we did not find any association between individual vaccination status and onwards transmissibility. Our study showed the importance of focusing public health efforts on achieving high vaccine coverage throughout the island, especially in more populated districts. The strong association between local vaccine coverage (including neighboring regions), and the risk of transmission indicate the importance of achieving homogeneously high vaccine coverage. The individual vaccine status may not prevent onwards transmission, though it may reduce the severity of infection.

It is estimated that about 3–5 million people suffer severe illness due to seasonal influenza, and influenza-associated infections are estimated to cause between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths every year (WHO)2. It is therefore a key to understand the drivers of influenza transmission and identify the interventions able to reduce the burden of influenza.Empirical and modeling studies have revealed a number of key characteristics of the spatial transmission of seasonal influenza over multiple seasons3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. The dynamics of human mobility patterns played a key role resulting in hierarchical transmission of influenza with short commuting responsible for wave-like transmission on a small geographical scale, while air travels was responsible for long-range seedings behaviors5,8,12. Seasonality, dominating influenza strain in each epidemic, humidity and temperature are also reported to affect the spatial dynamics of influenza10,14,15,16. These studies were conducted at a global, regional, or country level, with very limited representation to the transmission dynamics at smaller geographical levels, such as islands or cities. Analysis conducted at a smaller geographical granularity in areas with limited incoming transportation links may capture unique patterns of disease transmission that would not be visible in aggregated data at a larger scale.We studied patterns of influenza transmission using the unique fine scale linelist dataset collected in Kamigoto island, Japan. Kamigoto island is located on the western coast of Nagasaki prefecture in Japan, semi-isolated from mainland Japan due to limited transportation links. The setting is therefore ideal for understanding the driving force behind local transmission without being severely affected by interferences from other regions or long-distance mobility. We first calculated the relative illness ratios and attack rates between age groups to identify groups at greatest risk of infection. Secondly, we explored what factors were associated with the risk of onwards transmission. To do so, we inferred the network of who-infected-whom (i.e., probabilistic transmission trees) using a Bayesian approach, which resulted in a set of probabilistic transmission trees that we used to estimate the likely number of secondary cases caused by each case in our dataset. We then performed a negative binomial regression analysis on each inferred transmission network to identify factors associated with increased risk of onwards transmission.MethodsStudy settingThis study is a retrospective observational study over eight influenza seasons (2010/11 to 2017/18 seasons) in Kamigoto island. Kamigoto island is located on the western coast of Nagasaki prefecture, Japan. Kamigoto island has 39 districts, with approximately 22,000 residents in total. Population sizes of the districts range from 40 to over 3000 inhabitants. The island is semi-isolated due to its limited transportation links to mainland Japan. There is only one hospital within the island, which most of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases attended for the diagnosis of influenza during the study period. Aside from the hospital, there are six clinics on the island. Influenza-like cases and rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed influenza cases within the island were monitored by the ILI registry system as influenza surveillance. In Japan, influenza vaccination is recommended annually between late October to December. Routine vaccination is recommended to people aged 65 and above, and for high-risk population aged 60 and above. For children, influenza vaccination is not under compulsory vaccination according to the national immunization schedule of Japan.Data sourceThe study dataset is based on surveillance data and contains information on all patients who visited Kamigoto Hospital with RDT-confirmed influenza between October 2010 and April 2018 (8497 patients in total). In Japan, ILI and influenza had been under systematic surveillance following the new infectious disease control law effective since April 199917. An ILI case is defined as the sudden onset of fever over 38 °C, respiratory symptoms, and other systemic symptoms (fatigue, headache, or myalgia)18. All individuals with ILI symptoms visiting the hospital during influenza season were tested with a commercial RDT to diagnose influenza A- and B-positive cases as a routine practice. RDTs are widely used in Japan and can serve as a proxy of the total symptomatic influenza case in the population18. Sensitivity of RDTs in Japan is estimated to be relatively high: 72.9–96.4% across all the studies conducted in Japan19,20. Previous studies suggested that the reporting ratio of ILI and influenza cases were higher in Japan compared to other countries due to the wide use of RDTs21. In our dataset, 107 cases were not RDT positive but clinically diagnosed influenza, and only one case was coinfected (A + B). Cases with the history of travelling into/outside the island within 7 days prior to the onset were identified as import cases in the surveillance system. A total of 959 cases (11.2% of all the RDT-confirmed influenza cases) were recorded as epidemiologically identified imported cases.The surveillance dataset contains the age, sex, date of onset, date and result of RDT test of each case. In addition, the local health authorities and government collected data on influenza vaccination statuses, distribution of the age group of residents, influenza vaccination coverage by district and by age group in each season via the vaccination record system for the entire population on the island. Individuals were classified as ‘vaccinated’ if they were 14 days past vaccine administration. Postcode of residence was collected for influenza positive cases22. In the dataset, 134 cases (1.6% of total cases) had no post-code information recorded and thus were excluded in the reconstruction of transmission analysis. Demographic characteristics of the cases are presented in Fig. 1.Figure 1Map of Kamigoto island (each color represents a district), and demographic characteristics of the surveillance dataset of influenza, Kamigoto Island, Japan 2010/11–2017/18 influenza season.Full size imageRelative illness ratio (RIR)To identify the burden of age groups most infected by influenza, first we calculated the relative illness ratio (RIR). RIR is defined as the ratio of the percentage of influenza cases in age group i (seven age groups in this study: below 3 years old; 4–6; 7–12; 13–18; 19–64; 65–74; above 75 years old), to the percentage of the total population belonging to that ith age-group. The formula as follows.$$RIR_{i} = \frac{{{{C_{i} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{C_{i} } {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} {C_{j} } }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} {C_{j} } }}}}{{{{N_{i} } \mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{N_{i} } {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} {N_{j} } }}} \right. \kern-0pt} {\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} {N_{j} } }}}}$$\({C}_{i}\); number of influenza cases in age group i (n age groups), \({N}_{i}\); population size of age group i, Cj; total number of influenza cases, Nj; total population size.RIR values above 1 indicate excess risk of infection. Confidence interval (CIs) were calculated with the Poisson exact method23,24,25. More details about age-standardized relative illness ratio (RIR) were described in previous studies23,24,25.Probabilistic reconstruction of transmission chainsIn order to highlight determinants frequently associated with onward transmission, we had to reconstruct who-infected-whom during influenza outbreaks reported on Kamigoto Island. Transmission history can be reconstructed through contact-tracing investigations, where infected cases are asked who they had been in contact with over their infectious period. However, such contact-tracing investigations were not carried out as part of flu surveillance on Kamigoto island. Therefore, we needed an inference framework to estimate who-infected-whom using features available in the case data.Transmission tree reconstruction methods often require genetic sequences, and group cases according to how closely they are genetically related. However, we did not have access to genetic sequences in this analysis, only to epidemiological information (age groups, onset dates, location). We used the R package ‘‘o2geosocial” (v1.0.2)26, developed to infer who-infected-whom when genetic sequences are unavailable or uninformative. The package uses the age, location, type of influenza and onset date of each case, the distributions of influenza incubation period and generation time, and estimates of social contact patterns between age groups. It applies Bayesian inference using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method to jointly estimate the probabilistic transmission trees, and the importation status of each case in each region for each influenza season. The method implemented in the package generates transmission tree samples from the posterior distribution, with a likelihood function relying on various components.Influenza type componentInfluenza cases were either diagnosed clinically or by RDTs. RDTs can identify the type of influenza for a given nasopharyngeal swab sample as A, B, or both. We categorized cases in the dataset into Influenza A, B and ‘not attributed’ (clinically diagnosed and A + B coinfected cases) classes. In our model, we assumed that there can be a single type of influenza for each transmission tree. For each influenza (A or B) case, only cases from trees containing the same influenza type could be listed as potential infector, while cases coinfected with both types and clinically diagnosed (less than 1% of all cases) could belong to any tree. This reduced the pool of potential infectors for genotyped cases, and helped the model identify plausible transmission links.Age mixing componentWe used a social contact survey study conducted in Japan27 to estimate the probability of social contact between age groups. This contact survey was conducted in 2014 and included 1476 households covering all 47 prefectures in Japan. Contacts were grouped into 5-years age groups to derive the social contact matrix. We calculated the weighted average between weekday and weekend contact rates with 5:2 weights. The same matrix was used for all the seasons investigated and the impact of long school holidays on contact patterns was not considered.Conditional reporting ratioConditional report ratio refers to the likelihood of missing generation between two cases. It differs from the overall report ratio in that it describes the reporting ratio between reported cases (i.e., it does not consider entirely unreported transmission chains). Influenza surveillance data in Japan is assumed to be high given the cultures of patients-initiated diagnosis during the influenza season21. However, in this study, conditional report ratio was estimated using a beta distribution prior (mean 0.9, Standard Deviation: 0.08) as one of the parameters of the model.Time componentFor each case, the probabilistic distribution of infection date of each case was inferred from the reported date of onset and distribution of the incubation period. The probability of a case being infected by another case is estimated from generation time of influenza and the number of generations between the two cases. The distributions (shifted Weibull distribution) of incubation period (Mean: 1.63 days, SD: 0.26 days) and generation time (Mean: 3.2 days, SD:0.4 days) of influenza were taken from previous studies28,29. Given the distributions of the generation time and incubation period, we assumed that only cases reported less than 8 days prior to the report date of a case could be potential infectors for computational efficiency (Temporal pre-clustering, δ).Spatial componentThe estimates of the probability of transmission between regions were calculated using Stouffer’s rank model30,31. In the Stouffer’s rank method, rather than the absolute distance between the districts, the connectivity between the districts was estimated as the summed population of all the districts closer to district of infected case than the district of infector case. Stouffer’s distance is calculated as \({p}_{kl}= {m}_{l}^{c}*{(\frac{{m}_{k}}{\sum {i\in\Omega }_{kl} {m}_{i}})}^{a}\) , where m is the population size of the regions, and the regions are defined as$${\Omega }_{k,l}=\{i:0\le d(i,l)\le d(k,l)\}$$d (i,l) , d(k,l) ; distance between regions (i,l) and (k,l).Then the probability of a case from region l infected by a case from region k is$$s(kl)= \frac{{P}_{kl}}{{\sum }_{h}{P}_{hl}}=\frac{{\left(\frac{{m}_{k}}{\sum {i\in\Omega }_{kl} {m}_{i}}\right)}^{a}}{\sum h {\left(\frac{{m}_{k}}{\sum {i\in\Omega }_{kl} {m}_{i}}\right)}^{a}}$$The parameter \(a\) was estimated by the model. We chose to implement a Stouffer’s rank model rather than use a gravity model (which would depend on the absolute number of inhabitants per region and distance) because of the variance in the number of inhabitants per district on Kamigoto Island (from 40 to 3000 inhabitants). This variance would lead to populated areas causing an abnormally high number of transmissions in a gravity model, and underestimate within-region transmission in low populated areas. We assumed that only cases reported in a 100 km radius of a given case could be listed as potential infectors of this case for computational efficiency.Therefore, the overall log-likelihood that the case i was infected by case j, belonging to the transmission tree \({\tau }_{j}\) is estimated as27$${L}_{ji} \left({t}_{i},{t}_{j}, \theta \right)= log\left(p\left({\kappa }_{ij}|\Pi \right)*{w}^{\left(\kappa ji\right)} \left({t}_{i}-{t}_{j}\right)* {\alpha }^{\left(\kappa ji\right)} \left({\alpha }_{i}, {\alpha }_{j}\right)*G \left({g}_{i}, {g}_{{\tau }_{j}}\right)*{s}^{\left(\kappa ji\right)} \left({r}_{i}{r}_{j}|a\right)*f({t}_{i}- {T}_{i})\right)$$where, kij is the number of generations between cases \(i\) and \(j\), equal to 1 if \(j\) infected \(i\), equal to 2 if there is an unreported case between \(j\) and \(i\). \(G \left({g}_{i}, {g}_{{\tau }_{j}}\right)\) is the likelihood associated with the influenza type (equal to 0 if \({g}_{i}!={g}_{{\tau }_{j}}\), 1 otherwise, and where \({g}_{i}\) is the influenza type reported for \(i\), while \({g}_{{\tau }_{j}}\) is the influenza type reported in the transmission tree \({\tau }_{j}\) containing \(j\)),\({\alpha }^{\left(\kappa ji\right)} \left({\alpha }_{i}, {\alpha }_{j}\right)\) is the age component (with \({\alpha }_{i}\) and \({\alpha }_{j}\) the age groups of cases \(i\) and \(j\)),\({s}^{\left(\kappa ji\right)} \left({r}_{i}{r}_{j}|a\right)\) is the spatial component (with \({r}_{i}\) and \({r}_{j}\) the regions of residence of \(i\) and \(j\), and \(a\) the parameter of the Stouffer’s rank spatial kernel),\(p\left({\kappa }_{ij}|\Pi \right)\) is the likelihood of the conditional report ratio (with \(\Pi\) the conditional report ratio of the tree).\(w^{{\left( {\kappa ji} \right)}} \left( {t_{i} - t_{j} } \right)*f\left( {t_{i} - T_{i} } \right)\) is the time component (with \({t}_{i}\) and \({t}_{j}\) the estimated infection dates of \(i\) and \(j\), \({T}_{i}\) the reported onset date of \(i\), \(w\) the distribution of the generation time, and \(f\) the distribution of the incubation period).Cases identified by the surveillance data as importations and cases with no plausible infectors (i.e., no other case reported within the temporal pre-clustering threshold \(\delta\) (8 days), and with the spatial pre-clustering threshold \(\gamma\) (100 km radius)) were set as importations in the model. In addition, we used the importation threshold (λ) as defined in the package o2geosocial to infer the importation status of cases that were not previously identified as importations. In o2geosocial, for each case and iteration, connections with a likelihood below the importation threshold are defined as non-plausible and removed.The prior distributions used are listed in Table 1. We ran a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) with 40,000 iterations to sample from the probabilistic distribution of likely transmission trees. The first 5000 samples were discarded as burn-in and 1 in 50 samples were kept thinning the chain, leaving 700 sampled trees describing the posterior distribution (Supplementary S-Fig. 1). To assess the convergence of the MCMC chain, we run the chain with different initial values and observe their convergence to the same mean and variance for each parameter. The final convergence agreement is shown in the S-Fig. 1. The posterior distribution of the parameters was consistent throughout the chain. The reconstructed cluster size distribution in the inferred trees is shown in supplementary S-Fig. 2. The maps describing the spatial distribution of transmission and importation risks were plotted at the post-code level using the shapefile of the Kamigoto Island obtained from ESRI Japan’s website22.Table 1 Parameters used in the Bayesian analysis.Full size tableRegression analysis to identify factors associated with onwards transmissionThe inferred probabilistic transmission trees were then used to identify factors consistently associated with increased risks of onwards transmission. To do so, we implemented a negative binomial regression analysis on each sampled transmission tree kept from the MCMC and pooled the results together. The outcome variable of the analysis was the number of onwards transmission per case. The sociodemographic variables used as explanatory variables were: (1) age group, (2) vaccination status, (3) vaccine coverage in the district of the reported case, (4) type of flu (5) number of inhabitants in the district of the reported case, (6) mean household size, (7) average vaccination coverage in neighboring districts, (8) epidemic year, and (9) within-year seasonality (sin and co-sin).We grouped the age of cases into categories: < 3, 4–6, 7–12, 13–18, 19–64, 65–74 and ≥ 75 years-old. Individual vaccination status was categorized as vaccinated, unvaccinated, and unknown. We controlled for the impact of seasonality (the peak of the influenza in each influenza season) on transmission by adding two covariates (sine–cosine) in the regression analysis. The vaccination coverage in nearby district was defined as the population- and district-wise average coverage in the neighbors of each region.The regression was run independently on each transmission network sampled from the MCMC (i.e., 700 samples, obtained after removing the burn-in phase and thinning the chain). The coefficients were then pooled together following “Rubin’s rules” to identify factors consistently associated with increased transmission risks across all samples32. We examined collinearity among the variables before running the regression models. We run different models to evaluate the robustness of our results: in model II, we categorized the population per district and vaccine coverage variables, and in model III, we also removed the seasonality variables.All analyses were performed with R software, version 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing)33.Ethics approvalThis study is a secondary analysis of data collected as part of routine surveillance of influenza in Japan.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of influenza cases by RDT-confirmed influenza type. A-H3N2 subtype dominated in majority of the seasons, while influenza B subtype dominated in 2017/18. (Fig. 2, supplementary S-Table 1).Figure 2Weekly incidence of RDT-confirmed influenza cases in Kamigoto Island, Japan 2010/11–2017/18 influenza seasons.Full size imageTo assess which age groups were more likely to be infected, we calculated the relative illness ratio (RIR) of each age group in each epidemic season (Fig. 3). Consistently across all epidemics, RIRs were higher in the pre-school and school children age-group (below 19 years old). The RIR was lower in other age groups in all epidemic seasons. The attack rate was highest among school-aged children (4–6, 7–12 and 13–18) years old across all the epidemic seasons (Supplementary S-Table 2).Figure 3Relative illness ratio of influenza.Full size imageReconstruction of probabilistic transmission treesWe used the R package o2geosocial to infer who-infected-whom among cases reported between 2010 to 2018 and estimate the number of secondary transmissions per case. The conditional report ratio ranged between 86 and 91% (Supplementary S-Fig. 1). The inference method therefore considered that most of the reported transmission chains captured by the surveillance data were complete, with a low risk of missed generation between reported cases. The spatial parameter ranged between 1.6 and 1.7 (Supplementary S-Fig. 1), which corresponds to a decrease in the probability of connection between regions as the number of inhabitants living in the area between these two regions increases. Figure 4 shows the inferred distribution of imported cases in each district for each season. There were 1050 cases classified as importations in the inferred transmission trees over the study period. MCMC inference therefore identified an additional 91 imported cases which were not classified as imports in the epidemiological data. These 91 cases were cases with no plausible infector and highlight the good performance of the surveillance system. The regions associated with most importations were consistent across epidemic seasons. Three districts (Tainoura-go, Arikawa-go, and Aokata-go) were estimated to have recorded most imported cases (orange and red) across the seasons. Tainoura-go and Arikawa-go are the main port areas of the island and are therefore the main connection from and to areas outside the Kamigoto island. Aogata-go is a more urban area of the town and the district and contains Kamigoto hospital, the only hospital within the island. Arikawa-go and Aogata-go districts are the tourist attractions within the island. The district on the southern part of the island (Narao-go), another port area, was also suggested to have large number of imports in alternate years examined. We also found a gradual increase in the overall number of imported cases over the years studied (73 import cases in 2010/11 to 201 import cases in 2017/18).Figure 4Median number of imported cases stratified by district and by season (2010/11–2017/18).Full size imageWe then used the set of inferred transmission trees to compute the average number of secondary cases per primary case or individual reproduction number (Reff) in each district. The geographical distribution of individual reproduction number (Reff) was very similar across the epidemic seasons (Fig. 5). The districts at higher risks of importations also consistently had the highest individual reproduction number (Reff ≥ 1.2) (Fig. 5, Supplementary S-Fig. 4). The Reff was below 0.8 in the majority of the remaining districts, with localized outbreaks causing increases in the number of secondary cases per case in certain years (e.g., in the south of the island in 2014/15 and 2017/18) (Fig. 5, supplementary S-Fig. 3). We categorized the average number of secondary cases for each case, as: (1) no onward transmission, (2) moderate transmitters (1–3 cases), or (3) high transmitters (more than 3 cases). Preschool (< 3 years old), adult (19–64) and older age group (65–74, > 74 years old) had lower onward transmission while the school age group (4–6, 7–12 and 13–18) were more likely to have higher number of secondary cases generated (supplementary S-Fig. 5 and S-Fig. 6). The probability of transmission between and within district are displayed in supplementary S-Fig. 7.Figure 5Median number of secondary cases per each influenza case, stratified by district and by season (2010/11–2017/18).Full size imageDeterminants of onwards transmissionNext, we identified the factors consistently associated with increases in the risk of onwards transmission across the inferred transmission trees. In each transmission tree from the posterior distribution (i.e., 700 samples), we computed the number of secondary transmissions per case, and ran a negative binomial regression analysis to explore characteristics associated with the risk of onwards transmission. The coefficients were then pooled across all regressions.We found that age, number of inhabitants per district, district- level vaccination coverage, type of influenza and epidemic season had significant associations with the number of secondary cases per case (Table 2). Pre-school and school-aged children (aged 4–18) were significantly associated with higher secondary cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21, 1.57), 1.45 (95% CI 1.33, 1.59), and 1.51 (95% CI 1.37, 1.66) compared to the adult (aged 19–64) group. On the contrary, adults over 65 years were associated with significantly fewer secondary cases (IRR = 0.72 (95% CI 0.58, 0.89) in aged 65–74 and 0.76 (95% CI 0.63, 0.91) in aged 75 years and over).Table 2 Association factors to the number of secondary cases generated, Kamigoto island, Japan, 2010/11–2017/18.Full size tableCases living in districts that achieved lower vaccine coverage were more likely to cause further transmission (IRR = 1.45 (95% CI 1.02, 2.05)). There was a significant positive association between the number of inhabitants per district and the number of onwards transmissions (IRR = 2.00 (95% CI 1.89, 2.12)). The average proportion of unvaccinated individuals in neighboring regions was also associated with an increased risk of secondary transmissions 2.41 (95% CI 1.11, 5.21). Type B influenza were less likely to generate more secondary transmission compared to type A influenza (IRR = 0.83 (95% CI 0.77, 0.90)). Epidemic seasons 2015/16 and 2017/18 were associated with higher transmission compared to 2010/11 (IRR = 1.28 (95% CI 1.06, 1.54), 1.31 (95% CI 1.01, 0.57) respectively). There was no significant association between individual vaccination status, mean household size, seasonality and onwards transmission. The results were consistent with different models. (Supplementary S-Table 3).DiscussionWe analysed the dynamics of influenza transmission in a remote island setting in Japan (Kamigoto Island), using fine scale influenza surveillance data collected between 2010 and 2018. Kamigoto island provides a unique opportunity to explore the dynamics of influenza transmission in an heterogenous population, with limited mobility. We analysed the age-specific influenza burden, the importation status of the cases, and the risk of secondary transmission for each case by reconstructing transmission trees using a Bayesian approach. We also explored factors associated with onwards influenza transmission.The result from our study adds to the evidence that children play an important role in influenza outbreaks34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42. Across all epidemic seasons, pre-school, and school-aged children (i.e., 4–18-year-old) were infected at higher rate than the other age groups (Fig. 3). Previous studies have reported that age distribution patterns vary between the influenza subtypes/lineages, with school-aged children most likely to be affected by A(H3N2) and B15,36. In Japan A(H3N2) was the dominant subtypes in four of the eight seasons, A/H1N1pmd09 in three seasons (2010/11, 2013/14 and 2015/2016) whereas B was predominant 2017/18 (supplementary S-Table 1). We also found that school-aged children were associated with the highest number of secondary cases generated. This is in line with studies reporting that social contact rates within the same age group is higher among school-aged children27,34. On the other hand, we found that adults over 65 years-old were associated with the lowest influenza attack rate, and lower risks of onwards transmission. Similar results were previously reported in a study conducted in Italy15.Our study highlighted that vaccination had different impacts on influenza dynamics. Firstly, high vaccine coverage in a district was consistently associated with lower levels of transmission, highlighting the importance of vaccination campaigns to reduce the risks of outbreaks through direct and indirect protection. Moreover, high vaccine coverage in regions neighboring a given district were also associated with reduced transmission risks. This may show the importance of reaching homogeneously high vaccine coverage, rather than focusing on a limited number of districts, to reduce opportunities for onward transmission. However, the spatial heterogeneity of the median number of secondary cases per region shows that active transmission clusters was only observer around a limited number of districts (Fig. 5). More analysis, potentially using mechanistic transmission models, is needed to compare the impact of different vaccination strategies.In this study, the vaccine status of the individual cases was not associated with changes in the risk of secondary cases, suggesting that while vaccination is protective against infection, it might not necessarily prevent onwards transmission if breakthrough infection happens. A study conducted among children in Matsumoto city, Japan also reported an association between vaccination and reduction in susceptibility, with vaccination having a more limited association with onwards transmission43. Recently published studied also reported the low degree of indirect protection by childhood vaccination supporting the results of the current study44.The RIR and attack rate was highest among school-aged children despite very high childhood vaccination coverage in the island (Supplementary S-Table 4). RIR and attack rate was lowest among the elderly age group (> 65 years old), and the vaccination coverage among these age group were above 70% in almost all epidemic seasons (Supplementary S-Table 2 and S-Table 4). The highest attack rates among children implies that their higher number of contacts was not fully offset by the high immunization rates. The majority of the reported cases were vaccinated, which indicates that although it does provide protection, the efficacy of the vaccine is not perfect. Previous studies on vaccine effectiveness reported the negative impact of repeated vaccination in children without prior history of natural infection45,46,47,48. The type of influenza vaccine may also play a role, since Japan uses the inactivated influenza vaccine while other countries (for example: UK)42,49 use live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Similar results were previously reported when comparing the incidence among age groups with vaccination status in the United States: estimated incidence for children below 18 years old was 8.7% while it was 5.1% for adults after adjustment for median vaccine coverage and effectiveness50.To summarise, our study reveals different effects of vaccination on influenza transmission in Kamigoto Island: Firstly, although the proportion of vaccinated cases in our dataset implies that the protection provided by vaccines may not be perfect, cases reported in highly vaccinated regions were associated with lower risk of secondary transmission. This suggests that the protection provided by high vaccine coverage in a region did minimize opportunities for onward transmission (by reducing the pool of susceptible individuals available to be infected). Vaccination history of cases (i.e. conditioned that they were infected) were not associated with lower risk of onward transmission, showing that although the vaccine may provide protection against infection, we cannot conclude that it provided significant protection against onward transmission from those who experienced a ‘breakthrough’ infection.The inferred transmission trees suggested that the distribution of influenza transmission within the island was similar across the epidemic seasons with the same districts having the highest number of importation and secondary transmissions per case (Arikawa-go, Tainoura-go, Aogata-go and Narao-go). With the presence of the ports connecting the islands to mainland Japan, major tourists’ attraction sides of the island, and the highest number of inhabitants, these districts provide the best opportunities for the influenza transmission in the community. Moreover, people residing within the island but working outside (e.g., Nagasaki city) need to take a ferry from these ports to commute daily to their workplaces. This connectivity to the outside of the island likely contributes to the importation of influenza into the island.The determinants of onward transmission identified by the regression analysis were consistent throughout all samples generated in the transmission tree inference. The Bayesian inference model, implemented using o2geosocial, was able to identify a robust history of transmission from routinely collected surveillance data (location, age, timing of disease onset). The different parameters estimated in the MCMC converged to consistent means and variances. The sampled transmission tree could not be compared to sequence data or contact tracing investigations to assess their accuracy, however, the results and estimates from the inference are in line with prior results, for instance on the high number of infectious contacts among children27, or the low risk of unreported cases in Japan39, and were robust to sensitivity analysis. We believe this indicates that our findings are reliable. This analysis is therefore an example of how even limited surveillance data can be used to reconstruct complex dynamics of transmission, highlight factors associated with transmission, and inform how to limit the risks of flu outbreak.There are several limitations to our study. First, we assumed the same reporting rates across all the seasons we analyzed. Second, influenza transmission is suggested to be influenced by some meteorological variables such as temperature, absolute humidity and precipitation16,51. We did not consider these factors in our analysis. Third, we did not account for the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as mask wearing and hand hygiene. The period of school closure can also have impact on the transmission dynamics; however, this was not included this in our study. Lastly, district with higher proportion of children may influence the onwards transmissibility and higher infection rates. However, we do not have access to the distribution of age group by district.ConclusionOur study used geospatial method to better describe spatiotemporal patterns in a fine-scale epidemiological setting. We show that age, population density, local vaccination coverage, and dominant strain of influenza play a significant role in shaping recurrent influenza spatial patterns across the seasons studied. The local vaccine coverage was found to be strongly associated with the risk of onwards transmission, highlighting the importance to focus public health efforts on achieving high vaccine coverage throughout the island or prioritizing vaccination in areas with high transmission rates. The individual vaccine status may not prevent onwards transmission, though it reduces the susceptibility to infection. Thus, the other social precaution measures such as social distancing, handwashing, and wearing a mask must be practiced once someone is infected. Similar analysis could potentially be reproduced in similar settings (e.g. Oceania and pacific island countries), to study the transmission of influenza or other infectious disease such as COVID-19.

In New York, as of the week ending March 25, of the 2,013 samples subtyped, 64.16% were identified as influenza B, state health department data shows.Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, told ABC News that it's not surprising to see an uptick of influenza B toward the end of the flu season.Percentage of Positive Influenza TestsCDCHowever, due to few to no cases of influenza reported during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, people may have forgotten how the flu normally behaves."We have to remember that, overall, we're returning to a somewhat normal respiratory virus season," said Brownstein, an ABC News contributor. "Influenza B is often later in the season. ... It's not a surprise at all that we're seeing flu B and, as part of our return to normal, we have to remember that flu still has an impact on population health."Since the beginning of the year, hospital admissions for flu have been declining, from 12,883 the week ending Jan. 7 to 1,222 the week ending March 25.Brownstein said the decline of other viruses as helped prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed but advised Americans to stay vigilant."Right now, the hospitals are benefiting from a little bit of a break," he said. "We do have more breathing room in our hospitals than we have in the past, and that's thankful, because that means that we can perform elective procedures, that means that our frontline health care workers are getting a little bit of a breather."MORE: Flu cases, hospitalizations, deaths continue to surge across USBrownstein added, "We still have COVID circulating, there's still other viruses that are still creating capacity challenges. A bad flu B peak could bring us right back to some of those capacity concerns."There are four types of influenza -- A, B, C and D -- however, A and B are the most common and cause seasonal epidemics in people, what we refer to as "fu season."However, flu activity across the U.S. remains in the "low" category and there Is currently no evidence that influenza B is more dangerous or more worrisome than Influenza A or any other strain."It just highlights the fact that, we still need to be vigilant about respiratory viruses, to being vaccinated against flu is still important," said Brownstein.According to the CDC's weekly flu vaccination dashboard, about 48.3% of U.S. adults reported receiving a flu shot as of mid-February, higher than the 45.1% who reported doing so the same time last year.Flu and coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine signage is seen at a pharmacy in New York, Jan. 5, 2023.Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, about 54.9% of all children in the U.S. are currently vaccinated against flu by the end of March, about the same as March 2022.The federal health agency said flu vaccines are still very effective at preventing hospitalization and death. Flu vaccines administered this season reduced the risk of influenza A-related hospitalization among children by nearly three quarters and among adults by nearly half, the CDC said.Brownstein said while it's never too late for someone who hasn't gotten the flu vaccine yet to be immunized, there will be availability issues as pharmacies and doctors' offices give out their final doses."You will be challenged by availability and, of course, the longer you wait, the further the value of that vaccine is diminished," Brownstein said. "The value keeps going down the longer you wait."ABC News' Emma Egan and Youri Benadjaoudi contributed to this report.Related TopicsFlu SeasonPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second term4 hours agoSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsA radical change to the flu vaccine may be coming - The AtlanticSkip to contentSite NavigationThe AtlanticPopularLatestNewslettersSectionsPoliticsIdeasFictionTechnologySciencePhotoBusinessCulturePlanetGlobalBooksAudioHealthEducationProjectsFeaturesFamilyEventsWashington WeekProgressNewslettersExplore The Atlantic ArchivePlay The Atlantic crosswordListen to Podcasts and ArticlesThe Print EditionLatest IssuePast IssuesGive a GiftSearch The AtlanticQuick LinksDear TherapistCrossword PuzzleMagazine ArchiveYour SubscriptionPopularLatestNewslettersSign InSubscribeScienceThe Flu May Never Be the SameScientists haven’t spotted one of influenza’s most mysterious lineages for more than three years. Is it truly gone?By Katherine J. WuIllustration by The Atlantic. Source: Science History Images / Alamy.April 7, 2023 ShareSave In March 2020, Yamagata’s trail went cold.The pathogen, one of the four main groups of flu viruses targeted by seasonal vaccines, had spent the first part of the year flitting across the Northern Hemisphere, as it typically did. As the seasons turned, scientists were preparing, as they typically did, for the virus to make its annual trek across the equator and seed new outbreaks in the globe’s southern half.That migration never came to pass. As the new coronavirus spread, pandemic-mitigation measures started to squash flu-transmission rates to record lows. The drop-off was so sharp that several flu lineages may have gone extinct, among them Yamagata, which hasn’t been definitively detected in more than three years despite virologists’ best efforts to root it out.Read: The pandemic broke the fluYamagata’s disappearance could still be temporary. “Right now, we’re all just kind of holding our breath,” says Adam Lauring, a virologist at the University of Michigan Medical School. The virus might be biding its time in an isolated population, escaping the notice of tests. But the search has stretched on so fruitlessly that some experts are ready to declare it officially done. “It’s been missing for this long,” says Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, a virologist at Hong Kong University. “At this point, I would really think it’s gone.”If Yamagata remains AWOL indefinitely, its absence would have at least one relatively straightforward consequence: Researchers might no longer need to account for the lineage in annual vaccines. But its vanishing act could have a more head-spinning implication. Flu viruses, which have been plaguing human populations for centuries, are some of the most well-known and well-studied threats to our health. They have prompted the creation of annual shots, potent antivirals, and internationally funded surveillance programs. And yet, scientists still have some basic questions about why they behave as they do—especially about Yamagata and its closest kin.Yamagata, in many ways, has long been an underdog among underdogs. The lineage is one of two in a group called influenza B viruses, and it’s slower to evolve and transmit, and is thus sometimes considered less troublesome, than its close cousin Victoria. As a pair, the B’s are also commonly regarded as the wimpier versions of flu.To be fair, the competition is stiff. Flu B’s are constantly being compared with influenza A viruses—the group that contains every flu subtype that has caused a pandemic in our recent past, including the extraordinarily deadly outbreak of 1918. Seasonal flu epidemics, too, tend to be heavily dominated by flu A’s, especially H3N2 and H1N1, two notably tough-to-target strains that feature prominently in each year’s vaccine. Even H5N1, the flavor of avian influenza that’s been devastating North America’s wildlife, is a member of the pathogen’s A team.Read: Eagles are falling, bears are going blindB viruses, meanwhile, don’t have a particularly daunting résumé. “To our knowledge, there has never been a B pandemic,” says John Paget, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research. Only once every seven seasons or so does a B virus dominate. And although A and B viruses sometimes tag-team the winter, causing twin outbreaks spaced out by a few weeks, these seasons often open with a major flu A banger and then close out with a more muted B coda.The reasons underlying these differences are still pretty murky, though scientists do have some hints. Whereas flu A viruses are known as especially speedy shape-shifters, constantly spawning genetic offshoots that vie to outcompete one another, flu B’s evolve at oddly plodding rates. Their sluggish approach makes it easier for our immune system to recognize the viruses when they reappear, resulting in longer-lasting protection, more effective vaccines, and fewer reinfections than are typical with the A’s. Those molecular differences also seem to drive differences in how and when the viruses spread. The A’s tend to trouble people repeatedly from birth to death, and are great at globe-trotting. But B’s, perhaps because immunity against them is easier to come by, more often concentrate among kids, many of whom have never encountered the viruses before—and who are usually more resilient to respiratory viruses and travel less than adults, keeping outbreaks mostly regional. That might also help explain why B epidemics so frequently lag behind A’s: Slower pathogen evolution facing off with more durable host immunity add up to less rapid B spread, while their A colleagues rush ahead. Our bodies also seem to mount rather fiery defenses against A viruses, steeling them against other infections in the weeks that follow and deepening the disadvantage against any B’s trailing behind. All of that means flu B has a hard time catching humans off guard.The virus’s host preferences, too, make flu A viruses more dangerous. Those lineages are great at hopscotching among a whole menagerie of species—most infamously, pigs and wild, water-loving birds—sometimes undergoing rapid bursts of evolution as they go. But flu B’s seem to almost exclusively infect humans, igniting only the rare and fast-resolving outbreak in a limited number of other species—a few seals here, a handful of pigs there. Spillovers from wild creatures into humans are the roots of global outbreaks. And so, with its zoonotic bent, “influenza A will always be the main focus” of concern, says Carolien van de Sandt, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, in Melbourne. Even among some scientists, Yamagata and Victoria register as little more than literal B-list blips.Plenty of other experts, though, think flu B’s relative obscurity is misguided—perhaps even a bit dangerous. Flu B’s account for roughly a quarter of annual flu cases, many of which lead to hospitalization and death; they seem hardier than their A cousins against certain antiviral drugs. And scientists simply know a lot less about flu B’s: how, precisely, they interact with the immune system; what factors influence their sluggish evolutionary rate; the nuances of their person-to-person spread; their oddball animal-host range. And that lack of intel on what has for decades been a formidable infectious foe creates a risk all on its own.Flu lineages have dipped into relative obscurity before only to come roaring back. After the end of the H2N2 pandemic of the late 1950s, H1N1 appeared to flame out—only to reemerge nearly two decades later to greet a population full of young people whose immune systems hadn’t glimpsed it before. And as recently as the 1990s, the B lineage Victoria underwent a years-long ebb in most parts of the world, before ricocheting back to prominence in the early 2000s.As far as researchers can tell, Victoria is alive and well; during the globe’s most recent winter seasons, the lineage appears to have ignited late-arriving outbreaks in several countries, including South Africa, Malaysia, and various parts of Europe. But based on the viral sequences that researchers have isolated from people sick with flu, Yamagata is still nowhere to be found, says Saverio Caini, a virologist at the cancer research center ISPRO, in Italy.The lineage was already teetering on a precipice before the pandemic began, van de Sandt told me. Yamagata and Victoria, which splintered apart in the early 1980s, are still closely related enough that they often compete for the same hosts. And just prior to 2020, Victoria, the more diverse and fleet-footed of the two B lineages, had been reliably edging out its cousin, pushing Yamagata’s prevalence down, down, down. That trend, coupled with several years of use of a well-matched Yamagata strain in the seasonal flu vaccine, meant that Yamagata “had already decreased in incidence and circulation,” van de Sandt said. With the odds so steeply stacked, the addition of pandemic mitigations may have been the final factor that snuffed the lineage out.Recently, a few countries—including China, Pakistan, and Belize—have tentatively reported possible Yamagata infections. But there’s been no conclusive genetic proof, several experts told me. Several parts of the world, including the United States, regularly use flu vaccines containing active flu viruses that can trip the same viral tests that the wild, disease-causing pathogens do. “So the reports could be contaminations,” van de Sandt said. Scientists would need to scour the virus’s genetic sequences to distinguish infection from vaccination; those data, however, haven’t emerged.Should the Yamagata dry spell continue, researchers may want to start considering snipping the lineage out of vaccines altogether, perhaps as early as the middle or end of this year. Doing so would punt the world back to the early 2010s, when flu shots were trivalent—designed to protect people against two A viruses, H3N2 and H1N1, plus either Victoria or Yamagata, depending on which lineage researchers forecasted would surge more. (They were often wrong.) Or maybe the space once used for Yamagata could feasibly be filled with another flavor of H3N2, the fastest mutator of the bunch.But purging Yamagata from the vaccine would be a gamble. If Yamagata is not gone for good, van de Sandt worries that booting it from the vaccine would leave the world vulnerable to a massive and deadly outbreak. Even Dhanasekaran, who is among the researchers who are fairly confident that we’ve seen the last of Yamagata, told me he doesn’t want to rule out the possibility that the virus is cloistering in an immunocompromised person with a chronic infection, and it’s unclear if it could reemerge from such a hiding place. The only thing scientists can do for now is be patient, says Jayna Raghwani, a computational biologist at the University of Oxford. “If we don’t see it in successive seasons for another two to three years, that will be more convincing,” she told me.If Yamagata’s death knell has actually rung, though, it will have reverberating effects. There’s no telling, for instance, how other flu lineages might be affected by their colleague’s supposed retirement. Perhaps Victoria, which can swap genetic material with Yamagata, will evolve more slowly without its partner. At the same time, Victoria may have an easier time infecting people now that it no longer needs to compete as often for hosts.If Yamagata has gone to pasture, “there won’t be a ceremony declaring the world Yamagata free,” Lauring told me. And it’s easy, he points out, to forget things we don’t see. But even if Yamagata seems gone for now, the effects of its demise will be significant enough that it can’t be forgotten—not just yet.About the AuthorKatherine J.

Download PDF Copy By Tarun Sai LomteReviewed by Lily Ramsey, LLMApr 3 2023 A recent study published in the One Health Advances Journal discussed influenza A virus (IAV) infections in minks, emphasizing their contributionole as an intermediate host. Study: Mink infection with influenza A viruses: an ignored intermediate host? Image Credit: shauttra/Shutterstock.com Background IAVs infect different hosts, including humans, birds, and marine mammals. Studies have demonstrated mink infection with IAV subtypes and viral transmission via aerosols. Mink infection with avian H5N1, H9N2, H5N6, and human or swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses has been reported. Sequence data from the Global Initiative for Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) repository shows that the rate of IAV detection in mink has increased considerably over the past decade. Although minks are highly susceptible to IAV infection, outbreaks with severe outcomes are rare. Studies suggest that animal feed containing pork and poultry by-products might be responsible for mink infection with swine/avian IAVs. In contrast, mink infection with the human influenza virus could be due to transmission from farm workers. In the present study, the authors summarized the evidence on mink infections with IAVs, focusing on their role as intermediate hosts. Mink infection with emergent viruses China has witnessed multiple outbreaks of viral infections in mink farms since 2010. A novel orthoreovirus was detected in Hebei, with a mortality rate of 5%. In 2014, a swine pseudorabies outbreak was documented in Shandong, with a high rate of mortality estimated at 87%. Newcastle disease virus was responsible for pneumonia and hemorrhagic encephalitis in mink in 2014. Related StoriesUS study uncovers antiviral resistance in swine-origin influenza, urging enhanced pandemic surveillanceStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaCOVID-19 pandemic led to significant decline in cardiac arrest survival ratesIn 2015, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 caused outbreaks in two farms in China, with mortality estimated at 56% and 64%, respectively. Mink infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has increased, particularly in North American and European countries. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from infected minks to humans was documented in Denmark and the Netherlands. Reassortment and adaptation are suggested as critical for zoonotic influenza viruses in humans. In addition, co-infection with different viruses in animals/humans might result in novel strains with pandemic potential. Pigs are considered the mixing vessel as they harbor receptors for human and avian influenza viruses. Likewise, minks exhibit a similar feature, as they have both sialic acid α2,3-galactose (SA α2,3-Gal) and SA α2,6-Gal receptors for avian and human strains, respectively. Therefore, minks could represent another mixing vessel for novel strain(s). Mink farms and infectious diseases Neovison vison, the American mink, is an important species for the fur-farming industry. China, Poland, Denmark, and the Netherlands are the major fur-producing countries. Most minks (80%) in China are farmed in the Shandong province. Minks are densely populated on these farms and likely sheltered in a single facility/building. Thus, infectious diseases occur due to intensive farming, inadequate biosecurity, and poor sanitation. Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) is notable for its devastating effects on the adult reproductive system and the subsequent impact on fur quality. Gastroenteric and respiratory symptoms are caused due to canine distemper virus (CDV), SARS-CoV-2, and mink enteritis virus (MEV). Bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are implicated in hemorrhagic pneumonia. Molecular and serologic features of influenza virus infection in minks Sequences from the GISAID repository show that IAVs detected in minks are phylogenetically related to prevailing human, avian, and swine strains. H9N2 and H5N6/H5N1 have been the predominant mink influenza virus subtypes in China since 2013. Genetic analyses revealed that all H9N2 viruses detected in minks belonged to G9/Y280 lineage, prevalent in poultry. All H5N1 and H5N6 subtypes detected in China and Spain, except for one H5N1 subtype in Sweden, were likely introduced in minks from infected poultry. Molecular analyses revealed mammalian adaptive signatures (D701N and E627K substitutions) in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene. Numerous studies have assessed the seroprevalence of avian IAVs in minks. Seropositivity was the highest for H9N2 among all subtypes in minks, ranging between 20% and 47.5% during 2013-19, and much lower for H5N6 and H5N1. Seroepidemiologic data show that minks in China are highly exposed to human and avian influenza viruses, increasing the risk of novel variants due to co-infection. Concluding remarks Taken together, high susceptibility to and receptors for human and avian influenza viruses in minks meet the prerequisites to serve as the intermediate host for interspecies influenza transmission. Therefore, routine surveillance of IAVs in minks and preventive measures should be implemented. Vaccination against influenza should be introduced in the mink populations for public health and industrial benefits. Journal reference: Mok, C. and Qin, K.

"The pigs had labored breathing, maybe a runny nose, cough and potentially a fever," said virologist Benjamin Hause. At the time, Hause was working at the company Newport Laboratories, which develops custom vaccines for livestock. Samples from the sick pigs surprised researchers: this was an entirely new influenza virus. NPR science desk correspondent Michaeleen Doucleff brings us her reporting on novel animal viruses and Influenza D, an emerging virus spreading among cows and other livestock in the United States. Scientists have also found evidence of the virus in farm workers and others who work closely with livestock. Sponsor Message The phenomenon of zoonotic spillover — of viruses jumping from animals to people — is incredibly common. The question is: which one will start the next pandemic? "New animal viruses are jumping over into people every day. Many times a day. One scientist said they're like snow falling across humanity," she tells NPR co-host Emily Kwong. In today's episode, Michaeleen and Emily discuss the importance of widespread virus surveillance to stop the next pandemic before it starts.

We used next-generation sequencing to locally generate whole genomes from 116 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 118 A(H3N2) positive patient swabs collected across Uganda between 2010 and 2018. We recovered sequences from 92% (215/234) of the swabs, 90% (193/215) of which were whole genomes. The newly-generated sequences were genetically and phylogenetically compared to the WHO-recommended vaccines and other Africa strains sampled since 1994. Uganda strain hemagglutinin (n = 206), neuraminidase (n = 207), and matrix protein (MP, n = 213) sequences had 95.23–99.65%, 95.31–99.79%, and 95.46–100% amino acid similarity to the 2010–2020 season vaccines, respectively, with several mutated hemagglutinin antigenic, receptor binding, and N-linked glycosylation sites. Uganda influenza type-A virus strains sequenced before 2016 clustered uniquely while later strains mixed with other Africa and global strains. We are the first to report novel A(H1N1)pdm09 subclades 6B.1A.3, 6B.1A.5(a,b), and 6B.1A.6 (± T120A) that circulated in Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa in 2017–2019. Africa forms part of the global influenza ecology with high viral genetic diversity, progressive antigenic drift, and local transmissions. For a continent with inadequate health resources and where social distancing is unsustainable, vaccination is the best option. Hence, African stakeholders should prioritise routine genome sequencing and analysis to direct vaccine selection and virus control.

Genomic sequencing and characterisation of circulating IAVs are important to differentiate them from other viruses causing similar clinical symptoms for effective viral control and prevention. Seasonal influenza-related illnesses kill 290,000–650,000 people globally per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa2. Influenza accounts for 21.7% and 10.1% of the influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI) in Africa, respectively, and circulates all-year-round with discernible influenza peaks in North and South Africa3. Uganda's annual epidemics have two major peaks between May and November and usually constitute multiple IAV types and subtypes responsible for 13% and 6% of the ILI and SARI cases, respectively4.Vaccination and antiviral treatment are the best ways to prevent and control viral transmission5. However, the multi-segmented IAVs continuously mutate, especially in the antigenic surface genes, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), giving rise to vaccine-escape and drug-resistant viruses6. Vaccine formulations for the Northern (NH) and Southern hemispheres (SH) are updated annually to match circulating viruses. Countries select appropriately licensed vaccines based on the genetic relatedness of their circulating viruses to the vaccines5.Well-sampled and resource-rich countries have deep sequenced circulating IAVs using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and utilised advanced bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis to collect sufficient data on IAV evolution patterns, drug sensitivity6, and emerging and circulating viral genetic clades7 for virus control and vaccine selection5. Influenza surveillance in Africa has improved substantially since the mid-2000s3,8,9. However, the limitation in financial resources and advanced phylogenomic analysis capacity restricts the genomic characterisation of IAVs in Africa. We systematically searched 7 databases: African Journals Online, Embase, Global Health, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies on genomic analysis of Africa IAVs. As of 30th July 2021, we found 16% (11/71) of the eligible studies sequenced and/or analyzed whole genomes (WGs) of Africa IAVs, and only 8% (5/62) of the studies that generated new viral sequences used NGS10. Only 3 Ugandan studies have sequenced WGs from 59 A(H3N2)11,12, and 19 A(H1N1)pdm0913 IAV strains sampled in 2008–2009 and 2009–2011, respectively, with sequencing conducted in the United States.We aimed to explore the feasibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a resource-limited setting to generate WGs of Uganda IAVs sampled in 2010–2018, and compare the newly-generated sequences with vaccine strains and public Africa IAV sequences sampled in 1994–2019. We analysed the HA carrying antigenic sites which trigger host immune responses and the antiviral targets NA and matrix protein (MP). Further analysis of our newly-generated viruses for which we successfully assembled whole genomes showed evidence of intra-subtype reassortment events and reassortant A(H1N1)pmd09 and A(H3N2) strains circulating in Uganda14.This work birthed an East African network of influenza molecular epidemiologists, which we hope to expand across Africa.ResultsDemographic characteristics of sampled patientsThe Uganda Virus Research Institute National Influenza Centre (UVRI-NIC) laboratory tested 18,353 patients between 22nd October 2010 and 9th May 2018. Thirteen-percent (2404/18,353) were positive for influenza, 69.88% (1680/2404), 29.62% (712/2404), and 0.17% (4/2404) had influenza A, B, and A/B co-infection, respectively (Fig. 1A). IAV positives included 67.08% (1127/1680) A(H3N2), 32.2% (541/1680) A(H1N1)pdm09, and 0.12% (2/1680) AH1/H3 co-infections.Figure 1Workflow of swab selection and whole genome recovery. (A) Shows how swabs were selected for influenza whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Patients diagnosed with either influenza subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) and whose swab had a PCR CT ≤ 35 had their laboratory codes randomised based on the subtype and year of collection using the R software v3.6.3 (https://www.r-project.org). All available swabs were retrieved for years with less than fifteen swabs. The 697 swabs missing include some shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine surveillance and some lost due to an accidental failure of a freezer. The numbers are based on the UVRI-NIC laboratory dataset only, as of 9th May 2018. (B) Shows how viral samples were excluded before and after sequencing and the rate of whole genome recovery. Eight viruses [2 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 6 A(H3N2)] failed quality control (QC) before sequencing.Full size imageThe mean number of swabs sampled per subtype per year was 13 (1–18), excluding 2012, 2016, and 2018 with 2, 1 A(H1N1)pdm09, and no A(H3N2) swab available, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Three A(H1N1)pdm09 and one A(H3N2)] sampled patients’ swabs lacked demographic data. Of the 230 swabs with data, 65.22% (150/230) and 34.78% (80/230) were from ILI and SARI cases, respectively. The number of sequenced and un-sequenced swabs were not significantly different per case, gender, age group, and geographical region per year, except Central had more swabs sequenced than other regions in 2014 and 2016 (Table 1). The mean age was not significantly different between our study and the UVRI-NIC patients (Supplementary Fig. 1).Table 1 Comparison of demographic characteristics of influenza A positive patients sampled by the general UVRI-NIC surveillance programme whose viral swabs were successfully or not sequenced.Full size tableSequencing efficiencyAll 234 sampled swabs were analysed, and their mean read counts (ranges) are reported below.The MiSeq generated 569,435 (806–1,644,430) paired reads per sample (data not shown). Following quality control (QC), 266,020 (70,229–909,340) clean reads per sample were processed using the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA), 265,868 (70,150–908,946) passed IRMA’s QC, 213,809 (1381–908,234) matched flu references, and 113,164 (777–461,172) paired reads were assembled (Supplementary Fig. 2A).The number of assembled reads decreased with an increase in gene size. The shortest, MP and non-structural protein (NS), had 25,101 (28–91,585) and 19,341 (41–79,167) assembled reads, respectively. The NA, HA, and nucleoprotein (NP) had 18,653 (74–71,377), 14,466 (35–74,550), and 14,151 (69–74,415) reads assembled, respectively. The polymerase subunits: PA, PB2, and PB1 had 10,465 (31–56,243), 7885 (15–47,444), and 4497 (8–31,354) reads assembled, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2B).We successfully sequenced and assembled viral genes from 96.58% (226/234) of the swabs (Fig. 1B). Eleven viral WGs with a depth of coverage < 100 were excluded, leaving 215 viruses. 89.77% (193/215) of these were WGs, spanning 100% and > 96.7% nucleotides in the coding sequences (CDS) and complete genome of A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) vaccine viruses. Our overall WG recovery rate was 85.4% (193/226). The remaining 10.23% (22/215) viruses had complete CDS for 2–7 genes. Two viruses sampled as A(H1N1)pdm09 matched IRMA’s A(H3N2) references and were included in the A(H3N2) analysis. All newly-generated 215 virus sequences were submitted in a publicly accessible database, GISAID EpiFlu™ (https://www.gisaid.org/), under accessions EPIISL498819–EPIISL498931 [A(H1N1pdm09)], and EPIISL498934–EPIISL499037 [A(H3N2)].Antigenic drift among Uganda IAVsUganda IAV HA1 proteins continuously drifted away from the 2010–2020 vaccines (Supplementary Table 2). For seasons when formulations differed, Uganda A(H3N2) strains had 1–2 extra unique amino acid (aa) substitutions when compared to the Southern (SH) than the Northern hemisphere (NH) vaccine strains. Since Uganda’s largest part lies north of the equator, the substitutions described below are relative to NH and SNH vaccines (shared by NH and SH) for the sampled 2010–2018 [A(H1N1)pdm09] and 2010–2017 [A(H3N2)] seasons.We observed 18 unique aa substitutions across the five antigenic sites15,16 amongst the 107 A(H1N1)pdm09 strains (Supplementary Table 2A). Ranking from the most variable, the main antigenic sites Ca2, Sa, Sb, Ca1, and Cb had 6, 5, 4, 2, and 1 unique aa substitutions, respectively. Substitution S164T, S185T, S203T, and H138R and S74R were the most frequent at site Sa, Sb, Ca1, and Ca2, respectively. All 2010–2016 viruses had S203T, and 90% (27/30) of the 2017–2018 viruses had S164T and S74R.There were 92 unique aa substitutions across the five antigenic sites16,17 amongst the 99 A(H3N2) strains (Supplementary Table 2B). The antigenic sites B, A, D, C, and E had 24, 22, 17, 16, and 13 unique aa substitutions, respectively. Substitution K144N, P194L, H311Q, S96N, and K62E was the most frequent at site A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. Forty-seven percent (47/99) and 41.41% (41/99) of the 2010–2017 strains had V186G and N145S, respectively.Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains had mutated receptor binding sites (RBS, H138Q/R, S190V, and D222E) and S164T that alter the glycosylation motif at sites 162–1647. Uganda A(H3N2) strains had more aa substitutions affecting the RBS [130-loop (T135K, A/S138S/A, I/R140K, R140I), 150-loop (Q/H156H/Q), 190-helix (I192V, P194L, A196T, Q197H/R, A/S/A/P/S198S/A/P/S/P), 220-loop (N/D225D/N, F/Y219S)], and those creating (S45N, A128T, K160T) and removing [N45S, N122S/D, N144K/S, T/N128A, T135K] potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Supplementary Table 2B).Subgroup analysis showed differences of 1–4 and 1–32 unique aa substitutions at antigenic sites of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains, respectively, sampled from different cases, gender, age groups, and geographical regions relative to each subtype vaccines (Supplementary Tables 3, 4).Amino acid similarity of complete HA, NA, and MP protein sequences of Uganda IAVs to vaccine strainsThe complete HA (H1), NA (N1), and MP protein sequences of Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains had 94, 81, and 21 unique aa substitutions and a mean amino acid similarity of 98.09 (96.99–99.65%), 98.2 (96.8–99.79%), and 99.17 (97.73–100%), respectively, compared to A/California/7/2009(H1N1), A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1), and A/Brisbane/02/2018(H1N1) vaccines (Supplementary Table 5). All N1 proteins lacked the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) resistance substitution H275Y. However, 7.55% (8/106) had T362I (n = 1), I117M (n = 2), Y155H (n = 2), and V234I (n = 3) associated with reduced susceptibility to NAIs in vitro18.The complete HA (H3), NA (N2), and MP protein sequences of Uganda A(H3N2) strains had 160, 118, and 31 unique aa substitutions, and mean amino acid similarity of 97.47 (95.23–99.29%), 97.64 (95.31–99.79%), and 99 (95.46–100%), respectively, compared to A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2), A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2), A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2), A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016(H3N2), A/Switzerland/8060/2017(H3N2), A/South Australia/34/2019(H3N2), and A/Kansas/14/2017(H3N2) vaccines (Supplementary Table 6). N2 proteins lacked the NAI-resistance H274Y (N2 numbering), but 18.8% (19/101) carried Y155F (n = 3), and E/D221D/K/E (n = 16) that reduce susceptibility to NAIs18.All A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) M2 proteins had the primary adamantine-resistance marker (S31N), and 7.7% (8/104) of A(H3N2) had secondary V27A relative to adamantine-susceptible A/New York/392/2004(H3N2) strain (Supplementary Fig. 3). All Uganda IAVs M2 proteins had aa substitutions (L3I, L4F, T5F, E6K, V7I, E8C, and T9R) fixed in their extracellular N-terminal, a region that supports M2-antibody interactions19.The influenza surveillance webtool (FluSurver) identified aa substitutions in complete HA and NA proteins reported to alter host specificity and cause mild/strong drug resistance, respectively, and aa substitutions in both proteins that could potentially alter viral virulence, antigenic drift, glycosylation, and sites of interactions (Supplementary Tables 5, 6).Temporal and spatial divergence of Uganda IAVsUganda IAV strains phylogenetically clustered according to their year of sampling, with multiple lineages circulating annually (Fig. 2). Two major H1 lineages co-circulated; lineage 1 (shaded blue) with strains belonging to clade 6A and lineage 2 (shaded grey) with clade 6C, 6B, 6B.1, 6B.1A, 6B.1A.6 strains circulated in 2013–2016 and 2013–2018, respectively (Fig. 2A). The N1 and MP phylogenies showed similar lineages 1 and 2 emerged in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and lineage 2 dominated in 2016–2018.Figure 2Phylogenies showing the temporal divergence of the HA, NA and MP genes of Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 (A) and A(H3N2) (B) influenza viruses sampled from 2010 to 2018. Trees were rooted using the oldest sequence in the dataset. Shaded clusters are the two and three major co-circulating lineages observed since 2013 and 2012 for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses, respectively. The third A(H3N2) lineage (with one 2011 and 2016–2017 viruses) disappeared in the MP phylogeny.Full size imageThe dominant H3 lineage 1 (pink) contained clade 3C.3b and 3C.3 strains that circulated from 2013 to 2016. Lineages 2 (grey) had clade 3C.3a and lineage 3 (blue) had clade 3C.2a, 3C.2a3, and 3C.2a1(a, b) strains that emerged in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and co-circulated through 2017. We observed two long-branched clusters (bootstrap = 100%); cluster 1 (KSW0659 and KSW0643, sampled in 2010) and cluster 2 (TOR0492, TOR1664, and NSY0304, sampled in 2013–2016) in the N2 and MP phylogeny, with 3–5 unique amino acid (9–13 nucleotides) substitutions absent in other Uganda strains (Fig. 2B).Virus strains sampled from different geographical sites mixed in all phylogenies (Supplementary Fig. 4).Viral clades circulating in UgandaUganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains belonged to five global clades (A/Hong Kong/2212/2010(H1N1)-HK, 3, 5, 6, and 7) (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 5). The HK clade circulated in 2010 and had aa substitutions V19I, N97D, and S128P. Two novel clades H1-UG1 with P83S, D222E, and I267T, and H1-UG2 with T134A, P183S, and S185T, circulated in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Clade 3 had 2010–2011 strains with A134T and S183P. Clade 5 had 2011 strains with D97N, R205K, I216V, and V249L. One 2011 strain from Kisenyi clustered with A/St.Petersburgh/100/2011(H1N1) in clade 7 with A197T, S143G, and K163I. Clade 6 viruses with D97N, S185T, and S203T dominated since 2012 and diverged into 6A, 6B, and 6C. A novel subclade 6B.1A.6 with T120A emerged in November 2017 and dominated through 2018.Figure 3Genetic clades of influenza A viruses that previously circulated in Uganda during the 2010–2018 seasons. All labelled clades (indicated by black bars) were inferred based on the signature amino acid substitutions in the HA1 protein indicated on the tree trunk in bold. (A) Shows clades for 2010–2018 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Novel clades H1-UG1 and H1-UG2 are indicated. Genetic clade 6 diverged into 6A, 6B, and 6C. All clade 3, 5, and 7 viruses were collected from Entebbe and Kampala (Central Uganda) and circulated in 2010–2011. (B) Shows clades for 2010–2017 A(H3N2) viruses. A novel clade H3-UG1 is indicated. Clade 3 persisted in all 9 years. A similar figure with the full sequence names is provided in Supplementary Fig. 5.Full size imageUganda A(H3N2) strains belonged to two global clades 3 and 7 (Fig. 3B) and co-circulated in 2010–2012. A novel clade H3-UG1 with L183H, T212A, S214I, and P289S circulated in 2010. The major clade 3 had strains with N145S and V223I and diverged into 3B, 3C.2, and 3C.3. New subclades 3C.2a1a with T135K and 3C.2a1b with K92R and H311Q dominated in May–June and May–November 2017, respectively.Based on our dataset, similar clades circulated in Uganda and other African countries, except for A(H1N1)pdm09 clade 7, HK, and H1-UG2 (Supplementary Table 7). However, our recent systematic review showed that clade 7-like strains also circulated in Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa between 2010 and 201210.Phylogenetic relatedness of Africa IAVsWe define a group as a highly-supported phylogenetic cluster (bootstrap ≥ 90%) with at least three Uganda IAV nucleotide sequences.Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains collected before 2016 clustered uniquely towards the root, while the 2017–2018 strains mixed with Eastern, Central, Western, and Southern Africa strains (Supplementary Figs. 6–8). The H1, N1, and MP phylogeny contained 6, 5, and 1 group, with 50% (3/6), 60% (3/5), and 100% of the groups unique to Uganda, respectively (Supplementary Table 8A).Uganda A(H3N2) strains collected in 2008–2016 and some before April 2017 clustered uniquely closest to the root (Supplementary Figs. 9–11). Notably, the 2008–2009 Makerere Walter Reed project (MWRP)11 and our newly-generated strain sequences clustered separately. The H3, N2, and MP phylogeny had 8, 10, and 2 groups, respectively, and 50% (4/8) H3 (circulated in different years) and 40% (4/10) N2 groups had only Uganda strains (Supplementary Table 8B).If not clustered alone, Uganda strains grouped with strains from neighboring Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, and Congo. Interestingly, four unique H3 lineages (bootstrap ≥ 90%); Kenya (n = 1), Congo (n = 1), and West Africa (n = 2) co-circulated in 2019 (not shown). Virus group details are provided in Supplementary Table 8.DiscussionOur study demonstrated the feasibility of NGS whole-genome sequencing of IAVs in a resource-limited setting. Analysis of the newly-generated HA, NA, and MP sequences highlighted a continuous antigenic drift, multiple introductions, and local transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in Uganda. All Uganda strains lacked the neuraminidase inhibitors resistance marker (H275Y) but had the adamantine-resistance marker (S31N) in their MP proteins. Although we analyzed only the HA, NA, and MP, additional amino acid substitutions such as I38T/F/M in the endonuclease domain of the Polymerase PA protein have also been shown to give rise to antiviral resistance20,21,22. Africa IAVs were genetically similar, but unique viral lineages (bootstrap ≥ 90%) circulated and persisted in Uganda and other countries for 1–3 years.We successfully recovered 96.58% (226/234) genomes and 85.4% (193/226) WGs directly from frozen human swabs. Our WG recovery rate is comparable to the 82–88% reported in developed countries23,24 and better than in Scotland (47.3%)25 and Mexico (66%)26. 10–20% of frozen swabs fail NGS due to RNA degradation during storage and pre-sequencing analysis. The shortest genes, MP and NS, were sequenced at a greater depth and the least for the polymerase segment 2 (PB1) as previously reported in Mexico and France23,26.Sequence analysis showed most amino acid substitutions affected the antigenic sites Sa and Ca2 of A(H1N1)pdm09 and sites A and B of A(H3N2) viruses. Substitutions S164T (Sa) and S74R (Ca2) observed in 90% of Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains also dominated in Kenya in 2017–201827. The globally frequent S203T at site Ca1 has no known function28. Five-percent (4/77) of the 2010–2016 Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains had the RBS D222E, speculated to increase infection severity28. Amino acid substitutions in the H1 (P100S, S220T, I338V) and N1 (V106I, N248D) detected earlier in 2009–2011 among Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains relative to A/California/7/2009(H1N1)13 persisted through 2017. All 2010–2013 Uganda A(H3N2) strains had mutated antigenic sites also observed in Kenya29. It would be interesting to do antigenic and phenotypic analysis to assess the effect of the observed aa substitutions on vaccine responses and viral characteristics (virulence, pathogenicity, and transmissibility), respectively.Uganda IAV strains lacked the NA H274Y or H275Y substitutions confirming previous reports of 98% of global IAVs being sensitive to NAIs6. However, some N1 proteins carried permissive aa substitutions V234I, N369K, and V241I known to counteract the effect of H275Y. These aa substitutions enhance the NA surface expression and enzymatic activity, hence increasing viral fitness. Uganda IAVs NA active and catalytic sites30 were highly conserved indicating a lack of pharmacological selection pressure, which confirms the low NAIs intake in Uganda due to their privatization.Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 strains formed steeper ladder-like phylogenies than A(H3N2), which could result from sampling effects and/or directional selection due to immune escape31. Reassortment (gene exchange) within influenza viruses of the same subtype results in genetically unique strains which also affect the history and structure of the phylogenies32,33,34. Our recent whole-genome analysis using a Bayesian coalescent reassortant constant population model35 confirmed reassortment among Uganda A(H1N1)pmd09 (0.1237–0.4255) and A(H3N2) strains (0.00912–0.0355 events/lineage/year)14. Further whole-genome analysis to identify additional evolutionary processes driving the observed genetic variations is ongoing.Phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulation of multiple viral lineages and clades in Uganda as observed worldwide7,11,36. New viral lineages and clades were observed in-between seasons indicating multiple viral introductions into Uganda per year. Novel subclades 6B.1A.6 [A(H1N1)pdm09] and 3C.2a1a and 3C. 2a1b [A(H3N2)] emerged in Uganda in 2017. Our detailed review of previous studies showed that clade 3C.3a emerged outside Africa in 2013, and later circulated in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, South Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Madagascar, Cameroon, and Nigeria in 201410. Here, we show evidence that a clade 3C.3a-like strain (KSY0906_A_HA-H3_Uganda_UVRI_Kisenyi_003_2011-10-19) was first sampled in 2011 and similar strains circulated in 2014 through 2017 in Uganda. While its subclade 3C.3a1 continued to circulate outside Africa through 2021, making it the longest circulating H3 subclade10,37. Strikingly, we observed A(H1N1)pdm09 strains belonging to novel subclades 6B.1A.3, 6B.1A.5a, 6B.1A.5b, and 6B.1A.6 (± T120A) sampled during 2018, 2019, 2017–2018, and 2017–2018 seasons, respectively, in Eastern, Western, and Southern Africa (Supplementary Table 7), but were never reported before10. Uganda IAV strains from all geographical regions mixed, showing widespread local viral transmissions.Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) strains collected before 2015 and 2016, respectively, phylogenetically clustered distinctively from most Africa strains which could be due to insufficient viral sequencing in earlier years across Africa. Strains collected later were genetically similar to those from Eastern, Central, Southern, and Western Africa. Notably, all 2010–2018 Uganda strains clustered with global strains highlighting Uganda as part of the global influenza ecology.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic revealed virus exchange between Uganda and other countries through air and border travel. Currently, we are doing phylogeographic analysis on our newly-generated and public global IAV genomes to identify origins of viruses migrating to Uganda and Africa, and the continent's contribution to the global influenza migration network. This is the first and largest study to sequence Uganda A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus whole genomes (WGs) locally, and extensively describe the genetic diversity and evolution patterns of Africa IAVs since 1994. Our work expands on previous influenza sequencing and characterisation efforts of African researchers10 and highlights the feasibility of next-generation whole-genome sequencing for real-time disease surveillance and detection of emerging strains in Africa. Our newly-generated sequences add significantly to public Africa IAV genomes. However, we sequenced pre-collected swabs with a biased geographical sampling. Therefore, we did not consider geographical location in the swab randomisation.Due to financial constraints, we sampled only 24.1% (234/971) of available swabs, 8.12% (19/234) of which failed quality control and NGS. Although we generated WGs, we analysed only the HA, NA, and MP genes from a few strains sequenced per case, gender, age group, and geographical region per year. Therefore, our results do not give a comprehensive description of the genetic diversity of Uganda and Africa IAVs.Although NGS technologies can improve influenza surveillance in Africa, their implementation presents several challenges in analysing, reporting, and management of their big data. Fortunately, African researchers can leverage freely available automated pipelines38,39,40 for NGS data quality control, assembly, and variant calling for both segmented and non-segmented viruses. However, these pipelines are validated using sequences sampled from outside Africa. As shown here, genomic differences among strains sampled from different geographical regions and times cannot be ignored, hence African researchers will need to strengthen their existing Bioinformatics capacity to customize and/or develop region-specific tools.Our study provides a platform for larger studies and highlights the potential of molecular surveillance to improve viral detection and disease management. Existing African surveillance programmes should prioritize routine sequencing and genome analysis to monitor circulating IAVs. Our findings will inform Uganda’s public health, use of NAIs prophylactic treatment, and decision to design vaccination programs, especially for high-risk groups like children, pregnant mothers, and the elderly.MethodsInfluenza surveillance design and source of swabsThe Uganda Virus Research Institute National Influenza Centre (UVRI-NIC) in Entebbe implements a clinic and hospital-based surveillance at thirteen peri-urban and densely populated sites in seven districts across Northwest, Western, Central, and Eastern Uganda (Supplementary Fig. 12)4.Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs and demographic data were collected from ILI and SARI patients in 2010–20184. The swabs were tested, typed for influenza A and B, and the IAV positives subtyped for seasonal [A(H1N1) and A(H3N2)] and pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) protocols and primers (Atlanta, Georgia)41.Swab selection for whole-genome sequencingWe aimed to sequence 100 whole genomes (WGs) per subtype [A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)] due to financial constraints. Available swabs from 971 IAV patients with real-time PCR cycle threshold (CT ≤ 35) were stratified by subtype and year of collection, randomised, and then selected every first fifteen swabs per strata. Twenty-four percent (234/971) of the swabs [116 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 118 A(H3N2)] were sequenced at a KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Programme collaborating laboratory in Kilifi, Kenya.Viral RNA isolation and amplificationViral ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from 140 μL swab sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini extraction kit and manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was reverse transcribed and the whole genome amplified using the multi-segment real-time polymerase chain reaction (M-RTPCR)24 and universal IAV Uni/Inf primers at standardised thermocycling conditions (Supplementary methods)36.Next-generation sequencingThe M-RTPCR amplicon libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit and protocol (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA), cleaned using the 0.8 × AMPure XP beads, quantified on the Qubit 3.0 fluorometer using the dsDNA High sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Library size distributions were assessed using the Agilent Technology 2100 Bioanalyzer and the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Samples with a broad fragment size spectrum (> 250 bp) were normalized manually to 2 nM. 5 μL per sample library were pooled, denatured using Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), and diluted to 12.5 pmol. Diluted libraries were spiked with 5% Phi-X control (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California, USA) generating 2 × 250 bp paired reads per sample.We assessed sequencing efficiency based on the depth of coverage and number of gene segments recovered per swab.Sequence quality control and assemblyRaw reads were de-duplicated and decontaminated, and clean reads assembled using the reference-based FLU module of the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA) v0.6.742 at default settings (Supplementary methods). The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus assemblies were compared with A/California/7/2009(H1N1) and A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) vaccine viruses, respectively.The newly-generated sequences were deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (GISAID EpiFlu™, https://www.gisaid.org/) under accessions EPIISL498819-EPIISL498931 [A(H1N1)pdm09] and EPIISL498934-EPIISL499037 [A(H3N2)].Genetic characterisation of surface and matrix proteinsGene sequences for the Southern and Northern Hemispheres or both (SNH) vaccine and clade reference viruses per subtype were downloaded from the GISAID EpiFlu database43 (https://www.gisaid.org/; accessed on 26th February 2020). Uganda and vaccine virus sequences per subtype were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.155144.Amino acid substitutions in the major antigenic sites (A, B, C, D, and E) of A(H1N1)pdm0915 and A(H3N2)16 virus HA1 proteins were identified manually, while those in the complete HA, NA, and MP proteins and their functions were identified using the influenza surveillance (FluSurver) webtool (http://flusurver.bii.a-star.edu.sg; accessed on 24th September 2021) (Supplementary methods).Phylogenetic analysis and clade classificationUganda HA, NA, and MP gene sequences per subtype were aligned and maximum-likelihood trees reconstructed using IQtree v1.6.1145 with a GTR + G4 model and 1000 bootstraps. Trees were rooted using the oldest sequence in the dataset and visualized in ggtree v2.4.146 and Figtree v1.4.4 (http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).Uganda, clade references, and vaccine virus sequences per subtype were aligned and maximum-likelihood trees reconstructed as above. Viral sequences were classified into genetic clades based on signature amino acid substitutions in their HA protein HA1 subunits7.For Africa analysis, HA, NA, and MP gene sequences were downloaded from GISAID, accessed on 27th February 2020. Sequences with > 100 bps shorter or longer than the actual gene size and ambiguous “N” bases were excluded. The remaining A(H1N1)pdm09 (496 H1, 443 N1, and 278 MP) and A(H3N2) (718 H3, 675 N2, and 439 MP) sequences were aligned using a codon-aware aligner (https://github.com/veg/hyphy-analysesree/master/codon-msa) and maximum-likelihood trees reconstructed as above. Accessions for sequences analysed are provided in Supplementary Table 9.Statistical analysisWe used the Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact test (as appropriate) and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in R v3.6.3 (https://www.r-project.org), to compare differences in the categorical and continuous patient demographics between successfully sequenced and un-sequenced swabs, respectively.EthicsThis study was approved by the Makerere University School of Biomedical Sciences Research and Ethics Committee (SBS-REC) (ref: SBS-577) and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) (ref: HS2519).Our study was nested in the National Influenza Surveillance Programme at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) where patients’ consent and assent were verbally obtained before sample collection. Since our study used archived patient clinical samples collected from the surveillance programme and presented “minimal risk” of harm to patients, we obtained a waiver of consent through the Makerere University SBS-REC. Permission to use archived samples was granted by Prof. Julius Lutwama, director of the Department of Arbovirology and Emerging and Re-Emerging Viral Infections at UVRI. Data availability All sequences generated in this study with their respective metadata were submitted to GISAID EpiFlu (https://www.gisaid.org/) under accessions EPIISL498819–EPIISL498931 [A(H1N1pdm09)], and EPIISL498934–EPIISL499037 [A(H3N2)].

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Being hospitalized for COVID-19 vs. seasonal influenza was associated with an increased risk for death. Risk for death was greater among unvaccinated people compared with patients who were vaccinated or boosted. COVID-19 remained deadlier than influenza this past season, although the difference in mortality shrunk compared with past years, according to a study comparing outcomes of patients hospitalized with the illnesses. “In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, two U.S. studies suggested that people hospitalized for COVID-19 had nearly five times the risk of 30-day mortality compared with those hospitalized for seasonal influenza,” Yan Xie, PhD, senior clinical epidemiologist at the Saint Louis VA Health Care System’s Clinical Epidemiology Center, and colleagues wrote. Xie Y, et al. JAMA. 2023;doi:10.1001/jama.2023.5348. “Since then, much has changed, including SARS-CoV-2 itself, clinical care, and population-level immunity; mortality from influenza may have also changed,” Xie said and colleagues wrote. Because of this, the researchers sought to determine if COVID-19 was still associated with a higher risk for death compared with seasonal influenza during the fall and winter of 2022-2023. According to the study, the researchers used patient data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs electronic health databases to assess patients with at least one hospital admission between 2 and 10 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 or influenza test and admission diagnosis for COVID-19 or influenza between Oct. 1, 2022, and Jan. 31, 2023. All patients were followed until death or through March 2, 2023. In total, there were 8,996 hospitalizations for COVID-19 and 2,403 hospitalizations for seasonal influenza. They researchers determined that hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk for death (HR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.29-2.02) compared with hospitalizations for influenza. They added that the mortality rate at 30 days was 5.97% for COVID-19 and 3.75% for influenza, with an excess death rate of 2.23% (95% CI, 1.32%-3.13%). The authors wrote that this finding “should be interpreted in the context of a two to three times greater number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 vs. influenza in the U.S. during the assessed timeframe.” Additionally, the study showed that the overall risk for death decreases as vaccinations increased (P = .009 for interaction between unvaccinated and vaccinated; P < .001 for interaction between unvaccinated and boosted), which the authors said further highlights the importance of vaccination. “The difference in mortality rates between COVID-19 and influenza appears to have decreased since early in the pandemic; death rates among people hospitalized for COVID-19 were 17% to 21% in 2020 vs. 6% in this study, while death rates for those hospitalized for influenza were 3.8% in 2020 vs. 3.7% in this study,” the authors wrote. “The decline in death rates among people hospitalized for COVID-19 may be due to changes in SARS-CoV-2 variants, increased immunity levels (from vaccination and prior infection) and improved clinical care.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Xie Y, et al.

Dialing Back Its Pandemic Risk Starts with PreventionBird flu outbreaks are a numbers game, and the numbers are turning against usBy Daniel Schar, Erik Karlsson & Filip ClaesA veterinarian injects avian flu vaccine into a goose at the Taiyuan Zoo on November 10, 2020 in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province of China. Wei Liang/China News Service via Getty ImagesThe last two years have witnessed an unprecedented global expansion of avian influenza. Moving along migratory bird flyways into Europe and the Americas, a new strain of H5N1 influenza has established itself in wild birds and domestic poultry, leading to a record 58.6 million birds culled in the U.S. and new outbreaks across Latin America and the Caribbean. This strain’s spread in birds, along with infections of mammals and sporadic human cases—one fatal—raises pandemic influenza concerns.Last October the virus was likely transmitting between farmed mink in Spain and may have spread among sea lions during a mass mortality event in Peru earlier this year. Influenza is highly mutable and prone to dramatic genetic shifts, challenging any prediction of which viral subtype could emerge as a future pandemic. But each such event is another warning of viral churn, the portrait of a mutating pathogen that could yield a virus capable of infecting and transmitting among humans.This is a numbers game—a game we are losing.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

But what do we have to do better?Pandemics are a byproduct of how humans live on this planet: intimately connected across aggressively altered landscapes as we seek to house and feed over eight billion people. Influenza is no exception. Soaring demand for meat and eggs is shifting animal production and land use patterns, driving animals and humans into ever greater contact and escalating pandemic risk. Yet dialing back pandemic influenza risk is within our reach.Immediately, we must redouble upstream prevention, mitigating risk where the virus circulates in wild and domestic animals. On farms, restricting entry, limiting vehicle and equipment movement and implementing strict worker disinfection protocols will boost biosecurity. Checklists can be useful to systematically fill biosecurity gaps. Limiting domestic animal contact with wild birds—particularly at shared water sources—is essential. In England, a mandatory order for all poultry holders to house their flocks indoors is reducing domestic poultry exposure. Early warning surveillance and bird migration patterns can help target housing orders to times of peak risk.Market-based live poultry sales, common globally, also carry risk. Livelihoods depend on these markets. But we can make them safer. Separating highest-risk activities, such as on-site slaughter, defeathering and processing away from points of sale may help reduce viral exposure. These protocols should be augmented with regular cleaning and disinfection, market rest days, avoidance of species mixing, and bans on overnight poultry holding—all proven to reduce circulating virus.Strategically vaccinating poultry, while carrying trade-restriction implications for poultry-exporting nations, can also substantially reduce circulating virus when other containment measures fail. When Guangdong province in China began mass poultry vaccination with an H7 vaccine in 2017, zoonotic influenza A/H7N9 human cases dropped 98 percent within a year.Together, these upstream measures minimize human exposure and interrupt viral exchange between wild birds, domestic poultry and other animals. To successfully implement these measures, farmers and businesses along the chain of production from farm to fork can’t exclusively shoulder the costs; instead, these interventions should be viewed as investments in protecting public health. The newly launched Pandemic Fund can play an important role in building out the animal health capacities required for safe, secure, sustainable animal production and disease prevention.The investment case is clear: spend modestly on prevention now, or pay catastrophic health and social disruption costs later. The price tag for such a global prevention architecture? $11.5 billion annually. By contrast, in 2020 the global economy contracted 3.1 percent due to COVID—more than $2.7 trillion—with continued economic scarring projected through 2023. Our best, and most cost-effective, approach to averting the next pandemic is to reduce the viral exposure and spillover that spark outbreaks.However, we should not rely upon prevention alone to counter pandemic influenza. We must also fine-tune our surveillance structures to pick up signals from influenza viruses displaying worrisome mutations in both traditional and unexpected locations where animals and humans mix, risking spillover. These structures should see around corners, tracking the virus in new animal hosts to inform risk assessments. And we must dramatically extend their reach.Frontline health care workers globally should stay alert to unusual patterns of respiratory illness, prepared to quickly identify and arrest the earliest human-to-human clusters should they emerge. COVID broadened existing capabilities to identify human acute respiratory infections. We should leverage them. Influenza is not the only viral threat of this pandemic era, and as we suggested in 2017, these syndromic surveillance platforms should also detect a broad array of both known and as-yet-unknown respiratory viruses.Critically, we should expand stockpiles of prepandemic influenza vaccine, reserves meant to buy time until a well-matched shot can be produced. We need to produce, preauthorize and predeploy these vaccines equitably worldwide. Prepositioned vaccines, antivirals, personal protective equipment and rapid tests could save precious weeks and months in an escalating epidemic, breaking transmission chains, averting a pandemic and saving lives.Finally, hoping that history does not repeat itself should not be our pandemic influenza contingency plan. Engaging community leaders in scenario planning should start now. And we must learn from COVID and engineer messaging campaigns that unite the global community around a shared vision— preventing the next pandemic.Reassuringly, there is progress: Heightened surveillance alerts have been issued. Surge capacity planning tools are available. Prepandemic influenza vaccine virus, based on the new clade 2.3.4.4b strain, has been proposed. And paradigm-shifting, palm-sized genetic sequencing platforms now bring the lab into the field; these devices turn samples into full viral genome sequences in less than a day, making them available immediately on genetic repositories. Air samplers placed in live animal markets and other high-risk, high-contact locations paired with these field diagnostics bring us closer to near-real-time influenza monitoring.Migratory birds will soon move north to summer breeding grounds, carrying with them the prospect of a fresh set of viral incursions. Yes, influenza is churning, but we can expand these strategies to keep us ahead of the next outbreak. The off-ramp from the pandemic era is well-marked. The choice before us is whether we take it.The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of USAID, the U.S. government or the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsDaniel Schar is the senior regional emerging infectious diseases advisor at the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bangkok, Thailand.

Last month, UMSOM faculty in the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) launched a new clinical trial to investigate the use of mRNA technologies to create a vaccine against malaria. CVD Director Kathleen M. Neuzil, MD, MPH, FIDSA also provided commentary in the nation’s leading medical journal on the feasibility of using mRNA to develop a universal influenza vaccine that could eliminate the need for seasonal shots. The huge success of mRNA vaccines to combat COVID-19 has opened up a new era in vaccine development, offering the potential for faster, more efficient, and more effective vaccine production. In an editorial commenting on a new study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Dr. Neuzil, who is also the Myron M. Levine, MD, Professor in Vaccinology at UMSOM, wrote, “the application of mRNA technology to influenza vaccines would permit the design of vaccines that incorporate mRNAs matched to multiple influenza strains, a rapid adaptive response to virus evolution, and the manufacture of combination vaccines that include influenza and noninfluenza proteins, which would facilitate delivery to populations.” Dr. Neuzil pointed to more than 20 studies underway or in the planning stages to test novel influenza vaccines utilizing this technology. She commented on a recent animal study published in Science, which tested an mRNA vaccine against all 20 known influenza virus subtypes. The study found that the single vaccine can provide protection against different strains of the influenza virus by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens, which she said suggests that an mRNA vaccine against influenza is “feasible” but that “careful attention to safety evaluations will be critical.” Resources for the Media: Videos During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Neuzil led the team that launched the first clinical trial in the U.S. to test the Pfizer and BioNTech mRNA vaccine against COVID-19. CVD researchers also recently launched a new clinical trial investigating an mRNA-based vaccine for malaria. This phase 1, first-in-human study will aim to determine whether the vaccine is safe and its potential for efficacy against one of the world’s most deadly parasitic illnesses. “Many scientists who study malaria have long been invested in developing vaccines to prevent malaria deaths and disease, and the COVID-19 pandemic advanced the mRNA vaccine platform that can readily be adapted for other illnesses,” said Matthew Laurens, MD, MPH, Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at UMSOM’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) and Coordinating Investigator for the BioNTech mRNA malaria vaccine trial. “As this is the first study to test this novel mRNA-based vaccine in humans, we are hopeful we’ll see promising results that may be life changing for children who are at highest risk of death, severe disease, and inferior school performance due to malaria.” Study participants ages 18 to 55 will receive three total injections of a vaccine made by BioNTech SE, or a placebo, over six months. The study is expected to be completed in September 2024. Investigators will carefully track how well the participants tolerate the injection and monitor any reactions that might occur. Importantly, participant immune responses will be measured after vaccination. There were 247 million malaria cases and 619,000 deaths reported worldwide in 2021 alone, which is a 9 percent increase from 2019 before the pandemic. Public health experts contend new strategies are urgently needed to achieve the United Nation’s sustainable development goal of 90 percent reduction in malaria incidence and mortality by 2030. Scientists have tried for decades to develop a highly effective malaria vaccine without much success. The current study’s mRNA approach – and other recent research investigating monoclonal antibodies for malaria -- represent a promising advances to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. The first vaccine against malaria (RTS,S/AS01) was approved by the World Health Organization in October 2021, and it provides modest protection against malaria. Unfortunately, it is in short supply and thus additional vaccines are urgently needed. In 2022, UMSOM researchers published findings from a study that showed a three-dose regimen of a whole-parasite vaccine against malaria – called Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine – demonstrated safety and efficacy when tested in adults living in Burkina Faso, West Africa, an area highly endemic for malaria. “Instead of relying on inactivated microbes to trigger an immune response, mRNA vaccines use mRNA to teach our cells how to make a protein, or piece of a protein, that resembles a microbe’s protein,” said UMSOM Dean Mark Gladwin, MD, who is also Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor at UMSOM. “This foreign protein triggers a human immune response against the microbe. The mRNA vaccine platform has several advantages in terms of stimulating a more robust immune response and enabling quick adaptation and scalability to new strains or variants that emerge during pandemics.” About the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine For over 40 years, researchers in the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) have worked domestically and internationally to develop, test, and deploy vaccines to aid the world’s underserved populations. CVD is an academic enterprise engaged in the full range of infectious disease intervention from basic laboratory research through vaccine development, pre-clinical and clinical evaluation, large-scale pre-licensure field studies, and post-licensure assessments. CVD has created and tested vaccines against cholera, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, non-typhoidal Salmonella disease, shigellosis (bacillary dysentery), Escherichia coli diarrhea, nosocomial pathogens, tularemia, influenza, coronaviruses, malaria, and other infectious diseases. CVD’s research covers the broader goal of improving global health by conducting innovative, leading research in Baltimore and around the world. Our researchers are developing new and improved ways to diagnose, prevent, treat, control, and eliminate diseases of global impact, including COVID-19. In addition, CVD’s work focuses on the ever-growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.

Written by Tavishi Dogra |Updated : April 3, 2023 2:47 PM IST H3N2 influenza is one of the most virulent strains and has caused several epidemics and pandemics worldwide. While the respiratory symptoms of H3N2 are well known, recent research has revealed that the virus can also have serious side effects on kidney health. Influenza viruses, including H3N2, primarily affect the respiratory system, causing symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, and body aches. In this article, Dr Shovna Veshnavi, Consultant, Department of Internal Medicine, Jaypee Hospital, will share the side effects of the H3N2 virus on the kidney.Acute Kidney InjuryResearch has shown that H3N2 influenza can lead to kidney injury, which can range from mild to severe. In severe cases, the virus can cause acute kidney injury (AKI), a sudden loss of kidney function that can be life-threatening. AKI is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The study analysed data from over 6,000 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza and found that patients with H3N2 were more likely to develop AKI than those with other virus strains. American Journal Of Kidney DiseasesAnother research in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that H3N2 influenza was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This does not let kidneys function properly, making patients more vulnerable to infections and other health complications. The exact mechanism of H3N2 influenza affecting kidney health is not fully understood. However, it is believed that the virus can cause kidney inflammation, leading to kidney injury. In some cases, inflammation can become excessive and cause damage to organs such as the kidneys. Signs Of Kidney InjurySymptoms of kidney injury from H3N2 influenza can include decreased urine output, swelling in the legs or feet, nausea and vomiting, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, patients may require dialysis, a medical procedure that filters the blood when the kidneys cannot do so. Prevention From H3N2 InfluenzaPrevention is vital when it comes to protecting kidney health from H3N2 influenza. The best way to prevent influenza infection is by getting vaccinated annually. The influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone over six months and is especially important for individuals with chronic medical conditions such as CKD. In addition to vaccination, practising good hygiene can help prevent transmission. This includes washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and covering the nose and mouth when feeling ill. You may like to read TRENDING NOW In ConclusionH3N2 influenza is a severe respiratory illness that can have serious side effects on kidney health. The virus can cause kidney inflammation, leading to acute kidney injury in extreme cases. Patients with chronic kidney disease are particularly vulnerable to the complications of H3N2 influenza and should take extra precautions to prevent infection, such as annual vaccination and good hygiene practices. If you experience symptoms of kidney injury, seek medical attention immediately.

The number fell to below the threshold value for an epidemic, but did not fall any further. Moreover, the number of samples in which the flu virus was detected remained high. There was even a slight increase. That is why the experts continued to refer to a flu epidemic. In the past two weeks, the number of people who went to visit their GP with flu-like symptoms fell further. It is now down to pre-epidemic levels. At the same time, the number of samples in which the flu virus (influenza virus) was detected also fell to the level at the start of the flu epidemic. This drop was noticed in samples supplied by GP practices, laboratories and hospitals. About the flu epidemic The flu epidemic started halfway through December 2022. The number of people who went to visit their GP with flu-like symptoms was above the epidemic threshold value of 58 in every 100,000 people for a total of four weeks. The epidemic peaked in the first week of 2023, when 99 in every 100,000 people went to visit their GP with flu-like symptoms. In addition to the aforementioned threshold value, experts also looked at whether any other respiratory viruses in addition to the flu virus were present in the samples taken from a number of people who went to visit their GP with flu-like symptoms. They also looked at samples taken in laboratories and hospitals. All that information combined showed that there were two phases in the flu epidemic. The first wave was from halfway through December until late January. This was followed by a second, milder wave lasting until now. How can you avoid the flu (influenza) and other respiratory tract infections? Although the flu epidemic is now over, you can still catch the flu. Flu viruses and other respiratory tract viruses, such as the RS virus and the coronavirus, are highly contagious. You can spread them by coughing or sneezing. You can lower the risk of passing the virus on to others by: washing your hands often; coughing or sneezing into the crook of your elbow; keeping your distance from others. This is especially important when coming into contact with vulnerable groups of people, such as the elderly and young children. They can become seriously ill from these viruses. Vulnerable people receive an invitation for a flu jab each autumn. The flu jab is the best way to protect against the serious consequences of becoming infected with the flu virus.

Now, as millions more migrate north, scientists warn it’s yet another opportunity for this virus to spread and evolve. (Maryse Zeidler/CBC)Social SharingAcross Canada, an estimated seven million birds and counting have been infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) during a devastating global outbreak that shows no signs of winding down.The virus is also striking and killing other species, from farmed mink to wild sea lions to a domestic dog in Ontario, federal officials announced last week.Now, with millions of birds crossing the continent and flying north to Canada in the months ahead, scientists warn it's yet another opportunity for this virus to spread and evolve. "It gives more opportunity for transmission," said veterinarian Dr. Scott Weese, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College. "And if we have birds coming from different areas where the virus has evolved differently, it creates more opportunities for this virus to change further."Canadian researchers are watching this year's migration season closely. They aim to gauge how it impacts ongoing virus transmission, and to determine which species are being hit hardest by HPAI — and which ones are, somehow, beating the odds.WATCH | Scientists say bird migration routes help spread deadly avian flu: Spring migration ramps up risk of spread of new avian flu strain2 years agoDuration 1:55Scientists are warning the spring bird migration could give a new avian flu strain a chance to spread. Migrating birds could pose a risk to animals, so veterinarians recommend pet owners keep their animals away from birds where possible.Able to infect mammalsThis fast-spreading H5N1 strain has already caused mass mortality among waterfowl, raptors, and poultry flocks.Deaths among mammals appear largely relegated to close interactions with infected birds — the Ontario dog that died, for instance, had been "chewing on a wild goose," as noted in a government release — though a large outbreak on a Spanish mink farm also suggested possible mammal-to-mammal transmission.What's particularly concerning for Dr. Samira Mubareka, a clinician-scientist with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, are the early signals that this virus appears to be evolving in ways that make it more adept at infecting mammals, with heightened virulence.One recent study from Canadian researchers, which looked at sporadic H5N1 cases among 40 different species including red foxes, skunks, and mink, found the disease presented as a central nervous system infection, with 17 percent of the virus samples showing "mammalian adaptive mutations.""I'm definitely more concerned now than I was ten years ago…. We're seeing neurological illness, we're seeing [viral] reassortment," Mubareka said. Bird flu keeps spreading beyond birds. Scientists worry it signals a growing threat to humans, tooDog dies after contracting avian flu in OshawaMigratory birds are particularly at risk of HPAI, and the mutations they bring back from southern climates this spring and summer could be different from those currently circulating in Canada, she added, potentially posing new threats at a time when scientists and farmers are already struggling to track and contain the virus.Hundreds of Canadian poultry farms have battled outbreaks so far, which often involve culling vast numbers of birds. There's also growing concern that reported deaths among wildlife — which are tougher to track — are just the tip of the iceberg. "Is it a handful of mammals affected?" questioned Weese. "Or is it happening more in the background, and they die and just don't get noticed?"'Some immunity is built up'Andrew Lang, a professor in Memorial University's biology department, said there were waves of infections among seabirds on the East Coast last year, and various species fared differently, potentially impacting their subsequent migration patterns. "Some birds seem to migrate normally while infected," he said, "while other birds get extremely sick and are almost guaranteed to die."Vaccine makers prep bird flu shot for humans 'just in case' as rich nations lock in suppliesAvian flu is devastating seabird colonies across North Atlantic oceanThose with prior exposure to milder strains of avian influenza likely built up some level of cross-protective immunity, while other species hadn't. "That's what I think happened with northern gannets," Lang said, speaking of a species native to Newfoundland whose death toll is likely in the thousands. "Avian influenza typically doesn't circulate within those birds, because of their biology and limited interactions with other birds. When this strain came along, it devastated them."WATCH | 'Explosive' avian flu hits global bird populations:'Explosive' avian flu surge hits global bird populations2 years agoDuration 2:02Global bird populations are being ravaged by a deadly strain of avian flu, wiping out flocks of domestic poultry and killing wild birds. Some researchers warn the virus could eventually evolve to better infect humans and potentially start a future pandemic.Jennifer Provencher, a research scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) wildlife health and ecotoxicology division, said European researchers have seen similar patterns, with blood testing showing that there are birds who are getting the H5N1 strain and surviving. "And so we would expect that some immunity is built up at least in some of the populations," she said.Avian flu threat fades on farms but may be back in the fallSecond OpinionHow deadly bird flu sparked explosive outbreaks in 2022 — and why it matters for global healthGoing forward, Provencher stressed the need for ongoing surveillance, and said members of the public can report sightings of dead or dying wildlife to ECCC through the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative. "That will actually help us predict where we need to be paying attention," she said.Beyond the deaths of poultry and wildlife, Lang said it's also important to find out which bird species in Canada are developing antibodies against the virus."If we can sample as many birds as possible this coming year — the ones alive this year — can we find evidence that they were infected last year and survived?"ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

COVID vaccinations protective In a research letter published yesterday in JAMA, investigators at the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System studied death rates among 8,996 veterans hospitalized for COVID-19 and 2,403 hospitalized for flu from October 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Average patient age was 73 years. Among the 8,996 COVID-19 patients, 538 (5.98%) died within 30 days, compared with 76 of 2,403 (3.16%) flu patients. The 30-day death rate was 5.97% for COVID-19 and 3.75% for flu, for an excess death rate of 2.23%. Relative to flu hospitalizations, COVID-19 admissions were tied to a higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61). The risk of death declined with an increasing number of COVID-19 vaccinations (P=.009 for interaction between unvaccinated and vaccinated patients; P<.001 for interaction between unvaccinated and boosted patients). The authors noted that two or three times more people in the United States were hospitalized for COVID-19 than flu during the study period. "However, the difference in mortality rates between COVID-19 and influenza appears to have decreased since early in the pandemic; death rates among people hospitalized for COVID-19 were 17% to 21% in 2020 vs 6% in this study, while death rates for those hospitalized for influenza were 3.8% in 2020 vs 3.7% in this study." The risk of death declined with an increasing number of COVID-19 vaccinations. The decrease in death rates among hospitalized COVID-19 patients may have been due to variant evolution, increased immunity levels from vaccination and previous infection, and better clinical care over time, the researchers said. "The increased risk of death was greater among unvaccinated individuals compared with those vaccinated or boosted—findings that highlight the importance of vaccination in reducing risk of COVID-19 death," they wrote. 26% COVID death rate vs 9% with flu In an observational study to be presented at the April 15 to 18 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen, Denmark, researchers at the Rabin Medical Center at Belinison Hospital in Israel compared outcomes among 167 hospitalized COVID-19 Omicron patients and 221 patients admitted for flu in December 2021 and January 2022. That flu season was milder than normal, the authors noted. The median patient ages were 71 and 65 years among COVID-19 and flu patients, respectively. COVID-19 patients had higher rates of underlying illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes and needed more help with activities of daily living, while flu patients were more likely to have asthma. COVID-19 patients needed supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors to raise blood pressure more often than flu patients. A multivariate analysis showed that the 30-day death rate was 9% among flu patients, compared with 26% among COVID-19 patients, a relative difference of 55% (HR, 0.45). "Omicron was considered a less virulent variant with lower case fatality rates as compared with the original strain, even though, hospitalized patients with omicron variant still have a higher mortality rate than in seasonal influenza," the authors wrote. "This could be due to differences in underlying comorbidities of patients, the pathogenicity of the virus, population immunity, and host responses to infection." In an ECCMID news release, lead author Alaa Atamna, MD, said the results underscore the importance of vaccination. "The double whammy of overlapping influenza and COVID-19 epidemics will increase the complexity of disease and the burden on health systems," he said. "There is one basic step people can take that may alter the trajectory of either epidemic, get the vaccines for flu and COVID-19, especially if you are older and have underlying illnesses."

However, viruses that infect the same cell can also interact with each other, working jointly or in opposition. These collective interactions in viral populations are poorly understood, but are likely to be crucial in shaping infection dynamics and disease progression. Writing in PLoS Biology, Sims et al.1 reveal one consequence of inter-virus interactions: influenza virus particles can restrict each other’s spread, and, by doing so, partition a host into distinct territories of infection.

Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty ImagesCovid-19 isn’t “just a flu,” with a study of hospital patients finding that the virus was still 60% deadlier than influenza last winter. Greater immunity against the coronavirus, better treatments, and different virus variants lowered COVID’s mortality risk to about 6% among adults hospitalized in the U.S. last winter from 17% to 21% in 2020, researchers at the Clinical Epidemiology Center of the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri found. That was still much higher than the flu’s death rate of 3.7%. “This finding should be interpreted in the context of a two-to-three times greater number of people being hospitalized for Covid-19 versus influenza in the US in this period,” epidemiologist Ziyad Al-Aly and colleagues wrote in a letter Thursday in the journal JAMA. The research is based on an analysis of electronic health records in databases kept by the Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates the largest nationally integrated health care system in the US. COVID has frequently drawn comparisons with influenza, another viral respiratory disease, including by former U.S. president Donald Trump. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 22,000 Americans died from influenza in the 2019–2020 flu season, whereas COVID killed about 350,000 in 2020. Compared with flu patients, those hospitalized with COVID had a greater risk of acute kidney injury, severe septic shock, life-threatening blood clots, and a range of dangerous cardiovascular complications, Al-Aly showed in a study in 2020. Bleeding and clotting complications, which can lead to stroke and heart attack, are more common in COVID patients, said Lekshmi Santhosh, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “People who are hospitalized with COVID often tend to have more multi-organ system complications than with influenza,” said Santhosh, a pulmonary and critical-care physician and medical director of a post-COVID clinic. “When folks are hospitalized with COVID, they sometimes are ‘tipping over’ from a fragile baseline state of health.” Al-Aly’s analysis found the mortality risk was greater among unvaccinated users of the VA health system compared with those who had been immunized and boosted, underscoring the importance of the shots in reducing the risk of dying from COVID. VA users are mostly older, white males, which might limit how generalizable the findings are to other groups, the authors said.For you: The Well Adjusted newsletter: Sign up to get simple strategies to work smarter and live better, in your inbox three times a week.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Hospitalizations from COVID-19 during the most recent flu season remained significantly more deadly than those resulting from influenza, but the gap appears to have narrowed substantially since earlier in the pandemic, according to findings from Veterans Affairs' (VA) databases. Examining over 11,000 hospitalizations due to either of the two infections during this past fall and winter, 5.97% of the COVID-19 patients died within 30 days of admission versus 3.75% of the flu patients, reported Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, of VA St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, and colleagues. In a propensity score-matched analysis accounting for age, sex, prior infection, and a host of other factors, this difference translated to a 61% higher risk for death in the group with COVID (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.29-2.02), the authors detailed in a research letter published in JAMA. Furthermore, COVID-19 made up the bulk of the hospitalizations during the study period (8,996 vs 2,403 from the flu), resulting in over seven times more patient deaths (538 vs 76). "However, the difference in mortality rates between COVID-19 and influenza appears to have decreased since early in the pandemic," said Al-Aly and co-authors. In 2020, mortality rates for hospitalized COVID patients ranged from 17% to 21% depending on the study, roughly three times greater than the 6% rate in the current study, the authors noted. For flu hospitalizations, death rates were virtually the same (3.8% in 2020). "The decline in death rates among people hospitalized for COVID-19 may be due to changes in SARS-CoV-2 variants, increased immunity levels (from vaccination and prior infection), and improved clinical care," the group suggested. Except for individuals 65 and younger, where death rates at 30 days were nearly identical between COVID and flu patients (1.29% vs 1.33%), all other groups had a higher rate of death after COVID. Increased risk of death versus the flu was greatest among individuals unvaccinated against COVID (8.75% vs 3.86%; HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.80-3.00), and risk significantly decreased with the number of COVID-19 vaccinations, "findings that highlight the importance of vaccination in reducing risk of COVID-19 death," wrote Al-Aly and colleagues. People with COVID were also at higher risk of death versus the flu if they were over 65 or received no outpatient treatment -- e.g., nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir (Lagevrio), or remdesivir (Veklury). For their study, Al-Aly's team used electronic health databases from the VA, enrolling all individuals hospitalized from October 2022 to January 2023 with an admission diagnosis for COVID-19 or influenza, along with a positive test 2 days before or up to 10 days after admission. Individuals with dual infections were excluded. After propensity weighting, patients had an average age of 73 years, 71% were white, 23% were Black, and 95% were men. Average body mass index was 28, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64-65. About one in five had previously had COVID, and about 63% were current or former smokers. For vaccination history, a little less than two-thirds had received the flu vaccine and three-fourths received at least two doses of COVID vaccine, with 55% having received a booster as well. Only 2% of the hospitalized COVID-19 cases had received antivirals in the outpatient setting, while 24% received remdesivir during inpatient care. In the cases of influenza, oseltamivir was administered to 6% in the outpatient setting and to 82% during hospitalization. Limitations cited by the study authors included the common one seen with most VA studies (an older, predominantly male population), along with the fact that the results may not reflect the risk differences for non-hospitalized cases. Also, causes of death were not analyzed and residual confounding may have occurred. Ian Ingram is Managing Editor at MedPage Today and helps cover oncology for the site.

The results, published this week in the journal Population Studies, change our understanding of the social and demographic history of the 1918 pandemic. Hampton Gaddy. Image credit: Nuffield College and David Fisher. Historical demographers have thought that the 1918 influenza pandemic caused a baby bust in 1919 and then a baby boom in 1920, as birth rates recovered. This was mainly based on evidence from Norway and other European countries that were neutral in World War I.However, this new study finds that the overall 1920 baby boom in six neutral European countries was caused by economic recovery following World War I instead of any psychological effects following the 1918 pandemic. Furthermore, within these six countries, the extent of the 1920 baby boom varied significantly across different regions, and was strongly linked to the impact of the 1918 pandemic.Interestingly, the regions that had a baby boom in 1920 were not the ones whose fertility needed to recover. Parts of Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland whose fertility was initially affected the least by the 1918 pandemic experienced a baby boom in 1920, caused by the end of World War I.Meanwhile, in the communities whose fertility was hit hardest by the pandemic, couples were unable to share in the pro-fertility effects of the end of the war. This caused a large baby bust in 1919, with no baby boom in 1920. This is also clear when looking at birth cohorts. The 1919 baby bust was concentrated among women in their 30s and 40s, while the 1920 baby boom was concentrated among women in their 20s. If the baby boom served as recuperation for the bust, the two anomalies would have affected the same groups of mothers, but this was not the case. In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, for instance, older mothers had the biggest baby bust in 1919 but did not have a baby boom in 1920.Lead author Hampton Gaddy from Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, and MPhil student at Oxford University’s Department of Sociology, said: ‘It is not clear whether the communities who were hit hard by the pandemic had low fertility two years later because of lingering grief, lingering care responsibilities, or lingering economic effects—but each of those factors likely played a role.’The researchers discovered this by combining local level data on fertility and marriages across the six neutral European countries with global data on birth rates. This showed that the post-pandemic fertility situation in neutral Europe was more complex than previously appreciated and that focusing on neutral Europe has impacted researchers’ expectations about the global effects of the 1918 pandemic. In South Asia and Latin America, for example, it is much clearer that the pandemic stifled fertility rather than boosted it.Our work makes it clear that when the social environment is conducive to a baby boom, like at the end of a war, not all communities can partake in that equally. The year 1918 gave Europe both the end of a brutal war and the main wave of a deadly pandemic. When fertility recovered after the war’s end, the communities hit hard by the pandemic were unable to share in that demographic recovery. Hampton Gaddy, Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, University of Oxford.The researchers also used data on the prices of household goods across Spain at the time. This provided further evidence that the end of the war was the cause of the 1920 baby boom in neutral Europe, rather than the end of the pandemic. This data showed that birth rates in 1920 were jointly responsive to both the initial effect of the pandemic on fertility and the rate of inflation in 1919.These findings challenge the idea that pandemics and other mortality crises will necessarily be followed by baby booms that regenerate the population.Hampton Gaddy added: ‘This research reminds us that crises do not tend to have demographic silver linings. Many people have assumed that the pandemic had relatively little effect on the people who lived through it, given that they lived in a time of high disease burden. Indeed, we often speak of the 1918 pandemic as “forgotten” until recently. However, our findings suggest that the pandemic had a big enough effect to cause many couples to forego having children for at least two years.’He added: ‘Looking to the present day, the global understanding of Covid-19’s effect on birth rates is still emerging. This work raises the possibility that even if there was a baby boom in 2021 or 2022 in some communities, the 2020 pandemic may not have been the cause of that high fertility.’The study ‘Did the 1918 influenza pandemic cause a 1920 baby boom?

Share this article: The Agriculture Ministry, through the Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG), has decided to temporarily ban the hunting of all wild bird species in order to prevent the spread of avian influenza. The suspension of the wild bird hunting season comes into force today, following publication in the Official Gazette. It includes the species detailed in article 5 of the regulations of Law No. 19.473. The measure, which comes into force today following publication in the Official Gazette, seeks to prevent people handling and moving positive birds that could spread the virus. Normally, the hunting season begins throughout Chile in April, according to species and area, in line with the criteria established in the Hunting Law and its regulations. Current situation of H5N1 avian influenza H5N1 avian influenza arrived in Chile through migratory birds from the northern hemisphere. Countries were thus contaminated as the birds made their way towards the south of the continent. The first case of bird flu was detected in Chile in December last year. It has now spread to 14 regions of the country, mainly through marine wildlife, and is causing serious damage to biodiversity. According to SAG reports, 40 species are currently being affected by the virus throughout the country. SAG has taken samples from more than 3,000 wild birds to date. Among the most affected are: Pelican Guanay cormorant Kelp gull Grey gull Peruvian booby Effects of avian influenza on backyard birds With regard to the impact on backyard birds, SAG has taken more than 29,000 samples. 69 of the results have come back positive, and all birds have been eradicated. In the poultry industry, samples have been taken from 5,000 birds. Five industrial flocks have tested positive, the last in Valparaíso, which has already been controlled. There are now no positive cases in the industry in Chile to date. SAG has repeated the call to the public not to touch or move sick or dead birds. Meanwhile, the owners of poultry are called on to implement extreme biosecurity measures in their facilities. Some of the measures to prevent the spread of avian influenza in animals are: Confine the birds to prevent contact with other birds that could be affected. Protect bird feed and drinking water.

Pictured: Novavax logo behind a vaccine bottle/courtesy of STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images At the World Vaccine Congress in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Maryland-based Novavax presented data on its COVID-19 booster and COVID-influenza combination vaccine candidate. Novavax shares rose 12% Thursday following the presentation. In one study, a booster dose of the company’s a protein nanoparticle vaccine, called Nuvaxovid (approved under emergency use authorization in the U.S.), elicited enhanced immune responses against newer variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including Omicron BA.1, BA.4 and BA.5, in vaccinated individuals’ blood. The measured immune responses were comparable to three total doses of the approved messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The purpose of the study was to compile “really relevant data as to where we are in the pandemic today, as opposed to two years ago,” Lisa Dunkle, vice president of clinical development and global medical lead at Novavax, told BioSpace. The predominant COVID-19 strain circulating today is Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, which currently accounts for 90% of new U.S. cases, according to the CDC. Dunkle said that while existing vaccines and boosters have been effective against the earlier Omicron strains, XBB.1.5 is different. “It’s got some very significant mutations in the receptor binding site, which makes it harder for the antibodies to neutralize the virus. It wasn’t until we got to XBB 1.5 that things began to fall apart, and unfortunately, it fell apart for all of the [currently marketed] vaccines.” Novavax’s booster has not been tested against XBB.1.5. The FDA is currently working to determine the recommended target strains for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Dunkle said she expects that decision by late May or early June. While an updated vaccine would ideally target the variant that is circulating in the fall, that may not be realistic. “I don’t think there’s any way to accurately get a vaccine that strain-specific . . . with the current variant that’s circulating, just given the current mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2,” Scott Roberts, assistant professor in infectious diseases and medical director, infection prevention at Yale, told BioSpace. But, he added, existing bivalent boosters targeting both the original COVID-19 strain and Omicron BA.5 have generated neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1.5. “The hope is that there’s enough cross-protection where the vaccine efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization and death going into the winter season is still there, and I’m optimistic that we’ll achieve that,” he said. The Booster Debate When boosters first began to roll out, a debate ensued over whether it was optimal to stick with the primary series vaccine for the booster shot (the homologous approach) or to switch to a vaccine from a different company (the heterologous approach). In that vein, Novavax ran Study 307 measuring the immunogenic responses of people given a Novavax booster following a primary series of Pfizer’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s Spikevax, Nuvaxovid or the J&J vaccine, with and without a prior booster dose. While the study found that Novavax’s booster generated robust immunogenicity across the board, efficacy was highest in the homologous (all Novavax) cohort. While noting that this cohort was small, Dunkle said it did appear that antibodies were higher when Nuvaxovid was used as a homologous booster. Novavax also tested the immunogenicity of people primed with three doses of an mRNA vaccine and boosted with either the original Novavax booster, its booster targeting BA.1 or its bivalent vaccine. The study found responses to be similar, regardless of the vaccine formulation. Combination COVID-Flu Candidate Also on Wednesday, Vivek Shinde, vice president of clinical development and lead for older adult influenza & RSV vaccines at Novavax, gave an update on the company’s COVID-influenza combination (CIC) candidate. The rationale outlined in Shinde’s presentation was quite simple: address two major health problems with one vaccine. Roberts said he is on board with this approach. “I think a combination vaccine is only going to hopefully boost compliance in those who intend to get both vaccines,” he said. For Roberts, a combination vaccine would need to first be effective against severe disease. His preferred secondary endpoints would be prevention against infection, prevention of transmission to others and in vitro data showing neutralizing antibodies. In a Phase I/II trial, Novavax is evaluating the safety and efficacy of various formulations for the CIC vaccine. Shinde’s presentation showed that adverse events were comparable to both Nuvaxovid and Novavax’s investigational flu vaccine, qNIV, on their own. Shinde also reported that CIC formulations were immunogenic and induced strong functional antibody and CD4+ T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and multiple influenza strains. Novavax will use these data to inform an ongoing Phase II dose confirmation study. Results from this study are expected in May or June 2023.

The MOU marks the start of Lebanon’s eligibility to become a PIVI (Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction) partner country. It has become one of 21 countries that are benefiting from PIVI eligibility and support. “After the COVID pandemic, we all learned the importance of preparedness with systems in place, with vaccines readily available, but unfortunately, because of the situation in Lebanon and the resource-limited environment, this support was crucial to us and we are very appreciative of the support,” said Dr Firass Abiad. This support will allow for the availability of influenza vaccines ahead of the flu season every year for the next 5 years. The essence of the partnership is to provide technical support to the Ministry of Public Health through a workplan to improve vaccine availability and acceptability, as well as to decrease hesitancy and support and generate other information and evidence that will help integrate and sustain the availability of influenza vaccines. WHO is also supporting generating evidence to estimate the burden of influenza in Lebanon and the relative importance of the introduction of this vaccine at the national level. “PIVI, based at the Task Force for Global Health, together with our partners at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are committed to a long-term relationship with Lebanon to create a sustainable and impactful annual influenza vaccination programme that will also be a critical tool for the pandemic response. We are very excited about this collaboration”, stated Dr Joseph Bresee. This partnership is going to be sustained and renewed for the next 3 to 5 years. The MoU highlights the fact that this is a long-term partnership with the Ministry. PIVI is donating the vaccines and providing technical support. WHO’s role is to provide technical support and expertise in terms of all the technical areas that will come with the agreement which will be funded by PIVI under Task Force for Global Health through the WHO Regional Office. The formal partnership comes after intensive discussions involving the Expanded Programme onr Immunization committee, with the chair of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and other relevant immunization-related parties at the national level. “This MOU and the support of the Task Force for Global Health and CDC to Lebanon is an important opportunity to strengthen Lebanon's capacity to monitor influenza and foster preparedness for future pandemics. WHO support that started several years ago will continue to further expand national capacity for integration of the influenza vaccine at the level of PHC, and foster preparedness, prevention and response in Lebanon, within the overall national health sector strategy,” said Dr Alissar Rady. This important partnership falls under WHO’s objective of working hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with global health entities to ensure regular access to vaccines and other health-related care to citizens.

Can you comment a little bit on what that is, and maybe also about whether we think universal masking, always wearing a mask in a healthcare facility, is going to be something that we continue for all patient interactions.Tracy Field, RN, WCC, LALD, LTC-CIP: Sure. So as far as the enhanced respiratory precautions, that really came in light just when COVID came about us. And it's a mixture of the droplet precautions and contact precautions, and that is proven to help us eliminate the spread of COVID. And as far as universal masking goes, it doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon. It does seem to be helping, during the pandemic, and it is protecting us and protecting our patients that we take care of.Heather Saunders, MPH, RN, CIC: I think we also saw maybe the impact that universal masking had on seasonal flu outbreaks in decreasing the transmission of flu, as well. Could you comment a little bit on how the use of personal protection equipment has impacted and decreased the transmission of influenza?Isis Lamphier, MPH, CIC: Yes, we've seen a couple of trends with influenza. When universal masking was in effect, we saw a decrease in influenza because patients were using mask and they were protecting others from their respiratory droplets. But once we saw mask policies change a little bit, and masks no longer were a requirement, then we did see an increase in influenza, as well. I think it's important that if we see a patient come in that has respiratory-like illnesses, or influenza-like illness, that we request that they don a clean mask. Typically, they should also be segregated while they're waiting for their appointment or coming into the hospital. So, they should be in a different waiting area. And we should also emphasize just standard precautions that hand hygiene is important, and preventing infections through our hands is critical because most infections are spread through our hands.Heather Saunders, MPH, RN, CIC: I was looking at and seeing that the American Society of Testing and Materials Guidelines (ASTM) has changed a little bit, maybe in light of some of what we've experienced. But can you comment on what is required as far as ASTM ratings for face barriers and what that looks like?Isis Lamphier, MPH, CIC: ASTM has set forth clear expected standards for the development of facial barrier protection, and that's in order to ensure quality and protection for the wearer. Manufacturers are required to perform a design analysis, and in that design analysis they have to assess for leakage of exhaled air from the barrier covering. And they also look at filtration efficacy and airflow resistance as well. There's different standards that have to be met, and they need to ensure that all of those performance properties are being met in their testing.Heather Saunders, MPH, RN, CIC: Thank you. Thank you for that. Sounds like quality is so important. Knowing what type of personal protective equipment to use is so important. Think it's also so important for clinicians to understand PPE contamination and breaches. Can either one of you comment a little bit on where we see the most contamination on articles of personal protective equipment that clinicians need to be aware of?Tracy Field, RN, WCC, LALD, LTC-CIP: I think doffing is where we see the biggest risk of contamination. Just it's so important to remove the equipment in a certain fashion. And then the biggest is hand hygiene.Isis Lamphier, MPH, CIC: I think we also see contamination with prolonged use of PPE. A lot of individuals might not know that with prolonged PPE usage, they can be contaminating themself if they're continuing to use an unclean mask. And it's important to know the type of mask you're wearing or also your gown. Is it single-use disposable, or can you re-wear it? And if you can re-wear it, what are the proper conditions that have to be met? Do you have to disinfect it after use? We definitely see contamination when PPE is used outside of the instructions for use or the IFU, and it's important for wearers to understand what those specific requirements are for the PPE that they're wearing and if they can reuse it or use it for an extended period of time.Heather Saunders, MPH, RN, CIC: Is there a specific area of personal protective equipment that seems to be the most contaminated? With doffing, I can assume that there is more of a risk in touching certain parts of personal protective equipment. Is that true?Isis Lamphier, MPH, CIC: I think there are a couple. For example, mask. If a mask is reusable, for example if they're using a respirator, they need to properly store it after they remove it and also properly clean and disinfect it. Gloves can commonly cause contamination as well, especially if there's any tears in the gloves or microtears that you're unaware of. It's important to remove those gloves once they tear, perform hand hygiene, and then don a new set of gloves. It's also important to look at the CDC recommendations for removing PPE, so which items should be removed first and last, because that's sometimes a missed step when donning and doffing. It's important to note that when you're removing PPE, you want to go from your most contaminated item to your least contaminated. So, gloves should be removed first, and sometimes individuals might not want to remove those gloves first because then they're going to be touching their gown or their face shield or eye protection. So, it's important to perform that education so that they know which steps to take.Tracy Field, RN, WCC, LALD, LTC-CIP: It is a very important skill that does need a lot of reeducation because you're busy. You need to move on to the next patient. You might not be as careful as you should be in following that exact process. But it is very important.Recent VideosRelated Content The Critical Role of Rapid Diagnostics in Antibiotic StewardshipAlesia McKeown, PhD;Jeanie Bach, MSN, RN, CCRNNovember 6th 2024ArticleRapid

overwhelmed with patients because of a surge in flu cases and other respiratory infections, paediatricians have said, with authorities renewing warnings after the death of a second minor this year.AdvertisementA family doctor also told the Post that many private clinics in the city had been running low on Tamiflu, a commonly used antiviral drug, due to more children falling ill with influenza, and he feared his own clinic would run out of the medication after the Easter holiday.Prince of Wales Hospital announced on Wednesday that a 17-year-old patient, who had cerebral palsy, was earlier diagnosed with influenza A (H1) and died on Tuesday after his condition deteriorated due to pneumonia.Dr Louis Chan Tsz-wan, vice-chairman of the Hospital Authority’s Coordinating Committee in Paediatrics, on Friday said an increase in flu infections in children had pushed occupancy of wards caring for minors to over 70 per cent and occasionally above 100 per cent.In the past week, Chan said he had observed a 40 per cent increase in the number of children aged 11 or below being admitted to public hospitals for treatment of influenza compared with the previous week.Advertisement“Many admitted children carried more than one respiratory virus,” he said. “Some of them were even infected with three to four viruses.”AdvertisementShortage of influenza vaccines in PMC - Hindustan Times

However, the Pune Municipal Corporation has been awaiting a vaccine supply for the last couple of months after running out of its stock in January. The high price of the vaccine is also deterring some people from getting vaccinated. Free doses are available at PMC-run hospitals, maternity homes and dispensaries for high-risk people including expecting mothers, healthcare workers, elderly patients with comorbidities and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pune: Amid rising cases of influenza due to inclement weather, health experts have appealed to residents to get vaccinated against the infection. However, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) awaits supply of the vaccine since last couple of months. The civic body ran out of its stock in January this year. The civic body ran out of its stock in January this year. (HT PHOTO) The district civil surgeon recently received 1,000 influenza vaccine doses. Influenza vaccine or flu shots are vaccines which give protection against the four related viruses – two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B. The vaccine doses are given free of cost to high-risk people—expecting mothers, healthcare workers, elderly patients with comorbidities like diabetes, asthma, obesity, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among other things. The free doses are available at PMC-run hospitals, maternity homes and dispensaries. Dr Suryakant Deokar, PMC assistant health officer, said, “We have requested the state officials to provide us with flu shots as we have to turn away those who visit health centres for vaccination. We have been following up the request with the officials since a while.” The health officials have witnessed a surge in the number of H3N2 and H1N1 infection cases in the city. The recent increase in flu cases has been seen across various age groups, affecting children, the middle-aged population, and the elderly alike – although the intensity of symptoms differs. Influenza is a vaccine-preventable disease and it’s a must for high-risk people. The high price of the influenza vaccine is turning out to be a deterrent for people seeking to get the shot. The prices of the doses range from ₹1,500 to ₹4,000 at private health facilities in the city. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, PMC health officer, said the around 3,010 flu shots received from the state authorities in January got exhausted after reports of the spread of influenza across the country left residents to rush for civic medical centres for vaccination. “We are following up the issue with the state health department for vaccine supply. I will speak to officials soon,” he said. Dr Nagnath Yempalay, district civil surgeon, said that the influenza vaccine is given to pregnant women, health workers, elderly people and people with co-morbidity at the Aundh district hospital. “We have recently received 1,000 flu shots. But the stock is for government-run facilities in the district. There was a surge in flu cases in January and February that led to demand for the shots. If we receive the request from the local bodies, we can provide them the vaccine shots,” he said.

World Sepsis Day: Find out more about itWoman, 90, had three-day wait in A&E chairHer sister, Nia-ffion Davies, 27, said: "She said to me that she didn't feel really well, that she felt really warm to touch. Her throat was hurting a little bit and she had a headache."After going to Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf on 5 March, Bethannie discovered she had strep A and a collapsed lung. She then developed sepsis, a life-threatening condition where the body's immune system overreacts to an infection and starts to damage tissues and organs.Megan BoothBethannie (left) with her sisters Megan (centre) and Nia-ffion (right)Before being put into a coma, Bethannie texted her family members. Megan Booth, 25, Bethannie's other sister, said: "She took a video just before she went into a coma, she was messing around. I think she knew."She texted my sister that she thought she was going to die. "It kills me that she felt that, she must have been scared, but she was still able to crack a joke."Bethannie also made plans for her own funeral. Her father, Wayne Booth, said: "She told us what she wants, how she wants it, how to celebrate her life."She doesn't want the doom and gloom, she wants the happy colourful send off as she was a hearty, colourful person in life."Bethannie BoothBethannie was a support assistant at Twynyrodyn Community SchoolBethannie was transferred to Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London where she spent two-and-a-half weeks on an ECMO machine, which takes over a person's breathing using an artificial lung.After showing good progress, Bethannie was transferred back to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital where she re-developed sepsis and died on 31 March surrounded by her family. Mr Booth said: "All four of us went in to see her. We were holding her hand and she took her last breath."Ms Davies said: "She was so funny. So generous as well. She was the most selfless person I've ever met in my life."In her funeral plan, Bethannie asked people to wear colourful clothes and bucket hats and requested that her two favourite songs were played. Mr Booth said: "She wants people to celebrate her life. She wants all of her friends to have a pendant with her ashes so when they go to raves, Bethannie is with them."Nia-ffion DaviesBethannie's dad Wayne Booth said the whole family had been "ripped to shreds"Megan said the family had been overwhelmed by support, both from people on social media and in their community.Koolers, a nightclub in Merthyr Tydfil that Bethannie used to visit, held a special tribute night for her on Saturday.The family now want to raise awareness of the signs of sepsis, which can be difficult to spot.Symptoms include difficulty breathing, blotchy skin and a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it. Mr Booth said: "If we can save one poor family going through what we've gone through, we've accomplished something."A sore throat is not always a sore throat."Ms Davies added: "If you feel like things are wrong, if you suspect that anything's wrong, don't let anyone tell you that there's nothing wrong."Get a second opinion if you need a second opinion."BethannieMr Booth said Bethannie wanted people to celebrate her lifeMs Davies praised all of the medical staff who cared for her sister."We can't thank the doctors in every hospital that we went to enough," she said."They did amazing work for my sister and for our family."World Sepsis Day: Find out more about itMan died from sepsis after being sent home from A&EWidow calls for better diagnosis of sepsisWalesMerthyr TydfilHealthSepsisRelatedMotorists who bought cars on finance could share in billions3 hrs ago'I've been kicked and spat on' say shop workers5 hrs agoWalesNew Tory chair backs devolution despite debate calls8 hrs agoWalesMore2 hrs agoNHS offers 'improved' stop smoking pillPeople in England will be able to get free varenicline tablets to help them quit cigarettes. 2 hrs agoHealth8 hrs agoCovid inquiry told Treasury blocked NHS bed requestNHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard says the decision, in July 2020, was very disappointing.8 hrs agoHealth8 hrs agoPaterson was a divisive character - medic An inquest into patients linked to Ian Paterson is told the disgraced surgeon was seen as difficult.8 hrs agoBirmingham & Black Country9 hrs agoMother-of-two dies during Turkey weight-loss opJanet Savage paid £2,750 for the procedure but stopped breathing during surgery.9 hrs agoWales10 hrs agoHealth staff pay deals cannot be matched, says NesbittThe health minister predicts difficult conversations with unions over pay due to budget problems.10 hrs agoNorthern Ireland PoliticsBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveAudioWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2024 BBC.

A dog in Canada died of bird flu last week. In Wyoming, the State Veterinary Laboratory said in a brief statement that a barn cat tested positive for bird flu near Thermopolis, a small town in Hot Springs County, about 110 miles southeast of Casper. “This is the first report of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) in a domestic cat in Wyoming, and it likely became infected from ingesting meat from wild waterfowl,” the lab’s statement said. The cat later died. Dr. Myrna Miller, the lab’s supervisor of virology, said that in addiction to the infected cat, several semi-feral cats and skunks were recently found dead at or near the property. The other animals have not been tested. Article continues below the player After a previous version of this article was published on Thursday night, Dr. Miller informed BNO News about a recent case in Nebraska where two domestic cats had also tested positive for H5N1. Dr. Sarah Sillman, from the University of Nebraska’s Veterinary Diagnostic Center, wrote in a case report that two domestic cats died in January after being infected with bird flu, presumably from predation of wild birds. The first cat in Nebraska died after experiencing a “rapid decline” in health with multiple symptoms, including weight loss, fever, seizures, tremors and loss of proprioception. “The PCR Ct value for avian influenza in the brain of this cat was remarkably low (12), indicating a very large amount of virus in the brain, as consistent with an acute infection,” Dr. Sillman wrote. Three other cats in the household were considered to be at risk of bird flu and one of them developed symptoms shortly after the first affected cat. “The cat was described as somnolent and had episodes of walking in circles,” Dr. Sillman wrote. “The cat was responsive to stimuli and seemed to eat and drink normally. It lived 10 days with neurologic impairment, when the cat suddenly became laterally recumbent with continual tremors, necessitating euthanasia.” Advertisment1 A necropsy found major lesions only in the brain of the second cat and a test was positive for H5N1, Dr. Sillman said. The other two cats in the household did not develop symptoms and both tested negative for the virus. “It is presumed that the two cats described here became infected from predation of wild birds infected with the virus given the circumstances of the case,” Dr. Sillman said. “Keeping cats indoors to prevent wild bird contact – particularly given the context of the current HPAI outbreak – and avoiding feeding uncooked poultry are recommendations to minimize risk of H5N1 infection.” It’s believed to be the first time that cats in the U.S. have been infected with the new strain of H5N1, which emerged in late 2021. In December, a cat living near a duck farm in southern France also tested positive for H5N1. The cat became severely ill and had to be euthanised. Earlier this week, the Canadian Public Health Agency confirmed that a dog in Ontario had died of H5N1 after chewing on a dead goose. It was the first time a dog tested positive for the new strain of the virus. In addition to the cat, Wyoming also reported that four mountain lions and a fox have recently died of bird flu. The global spread of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b – and the recent spread to a growing number of mammals – has raised concern about the possibility of a future variant which could lead to human-to-human transmission. So far, only a few human cases have been found after contact with infected birds. “The global H5N1 situation is worrying given the wide spread of the virus in birds around the world and the increasing reports of cases in mammals, including in humans,” Dr. Sylvie Briand, a WHO official, said on February 24. “WHO takes the risk from this virus seriously and urges heightened vigilance from all countries.” Editor’s Note: This article was updated on April 9, 2023, to confirm that the cat in Wyoming has also died.

The infection strain, called H5N1, also known as bird flu, is a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza virus A and circulates most easily between birds. Although it’s rare for it to spread to mammals, numbers are increasing across Canada.The dog from Oshawa, Ont., was infected with the bird flu after chewing on a wild goose, and then developing “clinical signs,” the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said Tuesday. The case was confirmed on April 1 and the necropsy, which showed the respiratory system was involved in the death, was completed on April 3. Story continues below advertisement Although the CFIA said the risk of humans and domestic pets contracting the virus remains low, Scott Weese, a veterinary internal medicine specialist and professor at the University of Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College, said pet owners should still exercise caution as the risk is not zero.“This dog could have easily been missed because if they hadn’t noticed the encounter with the bird, that wouldn’t have triggered any testing,” he said. “So is this the only dog that’s been infected in Canada, or is it the only dog we’ve diagnosed? It’s hard to say.” 1:55 Why avian flu spread has some experts cautioning need for human vaccine Overall, domestic pets getting infected with the bird flu is rare, but the problem occurs when “you have a lot of background noise going on,” he explained.“If it’s a rare, one-in-a-million chance, but you get millions and millions of birds, that one-in-a-million chance starts to get more common.” Story continues below advertisement The World Health Organization (WHO) has called the ongoing circulation among poultry concerning. During a WHO media conference on Thursday, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist, said the transmission from poultry to mammals is “always of concern.”“As a pathogen that has that zoonotic risk, that spillover risk, the concern is if it has that amplification aspect,” she said. ” It is something the organization takes very seriously as pathogens that have epidemic and pandemic potential.” Hunting dogs may be more at risk Transmission between mammals usually happens when an animal eats or chews on a bird, Levon Abrahamyan, a virologist at the University of Montreal, said.“These cases are very rare, and they happen when there is very direct contact with a large number of viral particles,” he said. “And this can happen with a dog or any animal, including a human, is in close contact with a high concentration of the virus.” Story continues below advertisement This is why the bird flu has been transferred more to the “opportunistic carnivores,” like foxes, raccoons, skunks, wild cats and ferrets, Abrahamyan said.

For example, last month eight skunks that were found dead in the Vancouver area tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza. B.C. health officials said the skunks may have contracted the virus by eating infected wild birds.In terms of domestic animals getting infected, Abrahamyan believes hunting dogs are most at risk.Duck hunting in Canada is typically in the fall, but if the bird flu continues to spread across the country, the virus could still be present in September and October.“In the case of domestic dogs, it’s very rare the dog could get it. But a dog that can be at higher risk is the hunting dog,” Abrahamyan warned. “I would highly recommend for hunters to take precautions now that we have a highly pathogenic influenza among wild birds.“They should watch their dogs as a dead bird has a higher possibility of having the virus, as you don’t know what caused the death.” How to protect your pet from bird flu The avian flu affects all types of birds, like ducks, swans and geese. It especially affects those that tend to stay in flocks or congregate together. The virus is transmitted from bird to bird through secretions, feces and contaminated feed, water and equipment, according to the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety. Story continues below advertisement It can also be fatal, so when scavenger animals like skunks (or even a dog) eat an infected bird, they can also get the virus.“We don’t want dogs roaming around where they have a close encounter with, say, a goose, as geese tend to stand their ground,” Weese said. “Your dog goes up and barks at it and the goose will bark back. And that’s that close contact that we want to prevent.”If there is a park that dog owners enjoy, but it’s flooded with geese this time of year, Weese said it’s probably not a great place to take your pet, as the goal is to “reduce that bridge between wildlife and domestic animals.” 4:27 Bird flu virus spreads to mammals Trending Now One person is dead and 16 are injured after a shooting at Tuskegee University How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins Weese said he has two dogs of his own and lives in rural Ontario, so there are ducks and geese all over the place. Story continues below advertisement “I’m not being overly restrictive with my dogs, but I’m not going to let them go chase geese in the pond. If there’s a dead bird, I’m certainly going to keep them away and I going be more restrictive. But I’m not going to keep them completely on leash in areas where I know that we don’t see a lot of birds.”In terms of feeding pets raw meat, Weese said if a dog is on a raw meat diet, there shouldn’t be a risk of avian flu because it’s the same as buying poultry from the grocery store.“There’s no risk of influenza there,” he explained. “Poultry is really, really well monitored. They’re not going into the food chain if they’re infected.”But he warned that dog owners should not hunt their own birds to feed their dog, or have their own backyard poultry, as these are “big amplifying” sources for the virus. Are there risks with birdfeeders and avian flu? As cases of avian flu steadily rise in Canada, Weese said birdfeeders can pose a risk, especially for “birds themselves, as feeders are co-mingling sites.” Story continues below advertisement “You’re bringing together birds that might not be getting close together otherwise. And you’re also creating more of that risk of the bird’s secretions and bird poop that’s on the feeder. So it might be a place where you’re going to amplify the virus if one of them has it,” he said.There also is the danger of the bird feeder bringing in more animals that are close to the human and pet population.

Photo by Flickr/Rawpixel Ltd. (CC BY 2.0) Listen to article This story was originally published by Wired and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The wave of avian influenza H5N1 — which so far has hit 76 countries, triggered national emergencies, and created the worst animal-disease outbreak in U.S. history — keeps roaring through wild birds and commercial poultry. More than 140 million poultry worldwide have died from the virus or were slaughtered to keep it from spreading, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. And though they are harder to count, the die-offs among wild birds have been catastrophic.Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email Something has to put the brakes on. In the U.S., where losses are close to 60 million, industry experts are talking quietly about taking a step they have long resisted: vaccinating commercial chickens, laying hens, turkeys, and ducks against the flu. That doesn’t sound controversial; after all, flu shots for humans are routine, and chickens already receive a handful of vaccinations in the first days of their lives. But only a few countries routinely vaccinate poultry against avian influenza. Introducing a vaccine could trigger trade bans that would crush the enormous U.S. export market, turn sectors of the poultry trade against each other, and possibly provoke consumer uneasiness about food safety. Officially, therefore, the industry opposes what would be a drastic step. But privately — none would speak on the record — scientists at poultry companies say they see no other exit strategy. And researchers who work alongside the U.S. industry say there may be little choice but to begin vaccination — but also that the U.S. cannot embark on vaccination alone. Avian influenza has killed millions of birds. Shots to prevent it already exist. Why isn’t the entire poultry industry using them? #Influenza #Vaccines #PublicHealth #Farming “Vaccination is being discussed on a global scale because it would be a global decision,” says Karen Burns Grogan, a veterinarian and clinical associate professor at the University of Georgia’s Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center. (Georgia produces more broilers, or meat chickens, than any other state, about 1.3 billion per year.) “Everyone from the World Organization for Animal Health, to the U.S. federal government, to trading partners, would have to come to a decision.” But that decision is by no means guaranteed. Limited stocks of avian vaccines against H5N1 flu were commissioned by the federal government after a huge outbreak in 2015, but they may not curb the currently circulating strain. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has not authorized their use. And expanding the supply enough to protect billions of birds would require a massive manufacturing effort — as well as a significant labour force because those shots would likely be given by hand. The discussion is becoming urgent. Bird flu keeps infecting humans — most recently, it killed an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia and sickened her father, though the strain they contracted was different from the one currently ripping through birds, and there was no indication the disease spread from them to others. It is rapidly adapting to mammals, most recently killing sea lions off the coast of Peru and minks being farmed in Spain. Bird flu is also killing an uncountable but presumably vast number of wild birds, a change from its historic pattern in which wild birds carried the virus but were not sickened by it. “The impact on wild bird populations is unprecedented,” says Peter Marra, an ornithologist and director of the Earth Commons Institute at Georgetown University. “Massive numbers of gannets and other species have vanished. And this is not just in the U.S., it’s in the entire Western Hemisphere, throughout Europe, and we assume in Africa.” And outbreaks in poultry are increasing, even though the industry has tried to harden its biosecurity practices. Those outbreaks represent enormous animal suffering: The fast-moving disease is so gruesome that a prominent expert once called it “chicken Ebola.” Plus, a subset of American veterinarians claims a common method of culling chickens to prevent disease spread — turning off ventilation so that birds die of heat stroke — is cruel. Then, there’s the impact on the food supply: Flock losses just among laying hens last year cut the availability of eggs by 29 per cent while doubling prices. The devastation among those hens hints at complexities that make vaccination challenging. Every type of commercial poultry is allowed to live to a different age depending on its purpose: Broilers grow to full size in six to seven weeks, turkeys take about six months to get to market weight, and layers and broiler breeders (meat chickens’ parents) are allowed to live a year or more because hens can’t produce eggs until they’re about 26 weeks old. It’s odd but notable that the longer-lived varieties, layers and turkeys, seem to account for more of the losses from flu. (That may partly be an artifact of layer farms housing such huge numbers of animals — millions per property — that the arrival of the virus takes out many more birds.) So it makes sense that egg and turkey operations would benefit the most from vaccines. But eggs and turkeys don’t account for most of the U.S. international trade in poultry. Broilers do: meat, and also spare bits such as feet that Americans don’t care to consume. Broiler meat exports earned more than $5 billion in 2021, according to the USDA. Meanwhile, multiple countries that buy U.S. chicken have long refused to accept meat from vaccinated broilers, arguing that the immune response to vaccination and flu infection is so similar that safe birds cannot be distinguished from carriers. In other words, the U.S. poultry sector that least needs a vaccine would have the most to risk, economically, from using one. The intensity of H5N1’s onslaught around the world may be changing that calculus. Last fall, an international meeting in Paris explored “removing unnecessary barriers” to avian flu vaccine use. In November, the European Union issued new regulations permitting poultry vaccination under certain conditions. Since the beginning of the year, countries in Central and South America, where H5N1 just arrived, have announced they will begin vaccinating poultry. And late in 2021, the USDA authorized a five-year research project intended to search for new vaccines against avian flu, determine how to prove that they work, and map whether the use of such shots drives the flu virus toward mutations that vaccines would not protect against. A segment of the flu research community has argued for years that there’s a clear way to distinguish vaccinated birds from infected ones. The strategy, called DIVA (for “differentiating infected from vaccinated animals”), creates a molecular marker by swapping out one protein in whatever circulating strain is used to make the vaccine. When vaccinated chickens are tested, they display antibodies to that substitute strain instead of the wild type, demonstrating that their immunity comes from the vaccine and thus that they are safe to trade. The strategy was twice used in Italy, in 2000 and 2001, to shut down poultry outbreaks caused by flu strains H7N1 and H7N3. “Other countries always said that the costs attached to vaccination — because of the vaccine itself, but also because of the testing and the potential restrictions on movement — weren't worthwhile,” says Ilaria Capua, a virologist and senior fellow for global health at Johns Hopkins SAIS Europe in Bologna, who proposed the system’s use in Italy while at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie. “But the trade barriers can be nullified if you apply a system that tells you that a flock is vaccinated and has not been exposed to the virus.” Use of the DIVA system lapsed in Italy because that multiyear wave of H7 strains faded (though not before killing a Dutch veterinarian), and because other countries that were thought to be at risk at the time didn’t have the national budgets or lab capacity to create something similar. The context is different now, given how H5N1 flu has spread worldwide. The number of poultry and wild bird species it has been able to attack isn’t only a measure of the destruction it is wreaking — it’s also a signal that the virus is finding many more hosts in which it can mutate toward more virulent forms. Experts say recognizing that reality makes poultry vaccination more urgent. It’s always been known that flu spreads from wild birds to domesticated ones, on ponds or in droppings or via small birds that can squeeze past fan covers. But it’s also possible that flu spreads to wild birds in those moments. And while the logistics of vaccinating birds in the wild are unfathomable, vaccinating the ones close to home is within our grasp.

MECCNAR made a statement on Friday, following the reported death of more than eighty (80) birds spotted at Tanji Birds Reserve, Kartong beach site among other areas. “A National Taskforce by our Department of Parks and Wildlife Management and Department of Livestock Services (DLS) has begun conducting tests on birds following suspected outbreaks of Avian Influenza (bird flu) in and around Tanji Bird Reserve and Kartong. Mortality is recorded around Kotu Creek, Tanji Bird Reserve, and Kartong, also there is no reported case reported anywhere around the wetlands and in the region,” MECCNAR said in its statement made available. The statement noted that the tests conducted so far come out negative, and nonetheless, the team is still carrying out more detailed forensic examinations and continuing analysis in the labs of the Department of Livestock s Services while considering sending some samples abroad for more forestry opinion. MECCNAR urged the general public to avoid touching the affected birds with their bare hands and bury anyone found immediately, adding that the ministry is keenly following the development and will update the general public accordingly. Earlier, Momodou Lamin Gassama, Director of the Parks and Wildlife Department stated that his office has yet to confirm reports of an outbreak of Avian Influenza that is claiming the lives of birds along the coastal belt of the country. On Thursday, he told The Voice that all the online information is mere speculation but there’s no proof yet to confirm an outbreak of Avian flu his office is in charge Collins James Cross, Field Ornithologist, Kartong Birds Observatory (KBO) whose organization made the discovery and brought the issue to the fore of the public insisted that all the signs and symptoms found on the dead birds are signs of Avian Influenza. The senior Omithrologist confirmed that though Kartong Birds Observatory (KBO) has not conducted any scientific or laboratory assessment regarding the deaths of the birds along the beaches and at Tanji Birds Reserves experiences show that the birds are dying from Avian Influenza. He noted that his organization has been monitoring the conditions of birds for the past two years and is optimistic that the disease is taking a toll on the birds in the country. “Recently, KBO researcher Kebba Sosseh surveyed a serious outbreak of Avian Influenza at Tanji Bird Reserve. So far, it has killed at least 66 terns and gulls. A further 26 birds were found dying. At Kartong, 6 birds were found dying on the beach today,” Kartong Birds Observatory (KBO) reported on its Facebook triggering the situation.

The test is approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and can provide sample-to-result in an hour’s time. Truenat H3N2/H1N1 is the first point-of-care Real-Time PCR test that aids in the confirmatory diagnosis of Influenza infections. The test will work on the existing Truenat machines that are deployed across over 3500 primary and community healthcare centres and over 1200 private labs and hospitals across India, making it possible for patients to obtain a quick diagnosis at all levels of the healthcare chain. India is currently seeing a surge in influenza viral infections due to H3N2 and H1N1. The viruses that spread through the air, have the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission, which can potentially cause an influenza pandemic. Commenting on the launch, Sriram Natarajan, CEO, Founder, and Director of Molbio Diagnostics, said, “The launch of Truenat H3N2/H1N1 further strengthens Molbio’s product portfolio by providing complete testing solutions for respiratory illnesses.

Picture: ELENA VUCUKULA Fiji is not isolated to the common influenzas that have affected many since the beginning of this year. Ministry of Health’s permanent secretary Dr James Fong said we had been affected by Influenza A and recently by Influenza B. “But this is a global trend and it’s not Fiji only that is affected,” he said. “However, we are not as serious as other countries because we are not widely travelled compared to those nations. “Our current concern is the ongoing influenza outbreak as we had Influenza A and when it was receding, Influenza B and will see another escalation of cases if not now then later.” Dr Fong said since the period of COVID, they have seen outbreak of influenzas throughout the world. “It is all part and parcel of the global trend where influenzas always come up in the first five to six months of each year,” he said. “Preventing this influenza is a good focus so people can mask up in a crowded area to avoid the burden of cases. “But it will be good to the vulnerable for early medical check so we can avoid severe effects.” Amount of FJD: Convert To: Australian DollarCanadian DollarChinese YuanEuroU.K. Pound SterlingHong Kong DollarIndonesian RupiahIndian RupeeJapanese YenSouth Korean WonMalaysian RinggitNew Zealand DollarPhilippine PesoSingapore DollarThai BahtNew Taiwan Dollar U.S. DollarVietnamese DongSwiss FrancDanish KroneEgyptian PoundIsraeli New SheqelJordanian DinarLebanese PoundNorwegian KroneSwedish KronaSouth African RandU.A.E DirhamBulgarian LevBrazilian RealCzech KorunaHungarian ForintIcelandic KronaMoldova LeiMexican PesoPolish ZlotyRomanian New LeuSerbian DinarRussian RoubleTurkish LiraUkrainian HryvniaChilean PesoArmenia DramAzerbaijan ManatBangladeshi takaDominican PesoAlgerian DinarGeorgian lariIraqi dinarKyrgyzstan SomKazakhstani TengeLibyan DinarMoroccan DirhamPakistani RupeeSaudi RiyalTajikistan RubleNew Turkmenistan ManatTunisian DinarUzbekistan SumCentral African CFA FrancWest African CFA FrancBelarussian RubleVenezuelan BolivarPeruvian Nuevo SolArgentine PesoBolivian BolivianoColombian PesoCosta Rican ColónHaitian gourdePanamanian BalboaParaguayan GuaraníUruguayan PesoNigerian NairaAfghan afghaniAlbanian lekNeth.

The Ministry of Health says it must be noted that this increased presence of influenza B in circulation is similarly being observed in other countries of the region and the world. They also say they have Tamiflu (antiviral medications) stock which is being distributed and they are getting more flu vaccines which will be offered to those vulnerable to the severe effects of Influenza (individuals with chronic illness, pregnant women), and to front line staff. The Ministry further says whilst they still have stocks of flu testing reagents and consumables, they are also working with the World Health Organisation to increase their stocks. The Ministry of Health advises members of the public to stay home when feeling unwell or wear face coverings (masks) when going outside in order to minimize the spread of infection. They also advise that people living with chronic disease and children, especially babies, need to be protected from the severe effects of influenza. They say preventative measures will be familiar as they are similar to COVID-19. For adults, see a Doctor if the following danger symptoms develop; difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, pain or heaviness in the chest, persistent fever (more than 3 days, despite home treatment), very high temperature (over 40°C), feeling sicker as time goes by, confusion and persistent drowsiness, severe headache that doesn’t respond to painkillers and unusual symptoms such as hallucinations, severe vomiting, neck stiffness, skin rash, rapid heart rate, chills, uncontrollable shivering, or muscle spasms. For children, seek medical care right away if your child has a fever greater than 38°C for more than two days, or a fever of 40°C or higher for any amount of time has a fever of 38°C or higher and is under 3 months old has a fever that doesn’t get better after taking Panadol seems unusually drowsy or lethargic won’t eat or drink is wheezing or is short of breath.

(Source: istock.com)SHARE MEEpidemiologist Michael Baker said multiplex rapid antigen tests (RAT) which test for Covid-19, influenza and RSV would be a useful tool to have in New Zealand.It comes as the tests have been made available in parts of Europe such as Belgium and Spain.The tests look similar to a regular Covid-19 RAT and are used in the same way.The only difference is they also show if you have influenza A or B, or RSV.Baker told 1News it would be a "really good move in principle" if accurate home tests for other common illnesses could be introduced in New Zealand.ADVERTISEMENT"This could be seen as a big advance as we move as a society to more self-testing and self-management," he said.However, he warned there is a risk only rich people could afford the tests if they're not subsidised and made easily available to the public."We would need to have offer access for communities most at risk," Baker added.He believes the tests could be useful for those who were considered essential workers during the Covid-19 pandemic."Employers may want to test people working in essential roles once a week to make sure they aren't spreading Covid or influenza around their workforce".He believes it would provide an economic benefit, with more people being able to isolate themselves if they test positive to any of the illnesses.ADVERTISEMENTUS epidemiologist Dr Eric Feigl Ding is pushing for the tests to be used in America.In a tweet he hypothesised the FDA may be hesitant to import them as it may see more workers isolating if they tested negative for Covid but positive for RSV or influenza.Te Whatu Ora's responseWhen asked if it plans on clearing or importing the 4-in-1 tests for use in New Zealand, Te Whatu Ora said: "There is a sufficient supply of Covid-19 Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) in the national supply to cover the winter period."There are no plans to import additional tests as part of the public health response due to this sufficient supply."Te Whatu Ora said anyone wanting to import the tests for use must apply for an exemption.ADVERTISEMENT"Applications from those wishing to import multiplex test devices will be processed through the exemption process and assessed to determine whether they meet the minimum clinical performance criteria."The clinical performance criteria for multiplex tests, which detect a range of different pathogens, is much higher than the criteria for regular Covid-19 RAT."Minimum requirements for multiplex tests are a clinical sensitivity of ≥98% and a specificity of ≥98%," the Ministry of Health states.More on this topicCovid-19: Cases rise slightly to 12,202, 14 deaths reportedThe numbers cover the week from Monday, March 27 to Sunday, April 2.HealthApril 3, 2023'Going to hit the fan': South Auckland GPs warn of flu season crisisIt follows reports from Te Whatu Ora that the 2023 flu season could be one of the worst in years.HealthApril 3, 20232:07Fluorecare multiplex tests being used in Europe claim a sensitivity rate of 92.93% for Covid, 92.04% for influenza A, 90.91% for influenza B and 95.45% for RSV.However, Covid-19 RAT only require a minimum ≥80% sensitivity and>98% specificity.New ZealandHealthCovid-19SHARE MEMore StoriesVIEW MOREMore StoriesPharmac to disestablish Māori advisory groupPharmac established Te Rōpū in 2022 following a damning independent
