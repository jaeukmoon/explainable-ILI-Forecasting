Disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx contributes to acute lung injury in sepsis, but has not been well studied in H1N1 influenza. We aim to determine whether the plasma glycocalyx components levels are predictive of disease severity in H1N1 influenza. This prospective observational study included 53 patients with influenza A (H1N1) during the influenza season, and 30 healthy controls in our hospital. Patients were grouped by severity and survival. We collected clinical data and blood samples at admission. Inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, interleukin-10) and endothelial glycocalyx components (syndecan-1, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate) were measured. The plasma levels of syndecan-1, hyaluronan, and heparan sulfate were significantly higher in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) than in mild cases. Syndecan-1 and hyaluronan were positively correlated with disease severity, which was indicated by the APACHE II and SOFA scores and lactate levels, and negatively correlated with albumin levels. At a cutoff point ≥ 173.9 ng/mL, syndecan-1 had a 81.3% sensitivity and 70.3% specificity for predicting of 28-day mortality. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated a strong association between syndecan-1 levels and 28-day mortality (log-rank 11.04, P = 0.001). Elevated plasma levels of syndecan-1 has a potential role in systemic organ dysfunction and may be indicative of disease severity in patients with influenza A (H1N1).

Clinical symptoms range from mild to severe (including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS))1,2. According to World Health Organization reports (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/), influenza causes global annual infection rates of 5%–10% in adults, 3–5 million cases of severe illness, and between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths annually worldwide. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are approved for both influenza A and B virus infections; early antiviral therapy with NAIs can improve the outcome of influenza A2; however, a small number of patients experience a rapid progression to primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections, resulting in a significant number of deaths despite the use of antivirals3. Therefore, improving antivirals alone may not be sufficient to minimize morbidity and mortality, and the pathogenesis of influenza A needs to be further explored.Severe influenza virus infections cause a dysregulated inflammatory response, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and blood, a condition often referred to as a “cytokine storm”4. Inflammatory cytokines can lead to diffuse alveolar damage, and interstitial and airspace inflammation, which adversely affect outcomes in patients with severe influenza5,6. An abnormal immune response to influenza A can lead to endothelial damage, alteration of microvascular permeability, tissue edema, deregulation of coagulation, and even shock7,8.Influenza A can directly and indirectly cause lung endothelial cell activation and injury, inducing microvascular leakage9. The surface of the vascular endothelium is coated with a “thick” glycocalyx, a dynamic and complex biochemical structure consisting of core proteins (syndecans and glypicans) and glycosaminoglycan chains (heparan sulfate [HS], hyaluronan [HA] etc.), which play a key role in limiting vascular permeability and regulating platelet and leukocyte adhesion10. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) belongs to the family of syndecans, and is involved in leucocyte recruitment, the chemokine gradient, and extracellular matrix remodeling during inflammatory diseases11; it also plays a pivotal role in glycocalyx integrity and function. Glycocalyx dysfunction and component shedding have been described in many clinical pathophysiologic processes, including sepsis12, ARDS13, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)14. Furthermore, elevated plasma SDC-1 and HA levels are associated with cumulative fluid volumes, degree of organ failure, and increased mortality in patients with sepsis15,16. Lipopolysaccharide induced shedding of HS in the pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx uncovers endothelial cell surface adhesion molecules, thereby accelerating neutrophil adhesion and alveolar exudation17. Benatti et al.18 reported that a higher level of HA and SDC-1 in flu syndromes with the ARDS group is observed compared to those without ARDS. These findings suggest that endothelial glycocalyx shedding occurs during the virus-induced ARDS installation. Thus, the role of endothelial glycocalyx injury and activation in the pathogenesis of ARDS caused by sepsis and flu is known, but the role of the endothelial glycocalyx in influenza A (H1N1) severity has not been elucidated. However, the effect of the components of the glycocalyx on the prediction disease severity of influenza A (H1N1) needs to be further investigated.We further hypothesized that the degree of endothelial glycocalyx degradation is associated with severity and mortality in patients with influenza A(H1N1). In this study, we aimed to determine whether the plasma levels of glycocalyx components are indicative of influenza A (H1N1) severity.Materials and methodsStudy design and patient recruitmentThis prospective observational study included patients admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (72 beds) and intensive care unit (48 beds) of Binzhou Medical University Hospital (Binzhou, Shandong, China) during a period of the influenza season from November 2017 to March 2018 and from November 2018 to March 2019. The inclusion criteria were the age of ≥ 18 years, and should be an influenza-positive PCR test from an airway specimen. Viral specimens were collected from the patients via nasopharyngeal swab, whereas lower airway specimens were obtained via endotracheal tube and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Influenza A (H1N1) reverse transcription PCR testing was performed in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. A total of 30 age- and sex-matched healthy donors were recruited as controls. Patients who met any one of the following criteria were classified as severe: ARDS, shock, multiorgan failure, requiring ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation for medical reasons. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Binzhou Medical University Hospital, and was registered in the Clinical Trials Register (ChiCTR2000040921). Informed consent was obtained from patients (or their caregivers) and healthy controls before enrollment.Data and blood sample collectionDemographic characteristics, including sex, age, comorbidity, and symptoms at onset of illness, were recorded on admission. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and the Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score were calculated to assess illness severity. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to the 28-day mortality rate.On the first medical diagnosis, a venous blood sample was collected in a K2 EDTA tube. Venous blood samples were collected from the patients and centrifuged at 4000×g for 10 min, and plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until analysis. The lactate level, blood routine index, hepatic and renal function, and coagulation/fibrinolysis markers were analyzed in a standardized laboratory. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Besançon cedex, France, 950.090.096, Diaclone), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Besançon cedex, France, 950.030.096, Diaclone) and IL-10 (Besançon cedex, France, 950.060.096, Diaclone), SDC-1 (Besançon cedex, France, 950.640.096, Diaclone), HA (Minneapolis, USA, DHYAL0, R&D Systems), and HS (San Diego, USA, MBS285287, MyBioSource,) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Statistical analysisAll categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages. Between–group comparisons of frequencies were analyzed using the chi–square test. Summary statistics for normally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation, and non–normally distributed continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range. Differences between groups were tested for significance using either the non–parametric Mann–Whitney U test or an unpaired Student’s t-test for two groups and the Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance for multiple groups. Correlations were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test. The efficacy of each parameter in predicting the diagnostic power of each marker is expressed as the area under curve (AUC) using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to compare the outcome of groups according to the SDC-1 cut–off. Survival curves were compared using a log–rank test. For all tests, a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 25.0.ResultsPatient characteristicsWe initially screened 59 hospitalized patients with a high suspicion of influenza A infection (Fig. 1). We excluded one patient with avian influenza H7N9, and five patients with influenza B antigen (+). Thus, we enrolled 53 patients with a positive PCR test for influenza A (H1N1) and 30 healthy controls. The 30 healthy controls comprised 15 men and 15 women with a median age of 59 years. The 53 patients with influenza A (H1N1) comprised 20 men (37.73%) and 33 women (62.26%) with a median age of 57 years. Using the program for diagnosis and treatment of influenza A (H1N1), H1N1-infected patients were divided into two different groups based on clinical severity: the mild group (n = 15) and the severe group (n = 38). The patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.Figure 1Flowchart of the study.Full size imageTable 1 Characteristics and symptoms of patients infected with Influenza A (H1N1).Full size tableThe most common clinical features at illness onset included a fever of > 38℃ (n = 35, 66.04%), cough (n = 42, 79.25%), sputum production (n = 33, 62.26%), oppression, (n = 22, 41.51%) and chilly (n = 14, 26.41%). Less common symptoms were myalgia, chest pain, pharyngalgia, anorexia, etc. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n = 15, 28.30%), cardiovascular disease (n = 6, 11.32%), and diabetes (n = 8, 15.09%); however, 9 patients presented without comorbidity. Two patients in the mild group presented with asthma; this comorbidity was not present among patients in the severe group. The P/F ratio tended to be lower in the severe group than in the mild group. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in > 50% of the patients in the severe group. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients taking steroid treatment between the two groups. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the severe group than in the mild group. All participants were followed-up for 28 days, at which point there were 37 survivors and 16 non-survivors.Laboratory records and inflammation markersThe median white blood cell count in both the mild and severe groups were within the normal range; however, the count was significantly higher in the severe group; 50% of the patients in the severe group had white blood cell counts of > 10 × 109/L. The lymphocyte count and percentage were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were higher than 35 U/L in 17 patients in the severe group and four in the mild group. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were higher than 40 U/L in 24 patients in the severe group and one in the mild group. Concurrently, the proportion of patients with increased AST was significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group (24/38 [63.16%] vs. 1/15 [6.67%], P < 0.001). The lactate dehydrogenase and procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group. However, the albumin level was significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group. The severe group also exhibited marked increases in TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 levels relative to the mild group. The laboratory findings and inflammation markers of patients with influenza A (H1N1) are presented in Table 2.Table 2 Laboratory records and inflammation markers of patients infected with Influenza A (H1N1) on admission.Full size tableGlycocalyx component levels and biomarker accuracyThe plasma levels of SDC-1 (257.9 [142.1–658.8] vs. 58.6 [49.4–75.9] ng/ml), HA (334.4 [159.3–413.9] vs. 156.6 [116.1–230.5] ng/ml), and HS (305.1 [193.9–516.9] vs. 228.8 [198.9–312.4] ng/ml) were significantly higher in the severe group than in the mild group (Fig. 2). We conducted a ROC analysis to determine the utility of glycocalyx components as markers of severe disease. The diagnostic accuracy for the identification of patients progressing to severe influenza A (H1N1) was highest for SDC-1, with an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.881–1.000; P < 0.001; Fig. 2d). At a cutoff point of > 81.0 ng/mL, SDC-1 had a sensitivity of 92.1% and specificity of 86.7% for diagnosing severe influenza A (H1N1).Figure 2Plasma levels of glycocalyx components and ROC curves for the prediction of severe influenza A (H1N1).

Three-group comparisons of frequencies were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis test. SDC-1, syndecan-1; HS, heparan sulfate; HA, hyaluronan.Full size imageSDC-1 levels and disease severityTo identify the clinical relevance of endothelial glycocalyx components, we analyzed the correlation between the following variables: SDC-1, HA, and HS levels; SOFA score; APACHE II score; and various biochemical parameters including lactate, albumin, inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), and global hemostatic markers (platelet count and D-dimer).The SOFA and APACHE II scores indicate organ dysfunction and disease severity in critically ill patients independent of the underlying disease, and are therefore commonly used to predict mortality in ICU patients. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the SDC-1 and HA levels were significantly correlated with the APACHE II (r = 0.526, P < 0.001; r = 0.439, P = 0.001) and SOFA scores (r = 0.515, P < 0.001; r = 0.409, P = 0.002) (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). High lactate level is traditionally considered as a marker of tissue hypoxia, and can be considered as a warning signal for organ dysfunction19. Among the glycocalyx components, lactate levels were significantly positively correlated with SDC-1 (r = 0.392, P = 0.004) and HA (r = 0.372, P = 0.006) levels (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). SDC-1 and HA were negatively correlated with the albumin levels (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 2). The platelet count and D-dimer concentration reflect coagulation function. SDC-1 and HA were negatively correlated with the platelet count and positively correlated with the D-dimer concentration (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). We also observed that SDC-1 and HA were positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-10 levels (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 4).Table 3 Correlations between glycocalyx components levels and various clinical parameters.Full size tablePredictors of 28-day mortalityAll study participants were followed-up for 28 days and divided into the survivor and non-survivor groups (Table 4). The APACHE II and SOFA scores and lactate, D-dimer, IL-6, IL-10, SDC-1, and HA levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors. The albumin level and lymphocyte percentage were significantly lower in non-survivors than in survivors. We constructed ROC curves to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the APACHE II and SOFA scores, laboratory records, inflammation markers, and endothelial glycocalyx markers, in order to predict 28-day mortality (Fig. 3). The AUC for the SDC-1 was 0.855 (95% CI 0.75–0.96), which was higher than that for other indicators. At a cutoff point of ≥ 173.9 ng/ml, SDC-1 provided a specificity of 81.3% and a sensitivity of 70.3% for predicting 28-day mortality. Kaplan–Meier survival analyses are shown in Fig. 4. Patients with plasma SDC-1 ≥ 173.9 ng/ml had a significantly higher 28-day mortality estimate than patients with plasma SDC-1 < 173.9 ng/ml (P = 0.001).Table 4 The APACHE II and SOFA scores, laboratory records, inflammation markers, and endothelial glycocalyx markers in the survivors and non-survivors (28-day death) on the admission.Full size tableFigure 3ROC curves for the prediction of 28-day mortality in patients with influenza A (H1N1).Full size imageFigure 4Kaplan–Meier survival estimates for all patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection according to the circulating levels of syndecan-1 (SDC-1, cut-off: 173.9 ng/ml).Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we aimed to determine whether the plasma levels of glycocalyx components are indicative of influenza A (H1N1) severity. We found that SDC-1, HS, and HA levels were significantly higher in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) than in patients with mild disease. In addition, the severity of endothelial glycocalyx shedding was closely associated with disease severity, and facilitated the identification of patients with severe influenza A (H1N1). Furthermore, we found that the level of SDC-1 was a good predictor for 28-day mortality among patients with influenza A (H1N1). To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare plasma glycocalyx components in patients with mild and severe influenza A (H1N1).Pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viral infections continue to be a public health threat20. Influenza A (H1N1)-infected patients most often have a mild clinical course; but the mortality rate is higher in severe cases. Naudion et al.21 reported that nineteen patients (9.1%) died in the hospital during the study period. Lobo et al.22 reported that the mortality rate for the patients with severe acute respiratory infection in the influenza A (H1N1) positive was 29.5%. In our study, the 28-day mortality rate of severe H1N1 patients was 42.1%. Furthermore, we found that approximately 21% of patients with severe H1N1 had no underlying disease. Several studies have found that both young subjects and adults may develop a severe clinical course of H1N1 infection without having any known risk factors23,24. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In the ICU, patients with influenza A (H1N1) often present with viral pneumonia, severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, and ARDS. Currently, treatment for patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) is limited to antiviral drugs and symptomatic treatment, and which mainly consists of the optimization of oxygen supply and transfer through ventilation.The severity of influenza A has been attributed to a systemic and inflammatory process that damages not only the lungs, but also multiple organs, including the central nervous system and cardiovascular system25,26. In our study, we found that patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) had increased levels of D-dimer, indicating coagulation disorders. The multiple organ damage caused by influenza A may be due to inflammation and vascular endothelial cell injury9. The cytokines storms caused by influenza have been associated with pro-inflammatory response disorder, which may lead to significant pathological consequences and poor prognosis6,27,28. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are closely related to outcomes in patients with severe influenza27,28,29. This is consistent with our observation of significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) in non-survivors compared to survivors.The levels of endothelial glycocalyx components, including SDC-1, HS, and HA, are useful biomarkers for sepsis15,16, ARDS13,17, and COVID-1914,30. Further, the APACHE II and SOFA scores may be used to assess the risk of death in critically ill patients, regardless of the primary disease. We found that plasma levels of SDC-1 and HA were significantly higher in patients with severe H1N1 than in patients with mild H1N1, and were positively correlated with the APACHE II and SOFA scores. Furthermore, at a cutoff point of ≥ 173.9 ng/ml, SDC-1 showed a specificity of 81.3% and sensitivity of 70.3% for predicting 28-day mortality. The plasma SDC-1 levels ≥ 173.9 ng/ml were associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.A few of the pathophysiological features of severe influenza pneumonia include small vessel thrombosis, hemorrhage, and diffuse alveolar damage31. The surface of vascular endothelium is coated with glycocalyx, which is extremely important for the maintenance of antithrombogenicity in the vascular lumen32. Disturbance of the glycocalyx is often due to the increased expression and release of proteinases (matrix metalloproteinases) and glycosidases (e.g., hyaluronidases and heparinase)33. Aggregation of activated platelets within the pulmonary microvasculature promotes lung inflammation and injury34; shedding of the glycocalyx results in promoted platelet aggregation and adhesion to the endothelium and subsequent thrombi formation35. Chappell et al.36 reported that protection from glycocalyx shedding reduces platelet adhesion in ischemiaeperfusion injury. We previously found that an increasing level of SDC-1 can be used as a biomarker for predicting diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) development with sepsis11 and that non-anticoagulant heparin can improve coagulation by inhibiting the activity of heparinase and reducing the shedding of glycocalyx in sepsis rats37. It is well known that a sharp increase in D-dimer, a secondary fibrinolytic specific molecular marker, typically indicates the existence of a thrombus. Wang et al.38 reported that the significantly increased D-dimer and corresponding hypoxemia indicated to the probability of pulmonary microthrombus. Several studies have shown that elevated plasma D-dimer is a prognostic factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-1939, influenza A(H1N1)38, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)40. In this study, the AUCs predicted by SDC-1 for severe influenza A (H1N1) and 28-day mortality were 0.942 (95% CI 0.881–1.00), 0.855 (95% CI 0.75–0.96), which were higher than that for D-dimer 0.845 (95% CI 0.733–0.956), 0.791 (95% CI 0.654–0.927) (Supplementary Fig. 5). In conclusion, the destruction of the glycocalyx can lead to platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombi formation; SDC-1 was more reliable than D-dimer in predicting the prognosis of influenza A (H1N1).Shedding of the glycocalyx results in pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier disorder, mainly characterized by albumin exudation and tissue edema10. In this study, we observed a significant negative correlation (r = −0.639) between the plasma albumin level and SDC-1 level. Thus, we hypothesized that the shedding of the glycocalyx was associated with a decrease in blood albumin levels. Albumin has multiple biological activities including antioxidant effects41, and maintains vessel wall integrity. Although albumin has a net negative charge, its amphoteric nature promotes tight binding to the glycocalyx, with the net effects of reducing hydraulic conductivity across the vascular barrier, resisting glycocalyx degradation (i.e., protecting against shedding), and contributing to the maintenance of vascular integrity and normal capillary permeability42,43. Jacob et al.44 showed that 5% albumin prevented glycocalyx degradation more effectively than did HES (6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4) and 0.9% normal saline in their animal heart model. We believe that the effectiveness of albumin administration in preventing glycocalyx degradation in severe influenza or ARDS needs to be further explored.Our study has several limitations. First, this study was conducted at a single center and involved a relatively small number of patients with influenza A (H1N1); our findings require large-scale clinical validation in order to be generalized. Therefore, our data should be interpreted with caution. Second, the data presented here were based on single time-point measurements and were not consecutive, the dynamic change was unknown, and the predictive value needs further evaluation. Despite the above limitations, we believe that our study has yielded important and novel findings regarding the prediction of mortality in hospitalized patients with influenza A (H1N1).ConclusionsPlasma glycocalyx component levels are significantly higher in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) than in mild cases. Specifically, SDC-1 and HA are closely correlated with APACHE II and SOFA scores, albumin, platelets, and D-dimer. Plasma SDC-1 levels of ≥ 173.9 ng/ml were associated with 28-day mortality in patients with influenza A (H1N1). Thus, increased plasma SDC-1 may be a biomarker of disease severity and could be useful for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with influenza A (H1N1).Ethics approval statementThis study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by research ethics board of Binzhou Medical University Hospital.

Many of the symptoms are similar, so how do you know what you have if you get sick? For instance, all three illnesses involve coughing, sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose. Other symptoms differ. For instance, diarrhea and nausea may occur if you have influenza or COVID-19, but not if you have a cold. So how can you find out what illness you have? There are tests available to determine what is making you sick. If you become ill, experts recommend that you call the doctor with your symptoms and begin to quarantine. Also, it is possible to have both influenza and COVID-19 at the same time which could lead to more serious illnesses. A test may be necessary to determine which virus is making you ill. GET VACCINATED The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the best way to reduce your risk of getting either the seasonal flu or COVID-19 is to get both the influenza and coronavirus vaccines. Other safety measures include: If you are sick, stay home and limit contact with others as much as possible. Avoid close contact with someone who is sick. Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth when in indoor public places. Whenever possible, stay 6 feet apart from people who don’t live with you. Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces. Consider self-testing before indoor gatherings. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs can easily spread this way. Clean and disinfect commonly used surfaces and objects. COVID UPDATE The United States is averaging more than 400,000 new cases a day for the first time since the pandemic began. This is an increase of almost 240% in just the last two weeks. More than 56 million cases have now been reported and more than 826,000 people have died in the U.S. alone. The CDC recommends everyone ages 5 and older get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to help protect against the coronavirus. If eligible, people who have been vaccinated should also get their booster dose.

Every flu season is different and we never know how bad a flu season is going to be or how long it’s going to last which is why it is so important to get the flu vaccine every year. Some things to know about the flu vaccine: It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the immune system to fully respond to the vaccine and provide the body protection. Children 6 months through 8 years old who getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of the vaccine. The flu vaccine might cause some mild side effects such as low grade fever, aches, or redness/swelling where the shot was given but it cannot cause the flu. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza, including young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, and people 65 years of age and older. Flu viruses generally circulate from late fall to early spring, but can last into late spring. September and October are good times to get vaccinated, but you can get vaccinated anytime during flu season. COVID vaccines and the flu vaccine can be given at the same time.

There’s Nothing Unique About Catching the Flu and COVID-19 At the Same TimeDon’t Panic About ‘Flurona’. There’s Nothing Unique About Catching the Flu and COVID-19 At the Same Time8 minute readBy Angela HauptJanuary 6, 2022 2:59 PM ESTThere’s yet another colorful addition to the pandemic lexicon—“flurona”—but it doesn’t refer to a new variant or even a new condition. The made-up term describes simultaneous infection with both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The two diseases do not combine to make some hybrid form of either virus, which makes “flurona” a bit of a fearmongering misnomer. But co-infection is becoming more common. Having COVID-19 and the flu at the same time has been a possibility since the beginning of the pandemic, but until now, rigorous safety precautions largely prevented such concerns from coming to fruition. “Everybody was basically hunkered down—we shuttered our windows and closed our doors. We masked up. Schools were out and daycares went down,” says Dr. Frank Esper, a physician at the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases. “So all the viruses took a nosedive.” That’s no longer the case. “We’re seeing many, many people who have the coronavirus as well as a second or even third germ at the same time,” Esper says, and that could translate to an increasing number of so-called flurona cases.Earlier this week, Texas Children’s Hospital said that a child who was infected with both influenza and COVID-19 was recovering at home. Los Angeles County reported its first case of flurona in a teenager who had just returned from a family trip to Mexico. He reportedly does not have serious symptoms and is recovering at home. Israel recently recorded its first case in an unvaccinated pregnant woman who experienced mild symptoms, and instances have been detected in Brazil and Hungary.Here’s what to know about co-infection with the flu and COVID-19:Is flurona new?No. Having more than one virus at the same time is not a novel concept and has become more common over the last several decades, Esper says, so having the flu and coronavirus at the same time isn’t surprising. “It’s important for people to know that a lot of these co-infections, we’ve seen them for decades,” he says. “This is not a new phenomenon” and not cause for panic.Coinfection was already happening in 2020, when research conducted at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, found that nearly 12% of the 544 patients infected with COVID-19 also had influenza. Another 2020 study found that of nearly 2,000 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus in New York City, 42—2.1%—were co-infected with some other virus, and one was co-infected with the flu. The same year, researchers in Northern California found that about 21% of specimens positive for COVID-19 were also positive for another pathogen, most frequently rhinovirus.Will flurona be more common this year?Almost definitely. The highly contagious Omicron variant continues to whip around the globe, leading to record-high cases nearly every day. The flu, which is a respiratory infection, circulates during the fall and winter, usually peaking between December and February. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says flu activity is still low nationally, it’s steadily increasing.Like SARS-CoV-2, the flu spreads through droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze or talk to each other. Less frequently, it spreads via contaminated surfaces. For example, if someone with the flu touched a grocery store shelf, and then you did—and proceeded to rub your eyes or put your hand in your mouth—you could become infected. The flu can spread from up to approximately 6 feet away.“The discussion about COVID and influenza didn’t happen last year because there was no influenza really going around,” says Dr. Abinash Virk, an infectious disease specialist with the Mayo Clinic. Vaccines weren’t available yet, so mask mandates were in effect and people were social distancing and skipping social gatherings. “This year, influenza has already picked up,” Virk says. “So yes, we are worried that people will get both infections.”Also concerning: Fewer people are getting the flu shot this year than in previous years, Virk says. As of the end of November, for example, 47.5% of pregnant people had gotten their shot, which is nearly 15 percentage points lower than the same time last year.If I got the flu shot and am vaccinated against COVID-19, can I still get co-infection?Yes. “It’s not like you get the vaccine and you’re bulletproof protected,” Virk says. However, the best way to prevent hospitalization and severe illness is to get vaccinated against both viruses. “You may still get a mild infection—but hopefully it’ll only be a mild infection.”There’s some evidence that this year’s flu shot doesn’t match the circulating strain particularly well. Manufacturers produce shots designed to combat four strains that circulated during the previous season; that was difficult this year, since the pandemic essentially flattened the flu in 2020-2021. Still, it’s important to get the shot. “It doesn’t mean you’re not going to get protection,” Esper says. Almost everyone ages 6 months and over is eligible, and it’s especially encouraged for pregnant people, older adults, young kids and those with compromised immune systems.What are the symptoms of flurona?COVID-19 and influenza cause similar symptoms: fever, coughing, fatigue, sore throat, a runny nose and muscle aches. Esper anticipates that those with co-infection wouldn’t experience unique symptoms.Patients hospitalized with a dual infection will be treated based on their risk of severe illness, Virk says. That might include Tamiflu, an antiviral that can lessen the amount of time one is sick with the flu and cut the risk of serious complications and death, and COVID-19-specific treatments such as oxygen, monoclonal antibodies and IL6 receptor blockers. The exact treatment program will depend on each patient’s circumstances and personal risk factors. For example, patients at “higher risk of having severe lung disease,” such as those with obesity, will receive more aggressive treatment, Virk says.It’s possible that co-infection could lead to longer illness: In one of the early studies in Wuhan, COVID-19 patients who also had influenza shed SARS-CoV-2 for 17 days, as compared to an average of 12 days for those with only one infection.Does having the flu at the same time increase the severity of COVID-19?“The jury’s still out,” Esper says, “and that’s something we’re very interested in seeing.” But there’s reason for optimism: research has historically indicated that people with two or three viruses at the same time don’t experience more severe illness than if they just had one. “Everybody knows flu is bad; everybody knows coronavirus is bad,” he says. “You put the two together, you think you’re even worse. For the most part, virus-wise, we don’t see that.”Still, Esper adds, every virus can manifest differently, and so can specific pairings. So if you have both virus A and virus B, you might experience more severe disease; mix up a virus C and virus D cocktail, and you wouldn’t see such an effect. That underscores the need for more data to draw a conclusion.Are kids at greater risk?In general, young children are six to eight times more likely to have multiple viruses at the same time compared to adults, Esper says—partly because they’re exposed to so many germs at places like daycare. Plus, he points out, flu shot rates among kids tend to be low. According to data from the CDC, 58.6% of children 6 months through 17 years got inoculated during the 2020-2021 flu season, a decrease of about 5 percentage points compared to 2019-2020. And kids under 5 still can’t get vaccinated against the coronavirus, leaving them particularly vulnerable to infection.How can I protect against flurona?The good news is that we already know how to stay healthy. “If there was one big takeaway over the last 12 months, it’s how little respiratory viruses we saw because everybody was masking up and washing their hands and distancing,” Esper says. “So if you’re like, ‘Do I really have to wear a mask?’ It’s not just protecting you against the coronavirus.

The global pandemic that scientists feared had finally arrived, only no one predicted it would come from North America.PREVIEW THIS ISSUENational security advisors and public health officials had been warning the White House for years that dangerous flu viruses were circulating in birds that were only a handful of mutations away from jumping to humans, potentially sparking a pandemic like the notorious 1918 influenza outbreak that claimed more than 20 million lives globally. But US health officials expected the next globe-trotting virus to arise in Asia, the hotbed of zoonotic pathogens such as H5N1, or “bird flu,” and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, which nearly caused a pandemic in 2003. So they were caught off guard when cases of a new disease started appearing in children in San Diego in April 2009. Officials were doubly surprised when the virus was identified as a swine influenza. All three influenza pandemics of the 20th century had been bird strains.Even more baffling, the virus had an unusual genome, with pieces derived from three different swine influenza lineages, including a Eurasian lineage not previously observed in the Americas. As the new virus spread around the globe, sickening millions and killing some 200,000 young, otherwise healthy people, Obama’s advisors had no answers for how the unusual virus had evolved and where or when it jumped from animals to people. After diagnostic testing rolled out globally, it appeared that the epicenter of the pandemic had been in central Mexico. Rumors began to circulate that the virus, which was spreading rapidly among humans through contact and aerosols, was engineered by human hands. The CDC scoffed, but the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it was seriously investigating a memo sent to the organization by Australian biologist Adrian Gibbs, who laid out his evidence for why the virus was not of a natural origin but rather had leaked from a laboratory performing genetic experiments for vaccine production. Gibbs was considered a credible scientist who had participated in the development of the Roche anti-influenza drug Tamiflu. Scientists and public health officials shuddered. A lab-error pandemic virus was the last thing the world needed. Years of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases had already been undone by British doctor Andrew Wakefield’s falsified autism-MMR link, which would not be retracted for another year, fully 12 years after its publication. Scientists cannot create data out of thin air every time there is an outbreak.Soon, though, two seminal studies soundly refuted the lab-leak theory and revealed how the virus arose naturally in pigs. The detailed evolutionary history spanning several decades was more than we had learned about the animal sources of most other zoonotic outbreaks. Many considered the book on the pandemic’s origins was effectively closed. Still, some bits of the story didn’t add up—notably the prevailing notion that the virus came from pigs in Asia. I had recently joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study influenza in humans, but the pig story piqued my interest. So I switched to researching pigs. Dropping human research to study swine might seem like an ill-advised career move, but I had an unusual amount of freedom at the NIH. I wasn’t living grant-to-grant like most epidemiologists, so I could follow obscure hunches. It ultimately took our international teams seven years to track the pandemic’s origins to an unstudied corner of pig farming. Along the way, I learned that raising a pig—and a pandemic—is more complicated than I imagined. Still, tracing the origin of a pandemic, even long after the fact, can be done using genetic data, and the full understanding of how a disease emerged is worth the years of sleuthing.Quashing the “lab leak” rumorsWhile in retrospect it’s easy to be glib about the idea that the 2009 virus leaked from a laboratory somewhere, Gibbs pointed out some features of the virus that were important to explain. He doubted the virus came from nature because no genetically similar influenza viruses were known to circulate in pigs anywhere in the world. As a result, the virus sat on a “long branch” of the influenza phylogenetic tree, separated by many mutational differences from other swine flu viruses. Also, the virus’s proteins had an abundance of lysine residues. He and his colleagues noted that standard vaccine production practices of growing influenza viruses in chicken eggs—a method still used by the majority of flu vaccine developers—can lead to an increase in lysine residues, so Gibbs concluded that the newly emerged swine flu had been propagated in a laboratory, likely as a part of vaccine-related research. This idea did not hold up long against scientific scrutiny. All five of the WHO’s collaborating influenza centers evaluated Gibbs’ claims, and all arrived at the same conclusion: there was no reason to believe the virus was unnatural. Human, avian, and swine flu viruses naturally differ somewhat in lysine composition, and the amount of lysine seen in the strain responsible for the 2009 outbreak was consistent with natural increases seen in swine flu viruses historically. The genetic distance, too, proved unremarkable. MIXING PIGS: Pigs housed in close proximity at large commercial farms give viruses the chance to intermingle, resulting in the emergence of new strains.© istock.com, dusanpetkovicScientists had a wealth of genetic data from swine influenza viruses to compare against, as veterinarians have routinely performed diagnostic testing, sometimes sequencing entire viral genomes, to combat flu and monitor viral trends. The NIH’s public repository GenBank contained more than 500 genetic sequences from swine influenza viruses collected in the US, Canada, and multiple countries in Europe and Asia at the time of the 2009 outbreak. And that data revealed many swine flu viruses are somewhat isolated on the phylogenetic tree—the result of insufficient sampling from certain time periods or locations. Research teams from the US CDC and the University of Hong Kong used these genetic data to catalog the natural evolutionary origins of the virus in fine detail in studies published in Science and Nature, respectively. Both studies showed that the pandemic virus’s genome belonged to the H1N1 subtype, which is found in swine globally, and concluded that the virus arose through natural processes. But an unresolved question was where. The exact origins of the 2009 virus were difficult to pin down because flu virus genomes are composed of eight individual segments that can be swapped in their entirety during replication when two “parent” viruses co-infect a single host cell. This creates genetically new offspring in a process known as reassortment. And the 2009 virus epitomized why swine are called “mixing vessels” for avian and human strains: the eight segments of the pandemic virus’s genome had notably different evolutionary histories connected to three geographically distinct swine flu lineages, some of which were introduced into pigs from birds and others from humans. Two genome segments came from a Eurasian swine H1N1 lineage that jumped from birds to pigs in the 1970s and remains prevalent in pigs in Europe and Asia today. One genome segment was derived from a classical swine H1N1 lineage that first emerged in US pigs during the 1918 flu pandemic and continues to circulate in the US and Canada, with occasional incursions into Asia. The remaining five segments were derived from the “triple-reassortant” lineage that emerged in US pigs in the 1990s and was itself a mix of avian, human, and classical swine influenza A viruses. Triple reassortant viruses are established in the US and Canada, but also have been introduced into Asia.In their Nature paper, the Hong Kong group provided data compatible with an Asian origin. They had found new swine flu viruses in abattoirs in Hong Kong that resembled the 2009 H1N1 pandemic more closely than any other swine virus known globally—viruses whose genomes were mixes of segments from the same three swine flu lineages as the pandemic virus. Although none contained the exact same segments as the newly emerged pathogen, the authors noted that all three major genetic components of the virus were found in swine in Hong Kong, which routinely receives pigs from mainland China. So, it seemed reasonable that with additional sequencing in Asian swine, a perfect segment-by-segment match would eventually show up. After all, China hosts half the world’s swine population and only a tiny slice had been sampled for flu. Plus, the genetic sequences of the flu viruses from Hong Kong’s pigs were more closely related to the pandemic virus in terms of mutational distance than viruses sampled from pigs elsewhere. The paper included strong caveats, especially with regard to sampling, but an Asian-origins scenario was easy to accept because it fit with Asia’s historical role as the source of H5N1 “bird flu,” SARS, and two previous influenza pandemics (in 1957 and in 1968), and matched where scientists presumed the next pandemic would arise.Still, there were lingering gaps in the story that bugged experts in the field, myself and the Nature study authors included. Where the new virus overlapped with Asian sequences, there were mutational differences that suggested many years of unobserved evolution. What was the virus up to during that time? Plus, from a clinical perspective, the first major outbreak in humans occurred in North America. Weeks before the flu was first identified in California, clusters of an unusual pneumonia appeared in Mexico. The viral sequences obtained from patients in Mexico were genetically diverse, suggesting the virus had already been circulating there for many weeks, possibly months. No scientist could explain how a virus that appeared to arise in Asian swine could trigger an outbreak in humans in Mexico without setting off similar transmission chains in Asia. And no one had found an animal with the exact same virus strain. That is to say, there was no “smoking pig.”A History of Viral ReassortmentThe genome of the H1N1 virus that jumped to humans in 2009 included two segments from a Eurasian lineage, one segment from a classical lineage, and five segments from the “triple-reassortant” lineage, itself the product of viral intermixing.© istock.com, bgblue; © istock.com, ankomando; © istock.com, Julie_fdt; © istock.com, Irina_StrelnikovaSee full infographic: WEB | PDFThe hunt for the smoking pigInterest in the pandemic waned after cases fell during 2010. But the question of the virus’s origins remained a topic of discussion among a small group of pathogen hunters and evolutionary biologists who met informally in Leuven, Belgium, a small Flemish city renowned for its beer, chocolate, and one of Europe’s leading universities. In a building marked for demolition, we sketched out on a whiteboard possible scenarios for the pandemic’s origins, each of which seemed far-fetched. Could “patient zero” be a Chinese hog farmer who flew to Mexico? Exactly how many people from China’s swine-farming regions fly to Mexico each day? Or did an infected Asian pig make its way to Mexico some time before the pandemic? Do pigs ever fly from China to Mexico? No one knew. One silver lining of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was an increase in funding for research and surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs on a global scale, allowing myself and other scientists to dig deeper into the many unknowns about influenza in pigs. During the pandemic, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established routine surveillance and genomic sequencing of flu viruses collected in US herds. The UK Animal and Plant Health Agency established a research consortium to characterize virus diversity in European swine herds. Numerous research groups published their countries’ first surveillance reports for influenza in swine, even in Brazil and Australia where the herds were considered influenza-free. It turned out that anywhere there were pigs, there was flu. Swine veterinarians in many countries suddenly became interested in teaming up with me and my collaborators to figure out the genetic makeup of these newly discovered viruses and to develop customized vaccines.Impugning a single country or animal species oversimplifies a geographically and ecologically intermixing world.Some of the flu viruses identified by these efforts were genetically similar to the Eurasian viruses found in Europe or the triple-reassortant and classical virus lineages circulating in the US, indicating that the viruses had traveled from centers of swine production in Europe and the US to other countries that regularly imported their live swine. Transporting live pigs across oceans is expensive and cumbersome, but many countries were rapidly modernizing their swine production towards the end of the 20th century and needed sows bred to produce larger litters of piglets, which were only available from the US, Canada, and Europe. Imported swine had to be documented to be free of certain pathogens such as African swine fever, but most pigs were not tested for influenza or quarantined. Because influenza frequently infects pigs asymptomatically, it makes an excellent stowaway. How had influenza viruses reached geographically isolated areas such as Western Australia, with its stringent quarantine requirements for imported animals? We were learning that the story of the 2009 pandemic had a twist. Yes, one H1N1 influenza virus had managed to jump from a pig to a human to spark the 2009 pandemic. But humans also transmit influenza viruses to swine in what’s known as reverse zoonosis. All that surveillance of flu viruses revealed that, following the pandemic, humans transmitted the virus back to swine all over the world en masse, including in Australia. Humans may refer to the 2009 pandemic as “swine flu,” but from the pigs’ perspective, humans are the disease vectors. At first, the introduction of human viruses into swine herds created a disease problem largely restricted to pigs. But in each country, the human-sourced pandemic viruses quickly reassorted with other endemic swine viruses to create novel strains, some of which began to infect people. For example, during the summer of 2012, more than 300 American children, primarily in Ohio and Indiana, were infected by viruses from their show pigs, and my colleagues and I found that the viruses involved in that outbreak contained a piece of genetic material introduced into US herds by humans during the pandemic. This later round of zoonotic infections never established human-to-human transmission, so the strains never went global. But the scare was a wake-up call that new infectious diseases can arise at any time from unexpected sources—even from America’s wholesome state fairs—and that the risk of another influenza pandemic arising from pigs had only increased since 2009. Still, the origins of the 2009 pandemic remained mysterious—and, frankly, a bit confusing. My collaborators sequencing flu viruses from Latin American pig herds turned up plenty of new viruses of human origin, but none contained genetic material from the Eurasian lineage that had donated two crucial segments to the pandemic virus. The more countries in the Americas that failed to unearth a match to the pandemic virus, or even a shred of evidence that Eurasian viruses had made it there, the more doubtful I became that the pandemic could have originated in the West. Had it come from Asia after all? The Investigation into H1N1’s OriginsIt was a long journey to figure out what led to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, but eventually the work not only solved the pandemic’s origins, but also yielded results that should serve as a warning sign: we do not have the surveillance infrastructure in place to track fast-moving and intermixing pathogens inadvertently shipped around the world as livestock operations grow to support an expanding human population. Here are some of the major stops on our journey to tell the pandemic’s origin story.© istock.com, Samuil_Levich; © istock.com, bgblue; © istock.com, ankomandoSee full infographic: WEB | PDFPigs can flyEven though I found no support for my hypothesis about the pandemic’s swine origins being in the West, six years of digging had not been wasted. By 2015, labor-intensive viral collection, diagnostic testing, lab prep, genetic sequencing, and genetic analyses had revealed how the world’s billion swine move within and between countries, spreading flu viruses efficiently.We also discovered that most routes are not round-trip. Every pig that legally crosses international borders is reported to the United Nations Comtrade database, yielding data on the numbers of live swine traded between various countries each year. So I collaborated with NIH epidemiologist Cécile Viboud to build simulations from trade data to predict whether a virus residing in one country’s swine population is likely to spread to neighboring countries, or overseas. This simulation, published in 2015 in Nature Communications, predicted that countries such the US that export many pigs act as “sources” for swine influenza around the world. Other countries, including China and Mexico, act as “sinks”—destinations that receive many pigs but where few pigs travel out. In sink areas, imported viruses can take root and evolve into new forms that go undetected without targeted surveillance. In other words, from the perspective of swine influenza, Mexico is like Vegas: what happens there stays there—at least, until it jumps to another species.Ultimately, this means swine viruses in the US, Canada, and major exporting countries in Europe readily disperse along international trade routes, creating hubs of viral diversity across Asia and in countries such as Mexico. China was not the only country where the classical, Eurasian, and triple-reassortant lineages likely circulated and combined to create new viruses. And, because some of these countries, including Mexico, export few live animals, they could host new viruses for decades that never spread elsewhere. This could create niches for the hidden evolution of viral lineages—which, in theory, could explain the 2009 virus’s novelty and why it was so hard to pinpoint its origin. And yet, while sampling Mexico’s swine herds in the years following the pandemic did uncover new Mexico-specific viruses, the lineages we found traced back to humans, not Eurasian swine. We saw the same pattern in other Latin American countries. There was no trace of the Eurasian lineage anywhere in the West, likely because there is not much trade in that direction. All evidence pointed toward an Asian origin, I conceded. And that seemed unlikely to change, as research on the 2009 swine flu was slowing as attention turned to more pressing disease threats, including Ebola in West Africa and Zika in the Americas. Funding for flu surveillance in pigs was drying up.Imported and ReassortedIn early 2009, a virus with an unusual genome popped up in people in central Mexico. It had pieces derived from three different swine influenza lineages, including a Eurasian lineage not previously observed in the Americas.© istock.com, Samuil_Levich; © istock.com, bgblue; © istock.com, ankomandoBeginning in the 1990s, millions of US pigs were trucked into Mexico, some of which carried classical H1N1 and triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses that then spread across the country’s northern, central, and eastern regions. Around the same time, at least once and possibly twice, Eurasian swine viruses were imported from Europe to central Mexico. There, American- and European-origin viruses exchanged genetic material to create the pathogen that jumped to humans in early 2009.See full infographic: WEB | PDFThe smoking pigStill, our work on swine influenza continued. The disease remained an issue for US swine farmers, and my collaborator Amy Vincent at the USDA maintained a vibrant surveillance program. So we organized a workshop at her lab in Ames, Iowa, to teach scientists how to analyze genetic data from swine influenza viruses circulating in different countries. One workshop participant was Ignacio “Nacho” Mena, a virologist who was part of the NIH-funded Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS) that Vincent and I also participated in. For the workshop, he brought the genomes of 57 influenza viruses collected from swine by his local veterinarian partners all over Mexico between 2013 and 2015. These genomes were hot off the sequencer, so they hadn’t yet been fully examined. Astoundingly, one of Mena’s Mexican viruses had a gene segment that was related to Eurasian viruses from swine in Europe, seemingly the first documentation of the Eurasian swine H1N1 lineage in the Western hemisphere. The Eurasian segment didn’t match those in the 2009 pandemic virus, but the detection of any genetic pieces of the Eurasian lineage in Mexico meant it was possible that the 2009 pandemic had emerged in North America. When we looked more closely, Mena’s data turned out to contain 18 smoking pig viruses that matched the 2009 viral lineage segment for segment. Moreover, the 18 viruses were collected from swine in central Mexico, the same region where the earliest clinical signs of a pandemic outbreak had been detected in humans in early 2009. And lastly, phylogenetic analyses placed the Mexico viruses in a clade on the tree that more closely adjoined the clade of human pandemic viruses than any other swine viruses. The pattern was exactly what we would expect if the 2009 H1N1 pandemic originated in pigs in Mexico. Only one mystery remained: How did Eurasian viruses with a geographical range limited to Europe and Asia wind up in Mexico? US swine veterinarians remained convinced that Eurasian viruses had never reached America’s well-sampled herds. Fortunately, thanks to time-stamped sequences, background data from swine in Europe, Asia, and North America, and a decade of advances in phylogenetic tree-building methods, we were able to reconstruct a detailed history of influenza virus evolution in Mexico dating back to the 1990s. Our findings, published in eLife in 2016, confirmed Mexico’s role as a pig trade sink, and therefore a melting pot for influenza A viruses imported from Europe and the US.According to the analysis, millions of US pigs were trucked into Mexico along with their classical and triple-reassortant viruses, which over time spread across the country’s northern, central, and eastern regions. Around the same time, Eurasian swine viruses were independently brought into Mexico directly from Europe on at least one, and possibly two, occasions, presumably by an infected sow in a plane’s cargo. The Eurasian viruses had circulated for more than a decade in Mexico undetected, but only in the central region surrounding Mexico City, where the country’s major swine-producing states of Jalisco and Guanajuato are located. Here, American- and European-origin viruses exchanged genetic material through reassortment to create an entirely new pathogen with a hitherto unseen combination of segments that helped the virus jump to humans.Playing the long gameIt took me and my colleagues seven years to piece together how the 2009 H1N1 pandemic happened. What drove us to persist, and continue tracing that virus’s origins even as the rest of the world moved on? For one, we needed to set the record straight. Although Adrian Gibbs had been wrong about the pandemic coming from a lab, he had laid out questions the scientific community still needed to answer, including why the virus was positioned on a long branch of the phylogenetic tree and where the virus had been hiding out all those years. It was also worth emphasizing that uncovering the complete evolutionary history of the 2009 pandemic did not pin blame on a single country. Although Mexico was the proximal source of the 2009 pandemic, all the viral components were imported from pigs in the US and Europe. The deeper we dove into the complexity of pathogen emergence in a globalized world, the harder it became to point fingers. There is also the lingering idea that birds are the only important source of flu; they’re not. Novel flu lineages have been detected in all sorts of animals, most recently in dogs, bats, and cattle. Even we humans play a role; people transmit hundreds of influenza viruses to pigs for each virus that successfully jumps from pigs to humans. If there’s another pandemic swine flu in the future, it will be because humans repeatedly restock pigs’ viral gene pool with new genetic diversity that combines with other pig viruses. Really, it shouldn’t have come as such a surprise that the first global pandemic of the 21st century came from pigs. For most of the 20th century, influenza was not a problem for pig farmers. But as agricultural production of pigs expanded and modernized at a blistering pace, with backyard farms being displaced by large commercial operations all over the world, the opportunity for viral intermixing grew exponentially and cases of flu in swine began to climb.Drug companies have tried to manufacture vaccines for swine flu, but they struggle to keep pace with a moving target. Influenza simply evolves too fast and has too many different strains. As the NIH and other funders invest in improving influenza vaccines for humans that broadly protect against diverse strains, it is worth testing out new candidates in pigs, where the problem of matching vaccine and field strains is even more dire. The risk of another pandemic coming from pigs only grows each year.Of course, the next globe-trotting influenza virus won’t necessarily come from swine. It’s impossible to predict the origin of the next pandemic flu, as scientists struggle to keep up with the effects of globalization, climate change, and economic development in an unpredictable and ever-changing landscape for disease emergence. Impugning a single country or animal species oversimplifies a geographically and ecologically intermixing world. As we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, to prevent future pandemics, there is an urgent need for scientists from different countries to work together and share data on emerging pathogens.There is value in being able to explain the animal origins of a new disease right at a pandemic’s onset, not seven years later, to reduce fear and avert misdirected mitigation efforts, for example culling of pigs in 2009. But scientists cannot create data out of thin air every time there is an outbreak. Tracking the global diversity and movement of animal diseases in real time requires ongoing investment and infrastructure. Some countries like Australia already do rigorous testing and quarantine, but most do not. Currently, there is no requirement for animals being shipped around the world to be tested for flu. We hope our small success emboldens efforts to uncover the zoonotic origins of other novel viruses, even if it takes years of digging. Tracing the earliest chains of human infections becomes near impossible for a respiratory virus like flu or SARS-CoV-2 that causes so many asymptomatic infections and transmits so rapidly. Fortunately, remarkable advances in genomic sequencing and phylogenetic reconstruction can extract hidden signals from animal data going back decades, and the origins of a virus can be uncovered many years after a pandemic event by continuing to follow the genetic traces of its descendants still circulating in animals. Eventually, such work forms a full picture of a disease system spanning humans, wildlife, and domestic animals over time and space, unearthing the root causes of pandemics, including animal trade. The potential of DNA to sleuth unsolved mysteries is only beginning to be tapped. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story without infographics was published online in September 2020.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Overview A research team consisting of Daigo Natsuhara, a first year Ph.D. student and Professor Takayuki Shibata etc. at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology, and Professor Hirotaka Kanuka, etc. of the Jikei University School of Medicine has developed a microfluidic chip which is capable of simultaneous diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza diseases, by applying the microfluidic chip technologies. The team has built a theoretical model that manipulates microfluidic flow with an extremely simple microchannel design and has established an optimal design theory for microfluidic chips. Further, by using the diagnostic device they developed, they performed genetic amplification experiments on four types of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and demonstrated that multiplexed rapid and simultaneous diagnosis was possible within 30 minutes. The device can be utilized for genetic diagnoses in a range of fields (e.g. agriculture, farming, and fisheries industries, food industry, and health and medical care), not only human infectious diseases. Details As shown during the global COVID-19 pandemic, viral diseases cause immense public concern and have a massive impact on economic activity. In this research, as a technology supporting our safe and secure life, the team developed a diagnostic technology that enables anyone, anywhere, any time to detect viral diseases in a rapid, simple, and low-cost way. The LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) method*1 is a genetic test technology. This simple test method does not require an expensive accurate temperature control equipment, etc., in contrast to the widespread PCR test, and can be conducted on site because it allows genetic amplification at a constant temperature for a constant length of time (60 to 65℃, 30 minutes to an hour or so). However, to diagnose multiple types of viruses, the conventional LAMP method entails considerable effort to perform as many preparations of samples and reagents and genetic amplification reactions as the number of analytes, requiring expert knowledge and skills. Therefore, the research team of Toyohashi University of Technology and the Jikei University School of Medicine developed a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based multiplexed genetic diagnostic device (size: 45mm x 25mm, reaction chamber: 3µL x 5 pieces) (refer to the photo in the figure) by applying the microfluidic chip technology. It autonomously, equally, and accurately dispenses samples and reagent into an array of reaction chambers simply by introducing the liquid, a mixture of an extremely small amount of sample extracted from the analytes and a reagent, into the diagnostic device. By heating the device in warm water (at 60 to 65℃, for 30 minutes to an hour or so), it is capable of simultaneous diagnosis of multiple types of viruses with only one operation (one work process per sample). The genetic diagnosis result shown in the figure indicates that four types of infectious diseases including the COVID-19 (seasonal influenza A, SARS, and influenza H1N1 pdm09) have been successfully detected with this diagnosis device. Only the reaction chamber that reacted when a sample containing the gene of each virus was introduced turned sky blue (denoting a positive reaction) after 30 minutes, which means that visual detection is possible. In addition, to support on-site diagnoses, the team has developed a smartphone app, which automatically diagnoses the reaction as positive or negative based on photographs taken with a smartphone camera, jointly with OptTech LLC. (Toyohashi, Aichi; founded by a graduate from the university). As shown in the figure, the diagnosis device is capable of easy automatic test result diagnosis (positive or negative), by placing the device after LAMP reaction in a simple LED illumination device and taking photographs with a smartphone. As a result, it is expected that anyone will be able to easily perform the test, anywhere and anytime. *1 The LAMP method is a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method developed by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. (https://www.eiken.co.jp/). Four to six types of primers are set for six to eight areas of a targeted gene to amplify the gene at a constant temperature (60 to 65℃) through strand displacement reaction. Future Outlook In the future, aiming to commercialize the diagnosis device, the research team will develop devices capable of multiplexed rapid diagnosis of variants of the COVID-19 and human infectious diseases for a safe life during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

"This means that there is a new area hit," Nedelec said, stressing that the region was vulnerable to avian influenza outbreaks as it hosts a large number of poultry farms and is under some migrating birds' corridors. Avian influenza is often carried by wild birds in the autumn and winter. It has been spreading quickly in Europe in recent months, putting the industry on alert after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds. So far this season the virus has already killed more than 600,000 poultry in France, Nedelec said. A first farm case in France had been detected on 26 November on a poultry farm in the north, Outbreaks in north were now under control, Nedelec said. However, the virus was still spreading among duck farms in the foie gras production zone of the southwest, where flocks were decimated by outbreaks last winter. "Hopefully it won't be as bad this year, looking at the strict measures we have taken, including keeping all flocks indoors," Nedelec said. In Italy, data from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) show nearly four million birds died in the country because of avian influenza between mid October and 26 December. Avian influenza cannot be transmitted through the eating of poultry products. But outbreaks are raising concern among epidemiologists because it can be transmitted from one human to another.

In Gadish, about 7,400 infected chickens were found in two coops. In Ne’ot Golan, about 14,000 turkeys were found to be infected. The veterinary services are operating in an emergency format and continuing to actively locate outbreaks in northern Israel and isolate the hotspots. Eggs produced in Gadish are being kept out of the market.“This is an infection event of a magnitude we have not experienced here before,” said Agriculture Minister Oded Forer on Sunday.

The minister is operating an inter-ministerial command room to handle the continuing bird flu outbreak in the country. All of the outbreaks in Israel so far have been due to the H5N1 subvariant.Over 8,000 migratory cranes have died due to the virus in a continuing outbreak in the Hula Valley. A number of additional outbreaks have been reported at farms in northern Israel in recent weeks and months.Hundreds of thousands of birds migrate through Israel on their way to Africa during this season, raising the risk of bird flu outbreaks. The Agriculture Ministry has called on all farmers to follow directives and ensure that their birds are kept separate from wild birds. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Since 2006, there have been cases of bird flu detected in Israel almost every year.Amid the spike in bird flu outbreaks, the Health Ministry stressed that the public should only buy poultry and eggs from regulated places and ensure that eggs have a seal of inspection. The public should also make sure to properly, hygienically, and thoroughly cook poultry and eggs and should keep distance from wild birds.A high number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia in recent weeks, mostly due to the H5N1 subtype, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. The OIE has urged countries to increase surveillance for high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, as the virus has been reported in over 40 countries since July.The H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8 subtypes of HPAI are circulating in bird and poultry populations across the globe, sparking concern at OIE which called this an “unprecedented genetic variability of subtypes... creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape.”Germany’s Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, told the German Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) that Europe is experiencing its “strongest avian flu epidemic ever.”The institute added that “there is no end in sight” as the virus spreads throughout the continent and around the world, with new cases reported on a daily basis.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags agriculture Oded Forrer bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

The patient was described only as a teenage boy with mild symptoms who tested positive for both flu and COVID. He and his family had just returned from a trip to Cabo San Lucas, and he was the only member experiencing symptoms. He was the only one in his family to test positive for both viruses, but one of his parents has tested positive for COVID. "We were in contact with the mother yesterday, the child is in good spirits, and at home and doing well," said Steve Farzam of 911 COVID Testing. (credit: CBS) The testing site, run by 911 COVID Testing, says they've seen about a 30% positivity rate among the people tested in the past few days, along with a few confirmed cases of the flu. The site began using the dual tests when people who had tested negative for COVID came back because they were still experiencing symptoms. "This one swab will give us traces of Influenza A, Influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2," he said. CBSLA's Joy Benedict spoke to Dr. Otto Yang, an infectious disease expert for UCLA Health, on Wednesday who said he has seen several cases of people with both influenza and coronavirus in the hospital currently. "If it's a bad virus season and a lot of virus is circulating, it's not unusual to be exposed to more than one because they all travel the same," Dr. Yang said. Testing positive for both influenza and coronavirus, a condition now being called flurona, was reported this weekend in Israel. That patient was reportedly an unvaccinated pregnant woman with mild symptoms. Other cases of flurona have apparently surfaced in Florida and Texas, and they all seem to be among minors -- children and teenagers. Because COVID and the flu are caught the same way, most hospitals test patients for more than just COVID-19. "At UCLA here, it's a standard to both together anyway because the two look so similar and the two are traveling the same way, so it's just assumed that if you're testing for one, you should test for the other as well," Dr. Yang said. Flu and COVID-19 symptoms, particularly the Omicron variant, overlap in many ways – respiratory difficulties, weakness, sniffles, according to Farzam. The detection of flurona should not be cause for alarm, he said, but another reminder to take precautions such as wearing a mask, washing hands, and staying home when feeling sick. Dr. Yang also said that if a person is not severely ill, it's probably best to not try and go get tested, and added that those who are vaccinated are likely to have symptoms that are manageable at home, regardless of which virus you might have. "Right now, the emergency rooms are clogged up. There's a shortage of tests, and so if you're risk factors are low for severe disease, it's better to just stay home and recuperate," said Dr. Yang. Those who are working in a health care setting, nurses or doctors, as well as those who might work in the school system, it is important to test, in order to let others know whether you're positive or not.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 6 January 2022 Bird-to-human transmission of avian flu is very rare and has previously only occurred a small number of times in the UK. The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time. All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low. However, people should not touch sick or dead birds. Avian flu, also known as bird flu, is a type of influenza that spreads among birds. The UK has recently seen a large number of outbreaks and incidents of avian influenza in birds across the country of the H5N1 strain and Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and the UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer have issued alerts to bird owners. Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare. It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low. Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is very rare. The case was detected after APHA identified an outbreak of outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian flu in their flock of birds. Their infection was identified through the routine monitoring which is conducted on anyone who has close contact with infected birds. The infected birds have all been culled. In line with the highly precautionary approach that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) takes to identifying and stopping the transmission of avian flu, UKHSA swabbed this person and detected low levels of flu. Further laboratory analysis revealed that the virus was the ‘H5’ type, found in birds. At this point it has not been possible to confirm that this is a H5N1 infection (the strain that is currently circulating in birds in the UK). Based on the available evidence, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified. This is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally. Professor Isabel Oliver, Chief Scientific Officer at UKHSA, said: While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that’s why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action. Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We have followed up all of this individual’s contacts and have not identified any onward spread. It remains critical that people do not touch sick or dead birds, and that they follow the DEFRA advice about reporting. The UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: While avian influenza is highly contagious in birds, this is a very rare event and is very specific to the circumstances on this premises. We took swift action to limit the spread of the disease at the site in question, all infected birds have been humanely culled, and cleansing and disinfection of the premises is underway. This is a reminder that stringent cleanliness when keeping animals is important. We are seeing a growing number of cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country. Implementing scrupulous biosecurity measures will help keep your birds safe. UKHSA follows up all individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed case of avian influenza. For those with the highest risk exposures, we contact them daily to see if they have developed symptoms so that we can take appropriate action. People are also offered anti-viral treatment after exposure to infected birds. This is to stop the virus reproducing in their body if they have picked it up and should prevent them from becoming unwell. It also helps reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. We also swab people even if they don’t have symptoms, to help our surveillance programmes and make sure we identify anyone infected so that we can take action to control any risk of transmission.

How IL-7 shapes CD8 T cell responses during an acute viral infection is less understood. We had previously shown that IL-7 signaling deficient mice have reduced accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells following influenza infection. We sought to determine whether IL-7 affects early CD8 T cell expansion in the mediastinal lymph node and effector function in the lungs. Using IL-7Rα signaling deficient mice, we show that IL-7 is required for a normal sized mediastinal lymph node and the early clonal expansion of influenza-specific CD8 T cells therein. We show that IL-7 plays a cell-intrinsic role in the accumulation of NP366–374 and PA224–233-specific CD8 T cells in the lymph node. We also found that IL-7 shapes terminal differentiation, degranulation and cytokine production to a greater extent in PA224–233-specific than NP366–374-specific CD8 T cells. We further demonstrate that IL-7 is induced in the lung tissue by viral infection and we characterize multiple cellular sources that contribute to IL-7 production. Our findings on IL-7 and its effects on lower respiratory diseases will be important for expanding the utility of therapeutics that are currently available.

It causes seasonal and pandemic outbreaks with major global health and economic impacts. Seasonal variants of influenza can cause death in children, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals1. Vaccination is a cornerstone of the preventative measures taken towards influenza as it arms the adaptive immune system. Multiple cell types in the immune system are required during a response to influenza infection. However, we lack a complete understanding of the cellular aspects and intercellular signaling components that lead to efficient generation of functionally competent immune cells. At the center of immune responses are the cytokine signals that shape various aspects of immune cells2.A hallmark of our immune response is its ability to develop memory to previously encountered pathogens—T cells are major players in this process. An ideal anti-viral response to influenza and other viruses, requires cytotoxic CD8 T cells for their swift and specific response. CD8 T cells employ multiple methods to kill infected cells and control viral replication, namely, granule-dependent (granzyme B and perforin) and ligand-dependent (Fas-FasL) means3.In addition to TCR-MHC engagement (signal 1) and co-stimulation (signal 2), cytokine cues (signal 3) have great influence in activating and shaping CD8 T cell responses and their terminal differentiation. Once a CD8 T cell receives these signals, it is driven towards a robust clonal expansion phase whereby a single cell expands to ~ 105 cells4. The signal 3 cytokines that govern T cells are multifaceted and include interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15 and others which dictate their terminal differentiation and inflammatory functions5,6.The common gamma chain (γc) cytokine IL-7 is produced mainly by stromal cells in the bone marrow and thymus. At steady state, it plays an indispensable role in the development of both pre- and pro- B cells and T cells in mice7,8,9,10. IL-7 is important in the development and survival of T cells at specific stages of maturation in the thymus as the expression of IL-7Rα (CD127) is dynamically regulated8,11,12,13. IL-7 shares the IL-7Rα with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an alarmin cytokine that plays a major role in mucosal sites. In addition to its role in development, IL-7 also plays a canonical role in maintenance of memory T cells14. The span of IL-7’s function was further expanded in the past decade when it was shown to be able to shape the effector responses of cytotoxic CD8 T cells by enhancing their responses against tumors15 and bacterial infection14, and reverse T cell exhaustion caused by chronic LCMV infection, thus, preventing liver pathology16. However, the extent to which IL-7 regulates CD8 T cell response to acute viral infections is unknown. We had previously shown that IL-7 but not TSLP is important for the accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs but the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear17. Since IL-7 is implicated in over 8 clinical trials for treatment of infections, solid tumors and other chronic conditions, the intricacies of IL-7 signaling in functional outcomes requires further inquiry18.In this study, we asked: what modulatory effects does IL-7 have on CD8 T cell priming and effector functions during an acute airway influenza infection? We used IL-7Rα knock-in mice (IL-7Rα449F), a hypomorphic model with targeted disruption of a signaling motif that permits development of naïve lymphocytes amenable in infection tests14. We show that in the lung draining mediastinal LNs (mdLNs), IL-7 is important for early priming and accumulation of CD8 T cells specific for influenza NP366–374 and PA224–233 presented on H2Db in a cell intrinsic manner. We also show that IL-7 is important for the terminal differentiation and cytokine production in CD8 T cells. This study will aid in therapeutic development and vaccine adjuvant studies to design combinatorial therapeutic strategies.ResultsIL-7Rα signaling is required for accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cellsTo assess the importance of IL-7 signaling in CD8 T cells following infection with influenza, we used mice expressing a mutated IL-7Rα whereby a cytoplasmic tyrosine important for signal transduction is substituted to a phenylalanine at residue 449 (IL-7Rα449F). We compared WT and IL-7Rα449F mice following infection with A/PR/8/34 (PR8) influenza virus and measured influenza-specific CD8 T cells by flow cytometry using MHC-I tetramers (Suppl. Fig. 1a). We found that IL-7Rα449F mice have reduced proportions of NP366–374 and PA224–233-specific cells within CD8 T cells in the lungs 7 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 1a), which phenocopies past observation of this defect at 9 dpi in a new, embryo re-derivation based, specific pathogen free facility17. Since the majority of influenza-specific T cells originate from tissue draining lymph nodes, we examined the mediastinal lymph nodes (mdLNs) of infected mice and found that IL-7Rα449F mice have reduced lymph node sizes, particularly the mdLN, compared to WT mice. Interestingly, unlike WT mice, there was little increase in mdLN size of IL-7Rα449F mice after influenza infection (Fig. 1b). Additionally, enumeration of the total influenza-specific cells in the mdLN at multiple days post infection revealed a consistent and substantial defect that is not due to a delay in expansion kinetics. (Fig. 1c). Consistent with lack of LN hyperplasia, the proportion of influenza-specific cells in IL-7Rα449F mdLN at 5 dpi was reduced indicating a defect in early priming of CD8 T cells (Fig. 1d).Figure 1Accumulation of tetramer specific response in IL-7Rα449F is impaired following influenza infection.

This likely contributed to the reduced lymph node sizes noted above. Therefore, it is possible that the reduction in influenza-specific CD8 T cell accumulation was due to factors extrinsic to T cells in the lymph node and that IL-7 was indirectly important for shaping the cellular and cytokine environment for optimal T cell activation. To address this, we created bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice whereby we grafted BM cells of wild type (WT) and IL-7Rα449F mice into lethally irradiated RAG-1-deficient hosts (Fig. 2a). Since WT lymphocytes outcompete IL-7Rα449F lymphocytes during development13, we delivered a 1 to 10 ratio of WT to IL-7Rα449F cells respectively. Following engraftment and infection of the hosts, we noted a reversal of this ratio within the CD8 T cell compartment in the mdLN (Fig. 2b). More importantly, IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells resulted in reduced NP366–374 and PA224–233—specific cells in proportion despite engraftment in a competent niche (Fig. 2b). These data suggest that IL-7Rα signaling plays an intrinsic role necessary for CD8 T cell expansion during influenza infection.Figure 2Impairment in tetramer specific response seen in the mdLN of IL-7Rα449F mice is cell intrinsic.

We infected these mice with a modified version of the influenza PR8 virus that has the OVA (SIINFEKL) peptide inserted into the stalk of the NA polypeptide (influenza PR8-OVA). Despite delivering equal number (1 × 106) of OT-I and OT-I;IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells into distinct BoyJ (CD45.1) hosts, OT-I;IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells did not expand to the same extent as wild type OT-I CD8 T cells 4 dpi (Fig. 3a) in the mdLN. This defect was observed as early as 3 dpi (Suppl. Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the expression of the early activation marker CD5 at 4 dpi was significantly reduced in OT-I;IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells indicating a defect in priming (Fig. 3b,c). Furthermore, TCR expression on OT-I;IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells showed a trend towards higher expression at 4 dpi albeit not significantly, further suggesting a possible defect in early priming (Fig. 3b,c).Figure 3Expansion of adoptively transferred OTI-IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells is impaired in the mdLN following influenza infection.

Antigen presenting cells, specifically dendritic cells (DCs) are key to activation of CD8 T cells and their subsequent response. Previous reports have demonstrated that IL-7Rα signaling plays an indirect role in the development of conventional DCs21. Furthermore, IL-7 has been shown to regulate CD4 T cell proliferation in conditions of lymphopenia indirectly though DCs22. We found that in the lungs of IL-7Rα449F mice, CD11b+ CD103− DCs but not CD11b− CD103+ DCs, accumulate up to 9 dpi, while in WT mice these DCs peak at 7 dpi and decrease in numbers at 9 dpi (Suppl. Figs. 1c and 2a). This increased accumulation could be due to cell-extrinsic factors such as increased viral load in the IL-7Rα449F mice as a result of lack of appropriate T cell response. Another plausible reason could be due to impaired lymph node homing signals from chemokines as a result of reduced draining lymph node size. Alternatively, IL-7 may have a direct effect on CD11b+ CD103− DC maturation or migration. To test these hypotheses, we created 50:50 BM chimeras using WT:IL-7Rα449F or WT:WT BM cells (CD45.1:CD45.2) grafted into congenic BoyJ/WT hosts (CD45.1/.2). We found that after infection, WT:IL-7Rα449F ratios of DC subsets were comparable to WT:WT ratios in both the mdLN and lungs for both DC subsets (Suppl. Fig. 2b,c). This suggests that the phenotypic elevation of DCs in IL-7Rα449F mice during influenza infection has a cell extrinsic cause.IL-7 is inducible in lung tissues in response to influenzaIL-7 is mainly produced by radio-resistant cells such as stromal and epithelial cells of the bone marrow and thymus, where it plays a major role in hematopoiesis and thymopoiesis10,23. A few studies have demonstrated IL-7 expression in various tissues including liver, skin, intestines and lungs24,25,26,27,28. While IL-7 is mainly produced in steady state lungs by lymphatic endothelial cells, its source during inflammation is unclear29,30. To assess IL-7 expression dynamics in response to influenza, we first infected human type II epithelial cells (A549) with influenza and assessed Il7 mRNA using qRT-PCR. We found that IL-7 expression is induced within 24 h following influenza infection correlating with the antiviral response signified by IFN-β and viral replication demonstrated by M1 mRNA transcript expression (Fig. 4a).Figure 4IL-7 expression in lung tissues. (a) Quantitative PCR of IL-7, IFN-β and M1 in A549 cells at the indicated times post infection normalized against beta actin. M1 expression is further normalized to time point 0 h. Data is representative of 2 experiments n = 3 per experiment. (b) Expression of IL-7 in various CD45− lung cells using IL-7eGFP/WT mice. Epithelial cells (ECs) are CD45− EpCAM+, stromal cells (SCs) are CD45− EpCAM− CD31− and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are CD45− EpCAM− and CD31+ GP38+. Data are representative of two experiments with n = 4 per genotype. *P < 0.05 as determined by two‐tailed Student's t‐test.Full size imageTo determine if IL-7 is induced in vivo, we used the IL-7eGFP/WT mice. We noted an increase in the number of cells expressing eGFP at 6 dpi (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, the majority of IL-7-eGFP+ cells during infection are epithelial cells. The number of IL-7-eGFP+ stromal cells also significantly increased during infection. However, IL-7-eGFP+ lymphatic endothelial cells were reduced following infection (Fig. 4b). Altogether, these in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that lung epithelial cells are responsive to viral infection, and that during influenza infection, they become the primary source of IL-7.IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells have reduced terminal differentiationThe cytokine milieu that CD8 T cells are exposed to throughout the course of an immune response governs their terminal differentiation to effector cells and hence, their functional capabilities. Among the heterogeneous population of CD8 T cells that emerge during the expansion phase are the T-bethi and granzyme B producing short-lived effector cells (SLECs) that are identified by their expression of the killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) and low CD127 (IL-7Rα)6,31. Due to extra-physiological expression of the mutated IL-7Rα449F subunit (Suppl. Fig. 3), we limited our use of SLEC markers to KLRG1. Testing the expression of KLRG1 in influenza-specific cells revealed a reduced proportion of KLRG1+ cells in both NP366–374 and PA224–233-specific cells of IL-7Rα449F mice (Fig. 5). However, the difference in KLRG1 expression between WT and IL-7Rα449F mice was greater in PA224–233-specific compared to NP366–374-specific cells (Fig. 5). These data suggest that IL-7Rα signaling plays a role in the terminal differentiation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells.Figure 5CD8 T cells of IL-7Rα449F mice have reduced terminal differentiation.

Data are representative of three experiments with n = 4–6 per genotype. *P < 0.05 as determined by two‐tailed Student's t‐test.Full size imageReduced degranulation and cytokine production by IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cellsSecretion of cytotoxic granules and inflammatory cytokines is a major event in the CD8 T cell effector response. Lysosome associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) or CD107a is a membrane glycoprotein found in the lumen of granzyme B and perforin containing vesicles. Detection of CD107a on the surface of CD8 T cells through flow cytometry after a short stimulation (4 h) with PMA/Ionomycin in the presence of CD107a detecting antibodies provides a direct method for identifying degranulating cells32. Using this method, we noted that CD8 T cells of IL-7Rα449F mice had reduced CD107a expression in antigen experienced cells (CD44+) and in tetramer-stained PA224–233-specific cells indicating decreased degranulation in these populations (Fig. 6a,b). Interestingly, this defect was notable in PA224–233-specific cells but not in NP366–374-specific cells. Furthermore, the proportion of cells expressing CD127 was notably higher in PA224–233-specific cells compared to NP366–374-specific cells in WT mice indicating increased influence of IL-7 on PA224–233-specific cells (Fig. 6c). As mentioned earlier, IL-7Rα449F cells have extra-physiological expression of CD127 (IL-7Rα), however, we found that WT and IL-7Rα449F influenza-specific CD8 T cells experience a similar fold decrease in expression of CD127 compared to naïve CD44− CD8 T cells (Suppl. Fig. 3).Figure 6Reduced degranulation of IL-7Rα449F lung CD8 T cells upon re-stimulation.

NP366–374-specific cells generated low proportion of IFNγ+ TNFα+ cells compared to PA224–233-specific cells regardless of mouse genotype (Fig. 7a). However, WT PA224–233-specific cells generated abundant IFNγ+ TNFα+ cells, which were largely absent within IL-7Rα449F PA224–233-specific cells (Fig. 7b). We used TSLPR-/- mice as controls since IL-7Rα is required for both IL-7 and TSLP signaling. We found that TSLPR-/- CD8 T cells presented with reduced cytokine production as well, however, this effect did not follow the same pattern as with IL-7Rα449F mice (Fig. 7a,b).Figure 7Deregulated cytokine production in IL-7Rα449F and TSLPR-/- lung CD8 T cells.

Gated within Live B220−, CD8+, tetramer+ cells. Data is representative of three independent experiments with n = 3–5 mice per genotype. *P < 0.05 as determined by one-way ANOVA.Full size imageTo determine if IL-7 independently affects cytokine production, we used IL-7eGFP/eGFP mice that have an eGFP gene inserted disruptively into an Il7 exon thus serving as an IL-7 ligand knock-out in homozygotes29. Using this mouse model, we established that IL-7 is required for accumulation of IFNγ+ TNFα+ cells within PA224–233-specific but not NP366–374-specific cells (Fig. 7c,d).IL-7 signaling regulates expression of PD-1 in PA224–233 but not NP366–374-specific CD8 T cellsExpression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 is known to be important to negatively regulate T cell activation and limit inflammation by T cells, however, sustained expression of these molecules can lead to dampening of protective immune responses33. To understand how IL-7 affects PA224–233-specific but not NP366–374-specific T cells, we evaluated the expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. We showed that IL-7Rα449F and IL-7eGFP/eGFP CD8 T cells have higher expression of this molecule (Fig. 8a,b). Specifically, the increase in PD-1 expression in IL-7Rα449F and IL-7eGFP/eGFP CD8 T cells was only evident in PA224–233-specific cells but not NP366–374-specific cells (Fig. 8a,b). In addition, TSLPR-/- CD8 T cells did not present with increased PD-1 expression (Fig. 8a). Together, this suggests that IL-7 plays distinct roles in CD8 T cell function depending on antigen specificity possibly by regulating PD-1 expression.Figure 8Increased PD-1 expression in IL-7 signaling deficient CD8 T cells.

Data is representative of 2–3 independent experiments with n = 3–4 mice per genotype. *P < 0.05 as determined by two‐tailed Student's t‐test.Full size imageDiscussionInitial studies of IL-7 have described its role in B-cell lymphopoiesis and thymopoiesis34,35,36. The bone marrow and thymus are the best defined sources of IL-7 production consistent with such roles in primary lymphopoiesis10. Subsequent studies showed a role for IL-7 in memory cell development and maintenance, in effector response to viral infections and in enhancing T cell functions in chronic conditions14,15,16. CD8 T cell expansion and effector function depends on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the cytokine milieu. Previously, we demonstrated that IL-7 is required for the accumulation of tetramer positive CD4 and CD8 T cells during influenza infection17. The mechanism by which IL-7 accomplishes this and its role in other aspects of T cell response have yet to be elucidated.We addressed these questions by using mice that express a hypomorphic IL-7Rα (IL-7Rα449F) which leads to impaired IL-7 signaling by primarily abrogating STAT5 activation14. This model provides a better alternative to using IL-7Rα-/- mice since IL-7Rα449F mice have defective signaling yet retain sufficient number of T cells to perform infection studies. We have previously used this mouse model to demonstrate an intact CD8 T cell effector response to intracellular Listeria monocytogenes infection14. In the current study, we found that defective IL-7Rα signaling led to reduced accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells in the secondary lymphoid organ (mdLN) at early priming stages (5 dpi) which ultimately led to reduced accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells in the lungs. Examination of IL-7Rα449F mdLN revealed a great reduction in its size. This is consistent with the fact that IL-7 is required for the development of lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells that seed LN anlagens and drive the organogenesis of LNs19. Considering IL-7Rα449F mice had reduced, albeit notable, numbers of influenza-specific CD8 T cells in their lungs, it is unclear where and how these CD8 T cells expand to significant numbers with an abnormal mdLN. It is possible that tertiary lymphoid organs in the lung tissues such as inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) provide a suitable environment for the accumulation of de novo pathogen specific cells without requiring IL-7 or LTi cells37. We have shown that despite such extrinsic factors, IL-7Rα signaling is required cell intrinsically by CD8 T cells for early priming in the mdLN.It is known that a population of CD8 T cells specific to a distinct peptide do not originate from a single naïve precursor but rather from tens to hundreds of precursors38,39,40. IL-7 signaling deficient mice have reduced thymic output of T cells, and this may result in a more stochastic or reduced chance of a T cell encountering a cognate MHC-peptide leading to reduced clonal expansion. In addition to these effects, IL-7 can play a role cell intrinsically by affecting TCR repertoire via VDJ recombination or TCR sensitivity8,41. We addressed this by adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells bearing a transgenic TCR (OT-I) in equal numbers (WT vs. IL-7Rα449F) intravenously into congenic WT mice. Using this approach, we found that OT-I;IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cells expanded in response to infection with influenza PR8-OVA to a lower extent compared to OT-I CD8 T cells within total host CD8 T cells. Our findings show that IL-7 is intrinsically important for the accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells during early priming phase in the mdLN independent of TCR specificity and the number of naïve T cell precursors. We have previously shown that IL-7Rα449F CD8 T cell form influenza-specific cells normally during systemic in vivo infection with L. monocytogenes yet do not proliferate well when exposed to suboptimal TCR stimulation in vitro in contrast to high dose TCR stimulation14. It is possible a low dose, local influenza infection recapitulates the low level TCR stimulation model whereby IL-7 plays an essential role in CD8 T cells under low TCR avidity activation.In addition to the intrinsic role that IL-7 plays in CD8 T cells, we found that IL-7Rα449F mice have continued accumulation of CD11b+ DCs in the lungs while in WT mice, the number of CD11b+ DCs peaks at 7 dpi then subsides. Previous studies using IL-7-/- and IL-7Rα-/- mice showed normal development of DC precursors in the BM, however these mice had reduced migratory DCs in secondary lymphoid organs21. Our BM chimera experiments showed that the effect of IL-7 in DC accumulation was indirect. Therefore, the accumulation of DCs we noted in IL-7Rα449F mice was not due to a problem with migration or maturation and was likely due to the fact that viral clearance was impaired which led to continued recruitment of DCs to the lungs.We have demonstrated for the first time that IL-7 is inducible in lung epithelial cells in response to viral infection in vivo. While the increase in total IL-7-eGFP+ cells in the lung was modest, we noted a shift in the population that are positive for IL-7-eGFP. In naïve mice, the majority of IL-7-eGFP+ cells were lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) as previously reported29,30. However, following infection with influenza, IL-7-eGFP+ epithelial cells (ECs) and to a lesser extent stromal cells (SCs) expanded while LECs decreased in frequency. Our results demonstrate that IL-7 can be produced by lung tissues and this could shape the function of CD127 expressing CD8 T cells locally. It is unclear to what extent IL-7 produced by epithelial cells influences nearby cells and the significance of the shift in sources of IL-7. In addition, more sensitive approaches are required to compare the levels of IL-7 expression between the different lung tissues.Terminal differentiation of activated CD8 T cells is important for the generation of short-lived effector cells (SLECs) that express killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) and low CD1276,31. We found that following infection with influenza, IL-7Rα449F influenza-specific CD8 T cells have reduced expression of KLRG1 and terminal differentiation to SLEC. The difference in KLRG1 expression between WT and IL-7Rα449F mice was greater within PA224–233-specific cells than in NP366–374-specific cells. We also noted a similar trend in CD107a expression between WT and IL-7Rα449F mice whereby the defect in CD107a expression was more pronounced in PA224–233-specific cells than in NP366–374-specific cells. Increased expression of CD127 by PA224–233-specific cells supports the hypothesis that PA224–233-specific cells have elevated dependence on IL-7 signaling. Furthermore, the increased expression of mutated CD127 in IL-7Rα449F mice did not compensate for the loss of Tyr449 signifying the importance of this signaling residue.Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα are important during an anti-viral response to help with recruiting and activating other cells. Within NP366–374-specific cells, we did not observe any differences in expression of IFNγ and TNFα between WT and IL-7Rα449F or IL-7eGFP/eGFP CD8 T cells. However, the large reduction in IFNγ+ TNFα+ population in PA224–233-specific cells of IL-7Rα449F or IL-7eGFP/eGFP mice followed a similar pattern to our findings with CD107a. NP366–374-specific cells did not generate IFNγ+ TNFα+ cells as notably as PA224–233-specific cells, consistent with other groups42,43. Our work further corroborates what previous studies have shown, that TSLP shapes effector T cell responses following influenza infection. However, these effects were shown to occur indirectly through programming of DCs44. Altogether, this suggests that IL-7 may differentially regulate the effector function of CD8 T cells based on their antigen-specificity. Further investigation into the downstream signaling is necessary to understand the mechanism that leads to this response.Previous studies have shown hierarchical differences between NP366–374 and PA224–233-specific CD8 T cells whereby tissue resident memory CD8 T cells that are NP366–374-specific expressed higher levels of inhibitory molecules including PD-1 at 30 dpi and beyond due to persistent antigen exposure and TCR stimulation45. IL-7 is also known to enhance cytokine production and reverse T cell exhaustion by repressing inhibitory pathways during chronic viral infections in mice15,16. It is well established that TCR signaling duration correlates positively with PD-1 expression but little is known about this phenomenon in the context of influenza-specific CD8 T cells46,47. In an acute hepatitis B virus infection, PD-1 expression in CD8 T cells is negatively correlated to CD127 expression, and blocking PD-1 in acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection increases the frequency of the CD127+ population48,49. Our finding that PD-1 expression is higher within PA224–233-specific but not NP366–374-specific CD8 T cells with IL-7 signaling deficiency is indicative of an antigen-dependent role for IL-7 in regulating their function. This is suggestive of a negative regulatory role for IL-7 on PD-1 expression dependent on TCR specificty. This hypothesis is corroborated by a previous study where infection with a high pathogenicity influenza virus strain, such as PR8, resulted in elevated PD-1 expression in influenza-specific CD8 T cells compared to infection with the low pathogenicity influenza x31 strain43. This in turn inhibited effector function by specifically affecting development of IFNγ+ TNFα+ cells43. Our studies suggest that PA224–233-specific IL-7 signaling deficient CD8 T cells do not receive the necessary signals to down regulate PD-1. Further studies are required to define the relationship between IL-7 and PD-1 in an acute infection setting and the mechanism by which this specifically affects T cells in an antigen-specific manner.In summary, we have found that IL-7 is required for an optimal response to acute influenza infection as it shapes the early priming stages of CD8 T cells. Moreover, IL-7 produced by lung tissues is important for the terminal differentiation and effector function selectively in antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Various cytokines have the ability to enhance CD8 T cell responses, however, rigorous testing is necessary to evaluate the adverse responses that these cytokines have on bystander cells. Using cytokines such as IL-7 to complement existing therapies may be beneficial given fewer off target effects due to the limited subset of cells that express CD127. IL-7 is currently in clinical trials for treatment of infections and tumors. Additional studies are necessary to expand the use of IL-7 in other conditions and to study its efficacy when delivered in combination with other agents.Materials and methodsMiceAll mice were housed and used in the Center for Disease Modeling facility (CDM) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and all work with animals was carried out with approval and in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of British Columbia Animal Care and Biosafety Committees. IL‐7Rα449F mice were generated in-house as described14. Briefly, they express a mutant form of the IL-7Rα with a single amino acid mutation from Tyr to Phe at position 449. C57BL/6, BoyJ (B6.SJL‐Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ) and C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb) 1100Mjb/J (OT-I) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, ME, USA). IL-7eGFP/eGFP mice were a gift from J.M. McCune (UCSF)29. In all cases, age-matched and sex-matched male and female mice between the ages of 6–12 weeks were used.VirusInfluenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) was purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Influenza A/PR/8/34-OVA (PR8-OVA, kindly provided by Dr. Tania Watts, University of Toronto) was propagated in-house in chicken eggs as previously described50. Mice were sub-lethally infected under anesthesia (isoflurane) with 5 Hemagglutinin Units (HAU) of influenza PR8 or 64 HAU of influenza PR8-OVA in 12.5 µL of sterile PBS intranasally.Tissue preparationMice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in 1 L/min O2 and euthanized by cervical dislocation and perfused with 10 ml cold PBS (+ 5%FBS, 2 mM EDTA). Lungs were excised and processed by mincing with scissors followed by enzymatic digestion using 180 units/ml collagenase IV and 20 µg/ml DNase I (Worthington biochemical LS004188 and LS002139) in 5 ml RPMI incubated at 37 °C for 30–45 min in a shaker incubator before filtering through 70 µm filters and lysing RBCs with ACK lysis buffer. To assess non-hematopoietic cells in the lungs, dispase (1 u/ml) was added to the enzyme cocktail. Mediastinal lymph nodes (mdLN) were collected and crushed through 70 µm filters and suspended as single cells in cold PBS (5%FBS, 2 mM EDTA).Antibodies and flow cytometryAll cell surface staining was done at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark. Anti-CD8a [53–6.7] (APC-eFluor780), anti-B220 [RA3-6B2] (PE-eFluor610), anti-CD44 [IM7] (PE-Cy7), anti-IFNγ [XMG1.2] (A488), anti-TNFα [MP6-XT22] (PE), anti-MHCII [M5/114.15.2] (FITC), anti-CD11b [M1/70] (PE-Cy7), anti-CD326/EpCAM [G8.8] (PE-Cy7) anti-CD107a [eBio1D4B] (PE) and Rat IgG2a kappa Isotype control [eBR2a] (PE) were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, Massachusetts). Anti-KLRG1 [MAFA] (APC), anti-CD127 [SB/199] (PE) anti-PD-1 [29F.1A12] (BV510), anti-CD11b [M1/70] (PE-Cy7), anti-CD11c [N418] (biotin), anti-CD45 [30-F11] (Pacific Blue), anti-CD45.2 [104] (PerCP/Cy5.5 or BV421), anti-CD31 [MEC13.3] (biotin), anti-Gp38 [8.1.1] (PE) and anti-F4/80 [BM8] (PE-Cy7) were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, California). Anti-CD103 [M290] (PE), anti-TCR Vα2 [B20.1] (PE) and anti-CD45.1 [A20] (APC) were purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Anti-CD11c [N418] (Alexa fluor-647), anti-CD45.1 [A20] (A488), anti-B220 [RA-6B2] (FITC) and anti-F4/80 [BM8] (biotin) were purchased from AbLab (Vancouver, British Columbia).Tetramer staining was done at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. H2-Kb tetramers loaded with immune-dominant NP366–374 and PA224–233 peptides from influenza and labeled with Brilliant Violet-421 or Alexa fluor-647 were manufactured and donated by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Atlanta, GA).Viability staining [cat# L34957 and 65-0865-14] (Thermo Fisher) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions.Samples were collected on either a FACSCanto, LSRII (BD Biosciences) or the Attune NxT (Thermo Fisher) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software Tree Star (Ashland, Oregon).Bone marrow chimerasRecipient mice were irradiated with 2 doses of 6.5 grey (Gy) or 650 rad at least 4 h apart. For the following 10 days, they were supplemented with antibiotics ad libitum (2 mg/ml neomycin sulfate). 24 h after radiation, femurs and tibias were collected from donor CD45.1 and CD45.2 mice (WT and IL-7Rα449F respectively). RBCs were removed using sterile ACK lysis. For tetramer response experiments, a total of 1 × 106 donor bone marrow (BM) cells were injected intravenously (I.V.) at a 1:1 ratio to deliver WT:WT or 1:10 ratio to deliver WT:IL‐7Rα449F into Rag1-/- hosts. For dendritic cell experiments, a total of 5 × 105 donor BM cells were injected I.V. at a 1:1 ratio to deliver WT:WT or WT: IL‐7Rα449F into C57BL/6 J;Boy/J (CD45.1/0.2) hosts. 6–8 weeks elapsed for reconstitution before challenge with influenza infection. After euthanasia, spleens and BMs were assessed for reconstitution efficiency and ratios.Adoptive transferSingle cell suspensions were prepared from multiple OT-I and OT-I;IL-7Rα449F mice spleens and CD8 T cells were purified using the CD8 T cell negative selection kit (EasySep™ Mouse CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit) from Stem Cell Technologies. 1 × 106 cells were transferred I.V. into BoyJ (CD45.1) hosts and 24 h later hosts are challenged with 64HAU PR8-OVA intranasally. MdLN was harvested at experimental endpoint and cells were stained for surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above.Cell culture and Il-7 RT-qPCRA549 (ATCC CCL-185) human type II alveolar epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, Virginia). Cells were passaged and expanded in 10% FBS F-12 K Medium from ATCC (Cat No. 30-2004). For experimental use, 5 × 105 A549 cells were seeded into 6-well plates in media and expanded for 24 h to achieve confluence. After 1 h of serum starvation, cells were infected with 200 HAU PR8 in PBS and incubated for 1 h on a plate shaker to initiate infection. Virus containing PBS was aspirated and replaced with F-12 K media containing 0.5% BSA and 0.5 µg/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) treated trypsin. Cells were then incubated for the assigned experimental time points. Cells were lysed and RNA was extracted using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher). After treatment with amplification grade DNase I (Thermo Fisher), cDNA was generated using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and cDNA quantification was performed using the Ssofast EvaGreen Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are as follows. β-actin Forward: GAC ATG GAG AAA ATC TG; β-actin Reverse: ATG ATC TGG GTC ATC TTC TC; Human IL-7 Forward: CCA GGT TAA AGG AAG AAA ACC; Human IL-7 Reverse: TTT CAG TGT TCT TTA GTG CC; Human IFN-β Forward: ACG CCG CAT TGA CCA TCT AT; Human IFN-β Reverse: GTC TCA TTC CAG CCA GTG CTA; M1 Forward: AGA TGA GTC TTC TAA CCG AGG TCG; M1 Reverse: TGC AAA AAC ATC TTC AAG TCT CTG. Measurements were acquired using the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).Ex vivo T cell re-stimulationLungs from mice infected (7–9 days) with PR8 were excised and prepared as above. To measure CD107a, 5 × 106 lung cells were re-stimulated for 4 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) with 1% BSA RPMI containing 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml Ionomycin from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri); Monensin from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) used according to manufacturer’s instructions; and anti-CD107a [eBio1D4B] PE32. Following re-stimulation, cells were stained for viability and surface markers then analyzed by flow cytometry.To measure IFNγ and TNFα, 5 × 106 lung cells were re-stimulated for 3 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) with 10 nM NP366–374 and PA224–233 peptides from Anaspec (Fremont, California) in the presence of Brefeldin/A from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) in 1% BSA RPMI. Following re-stimulation, cells were stained for viability and surface markers followed by intracellular cytokine staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) then analyzed by flow cytometry.Statistical analysisAll analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA). Samples that were identified as outliers by the Gibbs tests were excluded from the analysis. Two-tailed t-tests and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test were performed as appropriate and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Unless specified, all error analysis in bar charts are presented as S.E.M.EthicsAll experiments described using mice had ethical and procedural approval from the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee (protocol A17-0249) as per guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Photograph: SWNSBird flu This article is more than 2 years oldFirst UK person to catch H5N1 bird flu strain is namedThis article is more than 2 years oldAlan Gosling, 79, tested positive having lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in DevonJamie GriersonFri 7 Jan 2022 14.26 GMTLast modified on Fri 7 Jan 2022 19.18 GMTShareThe first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with about 20 ducks inside his home in Devon.Gosling, who had about another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several birds falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports.Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas.Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu – a first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds.Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock.His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends.She said: “The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family. He saw all of his ducks killed, and they were like his closest friends.”The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed on Thursday that a person in the south-west of England had tested positive for bird flu.In a statement, the health protection body said: “Bird-to-human transmission of avian flu is very rare and has only occurred a small number of times in the UK previously.“The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time.“All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating.”The UK has recently reported a large number of bird flu outbreaks among animals, with the UK’s chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, issuing warnings to bird owners over hygiene.There are 64 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in England, according to Defra, with new cases being confirmed on a daily basis. There are also a number of cases in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.The whole of the UK is covered by avian influenza prevention zones, which require bird keepers to take measures to try to stop the disease’s spread, such as housing or netting all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds, and disinfecting clothing and equipment.Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA.It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low.Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.This was the first human case of the strain in the UK, the organisation said, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.Explore more on these topicsBird fluHealthDevonAnimalsnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBird flu outbreak confirmed at East Yorkshire poultry farm5d agoBird flu in pheasants in England sparks concern over lax rearing rules17 Oct 2024Risk of bird flu spreading to humans is ‘enormous concern’, says WHO 18 Apr 2024Northumberland’s Farne Islands reopen to visitors after bird flu outbreak27 Mar 2024Avian flu outbreak confirmed at vital seabird colonies in Wales20 Jul 2023Human gene identified that prevents most bird flu viruses moving to people 28 Jun 2023RSPB calls for suspension of game-bird releases over avian flu fears18 May 2023Two poultry workers test positive for bird flu in England16 May 2023‘We feel more prepared’: Farne Islands face another season battling avian flu4 May 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here are some of the major stops on our journey to tell the pandemic’s origin story.© istock.com, Samuil_Levich; © istock.com, bgblue; © istock.com, ankomandoNew virus identified in USIn April 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the identification of a new influenza A virus in two children in San Diego, California. The virus’s genome includes segments derived from the Eurasian, classical, and “triple-reassortant” swine influenza lineages. It remains unclear whether the virus is connected to mysterious pneumonia outbreaks reported earlier that month in Mexico. Epicenter found in MexicoRetrospective diagnostic testing confirms that the same swine-origin virus caused outbreaks in central Mexico as early as March 2009, establishing the country as the epicenter of an outbreak now rapidly spreading around the world.Lab-leak rumors ariseJust as flights are canceled to Mexico and schools shutter in parts of the US, Japan, and elsewhere, Australian biologist Adrian Gibbs claims to have evidence that the virus originated in a laboratory performing genetic experiments for vaccine production. His arguments include that there are no known influenza viruses in pigs that are genetically similar to the viruses identified in people in Mexico and California, and that the virus’s proteins have a preponderance of lysine residues, thought to arise during vaccine production.Genetically related viruses found in pigs in AsiaJust as the WHO declares H1N1 to be a global pandemic, studies published in Science and Nature in June 2009 conclude that the virus is of natural swine origin and outline how it evolved over decades as influenza viruses continuously jumped among birds, humans, and pigs. All five WHO collaborating influenza centers agree. The data presented in the Nature paper are compatible with the idea that the virus arose in Asia, where US health officials had expected the next pandemic to start, after close calls with SARS and bird flu outbreaks in China. Open questions remain about virus’s geographic originsAt an informal meeting in Leuven, Belgium, in mid-2010, my colleagues and I struggle to explain how a virus in an Asian pig sparked a pandemic that began in humans in Mexico. We admit it doesn’t make sense. Genomic surveillance yields dataGenomic sequences of flu viruses collected from pigs around the world between 2010 and 2015 capture the widespread movement of viral lineages following the direction of swine imports and exports. New discoveries are made in South America, where flu viruses introduced to pigs from humans have been hiding out for decades. Still, nothing points to the 2009 pandemic arising outside of Asia.Pandemic aftershocks felt: 300+ spillovers of swine viruses into US kidsMore than 300 children in the US Midwest catch novel flu viruses from their show pigs in the summer of 2012. These viruses carry genetic pieces closely related to the pandemic virus and are apparently the result of humans passing the virus to pigs. Fortunately, this time human-to-human transmission is never established.Flying pigs: New study shows how international live swine trade spreads flu virusesA simulation published in March 2015 shows the dynamic nature of pig imports and exports, with some countries such as the US acting as swine influenza “sources” and others, including Mexico, as “sinks.”“Smoking pig” identified in MexicoGenetic analysis of swine flu viruses from Mexico reveals 18 that match the 2009 viral lineage segment-for-segment, confirming the central region of the country as the likely site where the virus jumped from pigs to humans. Mystery solved: Components of 2009 pandemic virus imported into Mexico from US and EuropeReconstructing the detailed evolutionary history of influenza viruses in Mexico all the way back to the 1990s, we formulate the whole story: Over the past two decades Mexico imported millions of US pigs, including some carrying classical and triple-reassortant viruses, which spread across much of the country, while imports from Europe to central Mexico brought with them Eurasian swine viruses. This created a mixing bowl where American- and European-origin viruses reassorted into a new pathogen that made the jump to humans.Read the full story.Membership Open House!Enjoy OPEN access to Premium Content for a limited timeInterested in exclusive access to more premium content?Become a Member today!Already a member?Login HereShareKeywordsfluH1N1infectious diseaseinfluenzamicrobiologyoutbreakoutbreak modelingpandemicpandemic flupublic healthViral evolutionvirusvirus evolutionvirus huntingvirus hybridvirus variantMeet the AuthorMartha NelsonMartha Nelson is an evolutionary biologist in the Intramural Research Program at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The aim was to explore differences in metabolic profile, body composition, physical capacity, and inflammation between patients hospitalized with CAP caused by different etiology.MethodsA prospective study of Danish patients hospitalized with CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or bacteria. Fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis. Physical activity and capacity were assessed using questionnaires and handgrip strength. Plasma (p)-glucose, p-lipids, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), p-adiponectin, and cytokines were measured.ResultsAmong 164 patients with CAP, etiology did not affect admission levels of glucose, HbA1c, adiponectin, or lipids. Overall, 15.2% had known diabetes, 6.1% had undiagnosed diabetes, 51.3% had pre-diabetes, 81% had hyperglycemia, and 60% had low HDL-cholesterol, with no difference between groups. Body mass index, FM, and FFM were similar between groups, with 73% of the patients being characterized with abdominal obesity, although waist circumference was lower in patients with COVID-19. Physical capacity was similar between groups. More than 80% had low handgrip strength and low physical activity levels. Compared to patients with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had increased levels of interferon (IFN)-γ (mean difference (MD) 4.14; 95% CI 1.36–12.58; p = 0.008), interleukin (IL)-4 (MD 1.82; 95% CI 1.12–2.97; p = 0.012), IL-5 (MD 2.22; 95% CI 1.09–4.52; p = 0.024), and IL-6 (MD 2.41; 95% CI 1.02–5.68; p = 0.044) and increased IFN-γ (MD 6.10; 95% CI 2.53–14.71; p < 0.001) and IL-10 (MD 2.68; 95% CI 1.53–4.69; p < 0.001) compared to patients with bacterial CAP, but no difference in IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-18, IL-12p70, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin.ConclusionDespite higher inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19, metabolic profile, body composition, and physical capacity were similar to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP.

Various pathogens cause CAP but is dominated by a range of bacteria and viruses [2]. The emergence of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has re-emphasized the vital role of respiratory viruses as a cause of CAP. Numerous studies have now identified age, male sex, and especially obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease as strong risk factors for severe COVID-19 [3]. Similar risk factors have been associated with severe outcomes from CAP caused by bacteria or influenza viruses [4, 5]. In general, people with obesity have an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation [6, 7]. As a consequences, people with obesity (body mass index [BMI ]> 30) may experience diminished ventilatory drive and capacity also known as the obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome) [8]. Obesity is associated with physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Common for all disorders is insulin resistance, chronic low-grade inflammation, and low level of adiponectin [9]. Chronic inflammation is harmful to the immune system due to chronic leukocyte activation reducing the amount of signaling proteins in leukocytes available to respond to new stimuli [10]. People with obesity have an increased susceptibility to severe bacterial and viral infections, probably due to an impaired immune response [11, 12]. Dysregulated and/or exaggerated cytokine responses to the infection may cause immunopathology [7, 13], which is well-documented in patients with COVID-19, where several studies have described abnormal levels of cytokines [7, 14, 15]. Although patients with CAP from SARS-CoV-2 seem to have more severe outcomes than CAP caused by influenza or bacteria [5, 16], no studies have compared the degree of obesity, physical capacity, dysregulation of glucose, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory response between CAP etiologies. The aim of the study was to compare body composition, physical capacity, glucometabolic, and inflammatory profile in patients with CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2 to CAP caused by influenza virus and bacteria.MethodsStudy design, setting, and populationThis prospective cohort study includes admission data and prospective follow-up on admission to the ICU, length of hospital stay, and mortality. The patients were prospectively recruited at Nordsjællands Hospital in Denmark from January 8, 2019, until May 26, 2020. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, a new infiltrate on chest X-ray/CT, and minimum one of the following symptoms: fever (≥38.0 °C), cough, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, or focal chest signs on auscultation. Patients with no pathogen detection in blood, airways, or urine (Legionella pneumophila antigen or Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen) were excluded.VariablesData collectionInformation on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, and prior medical history were collected from medical records. CURB-65 was used as a severity score [17], and participants were risk-stratified according to their CURB-65 score: mild (0–1), moderate (2), or severe (3–5). The combined burden of comorbidities was assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and by categorizing patients into three groups based on the sum of conditions (none, one, or more than one). In addition, microbiological test results, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 180-day mortality were recorded.Sampling and analysis of bloodVenous blood samples were collected within 48 h of admission and included basic blood work such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), coagulation factors, procalcitonin, kidney function, liver function, diabetes biomarkers, and lipid status.For analysis of cytokines, blood samples were drawn in EDTA tubes and kept on ice until centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. Plasma was separated from the cells and stored at −80 °C until analysis by human pro-inflammatory kits (V-PLEX Viral Panel 3 Human Kit, Meso Scale Discovery). This involved concentration of interleukin (IL)-5, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The concentration of IL-18 was measured by IL-18 immunoassay (U-PLEX Human IL-18 Assay, Meso Scale Discovery). The concentration of adiponectin was measured by adiponectin immunoassays (Human Adiponectin Kit, Meso Scale Discovery). All cytokines were performed in duplicates with the average presented.Definition of known diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, and hyperglycemiaKnown diabetes was based on a diagnosis from patient files and/or the use of antidiabetic medicine. In patients without known diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes was defined as admission hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥48 mmol/mol (≥6.5%), and pre-diabetes was defined as admission HbA1c between 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%) [18]. In addition, we defined normoglycemia, mild hyperglycemia, and severe hyperglycemia at admission as random blood glucose concentrations of <5.99 mmol/L, 6.0–10.99 mmol/L, and ≥11.0 mmol/L, respectively [18].Study questionnaireStudy questionnaires were answered in cooperation with the patient within the first 48 h of admission. Self-reported physical activity data were recorded using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form [19]. Patients were divided into two levels of physical activity (low or moderate-to-high physical activity level). Health-related quality of life was assessed with the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) [20], while the ability to perform daily activities was evaluated with the Barthel Index-100 [21]. Frailty was assessed with the FRAIL scale [22], whereas nutritional status was assessed with the Nutritional Risk Screening-2002 [23].Anthropometry and body compositionWeight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on an electronic scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany), whereas height was self-reported. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Overweight and obesity were defined as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, respectively. Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. The distribution of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were assessed with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BioScan touch i8, Maltron International Ltd, UK). All measurements were performed within the first 48 h of admission.Handgrip strengthHandgrip strength was measured within the first 48 h of admission using an electronic hand dynamometer (Saehan Corporation, South Korea). All measurements were performed seated with shoulder and wrist in a neutral position and elbow flexed to 90°. Handgrip strength was based on the best attempt out of three with the dominant hand.Statistical analysisData were examined for normal distribution by histograms, quantile-quantile plots, and the Shapiro-Wilk test, while homogeneity of variance was explored by Levene’s Test. Missing observations were assumed to be missing completely at random. Parametric continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviation (SD), and statistical comparisons were made with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Where normality and variance violations prohibited parametric analysis of data, non-parametric continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile range (IQR), and statistical comparisons between groups were made by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks, followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. Categorical variables were expressed as number (%), and group differences were tested with the Chi-squared (χ2) test. If differences were found, Bonferroni-corrected p values were obtained as appropriate to identify significant differences between groups. Prior to statistical analysis, all cytokine values were log-transformed. After log-transformation, data were considered normally distributed, and ANOVA was used to detect differences between groups, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. After statistical analysis, cytokine data were back-transformed and expressed as geometric means with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding 95% CI was calculated for the variables; ICU admission and mortality. All p values were two-sided, and the significance level was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 or GraphPad Prism 8.0.2.Ethical considerationsThe study was approved by the scientific Ethics Committee at the Capital Region of Denmark (H-18024256), registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03795662), and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment.ResultsAmong 405 patients screened for inclusion, 164 (40.5%) fulfilled the criteria and were included in the study (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2 (n = 40, 24.4%) was the most common virus followed by influenza A (n = 25, 15.2%). In patients with bacterial CAP (n = 99, 60.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 30, 30.3%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 18, 18.2%) were the two most common pathogens (Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1: Flowchart showing the flow of the study population.LRTI lower respiratory tract infection.Full size imageDemography, comorbidities, and clinical parametersPatient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The groups were comparable in age, sex, CCI score, and the number of patients living in nursing homes. Patients with COVID-19 had fewer comorbidities (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Regarding diabetes, 15.2% of the patients had known diabetes, 6.1% had undiagnosed diabetes, and 51.3% had pre-diabetes, but no difference between groups. According to the CURB-65 score, 57% of the patients had mild CAP, while 34% had moderate CAP, with no difference between groups. During hospitalization, 6 patients (15%) with COVID-19, 1 patient (4%) with influenza, and 4 patients (4%) with bacterial CAP were treated in the ICU, with a tendency towards a higher ICU admission rate among patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of admission to the ICU than patients with influenza (RR 3.75, 95% CI 0.48–29.34) and bacterial CAP (RR 3.71, 95% CI 1.11–12.46). In addition, patients with COVID-19 had a tendency (p = 0.08) towards a higher in-hospital mortality risk compared to patients with influenza (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.39–25.22) and bacterial CAP (RR 4.13, 95% CI 1.03–16.45). Furthermore, 30-days after discharge, patients with COVID-19 tended (p = 0.08) to have a higher mortality risk than patients with influenza (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.39–25.22) and bacterial CAP (RR 4.13, 95% CI 1.03–16.45), respectively. At 180-days after discharge, the risk of mortality was still higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with influenza (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.41–8.58) and bacterial CAP (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.69–5.01). The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 3–10) for patients with COVID-19, which was similar to patients with influenza (5, IQR: 2–6) and bacterial CAP (5, IQR: 4–8; Table 1).Table 1 Baseline characteristics.Full size tableBody compositionBodyweight, BMI, total FFM, FM, and FM percentage were similar between groups. In total, 60% of the patients had an increased FM percentage (males > 25% and females > 36%, respectively), with no difference between groups. Moreover, 33% of the patients were characterized with overweight, while 22% were characterized with obesity, with no difference between groups. In total, 82% of the female patients and 65% of the males had a higher waist circumference compared to the recommendation (>80 cm and >94 cm, respectively), with no difference between groups (Table 2). Thus, although most patients with COVID-19 had increased waist circumferences compared to the recommendation, the waist circumference was lower than in patients with influenza (Table 2).Table 2 Physical capacity, body composition, and mental status.Full size tablePhysical capacity and mental statusOverall, 83% of the patients had low handgrip strength, while 85% had low physical activity levels, with no difference between groups. The ability to perform daily activities was similar between groups. Moreover, frailty was seen in 22% of the patients, while 51% were at nutritional risk, with no difference between groups. In addition, patients with COVID-19 had a higher pre-hospital health-related quality of life than patients with influenza (Table 2).Metabolic and inflammatory parametersPlasma adiponectin concentration, admission blood glucose, HbA1c, and lipids (LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides) were similar between the groups. Compared to normal values, 81% of the patients had admission hyperglycemia, while 60% had HDL-cholesterol <1.0 mmol/L, with no difference between groups (Table 3). Other laboratory parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 3.Table 3 Glucose and lipid metabolism.Full size tableMetabolic and inflammatory parametersPatients with COVID-19 had lower leukocyte count compared to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP and lower neutrophil and monocyte counts compared to patients with bacterial CAP (Supplementary Table 3). In addition, patients with COVID-19 had higher IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 concentrations compared to patients with influenza and higher IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations compared to patients with bacterial CAP (Fig. 2).Fig. 2: Cytokine concentration in plasma measured at admission.COVID-19 (n = 31): white bares, influenza (n = 24): bars in light gray, and bacterial CAP (n = 72): bars in dark gray. Data are in geometric means with 95% CI. Thirty-seven patients (SARS-CoV-2: 9, influenza: 1, bacterial: 27) had missing values on cytokine concentration, and four patients (SARS-CoV-2: 1, influenza: 1, bacterial: 2) had missing values on CRP concentration. Comparisons were made with one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001: Different from COVID-19.Full size imageDiscussionAmong Danish patients hospitalized with CAP, we found little difference in pre-admission status and the clinical presentation of CAP between different causative pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and influenza virus. Overall, patients were characterized with a very high proportion of abdominal obesity, pre-diabetes, known and undiagnosed diabetes, and low HDL-cholesterol, but no difference between the groups. Likewise, most patients had low physical activity levels and handgrip strength, with no difference between the groups. Despite a similar pre-admission profile, the pro-and anti-inflammatory responses were more enhanced in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP.The most common comorbidities among patients with COVID-19 were hypertension, asthma, and diabetes, which is partially comparable to a Danish nationwide study [24]. In comparison, similar comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were frequently seen in patients with influenza and bacterial CAP. A high CCI index (>2) has previously been associated with an increased risk of mortality from both COVID-19, influenza, and bacterial CAP [5, 16, 24]. In line with previous studies [18], pre-diabetes is common in patients with CAP, which we also found irrespective of the CAP etiology. In comparison, a recent study from the US of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reported 24% of the patients having pre-diabetes [25], a significantly lower number compared to our study. We have previously shown that among patients without a history of diabetes, pre-diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were seen in 37.5 and 5% of the patients with bacterial CAP [18]. This high degree of pre-diabetes has not previously been shown in patients with COVID-19 but adds to the knowledge of an unhealthy metabolic phenotype in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. However, more evidence is needed to comment on the prognostic impact of pre-diabetes in the disease severity of COVID-19. However, patients with COVID-19 were more often admitted to the ICU and had higher mortality compared to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP.People with obesity are predisposed to an increased susceptibility to CAP and increased risk of severe COVID-19 or influenza infection [6, 11, 26]. Interestingly, using bioelectrical impedance analysis, we found that the majority (60%) of the patients had an increased FM percentage (males > 25% and females > 36%, respectively), irrespectively of the CAP etiology, indicating general obesity in all three groups [27]. Furthermore, the adiposity was characterized by abdominal obesity as 73% of the patients had a waist circumference above the recommended [28]. In line with previous studies [6, 26], more than half of the patients were characterized with overweight or obesity, again with no difference between groups. A newly published retrospective French study comparing patients with COVID-19 and influenza [5] showed a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 being characterized with overweight or obesity compared to patients with influenza. In contrast, overweight and obesity were more pronounced in our study independent of etiology compared to the previous study [5]. Differences in study design and/or patient population between the studies might explain the marked difference in the percentage of patients with COVID-19 and influenza being characterized with overweight or obesity. We included adult patients where the primary contact to the hospital was CAP, defined by new pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray/CT. In contrast, the French study [5] included patients where COVID-19 or influenza was either the primary or secondary diagnosis leading to hospitalization, indicating less severe infections in the French study.Previous studies have, regardless of CAP etiology, demonstrated hyperglycemia at admission in hospitalized patients with CAP both with and without diabetes [29,30,31]. We add to the previous knowledge that no difference in hyperglycemia was observed between CAP etiology. Admission hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes has previously been associated with increased risk of critical illness and mortality from COVID-19 and bacterial CAP, possibly due to an impaired innate immunity [29,30,31]. Furthermore, in line with previous studies [32, 33], we observed that the majority (60%) of the patients had reduced HDL-cholesterol (<1 mmol/L) with no difference between groups. Dyslipidemia (high LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) is a risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19 and bacterial infections [32].During pulmonary infections, IFN-γ plays a crucial role in host defense and regulation of inflammatory response [34]. There are essential differences between COVID-19 and influenza regarding the role of IFN-γ in driving disease severity. Previous studies have shown that reduced IFN-γ signaling in response to influenza improves clinically relevant outcomes by promoting the survival of CD8+ T cells [35]. This protective effect of low IFN-γ in influenza differs from COVID-19, where inadequate secretion of IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells correlates with disease severity [36]. Moreover, COVID-19 has been shown to induce a more robust IFN-γ response in vitro than influenza, suggesting that IFN-γ might play a larger part in the host immune response to COVID-19 [14]. This is supported by the present study, showing elevated IFN-γ levels in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP. However, the role of IFN-γ in the pathogenesis of bacterial CAP is conflicting and highly dependent on the type of bacteria [37]. Overall, high levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 have been associated with disease severity and poor survival from COVID-19 [15, 36, 38]. In critically ill patients with influenza, disease severity is also related to elevated levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 [39, 40]. As reviewed by Ritter and colleagues [12], people with obesity may be more susceptible to severe complications from the inflammatory response induced by the COVID-19 infection as a consequence of chronic low-grade inflammation and dysfunctional immune response. Current evidence could indicate that the obesity-induced inflammatory responses may be an essential driver of COVID-19 severity [41]. Given the same degree of general obesity and even lower degree of abdominal obesity in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with influenza and bacterial CAP in our study, this could suggest that the severity of the interaction between obesity and systemic inflammation is enhanced in COVID-19. As patients with COVID-19 also had the lowest proportion of abdominal adiposity, this indicates that the increased inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 is not only explained by abdominal obesity nor dysregulated metabolic profile.However, conclusive clinical data are still awaited as another study has not found any association between cytokine concentration and BMI in patients with COVID-19 [15]. Nevertheless, in the present study, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 were the only cytokines elevated in patients with COVID-19. In support, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 have previously been shown to increase over the course of disease in patients with severe COVID-19 [7, 38], suggesting an extensive upregulation of the adaptive immunity during COVID-19 [13].Study strengths and limitationsThe study is a prospective cohort study, so real-time evaluation of outcomes such as body composition, functional capacity, and physical activity level between different CAP etiologies was possible. We used self-reported data, which can introduce information bias and misclassification. However, to reduce bias when collecting research, staff was trained by the same researcher. We cannot rule out the presence of selection bias in who was included in the study, as informed consent had to be obtained within the first 24 h of admission (consent bias). However, similar bias has occurred within each group and therefore has not affected the differences between the groups. As the study was a single-center study, geographic differences influencing the studied outcomes have been minimized. However, as with prospective studies, the patients were recruited at different time points. Patients with COVID-19 were recruited over two months, from March 24, 2020, to May 26, 2020. In contrast, patients with bacterial CAP were recruited over one and a half years from January 9, 2019, to May 25, 2020, while patients with influenza were recruited during seasonal influenza of 2018/2019 and 2019/2020. Finally, there was an imbalance in the number of patients in each group. The group with influenza CAP was relatively small compared to the other two groups.ConclusionDespite similar metabolic phenotype and less abdominal adiposity, patients with COVID-19 demonstrated an increased inflammatory response, indicating that a dysregulated metabolic profile or abdominal obesity in patients with COVID-19 cannot be the only explanations for the more severe outcome seen in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with other etiologies of CAP.

The antiviral activity of CAP against SARS-CoV-2 is being investigated, however, the same but of PAM has not been explored despite its potential. In the present study, the capability of Plasma Activated Media (PAM) to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and PR8 H1N1 influenza virus with negligible damage on healthy cells is demonstrated. PAM acted by both virus detaching and diminished replication. Furthermore, the treatment of A549 lung cells at different times with buffered PAM did not induce interleukin 8 expression, showing that PAM did not induce inflammation. These results open a new research field by using PAM to the development novel treatments for COVID-19, influenza, and other respiratory diseases.

Examples of plasmas are found in nature as lightnings, northern lights, stars and also in a wide range of technological applications from nuclear fusion to illumination. Such a broad spectrum of plasmas responds to the distribution of energy among species of molecules and particles that compose them. In the case that concerns us here, the plasmas of interest are those called Cold Atmospheric Plasmas (CAP). These are strongly out of thermodynamic equilibrium and they can transmit a relatively small amount of thermal energy to other bodies or materials. Indeed, under these circumstances it is not possible to use the concept of temperature strictly. The abundance of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) in these plasmas and its low heat transmission do CAPs excellent for use in biological, medical, veterinary, food, and agronomic applications2,3,4,5,6,7. There is a wide international consensus about the effectiveness of RONS delivered by CAPs to deactivate bacteria, fungi, cancer cells and viruses8,9,10,11,12,13,14. The active principle is oxidative stress that RONS produce on microorganisms in a synergistic action between Oxygen and Nitrogen radical compounds15,16,17,18,19. As is well known, oxidative stress plays a key role in cell redox biochemistry. In fact, cells have a higher threshold of oxidative stress tolerance, respect to bacteria, fungi, and viruses due to structural reasons and stimulation of its self-repair mechanisms20,21,22. The antiviral capacity of CAPs against SARS-CoV-2 has been recently investigated showing an interesting potential23,24,25.On the other hand, there is an alternative way to deliver RONS from a plasma on a surface by using liquids (for example, water or saline solutions) that have been exposed to a CAP long enough to absorb a certain RONS concentration. These liquids are given the generic name of Plasma Activated Media (PAM) and are gaining an increasing interest in medicine where for example, in-vitro and in-vivo results on cancer cells are relevant13,14,26,27,28,29. Although CAPs and PAMs share the same active principle of oxidative stress, PAMs have an interesting complementary advantage respect to CAPs: its capability to reach body cavities that are inaccessible for CAPs applicators systems. The possibility ot use PAMs against SARS-Cov-2 has only been recently proposed by experiments with virus and isolated pseudo-virus30,31 and its capability to be applied on living cells and complex body cavities had inspired our work. In this paper we show in-vitro experiments demonstrating the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 and PR8 H1N1 influenza A virus to PAMs with a minimal or neglectable damage to healthy cells with especial emphasis on non-inflammatory processes. Experiments with a fine aerosol of PAM on virus samples strongly aim to possibilities of developing a wide spectrum treatment on the base of a simple nebulization technique for respiratory tract diseases as COVID-19, flu, and others.ResultsTo study the effect of RONS present in the activated water on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 we performed a series of experiments comparing virus titers before and after contact with the activated media. Two types of PAMs were used for the experiments: Plasma Activated Water (PAW) made with distilled water and buffered PAW (bPAW) made by buffering PAW with 10% of 10X PBS in volume. The pH and RONS concentrations of used PAMs are shown in Table 1.Table 1 PAW is deionized water activated by cold atmospheric plasma and bPAW is a solution of 90% of PAW buffered with 10% of PBS10X in volume.Full size tableFigure 1Effect of plasma activated water on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Generated with INKSCAPE 1.1 (www.inkscape.org).Full size imageFigure 1 shows the results of titration experiments of SARS-CoV-2 inocula subjected to different treatment conditions. SARS-CoV-2 virus was diluted to 10% in either distilled water, PAW or bPAW. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with constant rocking. In this experiment the samples were frozen until use. After thawing, decimal dilutions were added to fresh monolayers of Vero E6 cells and adsorbed for 1 h. The viral titers were estimated by plaque lysis assay. The treatment with PAW completely abolished the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 while incubation with buffered PAW induced a reduction of 80% in the viral titers, when compared with the titers obtained after incubation with distilled water (Fig. 1A). The complete abolition of infectivity (no plaques were visible at the lowest dilution) upon PAW treatment could be due to the overextended contact period considering the time to completion of freezing and thawing. For a more controlled estimation of the infectivity loss, the treatment was performed for only 30 min immediately prior to incubation with Vero E6 cells. In this experimental setting we observed a titer reduction of around 90% and 99% upon treatment with bPAW or PAW, respectively (Fig. 1B). This result clearly demonstrated the deleterious effect of PAW on the virus viability and that this effect was slightly ameliorated after phosphate buffering of the medium. To test if both PAMs could have an effect right after virus-cell attachment, Vero E6 cells were incubated with serial SARS-CoV-2 virus dilutions for 1 h. Infected cells were then subjected to two consecutive washes with either PAW or bPAW and the titers estimated 48 h later as before. The reductions in titers were of 99.5% and 95% for bPAW and PAW respectively, indicating that PAMs efficiently altered the SARS-CoV-2-cell interaction (Fig. 1C). As aforementioned, the active principle of PAW is due to concentration of RONS, but low pH could play a significant role in its antiviral effect. Since most viral glycoproteins rely in a pH-dependent conformational change for viral and endosomal membrane fusion upon internalization we wondered if the extremely low pH of PAW could be responsible for the observed infectivity loss upon treatment. To estimate the influence of pH in the attachment efficacy a similar virus dilution experiment was performed, using different media with low to physiologic pH. The effect of lower than physiologic pH (5.5 or 2.7) resulted in a 22% and 58% infectivity reduction, respectively (Fig. 1D). These data point out to a combined effect of RONS and low pH as drivers for the loss of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 particles and might explain the differences observed upon PAW and bPAW treatment (pH 2.1 and 5.2, respectively). Taken together, these data demonstrate the negative impact of plasma activated media on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 particles in cell culture. To make an estimation of the concentration at which PAW exerts half of its maximal SARS-CoV-2 infectivity inhibition (\(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\)) a fixed amount of virus inoculum was incubated with decreasing concentrations of PAW, ranging from 90% to 30% in distilled water or PBS (Fig. 2). Upon non-linear curve fitting, the estimated \(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\) of PAW was 83.72%. Since the maximal concentration of PAW resulting after buffering with phosphate salts and incubation with the virus inoculum was below this threshold (80%) it could not be observed a clear dilution effect using this treatment, precluding the generation of a proper curve fitting for \(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\) estimation. The effect of different PAW concentrations on cultured Vero E6 cells was also assessed. The incubation of cells for 10 min with PAW dilutions resulted in full viability loss due to the non-isotonic nature of the media (not shown). One potential application of PAW would be to reduce the viral load in infected mucosal tissues. For human respiratory viruses such approach could rely on aerosol treatment. Thus, nebulization experiments with PAW were carried out with samples of Vero E6 cells infected with serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 inoculum. Vero E6 cell monolayers were used, as in previous experiments. The inoculum was allowed to contact cells for 0.5 h or 5 h, representing either preinternalized or internalized virus particles, respectively. After exposure to ultrasonic nebulization for 10 minutes, the treated cells were processed as for plaque lysis assay. Figure 3 shows that when the virus remained cell-attached the nebulization with both PAW and bPAW was able to alter the infectivity of inoculum, allowing for a reduction of about 77% with respect to infected cells nebulized with PBS. This effect was not evident after virus internalization suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory effect of PAW is more related to host cell-virus alterations rather than affecting other downstream processes in the viral cycle.On the other hand, infection tests with the PR8 H1N1 virus, responsible of common Influenza or flu, were performed by using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line. Once infected with the PR8 H1N1 virus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, the cells were incubated for 24 h in a regime of free virus multiplication and subsequently exposed to bPAW treatment for 20 min. Figure 4A shows the results of inhibition on replication by measuring the level of PR8 virus nucleoprotein (N) messenger RNA transcripts by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Columns represent the reference sample (MDCK), cells infected with PR8 (Infection PR8) and infected cells that were treated with bPAW for 20 min of exposure (bPAW 20 min). The antiviral activity of PAW against PR8 H1N1 is observed because the level of nucleoprotein (N) transcripts decreases by 71% with respect to the untreated sample. Figure 4B shows results of the internalization inhibition for PR8 virus in the A549 human cell line subjected to infection for 1 h and subsequently treated with bPAW during 20, 60 and 90 min. The amount of virus nucleoprotein messenger RNA transcripts was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As it can observed, two consecutive washes with bPAW reduced significantly the internalization of PR8. A similar result was observed when cells were incubated for 20 min. However, cells incubated with bPAW for 60 min led to the complete elimination of infectivity on A549. In all cases in which bPAW was used, virus internalization was inhibitedAdditionally, a study of inflammation due to PAM treatment was carried out with the human A549 lung cell line. In this case, the amount of interleukin 8 messenger RNA transcripts was measured by qPCR, a precursor cytokine of inflammation that makes it possible to establish whether inflammatory processes occurs32 . Figure 4C shows the values obtained in A549 cells submitted to the same treatment of that described for Fig. 4B. Results showed that the inflammatory action of PAM on A549 lung cells was not appreciable after 90 min of treatment whereas flagellin was able to increase the interleukin 8 transcript level, being statistically significant when compared to any other sample. Therefore, it is demonstrated that bPAW does not produce inflammation.Figure 5Immunofluorescence of MDCK infected with PR8 (MOI of 0.25) after the treatment with different PAW-PBS dilutions. The images are representative from three experiments. Results showed a reduction of infection between PR8 infected cells and PR8 infected cells and further treated with PAW-PBS. Generated with INKSCAPE 1.1 (www.inkscape.org).Full size imageFigure 6Counting of infected cells with PR8 without and with different PAW-PBS dilutions. Cells were infected with a MOI of 0.25 for 1 h, then submitted to the different treatments, and led the progression of the infection for 24 h. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described in methods and final counting of infected cells versus non-infected cells. Infection was reduced by more than a half (53%) with the lowest dilution of PAW-PBS used (90%PAW-0.1x PBS). Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired t test (*p<0.05, **p<0.009, ***p<0.0004).

Cells were incubated for 20 min with dilutions of PAW-PBS, ranging from 100% to 90% of pure PAW. Cell viability was determined by MMT assay. Absorbance values were used to calculate an exponential curve fitting and to estimate the concentration of PAW-PBS that causes 50% of citotoxicity (CC50).

The groups of lines corresponding to molecular and atomic transitions are shown in boxes indicating their origin. Generated with INKSCAPE 1.1 (www.inkscape.org).Full size imageIn addition to qPCR viral load of PR8, the production of infective PR8 was also determined. For that, MDCK cells infected with PR8 were treated with PAW at different dilutions, and the infection after 24h was observed by using indirect immunofluorescence. A representative image of the results is depicted in Fig. 5. Global results showed a 92.04% of infection in PAW-untreated MDCK cells infected with PR8 while those cells treated with PAW-PBS 1x (bPAW) reduced the infection close to 43%, being a 53% of infectivity reduction (Fig. 6). When PAW solution is more concentrated due to lower PBS concentration, PAW gained effectiveness reducing PR8 infection from 92.04% (PR8 w/o PAW) to 22% (94% PAW-PBS 0.6x), which led to 76% less infection than PR8. MDCK cells showed distinct viability after the treatment with different PAW media with an exponential curve (Fig. 7), ranging from pure PAW (very low cell viability) to PAW-PBS 1x (bPAW) showing a viability close to that of mock cells. The dilution bPAW represented a dilution 1/10 of pure PAW. Curve fitting to an exponential equation yield a R2 = 0,9243. As result, CC50 estimation value is obtained between the dilutions 98% PAW+0.2x PBS and 97% PAW+0.3x PBS. The efficacy of PAW is gained with higher percentage purity, however, this also leads to higher cytotoxicity. Therefore, the highest dilution of PAW (bPAW) had the lowest cytotoxicity, and would reach the \(\hbox {EC}_5\) \(_0\).DiscussionIn this work the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 and PR8 H1N1 virus to Cold Atmospheric Plasma Activated Media (PAM) is demonstrated with in-vitro experiments for isolated virus and infected cells. Our experiments showed a limited influence of pH over the full antiviral effect and a non-inflammatory action on cells by PAM. To explore the possibilities of developing antiviral treatments for respiratory diseases, experiments with PAM aerosol or spray were conducted with encouraging results. One limitation of our study is that we did not identify which of the reactive species generated in PAW are more determinants for the inactivation effect. It is reasonable to speculate, however, that the hydrogen peroxide concentration of our PAMs (around 0.02% w/w) is probably too low to be responsible for the titer drop of the virus. In this sense it was recently shown that a 0.5% w/w solution was not enough to significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 titers, and only higher concentrations (3% w/w) could show clear titer drops upon 5 minute contacts33. In these experiments higher titer drops were shown when lowering the pH of the solution. These data point out to a synergistic effect of \(\hbox {H}_2\) \(\hbox {O}_2\), low pH and RONS determining the virucidal properties of the PAMs tested in this work.During the editorial submission of this manuscript Szili et al.30 reported the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity with two acetyl donors (TAED and pentaacetate glucose) present in an aqueous solution that was activated with cold plasma (PA-TP). PA-TP medium contains peracetic acid in addition to RONS or \(\hbox {H}_2\) \(\hbox {O}_2\) and was able to reduce the virus loads in higher percentages with respect to a distilled water activated control (PA-DIW). Altogether these data confirm the potential of PAMs as appealing viral inactivation alternatives to other less environmental friendly decontaminating reagents.On the other hand, while the results limiting coronavirus or influenza virus replication were clear, cold atmospheric plasma has not always an antiviral effect. There are some studies demonstrating that using CAP increases the infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) in MDBK cells. There is a synergic mechanism shared by IBDV and CAP20. As result, IBDV infected and CAP treated cells were in a G2/M arrest stage. Moreover, CAP suppressed Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) in those cells infected by IBRV leading to an inefficient antiviral state. On the other hand, human adenovirus susceptibility to CAP is serotype-dependent34. So, CAP had an antiviral effect on HAdV-5 and HAdV-37, a neutral effect on HAdV-4 and HAdV-50, and a proviral effect on HAdV-20 and HAdV-35 serotypes. Therefore, these studies suggest that it is necessary to determine the antiviral capability of CAP for each virus family. In contrast, the advantages of PAMs aim to its use as a possible contribution in the fight against COVID-19 and influenza among other respiratory diseases. Oxidative stress (OS) is part of one natural cell’s biochemistry, and could play a key role to develop treatments for contention of respiratory viruses. Moreover, the possibility to apply a PAM in an aerosol mist to the upper respiratory tract with a nebulizer device that is universally available is extremely attractive due its simplicity. Considering that main multiplication and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 takes place during the first weeks of COVID-19 symptoms in the upper respiratory tract35, the application of a mist of PAM could help to contain the virus propagation while patients develop a better immune response. PAM would be effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that could arise and escape neutralizing antibodies, and against seasonal and highly pathogenic influenza viruses as well. Moreover, it is also important to highlight the broad-spectrum action of PAM on bacteria and fungi. Especially considering the patients who suffer complications with these infections simultaneously with COVID-19, the use of PAMs could make a great benefice.We cannot forget that SARS-CoV-2 is only one of viruses in a chain of outbreaks that is affecting us in last decades and everything aims to that more viruses will came soon36. The development of wide range treatments to content virus propagation while new vaccines are developed has a high priority. In this way, the use of aerosol of Plasma Activated Media could represent an important contribution.MethodsFacilitiesThe experiments were conducted in the biological security facility of Animal Health Research Center (CISA, INIA-CSIC) and the Department of Biotechnology, at National Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Technology (INIA-CSIC) in Madrid, Spain, where SARS-CoV-2 strain/NL/2020 and influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) are available for R&D purposes37. PAMs were produced in the laboratories of ION BIOTEC S.L. in Puertollano, Spain (www.ionbiotec.com).PAW and bPAWPlasma Activated Water (PAW) was obtained by direct exposure of deionized water (conductivity \(\le \) 10 \(\mu \)S/cm) to a cold atmospheric air plasma discharge as shown in Fig. 8. Coaxial electrodes separated by a quartz tube of 1 cm of inner diameter and 1 mm wall thickness are placed in contact with the liquid surface. The electrodes are energized by 20 kV power supply while air flow is 5 l/min. While plasma is interacting with the water surface, a fiber optics bundle allows to obtain UV-VIS and UV spectra plasma-water interface. We used a UV-VIS and VIS spectrometers from BWTEK Inc. Models Exemplar-LS BRC115P-U-UV (200–400 nm) and BRC115P-U-UV/VIS (200–800 nm) respectively with an Ocean Insight model QP1000-2-SR (200–900 nm) fiber optics. The exposure time between plasma and water is of 30 min to obtain 200 ml of PAW with the concentration of RONS detailed in Table 1. Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, nitrite and pH were measured by using color fixed indicator strips Quatofix by Macherey-Nagel: Peroxide 1000, Nitrate-Nitrite ans pH-Fix 0-14 respectively. The readings of color changes in the strips were performed by using a reflectometer with auto-calibrated microprocessor control Quantofix Relax. Buffered Plasma Activated Water (bPAW) was made by buffering PAW with a 10% in volume of 10XPBS. Figure 9A shows a wide range VIS-UV spectrum between 200–800 nm of wavelengths where radical, molecular, and atomic lines are observed. Figure 9B shows a narrower range spectrum from UV between wavelength of 200 and 400 nm obtained with other spectrometer with higher resolution to observe a more detailed molecular and radical emission from RONS like NO, OH and \(\hbox {N}_{{2}}\) lines. The activation rate of PAMs strongly depends on the relative abundance of RONS in the plasma-water interface as is shown in the spectra. On-fly measurement of RONS lines intensities while activation is produced allows to optimized plasma generation parameters as air flow, voltage, frequency etc. to obtain a higher transference of RONS to the liquid. In our case, typical activation rate values of 1.2 mg/min of hydrogen peroxide and 4.0 mg/min of nitride are reached. It is worthy to mention that these water activation rates are two orders of magnitude higher than typical of other devices38.Cells and virusVero E6 cells (ATCC/CRL/1586) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing supplements (10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin). Cells were routinely incubated at 37\(^\circ \)C in a CO2 atmosphere with 95% humidity. The SARS-related coronavirus 2 strain NL/2020/ (BetaCoV/Netherlands/01) was used. A virus stock was generated by infecting Vero E6 cells at low infection multiplicity (0.01 PFU/cell). When cytopathic effect (cpe) was evident (48–72 h post infection) the supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and stored in aliquots at -80\(^\circ \)C until use.Table 2 Primers sequences used in this study for quantitative PCR.Full size tableMDCK cell viability after treatment with PAWMeasurements of cell viability were performed using the CyQUANTTM MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Cat. V13154) by quadruplicate. The assay involves conversion of water soluble MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to an insoluble formazan. PAW dilutions were made with 10X PBS as following: (1) pure PAW, (2) 99% PAW+0.1x PBS, (3) 98% PAW+0.2x PBS, (4) 97% PAW+0.3x PBS; (5) 96% PAW+0.4x PBS; (6) 95% PAW+0.5x PBS; (7) 94% PAW+0.6x PBS; (8) 93% PAW+0.7x PBS; (9) 92% PAW+0.8x PBS; (10) 91% PAW+0.9x PBS; and (11) 90% PAW+1x PBS; which is termed bPAW. MDCK cells were seeded (\(10\times 10^3\)/well) in p96 plate the day before test. Next day, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 20 min with 100 \(\mu \)l of each PAW mixture. After that, the protocol was carried out following the manufacturer’s instructions. For CC50 estimation we followed a four-parameter logistic regression model. The calculations were performed using an online tool ”Quest Graph\(^{\mathrm{TM}}\) CC50 Calculator “AAT Bioquest, (https://www.aatbio.comools/ic50-calculator). Values were normalized dividing by the largest response.SARS-CoV-2 plaque assayThe titer of the SARS-CoV-2 stock was determined in Vero E6 cells by conventional plaque assay. Samples were subjected to 10-fold serial dilutions and added to each well. After adsorption of the virus inoculum at 37\(^\circ \)C, the cells were washed with medium and a semisolid mixture of 1% Carboxy-methyl cellulose (CMC) in serum supplemented DMEM added to each well. 72 h later the wells were examined for the presence of virus induced lysis plaques. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution, the semisolid medium removed, and the fixed cultures further stained with 2% crystal violet solution. After washing out the staining solution, plaques were visually inspected and counted in those wells displaying more than 30 lysis plaques. The viral titers were estimated by the following formula: (number of plaques x sample dilution factor)/sample volume (in mL). All SARS-CoV-2 culture procedures were conducted in an enhanced biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL3+). All personnel wore powered air-purifying respirators (3M) incorporated into Prochem suits. Manipulation of live infectious virus was performed inside a biosafety class-II cabinet.Titration of media-treated SARS-CoV-2For most experiments, the SARS-CoV-2 stock was diluted 1/10 in each different media and incubated at room temperature with constant shaking under a biosafety class-II cabinet. Incubation times ranged from 3 to 60 min. Upon incubation, the samples were either ten-fold diluted in DMEM and applied directly to Vero E6 cultures or immediately frozen for further use. Titration of residua virus upon treatment was performed by plaque assay as above.Influenza infection determined by indirect immunofluorescenceMDCK cells (\( 50\times 10^3\) /well) were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 5% FBS (Gibco) supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM, Gibco), and penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep, 100 U/ml). The following day, cells were infected with the influenza strain A/PR/8/34 at MOI of 0.25 for 1 h at 37\(^\circ \)C. Then, cells were further submitted to different treatments for 20 min by using 500 \(\mu \)L of pure PAW and different dilutions with 10X PBS: (1) pure PAW, (2) 99% PAW+0.1x PBS, (3) 98% PAW+0.2x PBS, (4) 97% PAW+0.3x PBS; (5) 96% PAW+0.4x PBS; (6) 95% PAW+0.5x PBS; (7) 94% PAW+0.6x PBS; (8) 93% PAW+0.7x PBS; (9) 92% PAW+0.8x PBS; (10) 91% PAW+0.9x PBS; (11) 90% PAW+1x PBS; (12) mock. After PAW treatment, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 \(^\circ \)C with DMEM supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Then, media was removed, the cells washed with PBS, and fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 10 min. MDCK cells were washed with PBS and then treated with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. After that, MDCK were washed again with PBS and then blocked for 60 min with PBS-tween20 (0.1%)-triton X-100 (0.3%). Cells were incubated with anti-PR8 antibody at 1/300 for 60 min (a gift of Dr. Aitor Nogales, CISA, INIA-CSIC). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a goat anti-mouse A-488 (Invitrogen, \(\#\) A28175) at 1/1000 for 30 min in dark. For nuclei staining, cells were incubated with Hoechst at 1/1000 for 10 min and further washed. Cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope. For each treatment, the percentage of infection was calculated by using (infectedotal cells) \(\times \) 100. Cells were counted using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) and the plugin cell counter taking into account three different fields for each treatment. These data was used to estimate \(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\). The calculations were performed using described above (https://www.aatbio.comools/ic50-calculator). Values were normalized dividing by the largest response.PR8 infection and induced-inflammation determined by transcriptomic profile on MDCK and A549Total RNA was extracted using the FavorPrepTM Tissue Total RNA Mini Kit (Favorgen) according to the manufacturing specifications, performing on-column deoxyribonuclease I (Applied Biological Materials Inc.) treatment to remove genomic DNA that might interfere with the PCR reactions. RNA was quantified with the NanoDropTM. One Spectrophotometer (Thermofisher) and cDNA synthesized using the HighCapacity cDNA reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and oligo (dT) primer. The mRNA levels of different immune genes were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System instrument (Applied Biosystems) using 2x qPCRBIO SyGreen Mix Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems). The primers were used at a final concentration of 400 nM (see Table 2). The running conditions were as follow: 30 s at 95 \(^\circ \)C, followed by 45 cycles of 3 s at 95 \(^\circ \)C and 30 s at 60 \(^\circ \)C. A melting curve analysis was included for each run to ensure the specificity of the reaction. Gene expression was corrected by the housekeeping GAPDH gene. Fold change (\(2^{-\Delta \Delta \mathrm{Ct}}\)) of transcript level for each gene was calculated by subtracting the relevant mean \(\Delta \) \(\Delta \)Ct values obtained in their respective control group. The reported changes in transcript levels are from median values calculated for the whole group that comprised 4 replicates.Nebulization chamberThe Nebulization chamber was made by ION BIOTEC S.L. The chamber is a 12 liters transparent plastic box with an airtight lid, and it allows to observe while the aerosol is introduced from a hose connected to a standard ultrasonic nebulizer for aerosol therapy LAICA Advance Technology Inhalation Series MD6026P. A holder 9 \(\times \) 13 cm for 12 wells with the samples to be treated can be accommodated inside. The nebulizer is loaded with the PAM to be projected and it can produce a fine aerosol of droplets of up to 5 microns in air with a flow of 0.5 \(cm^{3}/min\). The aerosol travels through hose to the chamber where it is deposited on the surface of the samples. The chamber is equipped with four fine particle filters attached to walls that maintain the atmospheric pressure inside but prevent the mist loss to outside. The mean density value of the aerosol inside the chamber is estimated in 1 \(mg/cm^{3}\).Nebulization experiments, Vero E6 cell viability and \(\hbox {IC}_\mathbf{50 }\) estimationVero E6 cells were infected with ten-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2. Before nebulization, the virus was allowed to attach to cells for 30 minutes at 4\(^\circ \)C to avoid internalization. Another set of cells was incubated with the same dilutions and allowed to progress for 5 hours at 37\(^\circ \)C. Ultrasonic nebulization of media was carried out in the previously described sealed chamber for 10 min at room temperature in a safety class-II hood. Upon treatment, the cells were washed and covered with semisolid CMC medium as for plaque assay. Viral plaques were visualized after 72 h and 296 counted as described. In Vero E6 cells measurements of cell viability were performed using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay System (Promega). PAM dilutions were made in distilled water (for PAW) or in PBS (for bPAW). SARS-CoV-2/PAM mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Upon incubation, the mixtures were 10-fold serially diluted in DMEM 10% FBS and added to Vero E6 cell monolayers for plaque assay titration as described previously. For \(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\) estimation we used a four parameter logistic regression model. The calculations were performed using an online tool “Quest Graph\(^{\mathrm{TM}}\) \(\hbox {IC}_{{50}}\) Calculator, AAT Bioquest, Inc (https://www.aatbio.comools/ic50-calculator). Values were normalized dividing by the largest response.Statistical analysisThe GraphPad software (Prism 6. https://www.graphpad.com) was used for graphical representations and significance comparisons.

(Francois Lenoir/Reuters)Social SharingA St. John's exhibition farm is under quarantine after being hit hard by a type of avian influenza that is deadly to birds and has been known to harm humans.According to a report filed with the the World Organization for Animal Health, a flu strain found on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula killed 360 birds on Lester's Farm Chalet. The 59 remaining birds on the farm were destroyed to prevent further spread of the virus.The birds' owner says it's a tragedy for his farm, which doesn't raise birds for human consumption and also kept show birds such as peacocks and Silkie hens."Each one of those [birds] had personalities and we had them bred to be social. They were more than just livestock. So it was a true tragedy and it has affected us emotionally as well as financially," said Jim Lester. "A lot of them were rare breeds or specific types of breeds that we have grown for years."Jim Lester at his farm in the west end of St. John's at 192 Pearltown Road. (Mark Quinn/ CBC)On Dec. 20, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 at the farm.Their chickens were the first birds to show signs of the virus, said Lester."There was unusual mortality in the chickens and that was our first cause of concern," said Lester. The farm contacted provincial vets, who performed post-mortem examinations and notified the inspection agency. "We were fully co-operative because this is a big concern. CFIA identifies it as a high pathogen strain so that was even more concerning."The presence of the virus was also confirmed in ducks and geese on the farm.According to the CFIA, avian flu circulates naturally in wild birds, and the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Europe indicates a higher risk of the disease in North American poultry this year.In a statement to CBC News, Environment Climate Change Canada said it is aware of a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a great black-backed gull collected at Mundy Pond in Newfoundland on Nov. 26.The statement also said samples have been collected from wild birds and are being analyzed.This is a colourized transmission electron micrograph of avian influenza H5N1 viruses, seen in gold. (Cynthia Goldsmith, Jacqueline Katz, Sherif R. Zaki/CDC)Lester said his birds sometimes do have contact with wild birds, which he believes were the source of the avian flu found on his farm. He said their ducks and geese were in an open pond on the farm where wild ducks occasionally land."So that's how we theorize that they became infected," he said.Risk to humansThere is no evidence that the H5N1 avian flu has made any people in Newfoundland and Labrador sick, but it has been known to cause severe illness and even deaths in other parts of the world. More than 700 human infections have been reported to the World Health Organization from primarily 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Middle East since November 2003, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Environment Climate Change Canada said it is aware of a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a great black-backed gull collected at Mundy Pond in Newfoundland on Nov. 26. (Twitter/@Seumas326)A University of Montreal professor who studies viral infections in animals says it's important to prevent the virus from spreading in Newfoundland and beyond."Right now we have a pandemic with more than 40 countries that have reported cases of the highly pathogenic strain of influenza," said Carl A. Gagnon."We were quite lucky because we didn't have any cases in Canada but now we have to be careful. We are able to control it so we have to act quickly and put biosecurity measures in place to make sure it doesn't spread around the country."If the virus does spread, said Gagnon, it could damage the country's poultry industry, but in a notice to industry operators, the CFIA notes that as the infected birds were found on an exhibition farm, it's considered a "non-poultry detection.""As per the World Organisation for Animal Health guidance, Canada's 'free from avian influenza' status remains in place," says the notice."Trading partners should feel reassured that existing measures do not warrant the imposition of any additional restrictions. As such, trade impacts on Canadian industry as a result of this detection should be minimal."St. John's residents have been asked not to feed or touch wild birds around the city, after the discovery of avian flu. (Mike Moore/CBC)Gagnon advised small-scale backyard farmers in the St. John's area to put their birds in quarantine to avoid contact with wild birds."They have to make sure that no wild birds have access to their coops and barns and no members of the public have access to those buildings," said Gagnon.Control zone establishedThe CFIA has placed the farm under quarantine and established a 10-kilometre control zone and enhanced biosecurity for farms within the area, aimed at limiting potential spread of the disease. Meanwhile, after Environment Canada confirmed the presence of avian flu in the St. John's area, including Bowring Park and Quidi Vidi Lake, the City of St. John's has asked the public to refrain from feeding, touching or handling wild birds, including ducks, pigeons and gulls.Lester's Farm Chalet expects it will eventually bring birds back to its facility after a period of time yet to be determined by the CFIA, said Lester."After there is a fallow period with no hosts on site, feathered species, there will be no presence of the virus on site," said Lester. "So we are just sitting tight, and there is no danger of the virus transferring to other animals."Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Avian flu discovered in birds around St. John's, Environment Canada says Discovery of avian flu puts N.L. exhibition farm under quarantineFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Cases like this are extremely rare and the individual probably became infected from very close contact with a sick or dead bird. Experts say there is no evidence of onward spread and all close contacts of the person are being monitored. The individual is currently well and self-isolating, and the risk to the public is very low. Avian flu, also known as bird flu, is a type of influenza that spreads among birds. The UK has recently seen a large number of outbreaks and incidents of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in birds across the country.Human to human transmission of bird flu is very rare.Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people but, again, is rare and requires close, prolonged contact. Officials say the person in question got the infection from "very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time". The virus they caught is the H5 type that is found in birds, but it is not yet clear whether it is the same H5N1 strain that has been causing recent outbreaks in poultry that have then had to be culled. This is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally. Being a notifiable disease, The World Health Organization has been informed.One million culled in bid to halt spreadUK chief vet issues plea amid surge in HN51 casesProf Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UK Health Security Agency, said: "While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that's why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action. "Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely. "We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread."The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: "We are seeing a growing number of cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country. "We took swift action to limit the spread of the disease at the site in question, all infected birds have been humanely culled, and cleansing and disinfection of the premises is under way. This is a reminder that stringent cleanliness when keeping animals is important."Prof Ian Jones, who is an expert in viruses at the University of Reading, said there is no risk to chicken meat or eggs and no need for public alarm.
