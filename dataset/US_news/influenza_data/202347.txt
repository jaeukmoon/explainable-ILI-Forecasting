This study aims to assess the potential impact of influenza vaccination on major cardiovascular events. A search of the medical English literature was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL up to 1 August 2023. Meta-analysis and stratified analyses were performed to investigate specific outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular death, and stroke. Pooled relative risks (RR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the associations. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on a total of 9059 patients, with 4529 patients receiving the influenza vaccine and 4530 patients receiving a placebo. Among patients who received the influenza vaccine, a notable reduction in the occurrence of major cardiovascular events was observed, with 517 cases compared to 621 cases in the placebo group (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55–0.91). The stratified analysis revealed a decreased risk of MI in vaccinated patients (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56–0.97) and a significant reduction in cardiovascular death events (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45–0.98). This study provides compelling evidence that influenza vaccination is associated with a decreased risk of major cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. These findings highlight the potential of influenza vaccination as an adjunctive strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention. Further research and exploration of underlying mechanisms are warranted to elucidate the observed beneficial effects.

There are strong recommendations for influenza vaccination where six months and older people especially adults should be vaccinated against influenza4.Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) including hypertensive heart disease, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation cerebrovascular disease like stroke, endocarditis, peripheral vascular disease, and other related cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide5,6.Differing viewpoints exist regarding the impact of influenza vaccination on CVDs. While certain observational investigations suggest a favorable correlation between influenza vaccination and the reduction in occurrences of cardiovascular incidents like acute myocardial infarction (MI), contrasting epidemiological studies propose the limited efficacy of influenza vaccines7,8,9,10.Consequently, a comprehensive and updated study becomes imperative. This updated meta-analysis seeks to assess whether a connection exists between influenza vaccination and a decreased likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events.MethodsSearch strategyA search of the medical English literature was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL up to 1 August 2023. A thorough review was conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the potential link between influenza vaccination and the subsequent risk of developing CVDs.The search terms were: myocardial disease and influenza vaccines (Table S1). This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA) for its design and reporting (Table S2) (Prospero ID: CRD42023450694)11.Study selectionThe records obtained from the database searches were amalgamated, and redundancy was addressed through employment of EndNote X7 (Thomson Reuters, Toronto, ON, Canada). Subsequently, two evaluators (MZ and MJN) carried out individual assessments of the records, considering both their title/abstract and full text, in order to exclude any entries that did not align with the study's objectives.The studies included in the analysis met the following criteria based on the PICOs:Participants: The patients with a diagnosis of CVDs.Intervention: Patients with CVDs who received influenza vaccine.Comparison: Patients with CVDs who received a placebo.Outcome: Lower risk of cardiovascular events.Conference abstracts, case reports, and studies comparing high and low doses of influenza vaccination were excluded.Data extractionData extraction was conducted by two investigators (MZ and MJN) and recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). The extracted information encompassed various key elements, including the first author's name, publication date, study type, definitions of cases and controls, the number of cases and controls, and the outcomes of the studies.Quality assessmentThe quality assessment of the included studies was conducted by two reviewers (MJN and MZ) using the Cochrane tool12. In case of any discrepancies, a third reviewer (FO) was involved. This instrument encompasses a range of domains, which encompass random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of both participants and personnel, blinding of assessors for outcomes, completeness of outcome data, and additional considerations such as selective reporting and potential sources of bias. Each study was categorized as having a low risk of bias when no concerns regarding bias were identified, a high risk of bias when there were concerns about bias or an unclear risk of bias when there was insufficient information available.Statistical analysisThe combined outcomes were presented as risk ratios along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To evaluate the level of variability among the studies, both the I2 value and p-value were employed. In cases where minimal statistical heterogeneity was observed (I2 ≤ 50% or p ≥ 0.1), the fixed-effect model was applied. Conversely, if substantial inter-study heterogeneity was identified (I2 > 50% or p < 0.1), the random-effects model was utilized. Assessment of between-study heterogeneity involved the application of Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic. To assess potential publication bias, Begg's test was employed, where a significance level of p < 0.05 indicated noteworthy publication bias. All analytical procedures were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, Version 3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ).ResultsOut of the 275 articles initially identified, five studies comprising 9059 patients met the predetermined inclusion criteria, as illustrated in Fig. 18,13,14,15,16. The key characteristics of these selected studies are summarized in Table 1. Among the participants, a total of 4529 individuals were randomly assigned to receive a standard intramuscular influenza vaccination, while 4530 were assigned to receive an intramuscular placebo. The average age of the participants was 61.3 years, and they were followed up for an average duration of 9 months. The majority of the trials exhibited robust practices in terms of randomization, allocation concealment, and masking, aligning with the Cochrane criteria for high quality (low risk of bias), except for one trial (Table 2).Figure 1Flow chart of study selection for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis.Full size imageTable 1 Characteristic of included studies.Full size tableTable 2 Quality assessment.Full size tablePooled major cardiovascular eventsWithin the cohort of 4529 patients who underwent influenza vaccination, a total of 517 individuals experienced significant cardiovascular events, in contrast to 621 cases among the 4530 patients who were administered a placebo. The calculated risk ratio (RR) was 0.70, indicating a noteworthy reduction in risk, accompanied by a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.55–0.91 (as depicted in Fig. 2).Figure 2Major cardiovascular events for influenza vaccine versus control.Full size imagePooled stratified analysisStratified analyses are shown in Table 3. MI occurred in 86 of the 4529 patients who received influenza vaccine compared with 116 of the 4530 patients who received placebo (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56–0.97) (Fig. 3). The RR of developing cardiovascular death events after influenza vaccination was 0.67 (95% CI 0.45–0.98) (Fig. 4). Thus, influenza vaccination significantly decreased the risk of cardiovascular death (P-value = 0.04). There was not any significant association between influenza vaccination and risk of stroke (P-value = 0.7) (Fig. 5).Table 3 Stratified pooled analysis.Full size tableFigure 3MI events for influenza vaccine versus control.Full size imageFigure 4Stroke events for influenza vaccine versus control.Full size imageFigure 5Cardiovascular death events for influenza vaccine versus control.Full size imageDiscussionRevealing a compelling insight into the potential benefits of influenza vaccination, our comprehensive meta-analysis, based on the latest randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, demonstrates a significant interaction between influenza vaccination and the reduction of major cardiovascular events. Notably, patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced a remarkable risk reduction of over 20% in cardiovascular death. These findings underscore the potential impact of influenza vaccination in safeguarding against adverse cardiovascular outcomes among vulnerable patient populations.Mechanisms of the potential relationshipUnderstanding the potential mechanisms underlying this association is paramount to comprehending the clinical and public health implications of our findings17.Inflammation Modulation Influenza infections are known to trigger systemic inflammation, and this inflammatory response may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis and CVDs18,19,20.Immune System Modulation Influenza vaccination activates the immune system, potentially influencing not only the response to influenza viruses but also the broader immune environment. A well-regulated immune system is essential for cardiovascular health, and the modulation of immune responses by vaccination may contribute to the observed cardiovascular benefits18,19,21.Prevention of Secondary Infections Influenza infections can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to secondary infections22. Secondary infections, especially respiratory infections, can exacerbate cardiovascular conditions. Influenza vaccination's role in preventing these secondary infections may indirectly contribute to the reduction in CVDs.Stability of Atherosclerotic Plaques Influenza infections have been implicated in the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, leading to acute cardiovascular events23,24. Influenza vaccination may play a role in maintaining the stability of these plaques, reducing the likelihood of rupture and subsequent cardiovascular complications.Comparisons with other studiesOur results align with the Behrouzi et al. meta-analysis published in 2022, which also demonstrated a decreased risk of CVDs in patients receiving influenza vaccination25. However, a more detailed analysis of the similarities and differences between our study and Behrouzi et al. is warranted.In our study, we conducted stratified analyses based on MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death. This approach allowed us to focus specifically on a population with pre-existing CVDs, aiming to isolate and better understand the direct impact of influenza vaccination on individuals with established cardiovascular conditions. This differs from Behrouzi et al. as we deliberately excluded studies involving sample populations with specific comorbidities to ensure a more targeted examination. To delve deeper into these distinctions, it's crucial to note that our study's exclusion criteria were designed to minimize the influence of confounding factors. This deliberate choice to focus exclusively on a target population with pre-existing CVDs enhances the internal validity of our findings and provides a clearer picture of the direct relationship between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes. While our calculated RR for major cardiovascular events (0.70; 95% CI 0.55–0.91) was slightly higher than Behrouzi et al. (0.66; 95% CI 0.53–0.83), the consistency in direction and statistical significance reinforces the robustness of the observed association. This nuanced comparison underscores the importance of considering study design and inclusion criteria when interpreting the results of meta-analyses in the context of influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes.Implications of the findingsThe observed interaction between influenza vaccination and reduced cardiovascular mortality among patients with recent CVDs is both clinically and epidemiologically significant. Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes, remain the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The potential of influenza vaccination to yield substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality in this vulnerable patient group warrants serious attention from healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers.Clinical relevance and public health impactBy targeting patients with recent CVDs for influenza vaccination, healthcare providers have a potential opportunity to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular death in a cost-effective and widely available manner. Influenza vaccination programs could be tailored to prioritize this high-risk group, thus potentially reducing the overall burden on healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.ConclusionThe evidence from the most recent meta-analysis of RCT data is compelling, revealing a significant interaction between influenza vaccination and the reduction of major cardiovascular events among patients with recent CVDs. This finding underscores the potential benefits of targeting this high-risk group for vaccination. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving this association and to explore the long-term impact of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular outcomes. In the meantime, healthcare providers and policymakers should take heed of these findings and consider prioritizing influenza vaccination for patients with recent CVDs as a feasible and potentially life-saving preventive measure.

Home / News / What is influenza B? What is influenza B? Influenza A and B are both highly contagious. Symptoms are similar: fever, headache, cough, sore throat, muscle ache, shortness of breath, vomiting and more. Author: David Steen Martin; Reviewed by Mary Rademaker, M.D. Published: November 20, 2023 | Updated: September 19, 2024 There are two types of flu viruses that make people sick each year, influenza A and influenza B. Influenza A viruses are also present in animals. Influenza B viruses are only present in humans. Influenza A viruses are more common than influenza B among adults, and it is influenza A that causes seasonal flu epidemics most years in the United States. Influenza B viruses also can cause seasonal epidemics, but influenza A viruses are the only ones that can cause a pandemic, which is a global spread of disease. That’s because Influenza A viruses can mutate — or change — more rapidly than influenza B viruses. Both influenza A and influenza B are highly contagious, and their symptoms are similar: fever, headache, cough, sore throat, muscle ache, shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhea. Untreated, flu symptoms can last for weeks. The flu also can cause severe illness and make some chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, heart disease and diabetes, worse. In some cases, the flu can lead to death. Influenza A is generally considered worse than type B influenza among adults, though symptoms vary from person to person. Most adults have built up immunity against type B influenza. Because they are different, it’s possible to be infected with both flu A and flu B at the same time. Flu Shots and Treatment Flu season runs through March, and while it’s best to get your shot early, the vaccine still can provide protection later in the season. Influenza vaccine is available across Louisville and Southern Indiana. If you think you have the flu, consult with your health care provider, especially if you are immunocompromised. Get vaccinated Get treatment Influenza B symptoms can be severe in children. Children under 5 are at higher risk of serious flu complications. Children under 2 are at the highest risk for serious complications. Flu viruses spread when a person who is infected sneezes or coughs and droplets travel to another person’s nose, mouth, or eyes. Thorough and frequent hand-washing is one important way to protect yourself against infection. The best protection is a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone 6 months and older receive a flu vaccine. All 2023-24 flu vaccines are quadrivalent, meaning they provide protection against four types of flu, two types of influenza A and two types of influenza B. “The seasonal flu vaccine can help prevent you from getting sick and also can be effective at keeping you from developing severe symptoms,” said Mary Rademaker, M.D., medical director for Norton Immediate Care Centers. “This is especially important for those who have cancer, survived cancer or have another condition that has weakened your immune system.” The seasonal flu vaccine allows your body to build up immunity against the flu without getting sick. The flu shot contains dead influenza virus, which activates your immune system to gear up against the real thing if you get an influenza virus infection. Dead flu virus won’t give you the flu, however some people feel sluggishness and other side effects as their immune system activates after the vaccine. It’s important to get a flu shot every year because strains of the flu mutate over time. Getting a shot each year gives your body immunity to the latest strains of the influenza virus. The CDC picks which strains of type A flu and type B flu each year depending on which flu viruses are making people sick prior to the upcoming flu season, how quickly the virus is spreading, whether the previous year’s vaccine will protect against those flu viruses and whether the vaccine could protect against multiple strains of the virus. If you get the flu, your health care provider will help you decide how best to care for you based on test results determining which type of flu you have, your medical history and your symptoms. Some antiviral medications work better against type A flus, while others work better against type B. Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible — ideally within 48 hours — for anyone hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza; anyone who has severe, complicated or progressive flu; or anyone at higher risk for complications from the flu.

According to the World Health Organization, there are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually. Symptoms typically present one to four days after infection and usually last about a week. According to the American Lung Association, influenza is a highly contagious respiratory infection while common colds are usually minor infections of the nose and throat caused by more than 200 viruses. Photo Details / Download Hi-Res Some key flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, body aches, fatigue, and vomiting. Both are highly contagious, so here are some ways to make sure you are your healthiest self this cold and flu season. The single most important way to prevent the spread of infection is washing your hands, especially when visibly soiled. If you are unable to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Hand washing with soap and water for approximately 20 seconds will remove any germs on your hands and help prevent infection. Follow these five steps to wash your hands: Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap, and apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands well under clean, running water. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them. Cover your mouth and avoid close contact, when possible. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose as the flu can be spread through the air and enter your body through your mouth or nose from infected persons or contaminated surfaces. Clean common spaces and supplies regularly to protect yourself and those around you. While many of us still telework, it is important to practice these habits while at home and in person. Learn more about your employer’s safety procedures if an outbreak of flu or another illness occurs. If you begin to feel sick while at work, go home as soon as possible. The Center for Disease Control states the best way to protect against the flu virus is by getting vaccinated. The flu vaccine may prevent you from getting sick with the flu, reduce the severity of illness (for those who are vaccinated but still experience symptoms), and may be lifesaving to individuals you encounter such as children or those who may be considered high-risk. Despite the numerous benefits the vaccine provides, only about half of Americans get their annual flu vaccination. As the flu virus is constantly changing, flu vaccines may be updated from one season to the next to protect against the most recent strain. As your protection from the vaccine declines over time, it is important to stay up to date with the most recent version.

At a press conference on 13 November 2023, Chinese authorities from the National Health Commission reported an increase in incidence of respiratory diseases in China. Chinese authorities attributed this increase to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection which typically affects younger children), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Authorities stressed the need for enhanced disease surveillance in healthcare facilities and community settings, as well as strengthening the capacity of the health system to manage patients. On 21 November, media and ProMED reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China. It is unclear if these are associated with the overall increase in respiratory infections previously reported by Chinese authorities, or separate events. On 22 November, WHO requested additional epidemiologic and clinical information, as well as laboratory results from these reported clusters among children, through the International Health Regulations mechanism. We have also requested further information about recent trends in the circulation of known pathogens including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV and mycoplasma pneumoniae, and the current burden on health care systems. WHO is also in contact with clinicians and scientists through our existing technical partnerships and networks in China. Since mid-October, northern China has reported an increase in influenza-like illness compared to the same period in the previous three years. China has systems in place to capture information on trends in influenza, influenza-like illnesses, RSV and SARS-CoV-2, and reports to platforms such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. While WHO seeks this additional information, we recommend that people in China follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness, which include recommended vaccination; keeping distance from people who are ill; staying home when ill; getting tested and medical care as needed; wearing masks as appropriate; ensuring good ventilation; and regular hand-washing. WHO will continue to provide updates.

By Eric Monticello 22 Nov 2023 Story Topics Flu Employees CSL Seqirus Radha Kadiwar, Associate Director, U.S. Medical Affairs, Commercial, CSL Seqirus, receives an annual flu shot at an employee flu clinic at a CSL Seqirus site in Summit, New Jersey. One way to tell that it’s autumn across CSL’s Northern Hemisphere sites is that in addition to fall leaves decorating the ground in certain locations, you’ll see pop-up canopy tents occupied by nurses and lines of employees in their fall attire. That’s because it’s flu season, and CSL takes it seriously by hosting flu clinics for employees. These clinics are similar to visiting the pharmacy, except health care professionals bring the pharmacy to the workplace for the sole purpose of administering immunizations against influenza. Melissa Troop, Director, U.S. Brand Marketing, Commercial, CSL Seqirus, receives a flu shot. “Flu clinics are just one of many ways that CSL fulfills on its promise to employees and public health,” said Gregg Sylvester, Chief Health Officer at CSL Seqirus, who attended this year’s company flu clinic in Summit, New Jersey, a corporate site for CSL Seqirus. “We want to be a model for other companies by providing on-site influenza vaccination clinics when everybody has a busy schedule. This makes it as convenient as possible, as well as serves as an important reminder for employees to vaccinate their family, too.” Brian Reynolds, Manager, Government Pricing & Contracting, Commercial, CSL Seqirus, getting his annual flu shot at an employee clinic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that that the annual vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and loved ones against influenza, which unlike the common cold, can result in serious health problems, such as hospitalizations and death. Compared to a cold, the flu packs a punch with the potential for more intense symptoms as well. Rather than a mild gradual illness, the flu may come on suddenly and can cause complications such as pneumonia and bacterial infections. Not an employee? Flu clinics can be found at other workplaces, schools and community centers as well. And of course, you can also get a flu vaccination at your local pharmacy or from your primary care provider.

But the future of the virus is uncertain By Hope Kirwan November 20, 2023 Download The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources detected highly-pathogenic avian influenza in two blue-winged teal in November 2023, the first case of the virus in nine months. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service After a year of no new cases of highly-contagious avian influenza, Wisconsin agriculture officials confirmed the virus has returned to the state.The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported on Friday that the virus was detected in a small backyard flock in Taylor County.The last confirmed case of highly-pathogenic avian influenza was on November 7, 2022 in Jefferson County. But Dr. Darlene Konkle, state veterinarian at DATCP, said it’s not surprising to see the virus affecting domestic birds again. New cases of HPAI in domestic flocks have been reported in Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota over the last month, according to DATCP. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email NameThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. “We are seeing kind of an uptick in cases throughout the United States, not just in one specific area,” Konkle said. “The migration of birds has something to do with that as well. There’s just higher populations of birds moving through.”Dr. Lindsey Long, wildlife veterinarian for the state Department of Natural Resources, said the DNR and the U.S. Department of Agriculture take samples from birds for highly-pathogenic avian influenza strains during the summer and fall. She said staff did not detect the highly-contagious H5 strain during summer surveillance. But the agency found two likely cases in blue-winged teal this month and is currently investigating several possible cases in swans.“I think we were a little bit surprised not to see as many cases in Wisconsin this year,” Long said. “But that doesn’t mean next year, there couldn’t be a gene deletion or something that would make some birds susceptible again.”She said avian influenza is highly variable, affecting some birds more than others. Long said many waterfowl carry multiple strains of the virus at low levels without any symptoms.“This particular H5 HPAI is really one of the first times we’ve actually seen avian influenza have significant mortality (in wild birds),” Long said. “Normally that ‘highly-pathogenic’ definition is because of how it interacts with domestic birds.”Because of the constant change in the circulating virus, she said it’s hard to know how long this version of avian flu will continue impacting birds in Wisconsin and around the world.USDA data shows the virus has been detected in 216 birds in Wisconsin since the start of 2022. Before this month, Long said the last confirmed case in a wild bird was in a bald eagle in January.Konkle said she believes the state will see more cases in domestic flocks this fall and winter, in part because the virus is able to survive in cold and wet weather.But whether the current strain of avian influenza will ever disappear from wild and domestic flocks remains uncertain. Konkle said previous strains of the virus have mutated over time, becoming less of a threat. But she said virologists and wildlife biologists are still studying the current version of the flu. In addition to North America, she said the virus is still being found in South America and Europe.“What we’re hearing from the wildlife biologists is that the concentration of the virus or the number of detections in wild birds has decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, but they’re still finding detections,” she said.While most commercial poultry operators have invested in biosecurity measures to protect their birds, Konkle said there are plenty of low-budget ways to protect smaller flocks. She said protective measures include increased handwashing, limiting exposure to wild birds and changing outside shoes and clothing before interacting with the flock. She said backyard flock owners should also only get birds from reputable sources and isolate new birds from their flock for 30 days.

Cases of influenza are on the rise across the country with the number of people visiting hospital with a respiratory illness above the national baseline for a second week in a row, as a map of recorded cases shows the greatest activity in southern states.It comes as the first pediatric flu death was reported earlier in the month, in Mississippi, raising concerns that an outbreak over the winter could have deadly consequences.Newsweek approached the CDC via email for comment on Monday.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in its most recent influenza surveillance report that four percent of flu tests were returning positive results in the week ending November 11, while 3.5 percent of visits to a health care provider were about respiratory illness, above the national baseline. It added that the number of hospitalizations with the flu "continues to increase," with 527 that week.The baseline is drawn from the average number of patient visits with respiratory illnesses outside the flu season.

A map of U.S. states and territories showing the prevalence of people visiting health care facilities with respiratory illness, in the week ending November 11, 2023. Concentrations appear to be highest in southeastern states, Puerto Rico and New Mexico. More CDC It is estimated that influenza can cause between 12,000 and 52,000 excess deaths per year, out of anywhere between nine and 41 million cases of illness. While the flu disproportionately affects the elderly, who are prone to a worse form of illness, the largest proportion of respiratory illness outpatients so far this season have been children aged 0-4.A map showing where concentrations of outpatients presenting with flu symptoms are reveals in the week ending November 11 the highest activity was in Louisiana, followed by Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, as well as Puerto Rico. Walk-in visits were also elevated in Florida, New Mexico and Washington D.C.The CDC said in the same week, of viruses tested for by public health laboratories nationwide, nearly 76 percent were with the influenza A strain while over 24 percent were influenza B.Outpatient visits with a respiratory illness are below what they were at the same point in last year's flu season—which peaked early on—but above the previous four years. Aside from the 2020-2021 season, when coronavirus restrictions largely prevented the spread of influenza, visits have spiked just before the new year and remained elevated through to February.

The health agency did not give the age of the child who had died, apart from that they were under the age of 18."Vaccination is the best protection against flu and the severe outcomes from flu infection," interim State Epidemiologist Dr. Kathryn Taylor said in a statement, noting flu shots were available for children for free."Flu cases and hospitalizations are so high in Mississippi," Dr. Anita Henderson, a paediatrician at the Hattiesburg Clinic, wrote on Sunday. Noting the recent pediatric death, she added: "Please avoid family and friends this Thanksgiving if you are sick and get tested and treated with antivirals if you are positive."Medical experts previously told Newsweek that the risk of viral infection is highest in newborns and younger babies and urged parents with young children to take appropriate precautions when meeting family over the holiday season.

Share Japan Detects Season's First Bird Flu Case, Will Cull 40,000 Birds, Report Says share Print TOKYO — Japan detected the first case of highly pathogenic H5-type bird flu this season at a poultry farm in the south of the country, public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday. The local government in Saga prefecture will cull about 40,000 birds on the farm, NHK said, citing agriculture ministry officials it did not name. Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment outside of business hours. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida will convene relevant Cabinet ministers to discuss measures to prevent spreading of the virus, NHK said. The virus was detected as a result of genetic testing conducted after some poultry birds were found dead at the farm on Friday, the report said. Highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread around the globe in recent years, leading to the culling of hundreds of millions of birds. In Japan a record 17.7 million poultry birds were culled last season, prompting the authorities to stay on high alert.

CDC considers the current risk to the general public from the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in wild birds and poultry to be low. Due to the die-off of wild geese in our area, we are reminding our residents and visitors to do the following: -As a general precaution, whenever possible people should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance. -Wild birds can be infected with avian (bird) influenza (flu) A viruses even if they don’t look sick. -Avoid unprotected contact with domestic birds (poultry) that look sick or have died. -Do not touch surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. -If you do come into contact with contaminated surfaces, birds or bird fecal material, wash your hands immediately and thoroughly. Learn More Learn More The best way to prevent avian (bird) influenza (flu) is to avoid sources of exposure whenever possible. Infected birds shed bird flu virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. People rarely get bird flu; however, human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes or nose. Bird flu virus infections in people happen most often after close, prolonged and unprotected (no gloves or other protective wear) contact with infected birds and then the person touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.To learn more about highly pathogenic avian influenza, please click on the following link: www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/prevention.htm#:~:text=Avoid%20touching%20your%20mouth%2C%20nose,and%20after%20handling%20wild%20birds.

(Valley News Live) - 22-year-old Jackson Allard of Fargo is fighting for his life, according to a GoFundMe page. Jackson is currently at the University of Minnesota, on life support, after he was diagnosed with a rare form on Influenza and double pneumonia back in October. Now, the page says the only hope of survival for Jackson, is a double lung transplant.The page, arranged by a family friend, says Jackson went to a clinic on October 18th with stomach issues. The page says Jackson was admitted because of low oxygen levels, and later tested positive with Influenza 4 and double pneumonia. On October 18th, Jackson was placed on life support and transferred to the University of Minnesota.Jackson has been featured several times on Posh Boutique Fargo’s Facebook page, selling Minky Blankets for his mom and grandmother’s business. A post made to the Facebook page on Monday, October 23rd says Jackson’s pneumonia was complicated by his vaping, making it harder for him to recover.You can find a link to Jackson’s GoFundMe page here.Copyright 2023 KVLY.

(photo credit: REUTERS/PETER NICHOLLS) A new variant of the H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been spotted in the Netherlands, the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Institute at Wageningen University reported on Thursday.The variant was spotted in Renswoude in the central Netherlands. It is similar to other versions of the H5N1 subtype that has been spreading in Europe and the Americas since 2021, but includes a new version of the PB1 gene segment in the virus. The new PB1 segment seems to be the result of the virus mixing with a low pathogenic version of avian influenza, according to the research institute.The new variant has also been spotted in several dead wild ducks and geese found in the Netherlands since November. It is unclear as of yet if the reassortment of the PB1 segment has changed any properties of the virus, such as pathogenicity, transmissibility, severity, etc. The discovery of the new variant comes as avian influenza continues to spread across the Americas, Europe, and other locations around the world in a global outbreak that has continued almost without pause since 2021. The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals worldwide.

The more the virus is allowed to circulate, the more it's allowed to evolve and change."The H5N1 has caused such widespread mortality that I think we can pretty confidently say that within living memory, no avian influenza has affected wild birds in the same capacity," she said.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags agriculture Virus bird flu Birds Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

China has been experiencing an increase in cases of influenza-like illnesses compared with the same period in the previous three years when strict measures were in force as part of its zero-COVID strategy. That policy was abruptly abandoned in December 2022. The WHO noted that China’s National Health Commission told a press conference earlier this month that there had been an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, attributing them to the lifting of COVID-19 measures and the spread not only of COVID-19 but pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection which typically affects younger children), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Earlier this week, ProMED, an online medical community that raised questions in late 2019 about an unknown illness circulating in Wuhan that later became COVID-19, noted a growing number of media reports of clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China. FTV News, a Taiwanese media outlet, reported that children’s hospitals in Beijing, Liaoning and other places in the north were “overwhelmed with sick children” and parents were questioning whether the authorities were “covering up an epidemic”. ProMED said more definitive information on the “concerning illness” was needed. The UN agency said it held a teleconference with Chinese health officials on Thursday, during which the data it requested were provided. Those showed an increase in hospital admissions of children due to diseases including bacterial infection, RSV, influenza and common cold viruses since October. “No changes in the disease presentation were reported by the Chinese health authorities,” the WHO said. It added that Chinese officials said the spike in patients had not overloaded the country’s hospitals. The WHO urged people in China to take steps to reduce their risk of contracting a respiratory infection including updating vaccinations, maintaining a distance from other people, wearing masks when necessary and staying at home when sick. Testing was also important, it said. The first cases of what turned out to be COVID-19 were reported as unexplained pneumonia in late 2019 with the first death from the disease in January 2020 the same month that China shared publicly the genetic sequence of COVID-19. “Deeply concerned” by the rapid spread and severity of the virus as well as by “the alarming levels of inaction“, the WHO declared a pandemic in March 2020. A WHO team finally visited Wuhan to investigate the outbreak in early 2021, but the origins of the virus remain unclear.

The synthesized compounds were tested for their potential inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in BHK-21-hACE2 cells and influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 (H1N1) virus in MDCK cell culture. Compounds 6, 8 and 19 showed significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus activity with EC50 value of 3.20-11.13 µM, which is comparable to the positive control amodiaquine (EC50 3.17 µM). Among them, 28-O-imidazolyl-azepano-betulin 6 and C3-hydroxymethylene-amino-glycyrrhetol-11,13-diene 19 were identified as the lead compounds with SI values of 7 and 10. The binding mode of compound 6 into the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB code: 7DK3) by docking and molecular dynamics simulation was investigated.

Even still, the public health, societal, and economic impact may be felt for years to come. The risk of another pandemic occurring in the next few decades is ever-present and potentially increasing due to trends such as urbanization and climate change. While it is difficult to predict the next pandemic pathogen threat, making reasonable assumptions today and evaluating prior efforts to plan for and respond to disease outbreaks and pandemics may enable a more proactive, effective response in the future. Lessons from the COVID-19 response and pandemic influenza preparedness underscore the importance of strengthening surveillance systems, investing in early-stage research on pandemic pathogens and development of platform technologies, and diversifying response plans across a range of tactics to enable earlier access to safe and effective interventions in the next pandemic. Further, sustaining the robust vaccine manufacturing capacity built because of COVID-19 will keep it ready for rapid response in the future. These actions will not be successful without improved global coordination and collaboration. Everyone, including the biopharmaceutical industry, has a role to play in pandemic preparedness, and working together will ensure that the most lives are saved in the next pandemic.

As of August 2023, COVID-19 has infected over 770 million people and resulted in over 6.9 million reported deaths globally1, although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates mortality could be much higher based on global excess mortality2. It has contributed to a reduction in global life expectancy; in the United States alone, life expectancy fell by an estimated 1.8 years, with a disproportionate drop among racial minorities. Many of those infected with COVID-19 still suffer from long-term COVID, with symptoms remaining months after the initial illness3.More broadly, COVID-19 led to substantial indirect health effects. Mental health declined worldwide, with a 25% increase in the global prevalence of anxiety and depression in the first year of the pandemic4. Disruptions to routine immunization programs in at least 68 countries affected more than 80 million children worldwide, likely resulting in higher rates of vaccine-preventable diseases5,6. Delays and avoidance of medical care contributed to more severe observed health outcomes; for example, delayed cancer screening and treatment have resulted in increased cancer mortality rates7. Beyond direct and indirect health effects, the pandemic challenged conventions around how people learn, work, and play. For example, delivering quality education virtually posed a challenge in some parts of the world, while in other parts of the world, formal education stopped altogether, setting back learning and development for an entire generation of children8,9,10. The negative health and societal impacts of COVID-19 may be felt for years to come. Unfortunately, many of these statistics and estimates will likely increase in magnitude with post-pandemic analyses, and as of the date of this publication, the entirety and extent of the pandemic’s impact are still not known.The resulting global economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were also unprecedented and may continue for years. Across countries, gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2–4% in 2020, and the US had the worst contraction in national GDP since World War II11,12. This decline pales in comparison to the global economic losses extending through to 2024 which are estimated to be $13.8 trillion13. The effect on productivity and livelihood left governments around the world juggling priorities to quickly implement response initiatives.Despite major economic shocks, the economic burden of the pandemic may have been worse if not for at least some prior spending on pandemic preparedness and response tactics. For example, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) spent $17.2 billion in vaccine technology research—more than $500 million toward mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle vaccines—before 2020 with specific attention to diseases with pandemic potential14. These early initiatives set some of the foundational work on which new COVID-19 vaccine candidates were based. However, even with these investments, a report by a WHO-established panel found that on the whole, investment in pandemic preparedness before COVID-19 was inadequate, prompting efforts to revisit how the world prepares for the next pandemic, an ongoing risk15.The risk of another pandemicSmaller-scale outbreaks or large-scale pandemics related to emerging infectious diseases have increased over the past century, and are projected to do so over time16. Evidence suggests the probability of another pandemic occurring within one’s lifetime is roughly 17% and may even grow to 44% within the next couple decades17. This means that in any given year, the chance of another pandemic occurring is over 2%17. Yet, it is difficult to determine exactly what pathogen will cause the next pandemic.Most emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential are initially transmitted from animals to humans—zoonotic spillover—and those that have or evolve the ability to move from human to human have the potential to become dangerous18. In fact, zoonotic spillover has likely been the trigger for most of the viral pandemics in the 20th century19. Meanwhile, societal trends are increasing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover. Urbanization and habitat destruction are placing humans and animals in closer contact, giving pathogens more opportunities to migrate to humans20. Climate change is also altering animal habitats and forcing them to migrate to new territories, causing many species to meet for the first time20. Pathogens may travel between several animal species before reaching humans; therefore, novel species interactions driven by climate change also increase the risk of zoonotic spillover20.Under the right circumstances, a newly emerged pathogen can grow from a disease outbreak to pandemic proportions. The balance of a pathogen’s characteristics, including transmissibility, case fatality rate, replication rate, and mutability—among other factors—will influence the likelihood of becoming a widespread pandemic21. For example, pathogens with a higher case fatality rate and lower transmissibility, combined with pronounced symptomology (e.g., Ebola), are more likely to be more limited in geographic footprint. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 had comparably moderate case fatality, and higher transmissibility through airborne transmission and asymptomatic spread, which led to an exponential growth in the number of infections. Additionally, societal trends that increase connectiveness between countries, like globalization and travel, can further accelerate the spread of high-risk pathogens20. Lastly, high pathogen mutation rates—as seen in particular with RNA viruses—also contribute to a greater risk because random mutations are a source of potential adaptations that benefit the virus. Altogether, given their high mutation rates and transmissibility, evidence suggests the next pandemic will likely be a respiratory RNA virus like a coronavirus or influenza (flu) virus, though the threat from other pathogen types remains22.This perspective discusses the current state of preparations for the next pandemic considering key lessons learned from the COVID-19 response and pandemic influenza preparedness, with a particular focus on vaccines. While it is difficult to predict the type and magnitude of the next pandemic pathogen threat, making reasonable assumptions today may enable a more effective response in the future. As with COVID-19, the world may once again rely heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) amid a disease outbreak, and it may need to deploy stockpiled medical countermeasures—or quickly develop and manufacture new interventions. Observations about past pandemic response and preparedness can guide proactive actions now, which may increase the world’s success in preventing or taming the next pandemic—an ongoing and potentially increasing threat.What happened during COVID-19?Although the health and economic impact of COVID-19 was immense, it could have been far worse had it not been for modern technology (Fig. 1). Historically, pandemics have, at times, reached extraordinary scales; 200 million people died during the bubonic plague between 1346 and 1353, and up to 50 million people died during the 1918 influenza pandemic23. While these pathogens differ from SARS-CoV-2 in virulence and transmissibility, they illustrate the potential scale of what can happen without the rapid availability of effective treatments and vaccines.Fig. 1: Examples of death tolls from historic epidemics or pandemics.Death tolls of major epidemics or pandemics in the last millennia are signified by circle size. Different interventions (triangles) were used during each pandemic, and advancements in intervention strategies likely reduced death tolls significantly, especially during COVID-19.Full size imageSimilar to some historic epidemics and pandemics, targeted vaccines and therapeutics were not available during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic24. As such, NPIs including lockdowns, social-distancing measures, and mask mandates became priority measures in the early response. NPI implementation and severity differed across the globe but generally included public information campaigns, school and workplace closures, bans on public events, domestic and international travel restrictions, quarantines, and stay-at-home orders25. These interventions also played a critical role in reducing disease spread and preserving hospital capacity25,26,27.In addition to NPIs, the development of new medical countermeasures, including vaccines, was critical to the COVID-19 pandemic response. Countries and multilateral organizations quickly took varying approaches to funding vaccine development, manufacturing, and procurement. Negotiations among manufacturers, governments, and multilaterals ensued even before COVID-19 vaccines were known to be successful. By mid-2020, the US government’s Operation Warp Speed had contracted numerous manufacturers to support research, development, and product procurement across a variety of technologies28. Similarly, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) invested in a diverse portfolio of vaccine technologies. The European Commission secured a number of advanced agreements for specific technologies, but it faced challenges to do so quickly given representation across 27 sovereign states with different budgets and risk tolerances29. Altogether, governments and multilateral organizations spent billions on medical countermeasures, though early investments represented just a fraction of spending on the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, government spending to shore up the US economy exceeded $5 trillion while vaccines and treatments made up about 2% of total spending30.Fortunately, safe, and effective vaccines and treatments were quickly developed and given emergency authorization to begin addressing the burden of COVID-19. The first vaccines were developed in approximately nine months, and to date, more than 13 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered1,31. The speed of vaccine availability was thanks in-part to flexible strategies used across sectors, including the issuance of emergency approvals by regulatory authorities. For example, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)—the first stringent regulatory authority to issue an emergency approval of a COVID-19 vaccine—relied on a rolling review process, allowing for the evaluation of clinical data as it became available and thus reducing the time to vaccine roll-out32. In fact, this pandemic harbored the fastest response, regulatory emergency authorization, and rollout of a vaccine in history.Thankfully, the rapid introduction of vaccines and treatments helped to reduce morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2, while helping to alleviate costs. Estimates suggest that vaccinations prevented over 14 million deaths in 185 countries and territories just in the first year of deployment33. A recent study conducted in the US suggested that without COVID-19 vaccines, between December 2020 to November 2022, there would have been nearly 120 million more COVID-19 infections, 18.5 million hospitalizations, and 3.2 million deaths34. The recent development of antivirals and antibody treatments for use early after symptom onset and for mild to moderate COVID-19 have also begun to further reduce hospitalizations and deaths34,35,36.Beyond reductions in infections and deaths, research suggests vaccination contributed to major economic benefits. Vaccination may have averted $1.15 trillion in medical costs in the US alone. A local study based in New York City estimated that every $1 invested in COVID-19 vaccine programs yielded a savings of approximately $10 in direct and indirect healthcare costs37. The benefits of vaccination continue to progress as ongoing surveillance and speedy manufacturing support the development of updated vaccines for evolving variants of SARS-CoV-238.While COVID-19 vaccines supported health and economic gains in some places, the pandemic also highlighted the need for strategies to improve rapid, equitable access to vaccines across the world. Higher-income countries had more immediate access to a range of vaccine technologies while lower-income countries faced delays due to additional challenges in financing and operations. The global initiative COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) was created in 2020 to address these issues, striving to provide rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments39. While admirable and justified, such a goal was also incredibly ambitious. As of the end of 2022, though COVAX had shipped over 1 billion vaccines to 144 countries, only about 22% of people in low-income countries had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose40,41.Challenges to vaccine equity in-part underscored risks associated with relying more heavily on single-source suppliers. Despite COVAX’s goal of investments across a range of vaccine technologies, nearly three-quarters of COVAX’s initial supplies were from one supplier in India. When a massive COVID-19 wave hit India in March 2021, vaccine exports were banned, leaving COVAX short 90 million expected doses42. Similarly, Australia had limited access to vaccine doses throughout the first half of 2021, having initially counted on the success of a narrow range of vaccine technologies43. At-risk investments across multiple technologies and manufacturers aimed to account for significant uncertainties on if, or when, new vaccines would be available.In sum, COVID-19 represented a novel global challenge, and governments and organizations took various pathways in their responses, including vaccine development and deployment, but extended to a range of other interventions (e.g., use of NPIs or development of new treatments). These experiences can translate into lessons learned and guide preparations for the next pandemic, but first, it is valuable to assess the state of pandemic preparedness before COVID-19.The focus on influenzaUntil the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, influenza was predicted to be the most likely pathogen to cause the next pandemic due to its high rate of mutation and transmission. In fact, many past pandemics were flu-related; the 1918 influenza pandemic was caused by an H1N1 virus, and smaller-scale influenza pandemics occurred in 1957, 1968, and 2009. Additionally, the World Bank had previously estimated that a moderate or severe flu pandemic could cost $570 billion annually (or 0.7% of global income) highlighting the ongoing threat to global health and economies44.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and public health organizations allocated billions of dollars each year for pandemic preparedness and medical countermeasures. Given the potential societal impact of pandemics, preparations for another flu pandemic have been underway for decades, including a focus on stockpiling vaccine products and therapeutics, forging advanced purchase agreements (APAs), research and development toward novel vaccine technologies, and strengthening manufacturing capacity.Strategic stockpiles are a stopgap in a health emergency, offering critical medical countermeasures when market supplies may be short. The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority’s (BARDA) Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile Program stockpiles antivirals and pre-pandemic flu vaccines using egg- and cell-based technologies, as well as adjuvants45. BARDA has for example accumulated hundreds of millions of prepandemic H5N1 bulk vaccine doses, with multiple other countries having stockpiled H5N1 vaccines45. Stockpiles also extend beyond influenza; Gavi in partnership with UNICEF has routinely stockpiled Ebola vaccines46. Another example includes the stockpiling of smallpox vaccines, which were quickly distributed amid a 2022 outbreak of monkeypox47. If a pathogen with an outbreak or pandemic potential emerges that closely aligns with a stockpile, it can be quickly distributed to protect the population or provide some level of protection before more tailored interventions are developed if they are necessary. For that reason, stockpiles are one of a set of tools used for pandemic preparedness. One of the limitations of stockpiling is the short shelf life of some products leading to significant financial and material wastage. An additional consideration is that maintaining stockpiles requires stringent inventory management and replenishment. The rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants every year demonstrates the speed at which pathogen evolution can occur, potentially making stockpiles outdated.In the case where the next pathogen to cause an outbreak or pandemic is not adequately addressed with stockpiled products, new or updated vaccines will need to be quickly manufactured as was the case with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. A limiting factor is that some current production processes for influenza vaccines require several time-consuming steps. As per current egg-based manufacturing practices, viral flu vaccines are developed by isolating a new virus strain, growing it in a seed stock, propagating it, and inactivating and purifying it—a process that may take 5–6 months—all before distribution48,49. Even still, as the 2009 pandemic showed, the H1N1 influenza virus did not grow well in egg-based medium, the most widely used influenza vaccine technology at the time, contributing to further delays50,51.Given these limitations, research and development has focused on vaccine technology innovation for influenza. A more reliable vaccine technology would lessen the health and economic impact of a pandemic by virtue of an earlier, potentially more effective intervention to slow the spread and health burden of the virus. For example, BARDA supported the development of recombinant influenza vaccines with the goal of reducing the time to vaccine availability in the event of an influenza pandemic, while investments in adjuvants aimed to allow for lower antigen dosing and therefore potentially more supply52,53,54. Recombinant technology and adjuvants were leveraged amid the range of COVID-19 vaccine candidates that arose after the pandemic declaration55. In the future, having both existing stockpiles and a fast, reliable—but also flexible—vaccine development process would ensure a more comprehensive level of protection in the event of another pandemic.Pandemic preparations also extend to the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines. Global manufacturing capacity at any point in time is finite, so it is important to create plans for adequate and thoughtful production and distribution. As previously mentioned, governments and organizations have forged APAs with vaccine manufacturers to prioritize available manufacturing capacity and ensure access once vaccines are available. APAs are agreements to purchase products not yet available, or reserve manufacturing capacity in the case of a disease outbreak, even if the products or capacity are no longer needed by the time they are produced. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, APAs were in place to ensure access to products once a pandemic was declared, while further sustaining manufacturing capacity for emergency use before the pandemic phase56.APAs mitigate the risk manufacturers take on when they produce a new vaccine, increasing the likelihood that doses will be available early in a pandemic56. Unfortunately, manufacturers may still be limited by slow vaccine production processes. Additionally, APAs may not adequately address issues around vaccine equity. The reservation of supplies by high-income countries with APAs during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic limited initial vaccine orders for lower-income countries and countries without APAs56. These limitations underscore the need to reform the design of APAs to prioritize equitable access in a timely manner and invest in vaccine discovery platforms for more rapid vaccine manufacturing.As an alternative to relying on de novo vaccine development and manufacturing, governments and multilateral organizations have explored the development of “universal” vaccines, though these technologies may be years away. A universal influenza vaccine is one that provides at least partial cross-protection against all influenza strains and variants, even ones that have yet to emerge, thereby potentially preventing severe disease and protecting health systems from being overwhelmed before more strain-specific vaccines become available. Vaccine candidates may target conserved epitopes of influenza viruses that may theoretically be able to provide universal protection against both seasonal and pandemic flu strains. Such a strategy could effectively prevent or mitigate influenza-caused pandemics. To date, no single approach has been successful in late-stage clinical trials. Clinical data for available universal vaccine candidates suggest that these vaccines may not achieve the levels of efficacy needed to control an influenza pandemic49. While pursuits toward a universal vaccine continue, a variety of pandemic preparedness and response tactics for influenza, as previously highlighted, must be considered.Stockpiling, rapid manufacturing through new technologies, and APAs exemplify some of the central approaches to pandemic preparedness today, beyond conducting research and developing pandemic-focused products. These strategies have their individual advantages and limitations, but with robust investment and thoughtful planning, can be improved and leveraged in the next pandemic. Because pandemic preparedness largely focused on influenza before the COVID-19 pandemic, many available interventions were not relevant to the COVID-19 response. Moving forward, broader pathogen-inclusive thinking is warranted when considering relevant preparedness tactics, including stockpiled products and vaccine development and manufacturing technologies. Recognizing that a proactive approach will benefit future populations, it is essential to use lessons learned focused on influenza in the past—as well as the COVID-19 pandemic response—to enhance strategies for pandemic preparedness.Lessons from COVID-19 and pandemic influenzaPandemic preparedness requires comprehensive thinking, from the earliest stages of research to enable effective development of countermeasures, to monitoring pandemic threats, and to coordination of pandemic response efforts in real-time. The time for action is during non-pandemic times, enabling a more effective response in an emergency. While this article highlights lessons specific to pandemic preparedness, many of the recommendations may also apply to local, regional, and global responses to other health emergencies, from smaller-scale disease outbreaks and biosecurity threats to weather-related catastrophes (Table 1).Table 1 Lessons learned to improve pandemic preparedness.Full size tableLesson #1: Prioritize early-stage R&D and platform technologiesEarly-stage research and platform technology approaches enable earlier access to vaccines and treatments. The biggest turning point during the COVID-19 crisis was the deployment of vaccines; and vaccines using novel platform technologies, like mRNA and adenovirus platforms, were among the fastest to be developed and authorized. Technology platforms are frameworks that allow the development of new vaccines without customizing the process, allowing for rapid production of multiple vaccines from a single system. The speed and flexibility of vaccine platforms contributed to reducing overall morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, which eventually lowered reliance on NPIs to slow disease spread35,36. The earlier a vaccine is made available in a pandemic, likely the more favorable the outcome33.Thus, world leaders have set ambitious goals to respond more swiftly to the next pandemic. The US set goals to design, test, and review a new vaccine just 100 days after a pandemic declaration and to produce enough vaccines for the US and the world in 130 and 200 days, respectively57. Similarly, both CEPI and the G7 have initiatives that aim for new vaccines to be ready for authorization within 100 days after recognition of a pandemic pathogen58,59. Such speeds will require streamlining existing processes, like increasing collaboration and information sharing between government and industry and faster approval processes.Crucially, the mRNA vaccines developed to combat SARS-CoV-2 were not an overnight success. Development of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was enabled by decades of research following the initial production of synthetic mRNA in the 1980s60,61. Equally important, advancements in carrier lipid nanoparticles enabled the delivery of mRNA to cells62. mRNA’s use as a therapeutic has been examined since the 1990s but was finally demonstrated at a global scale during the COVID-19 pandemic61. Importantly, research conducted by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) revealed the spike protein as a target for vaccine development, allowing for rapid production of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-249,58. Further research discovered that the 2 P stabilization of the spike protein was a modification that helps to stabilize the S protein in its prefusion form, which is a target for the immune response and therefore crucial for vaccine efficacy63. The fundamental role of basic research cannot be overstated. The success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines relied on years of progress in basic and translational research on influenza and previous coronaviruses60. Therefore, continuing to invest in basic research, as well as flexible vaccine development platforms, could help to speed response to the next pandemic58,64.Basic and translational research must continue following COVID-19 because the next pandemic pathogen may be even harder to target than SARS-CoV-260. Ongoing research should be informed by surveillance systems that track pathogens with the potential to cause an outbreak or pandemic. Understanding vaccine targets and correlates of protection of these pathogens and generating data may provide the solid foundation of science needed for rapid vaccine development. This process requires continuous funding, yet typically, there are valleys in funding that follow high peaks during a disease outbreak or pandemic. This was highlighted by the lack of sustained, continuous investment in vaccine research following the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, which affected the development of new vaccine technologies49. Commitments to maintain funding for vaccine research from both public and private funds—and an acceptance of funding research with a higher risk of failure, given difficult-to-target pathogens—may ensure rapid development of a vaccine when a new pathogen emerges.Some initiatives are already committed to funding research with the aim of advancing our understanding of various virus families and developing effective vaccines. NIAID, for instance, focuses on studying potential pandemic-causing viruses, and CEPI is aiming to develop a comprehensive library of prototype vaccines against a range of viral pathogen families65,66,67. While these efforts could be complicated and slow given the range of pathogens of outbreak and pandemic potential, early-stage R&D initiatives such as these may provide enough learnings to jump-start future pandemic responses.Further, agile vaccine technology will be critical for the response to any future pandemic due to the unpredictability of emerging pathogens. Existing mRNA vaccine platforms are highly suitable for a rapid response to an emerging pathogen given their proven manufacturing agility and scale, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic68. Typically, manufacturing can commence shortly after the antigen genetic sequence has been ascertained. This could result in both timely and effective responses to emerging threats from influenza, coronaviruses, or other pathogens with pandemic potential. Alongside an adaptable vaccine platform, research should also focus on addressing limitations in vaccine storage and distribution. For current mRNA vaccines, the requirement to keep doses frozen is a significant barrier to global distribution69. There exist goals to develop a more “ideal” vaccine, one which has a longer shelf life, extended durability, minimal dosing schedule, and wider breadth of coverage70.Currently, efforts are also underway to apply mRNA technology to influenza following the proven success against SARS-CoV-271,72,73. But this technology may also hold promise for other endemic pathogens for which vaccines have been difficult to develop or pathogens with significant outbreak or pandemic potential74. Efforts are needed to steer research funding toward a better understanding of pandemic pathogens and vaccine targets; projects such as the WHO’s recently launched process to update their list of pathogens with pandemic potential may begin to accomplish this75.The benefit of vaccine technologies such as mRNA relies on their “plug and play” possibilities to allow for a flexible response in the next pandemic, enabled by research identifying the most effective vaccine targets for a range of pandemic pathogens. Unlocking the potential of platform technologies will require collaboration across governments, multilaterals, academia, and industry to prioritize it. In the future, mRNA vaccine technology will be an important tool among a suite of options to respond to pandemics, one that has already been proven as an effective platform on a global scale.Lesson #2: Bolster pandemic pathogen intelligenceDetecting novel pathogens as they arise allows for the earliest possible response, so surveillance systems should be expanded and more extensively leveraged to better detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks in real time. Sentinel surveillance systems for global influenza—e.g., the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)—were leveraged during the COVID-19 pandemic and could continue to play an important role for SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens. In partnership with WHO, GISRS was systematically expanded to include RSV in 2015 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, and vitally acting as early testing centers for SARS-CoV-276. Strengthening systems like GISRS to include even more pathogens of outbreak or pandemic potential can improve future surveillance efforts. In parallel, there is a need to expand the number of surveillance sites globally; more than 70 countries still lack WHO-designated influenza surveillance centers, let alone broader systems77.Excluding systems for West Nile virus and other arboviruses, no formal system exists to actively monitor a broad range of priority emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, both in animals and humans78,79. For respiratory diseases, using existing influenza surveillance systems to monitor outliers of influenza-like illness (ILI) more extensively, which may encompass a range of pathogens, could also lead to earlier outbreak detection. One study speculated that if such a robust surveillance system were in use, the spread of COVID-19 could have been detected more than 13 weeks before the first reported infection peaks80. Earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 could have led to an earlier response, potentially limiting its health and economic impact.An expanded global surveillance system would also require investment in laboratory infrastructure, diagnostic capabilities, and workforce development at a local-, national-, and international level. Projects such as the Seattle Flu Study and the US Agency for International Development’s PREDICT may provide a roadmap. The Seattle Flu Study, launched in 2018 by the Brotman Baty Institute, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle Children’s Hospital, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is a city-wide platform for the surveillance of respiratory pathogens, as well as pilot interventions81. This platform was used to identify the first documented U.S. case of COVID-19 community transmission in February 2020. PREDICT, which operated across more than 30 countries for a decade, worked from the ground up to strengthen surveillance for both known and newly discovered viral threats. Given lessons from COVID-19, it may also be time to experiment with new models of building surveillance systems at the local level82. Community-based surveillance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, integrated with national and global surveillance hubs, such as WHO’s newly launched Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, could help drive earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases83,84.With information on pathogens coming from surveillance systems, major public health authorities have evolved strategies to constantly evaluate pandemic risk. The CDC’s Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) and WHO’s Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (TIPRA) evaluate the risk of viruses not currently circulating in humans and help to prioritize investments in pandemic preparedness85,86. For example, changes in the viral properties of a particular flu strain may signal the need to assess this strain for pandemic potential86. These tools may guide research and surveillance, while also serving as a forum to share information between scientists, public health authorities, and other stakeholders. They may also facilitate the development of pre-pandemic vaccines; this happened following the emergence of the pandemic flu strain H7N9 in 201348. As in this example, disease intelligence must be translated into action.Furthermore, to effectively respond to newly detected disease outbreaks, sharing pathogen data is essential. Originally established in 2011, the WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework allows for pathogen samples to be shared with companies to support vaccine development. In exchange, manufacturers agree to approaches that increase access to pandemic vaccines, thereby increasing equity in the event of a pandemic87. Efforts like these lay the groundwork for data sharing in a future pandemic, but must not require additional negotiation in the event of a crisis, leading to delays in the development of medical countermeasures. For example, varied national interpretation of the Nagoya Protocol—a supplemental agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that came into effect in 2014—has led to delays in sharing virus samples and subsequent manufacturing for seasonal influenza vaccines88. During COVID-19, China’s sequencing and sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome just days after identifying it was pivotal to successful vaccine development89. Continuous genetic sequencing of the circulating virus then allowed the detection of variants as they emerged90. Sequencing combined with surveillance may uncover the next SARS-CoV-2 variant or novel pathogen before it escalates, as long as frameworks are in place to rapidly disperse this information to the world.On top of detection and assessment, an optimal disease intelligence system would seek to predict the next pathogen with pandemic potential. Vast amounts of existing data can be used to inform decision-making on pandemic policy and response through, for example, predictive modeling91. Other efforts are underway to use artificial intelligence to predict the next pathogen spillover event92. There is an opportunity to test new approaches to predict emerging pathogens using a range of data sources while ensuring surveillance systems focus on threats of respiratory pathogens93. Above all, sharing disease intelligence and data—quickly, in the event of a disease outbreak—can speed response to the next pandemic.Lastly, it is pertinent to assess how to ensure prompt reactions when surveillance systems ring the alarm. In January 2020, the WHO sounded the pandemic alarm for COVID-19, yet few countries responded immediately94. Many of the calls to action by WHO were ignored, such as suggestions to quickly begin testing and social distancing95,96. These delays occurred for many reasons and varied from country to country. Some governments exercised caution to not disrupt their people’s livelihood and economy, and others lacked an understanding of the pandemic signifier itself94.One suggested approach to kick-starting earlier vaccine development is to have a gradient of warnings that separate dangerous pandemics from more manageable outbreaks. This system, akin to the early warning systems used in healthcare and weather-related scenarios97,98,99,100, could be employed for pandemic preparedness. For instance, in healthcare settings, an artificial intelligence platform could help prioritize patients based on their medical needs, effectively managing resources during triage situations100. Similarly, a gradient-based warning system for pandemics could initiate appropriate responses at different levels of threat, with each level tied to specific actions. An early warning or Level 1 may involve increased surveillance and information sharing, while higher levels could trigger more drastic measures like regional shutdowns or global travel restrictions. Low-grade alarms may also result in more active information sharing by governments since an innocuous signal would diminish fears of causing panic and disrupting economies94. However, the success of such a system hinges on complete adherence to the rules it prescribes. An incomplete application could potentially lead to inefficiencies or confusion, but despite this, even partial application of these systems could prompt earlier responses and slow down the spread of a pandemic.Undeniably, the evolution of disease surveillance and intelligence systems is not simple. It requires major investment and coordination across global-, national-, and local levels. The inherent complexity requires cooperation across borders, and strong leadership from global health actors given the need to quickly act and share intelligence globally. Strengthening leadership and funding at the global level may help with coordination, but countries must also commit to sustained cooperation in the short- and long-term15.Lesson #3: Optimize and de-risk earlier pandemic interventionsNPIs saved lives but are not without limitations and consequences. Persistent long-term reliance on NPIs can be challenging because people grow tired and apathetic toward them101. Another limitation is that there may not be, or necessarily should be, a universal strategy for NPIs. Differences in NPI timing, intensity, and adherence showed varying levels of success, demonstrating the importance of geographically specific and informed NPI policies102. Research from countries that imposed lockdowns showed that while NPIs were very effective at controlling spread, they resulted in significant economic, social, and health costs26,102,103. Some consequences were clearly visible, like increasing unemployment rates from business and school closures and the spike in non-COVID-19 deaths due to the unavailability or avoidance of medical care7,26. Others, like the effect of social distancing on the mental health of children and adolescents, continue to be difficult to measure.Beyond NPIs, early action should aim to leverage all available interventions as soon as possible in pandemic response, which may require pre-planning strategies and stockpiling a broad range of essential supplies. While leaders were encouraging social distancing early during the COVID-19 pandemic, US hospitals were already reporting shortages in basic supplies and essential medicines104. Shortages were amplified by supply chain bottlenecks, which limited access to many basic supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline hospital staff104. The shortage of facilities and pharmaceutical glass, especially Type I glass vials used for vaccines, also strained fill-finish capacity105. The existing fill-finish capacity shortages were further intensified by the pandemic due to a shift from vials to syringes and cartridges, increasing the demand for syringe capacity106. In response, companies reprioritized their manufacturing networks to ensure adequate production of supplies such as sterile injectables and PPE. In preparation for the next pandemic, several improvements can be made to ensure adequate supplies of essential products for healthcare systems. Governments and health systems may pre-plan access to essential medicines, hospital supplies, and treatments in anticipation of growing needs. They may also discourage the use of medical supplies, like PPE, in nonmedical settings and redirect those supplies to the most overburdened areas104.Beyond targeted medical countermeasures, NPIs and emergency supplies represent the need to think broadly about what is needed to respond most effectively in the earliest days of the next outbreak or pandemic. NPIs will continue to be an early mainstay of pandemic response, and research has suggested interventions such as physical distancing can be cost-effective107. Additional research may inform the most timely and locally acceptable ways to roll out NPIs in the future. Furthermore, scenario planning may help pre-plan NPI strategies, as well as contents of strategic stockpiles moving forward, employing lessons learned from COVID-19.These actions along with NPIs may significantly curb the spread of a pandemic virus, but ultimately, the earlier availability of medical countermeasures like vaccines and treatments is needed. In the time before tailor-made solutions are available, governments may utilize all available “off the shelf” solutions, including stockpiled products, to blunt the impact of disease outbreaks. WHO, for example, recommends the stockpiling of influenza antiviral therapeutics to reduce mortality in a pandemic87.The response to COVID-19 required a rapid end-to-end response, which may again be the case in the next outbreak or pandemic. COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of diverse interventions—including NPIs and medical countermeasures—across a range of preparedness tactics, manufacturers, and product technologies to help mitigate risks. While it is impossible to predict the efficacy of any single intervention in the next pandemic, planning to employ a range of responses can guard against the risk any single intervention will not work or be available in an emergency.Lesson #4: Sustain and leverage manufacturing capacityNew vaccines rely on manufacturers to make them. Adequate vaccine manufacturing capacity—scalable and aimed at rapid deployment—is vital. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, early surge capacity was inadequate to meet demand, and prior research had already predicted this would be the case108. But since 2020, manufacturers have scaled up to unprecedented capacity. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) estimated that worldwide vaccine manufacturing capacity would reach 12.5 billion by the end of 2021109. More recent data suggests this number will reach 20 billion by the end of 2022110.Momentum is growing to create additional end-to-end vaccine manufacturing capacity in low- and middle-income countries111. Local manufacturing seeks to overcome barriers around unequal vaccine distribution and trade restrictions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The largest barriers for new manufacturers appear to be cost and demand. Manufacturers building new facilities may need to price vaccines higher than global competitors to cover high start-up costs, and institutional buyers may need to be prepared to absorb the premium despite limited financing112. Furthermore, the sustainability of those facilities is directly tied to demand for vaccine production—if demand is limited, local production will be threatened. This has been the case for manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines in South Africa. Despite technology transfer to manufacturers for locally produced vaccines, health authorities reported limited purchasing by African countries given the availability of free doses elsewhere113.One potential solution could be found with international organizations helping to guarantee demand for vaccines to support investments into new manufacturing. For example, the Pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment (AMC) has helped ensure access to pneumococcal vaccines in developing countries by guaranteeing a market for vaccines before development114. Another potential solution is to produce a range of routine immunizations beyond pandemic vaccines112. There are several vaccine markets that currently have high demand but a low number of suppliers, such as measles, rubella, cholera, and malaria112. The suitability of mRNA technology for vaccine development for these and many other pathogens remains unknown at this time. However, if new manufacturers produce vaccines that are needed on a routine basis worldwide, they may sustain their manufacturing capacities despite the potential for higher costs early on. But new manufacturers also need to ensure that there are buyers for these vaccines. Therefore, alone, this strategy is not enough, but with multilateral organizations like Gavi prepared to purchase from these new facilities at risk, along with other countries in the region, new manufacturers would be set up for greater success. International efforts to strengthen routine healthcare systems, including last-mile delivery of health products, and encouraging health-seeking behaviors, could help further build the demand needed to sustain local facilities.Certain countries may also need to further develop and standardize regulatory systems surrounding medical products115. Additional regulatory expertize may be needed because many countries lack robust regulatory agencies, which may slow or limit the development of local manufacturing facilities and their approval or the acceptance of products from other countries. Multilateral organizations and governments are helping to address these challenges with the goal of ensuring biosecurity for lower-income countries before the next pandemic, though ensuring the sustainability of new manufacturing facilities is crucial.Efforts to further localize manufacturing in low- and middle-income countries may take years to build up, so while these efforts continue to evolve, it is beneficial to sustain and use the capacity currently available. Existing facilities can be leveraged as a reliable source of production capacity in a future pandemic if it is sustained over time. Sustained capacity will require regular investments in infrastructure and operations and a trained workforce. Additionally, there will be a need for steady supplies of raw materials to support vaccine manufacturing in the event of a pandemic. Raw materials for mRNA vaccine production have been costly and scarce given the novelty of the platform. Harnessing the major benefits of an mRNA vaccine platform would therefore require careful management of raw material suppliers, at least in the near term. Establishing raw material stockpiles may prove useful in absorbing the initial need during a pandemic. With basic components in place, existing manufacturing facilities can be “warm”, primed, and ready to respond to a future pandemic. Global manufacturers have a role to play in ensuring capacity is allocated fairly, above the interests of any one country. Ultimately, international collaboration will be the key to ensuring everyone, everywhere, has access to life-saving vaccines.Lesson #5: Troubleshoot trade, regulatory, and procurement barriersViruses do not have a nationality, yet vaccine nationalism—governments reserving vaccines for their own populations, leaving limited access for the rest of the world—was a pervasive problem during COVID-19. Vaccine nationalism and a lack of regulatory harmonization slowed the movement of vaccines, health products, and essential supplies across borders. Early decision-making in the COVID-19 pandemic was influenced by national interests, underscored by the uncertainty of a new outbreak. The resulting inequality of vaccine access posed a danger to all individuals as the virus spread across borders. Despite this, many high-income countries quickly developed procurement agreements for vaccines to cover their own populations. Meanwhile, COVAX, as a new organization representing many low- and lower-middle-income countries, faced challenges to begin operations116. Manufacturers honored commitments in the order of when contracts were forged, which ultimately meant many high-income countries had earlier access to vaccines than lower-income countries.Trade and regulatory barriers further slowed the manufacture and distribution of essential products117. During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries repeatedly prioritized their own populations even though pandemics are, by definition, a global concern. In response to COVID-19, many countries imposed export restrictions on essential products. For example, in March 2021, Italy refused shipment of 250,000 vaccine doses to Australia118. When India halted vaccine exports, as previously discussed, it heavily affected the ability of COVAX to serve low- and lower-middle-income countries119. The US and EU also restricted the export of raw materials used for vaccine production119. These issues could potentially be overcome with pre-established agreements for the distribution of vaccines, health products, and raw materials coupled with efforts to ensure adequate manufacturing capacity is kept “warm.” These incidences reiterate a need to not only establish proactive mechanisms that foster a more robust response in the future but to do so in a fair, diplomatic, and equitable manner.Preplanning supply agreements and determining in advance how manufacturing capacity is used in the event of a pandemic can enhance the safety of all countries before an emergency occurs. Establishing agreements (e.g., APAs) among national governments, multilateral organizations, and manufacturers with diverse vaccine technology platforms on how to respond in the event of a future pandemic could support the rapid delivery of new vaccines and treatments and help manufacturers reduce uncertainty around supply and demand. Furthermore, agreements should aim to achieve greater health equity by covering countries across income ranges. Tiered pricing of agreements and early considerations for vaccine donations, along with efforts to reserve capacity specifically for low- and lower-middle-income countries, are tools that may provide equitable access to a suite of necessary health interventions in the early days of a pandemic. This would ensure early access to pandemic vaccines and therapeutics in parallel across all countries.To support preparedness, governments and multilateral organizations should establish sustainable and proactive global funding mechanisms, with clear policies and governance. Efforts are already underway to develop long-term funding mechanisms for low- and middle-income countries to invest in prevention, preparedness, and response. These tailor-made mechanisms may help ease and hasten the initial pandemic response and overcome bottlenecks to financing, as experienced for example by COVAX120.Importantly, global financing and preparedness platforms can also further incentivize local investments and planning, including the development of integrated preparedness plans at the national level121. Experts recommend these country-level preparedness plans should include a focus on allocating emergency financing toward preparedness, in addition to surveillance and monitoring and connection to robust commodity supply chains, including therapeutics and vaccines, among other areas122. By prioritizing health equity goals and creating a mechanism through which high-income countries and multilateral organizations can collaborate on pandemic preparedness, these funding platforms may also further avoid vaccine nationalism felt during the COVID-19 pandemic.Lastly, greater governance and regulatory cooperation, and harmonization would speed up access to new health technologies during a pandemic. Even with initiatives already in place, like the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), COVID-19 caused trade restrictions that led to imbalances in supply and demand across the globe. Countries, multilateral organizations, and manufacturers should commit to building harmonized frameworks across borders that prevent these issues in the future and consider flexibilities including rolling reviews and consensus on the use of real-world data, where appropriate. In addition, pre-existing regulatory approvals for components of vaccine platforms, such as the components of mRNA platforms, may mean only targeted, supplementary regulatory submissions would be necessary in the event of an emergency. The ideal future situation includes regulatory submissions whereby manufacturers could effectively disseminate a robust, standardized data package to support regulatory approvals across multiple markets at the same time. Moreover, thoughtful indemnification and liability schemes could be developed in advance to enable innovation in an emergency. Streamlined, widely adopted efforts like these would quicken global response.Lesson #6: Leverage the power of partnerships to overcome health systems challengesStrengthening health systems may be another lever through which the world may better prepare for the next pandemic. Essential healthcare infrastructure, from service delivery, health workforce, supply chain, financing, and consumer engagement provides the basis through which emergency response may operate. The response to COVID-19 showed the power of international, cross-sector collaboration, as well as partnership across governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector to solve health systems challenges.While partnerships across sectors are not new, the COVID-19 pandemic should provide more momentum to achieve even bigger goals, including new ways of working. For example, Pfizer and BioNTech partnered with Zipline to provide not only financial support but also technical assistance to enable the world’s first drone delivery of COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra-cold chain in Ghana123. Pfizer also collaborated with the Global Environment and Technology Foundation to collaborate with Project Last Mile. The partnership focused on aligning the supply chain expertise and technical capabilities of Coca-Cola, a company whose supply chain is characterized as having one of the widest reaches in the world, with technical expertise from Pfizer on vaccine handling, storage, and administration to improve the availability of vaccines in developing countries. These and other examples show the biopharmaceutical industry can play a role in health systems strengthening beyond serving as only a manufacturer and transactional supplier of medicines and vaccines124.One area ripe for cross-sector collaboration is tackling vaccine hesitancy. Given the wider global availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the primary roadblocks to vaccine uptake continue to include vaccine hesitancy122. In the United States, almost three years into the pandemic, nearly one-third of people are not fully vaccinated for COVID-19—and research shows that hesitancy is prevalent worldwide125,126. The challenge of vaccine hesitancy could continue to limit COVID-19 vaccine primary and booster uptake, but also the uptake of both routine immunizations and future pandemic vaccines.As decision-makers for their own health and that of their children, adult consumers are a primary audience for efforts to increase vaccine uptake. Making routine adult vaccination a mainstay of every clinical visit, beginning with primary care as is done for pediatric vaccination, could potentially help address hesitancy. Public health leaders, governments, and manufacturers may integrate lessons learned from other therapeutic areas as well; for example, making HIV testing more routine in primary care visits has been shown to increase diagnosis and linkage to care. A better understanding of behaviors leading to vaccine hesitancy—and designing solutions to address them—could increase the success of vaccination campaigns in a future pandemic. Multiple stakeholders may all have a role to play, thus collaboration remains key127.ConclusionCOVID-19 had an historic impact that will be felt for years to come, but the risk of another pandemic is ever-present even as the memory of COVID-19 fades. The swift response included an unprecedented collaboration and movement of resources to save lives, develop new systems, and forge partnerships (Fig. 2). These actions were important in alleviating the health and economic burdens of COVID-19, but it is also clear that improvements can be made to ensure readiness for the next pandemic—and these efforts may also aid broader response to other widespread health emergencies.Fig. 2: Applying lessons from COVID-19 to reimagine the future.The number of cases (pink line), number of deaths (teal line), and number of vaccine doses administered (purple line) are all influenced by pandemic preparedness and response tactics. Decreasing the delay between responses and the point of pandemic declaration would lower the number of cases and deaths earlier in a pandemic. Vaccination is a key intervention for this result.Full size imageAdvancements and refinements can be implemented throughout every point of the pandemic response, from sentinel surveillance systems to global vaccine distribution. Investing in innovative vaccine technologies and platforms, sustaining manufacturing capacity, facilitating local manufacturing where necessary, and forming regulatory agreements proactively, will be some of the first steps.There should also be a focus on maintaining global momentum around preparedness and avoiding complacency. Despite the costs of responding to public health emergencies estimated in the billions and trillions of dollars, average spending for public health preparedness in higher-income countries has stayed relatively flat or decreased over time128. Bolstering proactive and dedicated financing for preparedness and working to pre-establish cross-border and cross-sector agreements may also help to achieve greater health equity in the next pandemic response.Interlaced amongst all potential initiatives is an increased need for cooperation in the global community. Each player is part of a global ecosystem, and every type of organization—including the private sector—has a role to play. Protection against a global threat like a pandemic pathogen requires a united front that is built upon collaboration. The risk of another pandemic is ever-present and real, but there can be countless lives saved tomorrow if everyone comes together today.

In what appears to be a replay of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when China showed little interest in alerting the WHO quickly, China’s National Health Commission failed to report to the WHO the large number of undiagnosed pneumonia cases among children. The other striking similarities to the 2019 outbreak are the reportage of the clusters in local media and ProMED, a publicly available surveillance system for infectious diseases outbreaks, more than a month after the respiratory illnesses spiked, and the WHO becoming aware of the issue only through media reports. Finally, like in 2019, the WHO was forced to request China for detailed epidemiologic and clinical information, as well as laboratory results of pneumonia cases in children. One reason for China’s reluctance to keep the global health body informed could be that the surge in respiratory illness was driven by known pathogens, including influenza and common bacterial and viral infections. On November 23, the details shared with the WHO by China indicated that the spike in cases and hospitalisations among children were due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia since May, and RSV, adenovirus and influenza virus since October. While the multiple pathogens that caused illnesses in children this year are not novel nor the clinical presentations unusual, the surge in cases has occurred “earlier in the season than historically experienced”. This could be because it is China’s first full winter season after COVID-19 restrictions were removed in December last year.China has claimed that the increased detection and reporting of respiratory illness in children was primarily due to enhanced outpatient and inpatient surveillance for respiratory illnesses covering a large variety of viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae. But this does not explain its failure to voluntarily keep the WHO informed about the unusually high number of cases last month. While China had reported a Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia surge in October, the reasons for the current outbreaks were less clear till the WHO requested for information. China is duty-bound to keep the WHO informed in time without being asked.

What the science says By Brenda Goodman, CNN 4 minute read Published 8:06 AM EST, Fri November 24, 2023 Link Copied! A pharmacy in New York City offers vaccines for Covid-19, flu, shingles and pneumonia. Ted Shaffrey/AP CNN — With holiday season underway, you may be realizing that you forgot to get your Covid-19 and flu vaccines, and now you’ll be sitting across the table from your elderly relatives. The good news is that it’s not too late to get your shots, but what about knocking them both out at the same time? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this is an option, but should you? A recent study of Medicare claims data found a slightly increased — but still very rare— risk of stroke for seniors who get a high-dose influenza vaccine and Covid-19 shot at the same time. The risk was about 3 strokes for every 100,000 doses of Pfizer’s bivalent Covid vaccine and about 3 transient ischemic attacks for every 100,000 doses of Moderna’s bivalent Covid vaccine. Other studies have not found the same risk, leading the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration to say there’s no change to their vaccine recommendations at this time. Covid-19 vaccines were updated this year to target one strain of the coronavirus rather than two. Beyond that, getting both shots at the same time does seem to make it a bit more likely that you’ll experience a temporary reaction to the shots; the most common symptoms reported in a government study were fatigue, headache and muscle pain. CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told CNN that the most important thing is for people to get their vaccines at all — and that early in respiratory virus season is a good time to do it. “It definitely is OK for you to get multiple vaccines on the same day,” Cohen said. “I would talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner about what’s right for you.” Does co-administration affect protection? But what about effectiveness? Does getting both shots together affect how well they work? Here’s where there might be an upside. A small study presented at the recent Vaccines 2023 conference in Boston found that health care workers who got flu and bivalent Covid-19 shots on the same day had higher antibody responses right after they got them, as well as six months later, compared with people who got their shots on different days. Susanna Barouch, a high school student in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the research, said she thinks that giving the shots at the same time may prod the immune system to react more strongly to shots. “The flu vaccine might have been an adjuvant for the Covid vaccine,” she said. But this hasn’t been the only study to look at the question, and perplexingly, other studies have come to the opposite conclusion or found essentially no difference between giving the vaccines together or one at a time. This is one of the first studies to find that co-administration increases antibody levels, and Barouch says its findings need to be replicated before they’re accepted as fact. ACVS pharmacist prepares to administer a shot of Comirnaty, the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination booster for COVID-19, at the Baldwin Park store on New Broad Street in Orlando, Fla., Friday, Sept. 15, 2023. Pharmacies across the U.S. have started administering new COVID-19 boosters, recommended for everyone 6 months and older by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP) Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/AP Covid shots may slightly increase risk of stroke in older adults, particularly when administered with certain flu vaccines “Definitely, I would say this is far from settled,” said Stephen Moss, a researcher at the University of Michigan. Moss led a recent study that compared neutralizing antibody responses of 53 Israeli health care workers who received their bivalent Covid-19 vaccines separately or with a flu shot. Blood samples from these health care workers were equally able to prevent Covid-19 and flu viruses from infecting cells, whether they got their vaccines together or separately. A study from the Netherlands, published in June, found that antibodies after co-administration showed significantly lower neutralization capacity compared with a reference group that got their vaccines separately. Moss said most studies of co-administration have found either “a slight increase, a slight decrease or no change whatsoever,” in antibody levels, he said. What that means, he says, is that from a broader public health perspective, it’s probably a good idea to recommend that people get both at the same time. “It cuts down on doctor’s visits. It cuts down on the number of encounters with the health care system you have to have. It also cuts down on the number of days you feel like crap after the vaccine. So you only have to go through that once rather than twice,” Moss said. Real world outcomes Reassuringly, a large recent study by researchers at Pfizer, which looked at the health outcomes in people who got their flu and Covid-19 vaccines together or separately, found little difference between these groups.

The study found that rates of hospitalizations, emergency room visits and doctor’s visits were similar between both groups. Overall, the group that got both shots at the same time was slightly more likely to visit the doctor or emergency room for Covid-19 but less likely to need medical care for the flu, suggesting that getting both shots together improved immune protection against influenza infections. So how you get your vaccines comes down largely to personal preference, but Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, says that getting them together makes a lot of sense, especially this far into the season. “I would just remind everyone that a vaccine deferred is often a vaccine never received, because you have to make another effort to go in,” he said.

"Vaccination is the most effective protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death from flu, RSV and COVID-19 infections, and there is still time to protect children this respiratory virus season."Five adult flu-associated deaths have already been reported in North Carolina this season. The state reported the first two adults had died during the third and fourth weeks of October due to complications with influenza.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one other state has reported a pediatric flu death as of Nov. 11, 2023.FAQ: What you need to know about the 2023 COVID vaccine, flu & RSV vaccinesFlu vaccinations are especially important for children who are at higher risk of developing severe disease or complications, including those younger than 5 years old, especially under 2 years, or those with chronic health problems like asthma, diabetes or a weakened immune system.The CDC recommends all children aged 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine. The CDC also recommends everyone age 5 years and older should get one dose of an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Children ages 6 months to 4 years old need multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccines to be up to date, including at least one dose of an updated vaccine.Parents should talk with their health care provider about options to protect infants from severe RSV disease, including vaccines for pregnant women during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancyMore On This State announces first two reported flu-related deaths of the 2023-24 seasonnull MINS AGO 2 more NC flu deaths bring season total to 7null MINS AGOrelatedflu deathchild deathfluTrending Southern Pines woman drives around barricades on I-40, dies near NC-Tennessee line18 MINS AGO Duke rises to No. 6, UNC falls to No. 10 in AP Top 25 poll No. 9 NC State falls in Final Four rematch vs. No. 1 South Carolina Stolen car crashes into tree after high-speed chase on I-40, juveniles taken to hospital50 MINS AGO South Carolina a unanimous No. 1 in women's AP Top 25, Stanford and Oregon crack rankingsVideos watch · 2:07WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch · 1:21Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch · 1:05:14President Biden and VP Harris participate in Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony watch · 1:27Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 watch · 0:41Mega Millions Drawing•CreditsMark BerginWeb EditorCopyright 2024 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

You’re not alone. ICYDK, the exact time flu season starts changes slightly by a few weeks every year. Some cases begin popping up around October, but the peak is usually from December to February, according to the CDC. And if you’re wondering just how common it is, influenza was associated with nine million illnesses in the 2021 to 2022 season. With that in mind, the best way to prevent yourself from getting the flu in the first place is by getting vaccinated. “The flu is going to start picking up over the next few months, and it's not too late to get the vaccine,” says Diego Hijano, MD, an assistant member at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital who specializes in infectious disease. "The CDC estimates that getting a flu vaccine decreases the risk of flu illness by 40 to 60 percent," adds Shivanjali Shankaran, MD, an infectious disease clinician at RUSH University Medical Group in Chicago, Illinois. "If you do get influenza, being vaccinated dramatically decreases your risk of needing hospitalization, needing ICU care, and death." But if you already have the flu, know someone who has the flu, or just want to have a better idea of what to expect if you get it, you probably have some lingering questions.Below, read on to learn all about the common symptoms, isolation guidelines, and the recovery process, with advice straight from the experts. Meet the experts: Diego Hijano, MD, is an assistant member at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital who specializes in infectious disease in Memphis, Tennessee. Shivanjali Shankaran, MD, is an infectious disease clinician at RUSH University Medical Group in Chicago, Illinois.Common Flu SymptomsAs with any illness, several symptoms are common among most people who get the flu. This includes:FeverCoughBody achesSore throatLoss of appetite Nasal congestion HeadachesRunny or stuffy noseFatigueWhile it's less likely, some people also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Most symptoms tend to start up almost abruptly, says Dr. Shankaran.Flu Isolation GuidelinesUnfortunately, it's possible to not realize when you should be isolating if you're asymptomatic. "You're shedding the virus at the time of onset, but it can be up to 24 hours before you get the symptoms," says Dr. Shankaran. "If you know that you've had a pretty significant exposure to someone with the flu, you might want to consider being careful, and perhaps wear a mask around the house."Related StoriesHow Long Does The Flu Shot Last?Novel Coronavirus Symptoms Vs. Cold And Flu 11 Cold And Flu Remedies That Actually WorkThe general rule of thumb is to isolate until you go 24 hours without a fever without the help of fever-reducing medication, along with improving symptoms. That said, it's possible for someone with the flu to still have a lingering cough after their fever has gone away. "It's better to stay home if you are still coughing and having a lot of respiratory symptoms [even without] a fever," says Dr. Hijano. "If you need to go to work, wear a mask to prevent potential spreading to others." Common Treatments For The FluMany people who get the virus may be asked to stay home, rest up, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and drink plenty of water while recovering. "Adults can use over the counter cough and cold medications to help with symptomatic relief," says Dr. Shankaran. She points out that electrolyte-based drinks such as Gatorade (sugar-free for those with diabetes) or Pedialyte could also be helpful to some people. Some antivirals may help alleviate symptoms quickly such as Tamiflu (or Oseltamivir) and baloxavir marboxil. Both Dr. Shankaran and Dr. Hijano suggest that these medications should be taken as soon as possible. Although, baloxavir marboxil is not recommended for those who are immunocompromised, says Dr. Shankaran. If you believe you need an antiviral medication, call your doctor to discuss your options and find out how you can get a prescription sent to your local pharmacy.When should I see a doctor or go to the hospital for the flu?Considering the various stages of the flu, it can be difficult to tell if you should seek out medical attention. However, there are a few less common symptoms that would signal a trip to the doctor or hospital is needed. These include:Shortness of breathTrouble catching your breathChest painDizzinessNew neurological conditions"[These symptoms] should prompt you immediately to be evaluated on a more urgent or emergent basis," says Dr. Shankaran. She adds that if you're immunocompromised and think you have the flu, you should contact your provider to be on the safe side. If you can get tested for the flu before seeking medical attention, that can also help doctors determine the best treatment method. Women's Health (Mariana Tuma)Day 0 This is the period in which a person will have exposure and get infected with the virus. It's also called the incubation period. "The virus starts making copies of itself and infects the body," says Dr. Hijano. "For most individuals, that will happen in the upper respiratory tract."At the same time, Dr. Shankaran points out that "day zero" can actually be a one to four-day stretch before symptoms start to present themselves. Day 1During day one, subtle symptoms may start to show up. This can look like waking up with a stuffy nose, thinking you're dealing with an allergy, or feeling tired. By the end of day one moving into day two, symptoms may progress quickly or other common symptoms of the flu may show up.Related StoriesThe 24-Hour Flu Has Nothing To Do With The FluWhat Is Elderberry And What Are The Benefits?What To Do Before Flu Season To Stay HealthyDay 2Day two is typically when symptoms have fully kicked in. The infected person will begin feeling feverish accompanied by a cough, body aches, or nasal congestion. As previously mentioned, they may also experience more severe symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. It can be hard to determine if you have the flu, COVID-19, or just a common cold. In this case, you'd want to get tested sooner than later to determine the best treatment method. Day 3Everyone experiences the flu differently, and there are many factors to consider such as whether or not you're immunocompromised or vaccinated against the flu. Someone who is vaccinated will not experience symptoms as severely as someone who is not. Still, day three through five is normally considered the peak. "Patients will still have a fever, aches, and fatigue, and the symptoms would get worse," Dr. Hijano.Day 4While some people may start to find relief from their symptoms, others may still be at their peak. Dr. Hijano points out that there's no way to tell what will occur during the middle stages of flu recovery because of how different bodies respond to the virus. Instead, he suggests that whether or not a person is improving can best be determined on a day-by-day basis. "In retrospect, you'll be able to say 'yesterday was my worst day,' says Dr. Hijano. "You can't really assess that ahead of time. Just know that as you develop symptoms, you're going to feel worse before you feel better. But you'll be able to tell every day when you wake up."Day 5By day five, there should be some signs of improvement in a person's overall condition. "Different people can recuperate over different periods of time, but usually by five to seven days most people are getting better," says Dr. Shankaran. Related StoriesCan You Get A Fever After The Flu Shot?How Long Do COVID-19 Symptoms Last?How Long Will I Test Positive For COVID?She adds that at this point, anyone with a fever, in particular, should start to see their temperature lowering. On the other hand, some people may be reaching the end of their peak.Day 6Come day six, most people will notice that their fever is gone or perhaps showing up on and off rather than having a consistently high body temperature. Anyone with a sore throat or body aches may no longer have those symptoms as well. Improvement can also mean the person is able to breathe better, they've regained their appetite, or their energy levels have returned to normal."You may want to ease into things rather than just going back to a hundred percent immediately because you're still recovering," advises Dr. Shankaran. "You should start slower until you know exactly how you're feeling."Day 7By the end of the week, you should feel up to leaving the house, doing activities, or starting up your normal routine again. There's the chance you may have a lingering cough, in which case, again, you should wear a mask until the symptoms subside. However, if a person is going into day seven and is suddenly beginning to experience breathing issues and chest pains accompanied by a returning fever, it may be an indication of post-flu complications. "The one frequent complication that can be very severe is pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs by a bacteria," says Dr. Hijano. "It involves inflammation of the lungs," adds Dr. Shankaran. "It can be from the flu itself. And some people, after the flu gets a little bit better, can get a bacterial infection following that. In those situations, you would get an antibiotic as well."

Here’s what owners can do By Chris Boyette and Holly Yan, CNN 3 minute read Published 5:44 PM EST, Mon November 20, 2023 Link Copied! Dog owners should make sure their pets are up-to-date on their vaccines, including those for canine influenza, Bordetella and parainfluenza, experts say. Eric Lee/The Washington Post/Getty Images CNN — From New Hampshire to Oregon, researchers are trying to figure out what’s causing an infectious respiratory disease among dogs that has turned deadly in rare cases. The mysterious illness is described as an “atypical canine infectious respiratory disease,” the Oregon Department of Agriculture said in a November 9 news release. Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, eye or nose discharge and lethargy. Veterinarians in Oregon have reported more than 200 cases of the disease since mid-August. Other cases have been reported in Colorado, Illinois and New Hampshire. “Based on the epidemiology of the cases reported at this point, the cases appear to share a viral etiology, but common respiratory diagnostic testing has been largely negative,” Oregon State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz told the American Veterinary Medical Association. In other words, dogs with the unidentified illness show similar signs of an upper respiratory disease but generally don’t test positive for common respiratory diseases. And the disease is generally resistant to standard treatments, said Dr. David B. Needle, a pathologist at the New Hampshire Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and clinical associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. “Fatalities do not seem to be a large part of the syndrome we are investigating, with rare animals developing an acute and sometimes fatal pneumonia after the longer chronic disease,” Needle said. “We think these may represent secondary infections.” Where did the disease come from? Needle said he’s part of a team trying to identify the disease and find common DNA segments by collecting samples from local veterinary clinics and comparing the results. “If what we have identified is a pathogen, it is likely that the bacteria is host-adapted bacteria with long histories of colonizing dogs,” Needle said. An “evolutionary event” like spontaneous mutation or getting a gene from a different source could then have led the bacteria to become virulent, he said. He said researchers have received samples from Oregon and expect to receive samples from Colorado, Illinois and other states for testing. The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has also reported cases of a mysterious canine disease, the lab’s director told CNN in an email. “There has been an uptick in the numbers of dogs with respiratory disease, (coughing, lethargy, fever) and the signs have been persisting longer than a few days,” said Kevin Snekvik, the laboratory’s executive director and a professor at the Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Snekvik said his Washington lab has not reported any canine deaths from the mystifying disease, but said labs in other states have reported a few deaths. What can dog owners do? While the news may be concerning, “We suggest caution rather than worry,” the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association’s website says. While this particular disease is unusual, “Periodic outbreaks of Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex (CIRDC) can occur in a dog population. At least nine different bacteria and viruses have been linked as causes of CIRDC, which is transmitted by respiratory droplets,” the association said. “Infection with more than one bacterial or viral agent is common. Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, nasal and/or eye discharge, and lethargy. If your dog shows these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.” Dog owners should help keep their pets healthy by making sure they’re up-to-date on all vaccines, such as those for canine influenza, Bordetella and parainfluenza, the association said. Other tips include: • Reducing contact with large numbers of unknown dogs. Just like with other respiratory pathogens, the more contacts your dog has, the greater the risk of encountering a dog that’s infectious. • Reducing contact with sick dogs. This can be harder to determine but if a dog looks sick (coughing, runny nose, runny eyes), keep your dog away from it. • Keep sick dogs at home and seek veterinary care. • Avoid communal water bowls shared by multiple dogs.

Email Predicting endemic viruses engaged in an evolutionary battle with the immune system From the Bedford Lab, Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division November 20, 2023 • By R Lex Itâs flu season. Youâve probably already gotten your annual flu shot, perhaps coupled with another COVID-19 booster. For viruses like influenza that causes the flu, updated vaccines are required each year. However, others vaccines can be more of a âone and doneâ situation; after a single vaccine or closely spaced series of vaccines, weâve acquired long-lasting immunity. How long immunization lasts, either from a vaccine or natural infection, can be influenced by how often a virus acquires mutations that enable it to evade immune recognition. âOne of the many ways our bodies fight viral infections is to make antibodies that very specifically recognize viruses that infect us and, thus, block these viruses from being able to reinfect us in the future,â explained Dr. Katie Kistler, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Dr. Trevor Bedford, part of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch. She continued, âat the population level, this puts pressure on a virus to evolve such that it can escape detection by those antibodies. Of course, now the human immune system is prompted to make antibodies that detect this evolved form of the virus, and the virus, in turn, is under pressure to evade these new antibodies. This results in a continual arms race between the virus and our immune system, which we call antigenic evolution.â According to Dr. Kistler, understanding if a virus undergoes this type of evolution is an important factor for âplanning vaccines and public health measures. At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it was not known whether related coronaviruses evolve antigenically, and thus, it was difficult to speculate whether SARS-CoV-2 would evolve in this way.â Previously, the Bedford group found evidence of antigenic evolution in several seasonal coronaviruses which have been circulating in humans for many decades. In a recent study published in Cell Host & Microbe, âwe sought to expand our knowledge of which viruses evolve in this way by comparing the relative rates of antigenic evolution among a panel of 28 viruses that commonly infect us.â These viruses that are in constant circulation are known as endemic viruses. Dr. Kistler explained that âendemic viruses can be contrasted with epidemic or pandemic viruses, which have just spread into humans. This distinction is important because we expect different evolutionary pressures to be at play in viruses that have just jumped into humans, versus those that have been in humans for a long time.â Early in a pandemic, new viruses adapt to their host species, while endemic ones are already optimized for replication and transmission. Graphical depiction of approach used to identify endemic viruses undergoing antigenic evolution. Image taken from original article. Among the 28 endemic viruses analyzed in this study, the authors included fast-evolving influenza viruses and coronaviruses strains and antigenically stable viruses, like measles and hepatitis A. They ensured that the selected viruses had high-quality genome sequences available for circulating strains spanning at least 12 years in order to predict accurate adaptation rates. To identify viruses undergoing antigenic evolution, a type of adaptive evolution driven by positive selection to evade antibody recognition, Dr. Kistler employed a quantitative method which calculated adaptive amino acid substitutions per residue per year. Since, âantigenic evolution occurs through the virus acquiring antibody escape mutations,â it is predicted that these escape mutations will âoccur in the viral protein that mediates receptor binding, which is located on the virionâs surface and is typically the primary target of neutralizing antibodies.â In other words, Dr. Kistler explained, âwe look for an excess of protein-coding changes in the protein that mediates receptor-binding.â Across all viruses, Dr. Kistler analyzed 239 viral proteins, however she said, âwe estimated that only 14 are evolving adaptively.â Thirteen of these were located on the virion surface and were âeither the primary receptor-binding protein or are at least sometimes involved in receptor-binding,â while the rest of the genome showed little-to-no ongoing adaptation. These 14 protein-coding genes belonged to 10 of the 28 viruses analyzed in this work, suggesting that nearly a third of the endemic viruses analyzed are predicted to be undergoing antigenic evolution. However, Dr. Kistler acknowledged this panel is skewed towards viruses that have ample historical sequences available and may not reflect the overall proportion of antigenically-evolving endemic viruses. Consistent with our need for yearly flu vaccines, influenza A/H3N2 evolved roughly 2-3 times faster than the other viruses analyzed. âAn obvious question is where the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 falls with respect to these other viruses,â the authors explained in the article. They also noted the challenge of using this paperâs method for a virus with a short existence. Instead, the authors compared the rate of amino acid substitutions in the receptor-binding proteins between SARS-CoV-2 and the 10 viruses predicted to be evolving antigenically. Dr. Kistler found that SARS-CoV-2 accumulates amino acid substitutions at a rate 2-2.5 times faster than the fast-evolving influenza A/H3N2. While this may sound concerning, the authors point out that we donât know whether SARS-CoV-2 can sustain such high rates of evolution or if the emergence of the highly fit Omicron variant was a one-time event. As to what makes viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2 evolve quickly and others evolutionarily stable, there are many possible reasons. Dr. Kistler explained that some factors influencing âantigenic evolution are mutation rate, mutational tolerance of the proteins targeted by neutralizing antibodies, the positions and co-dominance of epitopes, viral transmission dynamics, and existing population immunity.â While ânot ubiquitous, antigenic evolution is not uncommon amongst endemic viruses and immune evasion appears to be the primary driver of ongoing adaptation in viruses that have been circulating in humans for decades or longer,â Dr. Kistler stated. Because these antigenically evolving viruses âare particularly capable of causing repeat infections and escaping vaccine-mediated immunity,â identifying which viruses evolve this way and how fast they evolve âis directly relevant to vaccine design.â She added, âfor instance, the strains included in the influenza vaccine have to be updated regularly to antigenically match the circulating strains. It is likely that vaccines targeting any antigenically-evolving protein will have to do the same.â Moving forward, Dr. Kistler aims to âexpand this work further to compare an even wider panel of endemic viruses. The pandemic has spurred an increased interest in sequencing the circulating viruses and we hope to incorporate an analysis of more viruses in the future.â This work was supported by Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

HealthNovember 24, 2023Patient and member engagement improves flu vaccination adherence: Three case studies Healthcare organizations often struggle to reach annual flu shot goals, but those that have implemented targeted patient and member outreach have seen improved influenza vaccine rates, documentation, and overall outcomes. Note: At the time of the provided case studies, the UpToDate engagement and education solutions were called Emmi. Despite the well-known and often articulated value of annual flu shots, vaccinations rates in the U.S. frequently hover at around 50% of the population, less than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) advised maximum protection standard of 70%. Pharmacists, providers, and payers in the U.S. prepare annually for vaccine season expecting the typical 50% population uptake of the influenza vaccine that the CDC has tracked. This is generally considered good enough to keep the majority of the population protected and ease the burden on the healthcare system. Because the CDC estimates adults aged 65 and above account for 70-85% of seasonal flu-related deaths and 50-70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations, it especially important for providers and health plans to engage this population during flu season. Closing gaps in care related to influenza vaccines According to the Wall Street Journal, in the decade prior to the pandemic, there were several years in which the vaccination rate dipped below that 50% threshold, occasionally hitting as low as 42%. From 2022 to 2023, Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage contracts saw performance related to annual flu vaccines drop nearly a point. The Hill tracked flu vaccinations from 2019 through November 2021, and found that child flu vaccinations stayed steady at 40%, but adult coverage across all 50 states and Washington, D.C., saw a notable decrease during that time, with per-state ranges from 18.9% to 35.6%. The reason for some of this decline, according to a 2021 study in Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy, is an increase in vaccine hesitancy in adults ages 18 to 49. Among those surveyed who did not or would not get flu shots, the study reported that about 20% said they believed the shot gave them the flu (despite that being an incorrect assumption) and about 38% said that they did not believe it would help. The researchers posited that those beliefs arose from the participants having been exposed to misinformation and from the individuals’ (possibly faulty) perceptions of their general health and vulnerability. Evidence-based education and non-judgmental professional outreach could be essential steps to re-engaging these patients and members and helping overcome the misinformation and cognitive bias that is leading to increasing rates of vaccine hesitancy. Awareness is key to better vaccination rates National Influenza Vaccination Week is observed December 4-8 this year, and it is an ideal time to focus on outreach, awareness, and education of the risks and benefits of influenza vaccinations. These types of engagement initiatives can: Protect patients and members with chronic health conditions Lower risk of hospitalizations associated with flu Improve overall population wellness These stories of how targeted influenza vaccination patient engagement and outreach show how three healthcare organizations changed outcomes for their communities. Enhancing patient adherence and documentation for flu vaccines Triad HealthCare Network (THN) in Greensboro, NC, was facing challenges scaling their operations to close the gaps in care related to the influenza vaccine due to a two-pronged patient problem: Lack of the vaccine being administered Or lack of documentation of vaccinations administered outside their facility The administration was concerned knowing that the CDC reported: Influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization for children and adults but is a crucial prevention tool for those chronic health conditions. Influenza vaccine lowers the risk requiring a doctor’s care during flu season by 40% to 60%. THN implemented UpToDate® Outreach interactive voice response (IVR) engagement solution to reach out to its population who either had not had a flu shot or lacked documentation of a flu vaccine in their medical records. Over the course of the campaign, 6,737 patients received IVR calls powered by conversational AI. The calls informed patients of the importance of vaccinations and asked them to report whether or not they’d been vaccinated yet. All these responses were recorded by the IVR system and provided back to THN. The automated campaign was cost-effective and scalable for THN, while providing a gentle, nonjudgmental, and easy reminder for patients, underlining the importance of the vaccination. At the end of the campaign, the impact of patient engagement and documentation was evaluated: 34% (2,270) of the targeted patients engaged with the program 53% (1,119) of the patients who engaged documented they received the vaccine Improving CMS ACO rankings through patient engagement Another health system in the Southeastern U.S. was facing a similar conundrum in trying to identify if flu vaccine care gaps were due to members failing to get vaccinated at all or simply members failing to report and document their vaccinations. This health system was also looking to improve its performance in a key quality metric. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality performance benchmarks for accountable care organizations (ACOs) aim to accomplish policy goals, such as promoting ACO participation, developing incentives to reduce healthcare spending, and achieving program fiscal objectives. One of those objectives includes a measure for increased adherence to influenza vaccines. The health system used UpToDate IVR campaigns to contact specific patient populations from two practices within the system, targeting 1,270 patients with missing vaccination records. The program’s messaging was designed to: Improve documentation by offering a convenient method to do so on the call Educate patients on the importance of vaccinations Encourage vaccination scheduling The health system experienced the following results from the targeted populations who had no influenza vaccine documentation: Compliance for practice one increased from 51% to 65% Compliance for practice two increased from 57% to 67% The average compliance for both practices increased from 54% to 66% This resulted in a 10% increase in CMS ACO Ranking from the 50th to 60th percentile Vaccine adherence improves with interactive voice recognition and video education When Centura Health system was looking to improve influenza vaccine adherence and documentation, they wanted to go beyond an IVR outreach program to improve population health year-over-year. The health system has locations in Colorado, Utah, and Kansas and set up a campaign targeting 31,862 patients and members with options for both IVR outreach phone calls and multimedia education by email. Both engagement options offered information about the importance of flu vaccinations, with multimedia, interactive programs from UpToDate Engage providing content in plain language with easy-to-understand visual learning cues, helping to drive patient understanding and action. The IVR calls offered a convenient mechanism by which patients who had already had flu shots could simply document their immunization for their health record over the phone. Centura found the combined program cost-effective and scalable, and the health system observed that patients and members who interacted with the program were more likely to document their flu vaccines: 89% of patients (28,258) had an email address on file and were sent a multimedia program to watch. 11% of patients (3,504) provided both an email and phone number and received both a multimedia program and an IVR call. Increased vaccination documentation – Patients who did not interact with the programs documented their flu vaccine at a rate of 28%, whereas those who did engage documented their flu vaccine at a rate of 35%. Improvement in engagement – Overall, patients who received both a multimedia program and an IVR call experienced a 25% year-over-year improvement in flu vaccine documentation compared to unengaged patients. Combating influenza: Innovative solutions for healthcare providers and patients Member and patient engagement is an important tool in overcoming vaccine hesitancy, and studies have shown that educational intervention can correlate with influenza vaccine improvement. Payers aiming to protect older, at-risk populations may see increased adherence when using an engagement platform. As these three health systems learned, engagement campaigns and scalable outreach can make a significant impact in influenza vaccine uptake and combat declining rates to improve overall population health, protect at-risk patients and members, reduce hospitalizations and strain on the healthcare system, and boost key performance metrics.

Advertisement Flu season is ramping up just in time for the holidays.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shared new flu data, updated on November 17, which showed that cases of respiratory illnesses are above baseline nationwide for the second week."Really what we're seeing is a more sharp increase in activity, week over week, and we know from experience when that happens often times we are entering into that period of even more increased activity," Alicia Budd, the CDC's team lead for domestic flu surveillance, told STAT. Advertisement Flu season has started early this year Both this year and last, flu season started early. Last year it started in October, this year it started in November. CDC This graph from the CDC shows the percent of outpatient visits for respiratory illnesses each week of the year. You can see that visits for respiratory illnesses like the flu usually sharply increase in December and January. But like last year, this year cases started to rise in October and November.So far this year, the CDC estimates there have been 780,000 illnesses from the flu, including 8,000 hospitalizations and 490 flu-related deaths — including one pediatric death.Influenza A strain is currently dominating. This form of the flu tends to cause fewer deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly — one of the populations who are most vulnerable, the Associated Press reported. Advertisement Southern states and Puerto Rico are being hit the hardest so far Rates of "influenza-like illness" are currently the highest in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Puerto Rico declared an influenza epidemic earlier this month. CDC While the whole country is seeing increased flu activity, some areas are being hit particularly hard. The above map shows the regions that are currently experiencing the most reporting of respiratory illness. Related stories Southern states including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina are all seeing high or very high activity.Puerto Rico is also seeing high respiratory illness activity. Earlier this month, Puerto Rico declared a flu epidemic after 42 people died and over 900 people were hospitalized with the flu, the Associated Press reported. Advertisement It's not too late to get vaccinatedOne of the best things that you can do to prevent getting the flu is to get a flu vaccine.The number of adults and children who have received a flu vaccine this year is lagging behind vaccination rates from last year, according to the CDC. So far, fewer than 35% of adults and 33% of kids nationally have gotten a flu vaccine, according to the CDC's weekly flu vaccination dashboard.Experts typically recommend that anyone aged six months or older get a flu vaccine between October and November, so it's not too late to get one. Flu shots offer protection for four to six months, so getting a shot during this period will maximize your protection during peak flu season. Advertisement Additionally, precautions like masking during holiday travel, eating well, and getting good sleep can all reduce your likelihood of getting the flu, as well as other illnesses like COVID-19.

But if you’re traveling abroad, older than 65 or plan to get vaccinated for influenza (flu) and COVID-19, the number of vaccinations you need can feel overwhelming.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat if you could get multiple vaccines in one visit — the old one-and-done approach? It’d be more convenient, but is it safe?Primary care specialist Daniel Sullivan, MD, answers that question and explains what you need to know about getting more than one vaccine at a time.Can you get multiple vaccines at once as an adult?The short answer is yes. “It’s been shown both in studies and in general use that getting more than one vaccine in a day is completely safe,” says Dr. Sullivan.Getting more than one vaccine doesn’t mean mixing all the vaccines in a single syringe and getting only one shot, though. It means you can safely get multiple, separate vaccines during one appointment.Mixing or combining vaccines into one shot is only OK for certain formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One approved combo is HepA-HepB — a single vaccination that guards adults against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.While it’s safe, there are still some pros and cons to weigh about getting multiple, separate shots in one visit. Let’s take a look.Benefits of getting multiple vaccines at one timeOverall, doubling or even tripling up on vaccines offers more benefits than downsides.“If you don’t mind getting multiple shots, you’ll be better off stacking multiple vaccines into one appointment when you can,” Dr. Sullivan says.AdvertisementCheck out these potential benefits of getting multiple vaccinations at once.Increases effectivenessVaccines trigger your immune system to produce antibodies — proteins that recognize and attack a disease or virus.You may wonder if your body can mount an immune response to more than one vaccine at a time. Dr. Sullivan explains that getting vaccines simultaneously is not only safe, but it also may actually make each of those vaccines even more effective.“Getting a vaccine improves your body’s immune response,” Dr. Sullivan explains. “The second vaccine enhances that response and intensifies your ability to react to the vaccine trigger.”He also recommends getting multiple vaccines in the same arm whenever possible. Research suggests it may encourage a stronger immune response than vaccines given in different limbs.“When multiple vaccines target the same local lymph nodes, those lymph nodes produce more antibodies and help your body build a stronger response to the vaccine,” he adds.So convenientWhether you’re due for routine vaccinations or simply want to stay healthy this winter, getting the vaccines you need can be challenging if you need multiple appointments.“Most routine vaccines for adults can be given at the same time,” Dr. Sullivan notes. “For instance, we offer the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine together so it’s easier for patients to protect themselves without the hassle of coming back.”Wondering how many routine vaccines you can get at once? It’s a matter of preference.“Our nurses have given people four or more vaccines in one appointment if it’s what the patient wants and needs,” he says. “Not everyone wants that many pokes in one sitting, but it’s safe and saves your multiple trips to the office.”Downsides to getting two vaccines in the same armGetting more than one shot in the same arm is safe, but it may not be ideal for everyone.Your healthcare provider may want to give the shots in separate limbs if you are:Getting painful shots: TDaP (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) and PCV (pneumococcal conjugate, a pneumonia vaccine) commonly cause muscle soreness and some tenderness at the injection site. Getting these shots in separate arms can decrease your post-vaccine pain.Concerned about a bad reaction: If you’re worried about a severe reaction or have reacted badly to a previous vaccine, it may be wise to get vaccines in separate arms. If you have a reaction, you’ll know which vaccine caused it.Which vaccines can’t be given together?Dr. Sullivan acknowledges that there are urban legends about vaccines that you can’t get together. But most people can get most routine vaccines at the same time unless you prefer to space them out.That is most people and most vaccines can be given in combo.AdvertisementThere are some circumstances that will require you to space things out.Dr. Sullivan explains those situations.People who are high-riskPeople age 65 and older and those who are at high-risk for certain complications shouldn’t get some vaccines at the same time.For example, people age 65 and older need two pneumococcal vaccines, PCV and PPSV23 (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide). But you can’t get both vaccines on the same day.Plan to get PCV first. Then, after eight weeks, you can get PPSV23. If you mistakenly get PPSV23 before PCV, that’s OK. But you’ll have to wait a year before getting PCV.People with certain spleen issues or HIV also have limits on how many vaccines they can get at once. If you have these conditions, plan to get pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcal vaccines at separate times.In general, if you have health conditions or any concerns, talk to your healthcare provider about the most appropriate vaccination schedule for you.People getting travel vaccinesTraveling abroad often requires vaccinations that aren’t routine in the United States. Certain travel vaccines can’t be given at the same time.For example, if you need vaccines for both cholera and typhoid fever, you need to get the cholera vaccine first. You’ll then need to wait at least eight hours to get the typhoid vaccine.AdvertisementPeople getting live vaccinesVaccines use either a weakened (live) form of a disease or an inactivated one. Both trigger your immune system to fight off infection.Live vaccines tend to create a stronger immune response, so you don’t want to get more than two live vaccines at the same time. Some examples of live vaccines include:Influenza (nasal spray).Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR vaccine).Smallpox.Typhoid fever (oral vaccine).Varicella (chickenpox).Yellow fever.“You can get two live vaccines on the same day,” Dr. Sullivan says. “After that, you’ll need to wait four weeks to get another live vaccine. The spacing helps achieve the appropriate immune response.”If you’re due for multiple vaccines and want to get them over with at once, know that in most cases you can. Talk with your healthcare provider about any risks and the most appropriate vaccine schedule for you.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryVaccinesOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsHealth LibraryVaccinesOverviewProcedure DetailsRisks / BenefitsWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsAdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 7, 2024/Primary CareHow To Prevent ChafingIrritation from skin rubbing against skin or clothes can affect your whole body, but powders, creams and even the right underwear can help protect youOctober 30, 2024/Primary CareHow To Get Rid of Fruit Flies for GoodMake your home a no-fly zone by cleaning your drains, refrigerating your produce and DIYing a fruit fly trapOctober 15, 2024/Skin Care & BeautyBiotin Side Effects: What’s the Risk?Taking supplements with biotin can cause inaccurate lab test resultsOctober 14, 2024/DigestiveIs Acetaminophen Safe To Take When You’re Drinking?The answer depends on both dosage and drinking habitsSeptember 17, 2024/WellnessIs Kratom Safe To Use?The herbal supplement continues to be sold amidst warnings about health risksSeptember 9, 2024/Primary Care6 Signs You May Be Iron-DeficientExperiencing constant fatigue, shortness of breath and chills could all be signs of low ironAugust 28, 2024/Primary Care7 Common Causes of Cold SweatsIt can be a warning sign of low blood sugar or something more serious like a heart attackAugust 22, 2024/Brain & Nervous SystemHow To Live Your Best Life With Tardive DyskinesiaHealthy habits and a comfortable daily routine may make your TD symptoms more manageableTrending TopicsEar, Nose & ThroatHome Remedies for an Ear Infection: What To Try and What To AvoidNot all ear infections need antibiotics — cold and warm compresses and changing up your sleep position can helpNutrition52 Foods High In IronPump up your iron intake with foods like tuna, tofu and turkeyNutritionIs Starting Your Day With Lemon Water Healthy?A glass of lemon water in the morning can help with digestion and boost vitamin C levels, and may even help get you into a better routineHealth Categories to ExploreBrain & Nervous SystemChildren's HealthExercise & FitnessHeart HealthMen's HealthMental HealthNutritionOrthopaedicsPrimary CareSkin Care & BeautyWellnessWomen's HealthOther Popular CategoriesAging WellAllergiesCancer Care & PreventionChronic PainCold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesDiabetes & EndocrinologyDigestiveEar, Nose & ThroatEye CareInfectious DiseaseLungOral HealthParentingPregnancy & ChildbirthRecipesRheumatology & ImmunologySenior HealthSex & RelationshipsSleepUrinary & Kidney HealthWeight LossAdRendered: Tue Nov 12 2024 03:52:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestSnapchatCleveland ClinicHomeAbout Cleveland ClinicCareers at Cleveland ClinicGivingOffice of Diversity & InclusionCommunity OutreachResearch & InnovationsHealth LibraryFree Health eNewslettersResources for Medical ProfessionalsMedia RelationsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackAbout this WebsiteAdvertising PolicySocial Media PolicyCopyright, Reprints & LicensingWebsite Terms of UseWebsite Privacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination NoticeResourcesMobile AppsPodcasts9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2024 Cleveland Clinic.

Last year at this time, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said influenza activity had already crossed the seasonal threshold, indicating a “start of an influenza epidemic.” However, this season, PHAC says that while influenza activity is increasing, overall activity remains low and below seasonal threshold levels.“So far, it looks as if this season is going to be one of concern, but certainly nowhere near as bad as obviously the late onset that we had in 2021 and 2022,” said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Disease Centre.“As the restrictions were lifted … last year we had a significant number of cases by now, and then it went up from there. And this is below average, below what we had last year.” Story continues below advertisement Flu season in Canada typically falls in the autumn and winter months, with activity often starting to increase in late October. The peak of flu season in Canada tends to occur between December and February, although the timing can vary every year.According to the latest report, which includes PHAC’s flu numbers from Aug. 27 to Nov. 11, there have been 3,065 reported cases of influenza across Canada, 95 per cent of which were from influenza A. There also have been 184 flu-associated hospitalizations, 21 admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) and six deaths, according to PHAC. 4:36 Health Matters: Common vaccination questions Adults aged 65 years of age and older accounted for 51 per cent of reported hospitalizations. And 97 per cent of the hospitalizations were associated with influenza A. Get weekly health news Receive the latest medical news and health information delivered to you every Sunday.

Last year’s flu season saw much higher numbers by this time. Story continues below advertisement From Aug. 28 to Nov. 12, 2022, there were 8,273 influenza cases reported, 99 per cent of which were influenza A. There were 394 flu-related hospitalizations by this time last year, 32 ICU admissions and nine influenza-associated deaths.PHAC reported that during this time period last year, the highest cumulative hospitalization rates were among children under the age of five and adults 65 years of age and older.At the end of the 2022-23 flu season, PHAC said there were more than 72,000 reported and confirmed cases of influenza and more than 6,000 hospitalizations.While the current influenza numbers are lower than those of the previous year, Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist at McMaster University, cautions that the virus is inherently unpredictable.“Across the country, there is sporadic activity and some localized activity, but it’s not widespread yet,” he said. “But it is still too early to make predictions; we don’t know how much it will peak.” 'We shouldn't be complacent' It may be too early to predict how this flu season will play out, but Conway believes numbers may be lower this year due to the prior influence of COVID-19 on the spread of the virus. Story continues below advertisement “Last year was the first year in which we’d been out of confinement for a length of time before the onset of the respiratory virus season,” Conway said. “So, it having been more exuberant was potentially expected.”The 2022-23 flu season in Canada marked a notable resurgence, bouncing back after a couple of years of unusually low numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Young children were particularly affected.

PHAC “It’s off to a slower start than last year. But … we shouldn’t be complacent. It doesn’t mean you don’t need your shots. It doesn’t mean you don’t need to stay home if you’re sick,” Conway warned.To maintain low influenza numbers in Canada, Loeb and Conway emphasized that the most effective measure is to prioritize getting a flu vaccination, particularly for those who are at high risk. Story continues below advertisement PHAC has not provided data on the number of Canadians who have received their flu shot. However, Conway mentioned that, based on observations, there has been an enthusiastic beginning to flu vaccinations.“I think people are more fatigued of COVID vaccines than any other vaccines,” he said, noting that in British Columbia, he has observed a higher uptake of flu shots than COVID-19 vaccines. 4:08 Vaccinating children against the flu This year’s flu shot is designed to combat four strains of the flu: influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata). Currently, PHAC reports that a majority of flu cases are attributed to H1N1.Conway warned that people aged 65 years and older are particularly vulnerable to influenza A, stressing the importance of this group getting the flu shot.“If they get influenza A, they’re at risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes from influenza itself,” he said. “Within the week after they get influenza A, they have a sixfold higher rate of heart attacks than those who don’t have influenza A. And six months later, it may be that half of them haven’t totally recovered to their baseline.” Story continues below advertisement Canadians should not only prioritize getting their seasonal flu shot but Conway said they should also stay home when unwell, practise thorough handwashing and wear a mask whenever possible.“Run, don’t walk off. Go get your vaccine,” he said. “You can get a flu shot. You can get a COVID shot, one in each arm or both in the same arm.” More on Canada More videos RCMP report reveals new details on GTA man and his ‘camel-toe’ fake toonies How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins Veteran mental health highlighted on Remembrance Day: ‘It’s hard to say I’m not OK’ First B.C., now Montreal: What a pair of port shutdowns means for Canada Montreal refugee claimants facing increased racism As possible Canada Post strike looms, who could see biggest impact?

Reports indicate the illness, which presents as kennel cough or canine influenza, can morph into a more serious illness, similar to pneumonia. WASHINGTON - There’s increasing vigilance of a mystery respiratory illness popping up in dogs. Reports indicate the illness, which presents as kennel cough or canine influenza, can morph into a more serious illness, similar to pneumonia. FOX 5 checked around the DMV and found that right now, it is not believed to be in our area. Fairfax, Prince William, Arlington, D.C., and Montgomery counties, as well as two veterinarians who say they haven’t seen this "mystery illness" but are closely monitoring canine influenza. Prince William County said earlier this week it’s limiting the number of dogs it’s taking in because of respiratory illnesses. Last year, there was an increase in canine influenza. Becky Pugh is the owner of Bone Jour in Bethesda. She says they haven’t had any canine influenza cases but a sign they put up last year reminding pet owners about the risk and concern remains up here at the entrance to the business. Pugh requires dogs to have certain vaccines and encourages owners to think critically about the decision to board. "Whether it’s kennel cough or anything else, you have to have vaccines in order to come. Be conscious of your pet's health when you bring them here and that’s about all we can do," Pugh said. Bone Jour disinfects regularly and takes other actions to try and keep dogs from sharing water bowls or toys if something’s going around. And veterinarian Dr. Eric Cryan emphasized that dog owners should be cognizant of their dog’s overall health as it relates to boarding them, especially now. "As veterinarians, we worry about these emerging respiratory viruses, especially this time of year. When the outside temperatures start to get more like a refrigerator, some of these viruses can last longer, and more likely to spread at dog parks, boarding facilities, things like that. That also coincides with everyone coming together for the holidays and mixing in different locations, which contributes to spreads of many respiratory viruses," Cryan said.

There have been 18 ICU admissions and six deaths. (Katherine Holland/CBC)Social SharingInfluenza has arrived in Alberta and while its gaining traction later in the season than last year, some are concerned that with COVID-19 hospitalizations remaining high, hospitals could struggle under the increasing pressure.The two most recent weeks of data show that Alberta's influenza cases have more than quadrupled, from a total of 87 cases during the week of Oct. 22, to 389 cases the week of Nov. 5.Positivity rates have spiked, with the latest provincial numbers hovering just under 14 per cent. While it's variable by region, wastewater influenza levels are rising too.Respiratory virus outbreaks surging again in Alberta care homes"We're seeing a rapid rise in influenza in the community, "said Dr. Dan Gregson, an infectious disease physician with the University of Calgary."We're just at the very beginning of our influenza season."Experts often look to the southern hemisphere for a sense of what Canada's influenza season will be like."In Australia they had a very bad flu season in their winter so we're worried there's going to be a bad flu season here," said Gregson.Calgary hospitals, Gregson noted, are already dealing with high numbers of COVID-19 patients."And then we're now piling on influenza and RSV on top of that so it's a lot of people in the system that weren't there before."159 people have been hospitalized due to influenza so far this season. There have been 18 ICU admissions and six deaths.The majority of influenza cases reported so far this season are the H1N1 subtype of influenza A, which the province hasn't seen much of in recent years.RSV is showing early signs of increases as well.Calgary hospitalsAlberta's respiratory dashboard shows more than half of the people hospitalized for influenza so far this season have been in the Calgary zone.Dr. Eddy Lang, the head of emergency medicine in the zone, said it's important to note these are early days for influenza and there are currently far more people hospitalized due to COVID-19.1,822 Albertans have been hospitalized due to COVID since the end of August."We certainly expect the amount of influenza to increase over the next several weeks," said Lang. Nurses, doctors call on Alberta government to back down from health-care restructuring Alberta to dismantle current patient-care model, create new health delivery system He's particularly concerned about the elderly who can experience complications such as pneumonia, and require oxygen and hospitalization."Right now our hospitals are running way over 100 per cent capacity," Lang said, noting Calgary ER beds are often filled with patients who are already admitted but are stuck there because there are no beds free for them on the wards."As we see more and more patients needing in hospital beds, we know that unfortunately the emergency department often functions as the overflow department for when the hospital can't take these admitted patients upstairs. This will make it very difficult to provide emergency care in a timely manner and it will mean increased waiting times."According to Lang — under the current Alberta Health Services system — a number of steps can be taken if hospitals become overwhelmed including postponing scheduled surgeries. "It's not optimal. Some of these patients have been waiting months and months for knee replacement or hip replacement. But when the situation is completely unsafe in the emergency department, those measures have to kick in."Low vaccination ratesMeanwhile, Alberta's influenza immunization rates are a concern to both physicians.So far this season, 17.8 per cent of all Albertans have received their annual influenza shot.Lang calls that "disappointing.""Those people in the low risk group are at risk of transmitting influenza to the higher risk groups."When you look at Albertans 65 and up, the number jumps to 50 per cent. According to Gregson, in addition to secondary bacterial infections, there is also an increased risk of heart attack and stroke in people over 50 after influenza. "Ideally we'd like people who are at higher risk of admission to get vaccinated because it really reduces your risk of admission by half," he said."That takes some of the burden off of the health care system."

The ideal level of protection for a population is 70%. Despite flu activity spiking in Florida, pediatric vaccine levels are lagging behind the rest of the country. As families gathered for the Thanksgiving holiday, North America was experiencing the beginnings of increased flu activity. However, in Florida, children’s vaccine levels lagged behind the rest of the nation. The Sunshine State's pediatric vaccine levels (ages 6 months to 17 years) are about 22%, lagging behind the national average of 56% for children overall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ideal level is 70%, said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist at the University of Central Florida. Florida's child vaccination turnout is also low compared to the state's numbers from the previous flu season, about 48%. However, it is still early for flu season, Prins said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Weekly cumulative Influenza coverage. Florida has 22.6% of its pediatric population vaccinated Are kids at risk? Most folks won't suffer the severe effects of the flu even without a vaccine, but vaccinating before holiday get-togethers can be crucial for the most vulnerable family members, including immunocompromised folks, those 65 years and older, and especially young infants, Prins said. "Infants who are under 6 months can't get vaccinated, you know, they can be vulnerable," Prins said. "If you have children with underlying health conditions, conditions like asthma or other conditions, they can be at greater risk as well." Flu cases rising. A return to normal? Last week, the CDC released data showing Florida was among seven states with the highest flu activity. The other six included Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and South Carolina. However, the increased activity for this point of the year is fairly typical of pre-COVID-19 pandemic flu seasons, said Matt Hitchings, an assistant professor at the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Florida. COVID preventative strategies, such as quarantining, may have had impacts on other respiratory virus behavior, such as the flu, which peaks sometime between January and March. With COVID interfering, scientists saw influenza outbreaks occurring either early in the season (September) or late (April.) That's not the case this year, which could be a sign that respiratory virus seasons are returning to a pre-2020 lifestyle. "We've had in the last few years seen influenza at odd times, coming on the earlier side or on the very late side. So it seems like in terms of the shape of the epidemic, or the seasonal case counts this year, we're back on to pre-pandemic trends in terms of the timing," Hitchings said. When should you get your flu shot? A good time to get vaccinated is around October, Hitchings said. Getting the vaccine further into the season is a bit like playing chicken with the virus. The later one gets their shot, the stronger their immunity will likely be during the peak of flu season, but they also run a greater risk of getting sick before getting the shot, Hitchings said. "Epidemiologists would probably recommend not leaving your appointment that late," he said. Copyright 2023 WMFE. To see more, visit WMFE.

(Mainichi/Hiroshi Watanuki) TOKYO -- The raging influenza A outbreak in Japan is expected to dwindle to make way for influenza B, while people must be careful of a possible double-outbreak of the latter plus the coronavirus, according to a clinic director in Kanagawa Prefecture. Normally, the outbreak of seasonal flu starts around December and calms down the following April or later, with influenza A tending to be dominant during the initial stage and B later on. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, most of the strains detected so far this season have been influenza A. Hiroki Ohashi, director of Tama Family Clinic in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, which sees many infectious disease patients, told the Mainichi Shimbun, "It's thought that the outbreak of Type A flu will soon tail off, but people will have to be cautious of a Type B outbreak in the months ahead." Even if a patient has been infected with the flu once, they must not let their guard down, as infection with Type A flu doesn't lower the risk of contracting Type B. "Even if you've been infected once, there still are ample benefits to getting vaccinated (against the flu)," Ohashi advises. Furthermore, he warned of the possible simultaneous outbreak of the flu and the coronavirus, as every winter has seen a COVID-19 spike since the onset of the pandemic. "We might face an outbreak of Type B flu, or of the coronavirus, or even both of them at the same time. All scenarios are possible," Ohashi said. "Those who are at high risk of developing serious symptoms are advised to consider getting inoculated against COVID-19." To prevent infection, Ohashi recommends thorough ventilation on top of wearing masks and washing your hands. "Coronavirus waves have occurred during the summer and winter, when ventilation tends to be insufficient. I've seen many patients who managed to avoid infecting family members by taking ventilation measures at home," he explained. Japan has been gripped by the extraordinary outbreak of seasonal flu since early September, with average patient numbers rising to 11.07 per medical institution in October, surpassing the 10-patient per institution criterion for local government warnings at an unprecedented pace. According to the health ministry, the average flu patient numbers per institution hit 21.66 between Nov. 13 and 19. Many elementary and junior high schools have been forced to cancel classes due to the virus' rapid spread.

It's really important we consider all this."Ndubuka reminded everyone to wash hands frequently, stay home if sick and mask if there's a risk of exposure.He said the increase in cases is "stretching" staff in health-care facilities.WATCH | Flu cases increasing in Saskatchewan: Flu cases increasing in Saskatchewan12 months agoDuration 2:25Doctors in Saskatchewan say they are seeing a spike in influenza cases.The situation appears to be similar in urban areas."We are getting so many patients in with it, we have to close the clinic early because we simply can't take anymore patients," said Daniel McNeil, business manager at Saskatoon's Kenderdine Medical Clinic.According to the government report, total hospital admissions for respiratory viruses increased from 417 for the previous two weeks to 565 for the most recent two weeks, an increase of 35 per cent.

Some people might want to take extra precautions with get-togethers for a holiday meal such as Thanksgiving by avoiding large gatherings in crowded indoor spaces. PeopleImages/iStockphoto/Getty Images CNN — As people gather for Thanksgiving, they might be bringing along some unexpected guests. These get-togethers are occurring as respiratory viruses such as influenza are on the rise, and Covid-19 and the respiratory syncytial virus are circulating as well. Additionally, there are also foodborne illnesses going around that can result in stomach upset and other symptoms. Coronavirus Mask,Close up portrait of a man using pm 2.5 pollution mask in the street of a big city Krisanapong Detraphiphat/Moment RF/Getty Images As holiday season gets underway, here’s how to protect yourself and your family from respiratory viruses How can people protect themselves as they’re preparing for holiday gatherings? What should hosts keep in mind as they are planning events and serving food? And what symptoms are signs a person should seek medical care? To help sort through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, with responsibilities that included overseeing infectious diseases as well as food safety. CNN: What types of illnesses can be transmitted during Thanksgiving and other holiday get-togethers? Dr. Leana Wen: I’d think about the illnesses in two categories. The first is respiratory illnesses, like the flu, RSV and the common cold. Someone who is infected coughs or sneezes, then those droplets containing viruses land on your nose or mouth. Or they touch their nose, then touch a surface, and then you touch that surface and then your nose or mouth. Some viruses, like the virus that causes Covid-19, are also airborne, and can be transmitted by someone who is coughing, singing or just speaking and breathing near you. 22 August 2022, Saxony, Chemnitz: A medical-technical assistant prepares Escherichia coli strains for PCR analysis in a laboratory at the Saxony State Investigation Office (LUA) in Chemnitz. The aim of the LUA's work in the field of food safety and the safety of consumer goods and cosmetics is to protect consumers from hazards that can arise from unsafe food and materials and objects that are in prolonged contact with the body. Preventive consumer health protection is becoming increasingly important and is supported by the work of the LUA. The Saxon Ministry of Social Affairs has now presented the authority's annual report for 2021. Photo: Hendrik Schmidt/dpa (Photo by Hendrik Schmidt/picture alliance via Getty Images) Hendrik Schmidt/picture alliance/Getty Images Your risk of getting sick from germy food has gone up again, CDC says The second category is foodborne infections. These are also quite common. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are around 9 million episodes of foodborne illnesses each year. The most common pathogen implicated in these infections is norovirus. This can be spread through food and drink and can also be spread from person. If you touch an object that an infected person touched, and then touch your mouth, you could get norovirus. You could also contract it by eating from the same utensils or drinking from the same cup as an infected person. A subcategory under foodborne infections are infections that result from ingesting the food itself — for example, if it’s undercooked or spoiled. Such pathogens include salmonella and E. coli. CNN: How should people decide what level of precautions to take? Wen: Most people don’t want to get sick, of course, but some people need to take extra precautions because they are vulnerable to severe illness. Older people, babies and very young children, pregnant individuals, and those who are immunocompromised or have other serious underlying medical conditions all fall into this category. They should take additional precautions based on how much they wish to avoid infection. Hand of maid washing tomato fresh vegetables preparation healthy food in kitchen Sarinyapinngam/iStockphoto/Getty Images Doctor shares advice on how to prevent food poisoning For instance, they may wish to avoid very large gatherings in indoor crowded spaces and instead opt for get-togethers with a small group of family and friends who have taken steps to limit their own virus risks in the preceding week. They may choose to spend most of their time together in well-ventilated spaces. While traveling to the event, and in other public spaces, they could wear well-fitting N95s or equivalent masks. And, of course, they should be sure that they have their recommended vaccines and access to antiviral treatment if they were to become ill. CNN: What should hosts keep in mind as they are planning events? Wen: Hosts should check in with their guests to see whether any of them are in this category of individuals who are very vulnerable and wishing to take extra precautions. If so, they could have a discussion of what additional steps should be taken to reduce risk. For instance, could doors and windows be open during meals? Could there be instructions encouraging people not to attend if they have symptoms? Could hosts suggest that everyone take a rapid Covid-19 test prior to arrival? Could hosts place sanitizer throughout the event and encourage frequent use? Any of these steps could help reduce the risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal illness. CNN: Are buffet tables a good idea? Wen: Buffet tables could add a bit more risk for three reasons, but there are ways to reduce the risk with some planning. First, people often congregate near a buffet. A lot of people in a tight space adds to the risk of person-to-person spread. Hosts could ask a few people to get food one at a time and then sit down instead of congregating. They can also open windows and doors.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Brian Snyder/Reuters Covid-19 vaccination rate is ‘lower than we’d like to see,’ CDC says Second, buffets generally have a lot of items that are touched by numerous people, like serving spoon, pitchers and lids. Knowing that this is the case, hosts can place hand sanitizer at the end of the buffet line and at dining spaces to encourage people to use it after helping themselves at the buffet and before eating. Third, buffets often involve food that’s lying out for a long time. Depending on the type of food, it could be out for too long and then become a breeding ground for various pathogens. Hosts should be attentive to the amount of time perishable food is out — generally, perishable items should not be left out for more than two hours. Remember the old maxim: Hot food should be kept hot, and cold food should be kept cold. CNN: Is it better to forgo buffets in favor of plated meals? Wen: If the steps above can be followed, buffets may be no riskier than plated meals. However, if many people are likely to congregate near a buffet table, for instance, hosts can plate meals for their more vulnerable guests and have them dine in a less crowded area with open windows and good air circulation. CNN: What other food safety tips can help to reduce the spread of illnesses? Wen: Don’t undercook meat. There are excellent resources online that outline what internal temperatures different kinds of meat and poultry should be cooked to. Be conscious of what containers and utensils have touched raw meat. Don’t put vegetables that you intend to serve as salad items or cooked meat into these containers. And be sure to wash vegetables and fruit before serving. People who are preparing food should take extra care to wash their hands very well. If they touched raw meat, they need to wash their hands with hot water and soap before handling other food. Everyone should practice good hygiene with frequent handwashing. CNN: Finally, what symptoms should people watch out for — how do they know when they need to seek medical care?

De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images/FILE Why you shouldn’t postpone your flu vaccine Wen: Symptoms of respiratory illnesses include fever, cough, sneezing and body aches. Symptoms of gastrointestinal illnesses include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Those with foodborne infections can also develop body aches and flu-like symptoms, too. People should seek medical care if they have shortness of breath, severe abdominal pain, or are vomiting so much they cannot keep down fluids. This is especially true for people vulnerable to severe illness. And those who have symptoms should stay away from others to reduce their chance of further spreading infections.

The World Health Organization has asked China for more data on a respiratory illness spreading in the north of the country, urging people to take steps to reduce the risk of infection. (Jade Gao/AFP/Getty Images)Social SharingThe World Health Organization (WHO) has asked China for details on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children, which its China office on Thursday called a "routine" check.Chinese authorities from the National Health Commission held a press conference on Nov. 13 to report an increase in incidence of respiratory disease.Authorities attributed the increase to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae, a common bacterial infection that typically affects younger children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the virus that causes COVID-19.Both China and the WHO have faced questions about the transparency of reporting on the earliest COVID-19 cases that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.RSV infections surge as hospitals brace for return of 'normal' respiratory virus seasonOn Wednesday, the WHO said groups including the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in north China. The WHO said it was not clear if these were associated with an overall increase in respiratory infections previously reported by Chinese authorities or separate events.The WHO said it had asked for additional epidemiologic and clinical information as well as laboratory results from the reported outbreaks among children, through the International Health Regulations mechanism.24 hours to replyUnder the rules, China is supposed to respond to WHO within 24 hours.The UN health agency has also asked China for further information about trends in the circulation of known pathogens and the burden on health-care systems. The WHO said it was in contact with clinicians and scientists through its existing technical partnerships and networks in China.WHO China said it was "routine" to request information on increases in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children from member states, such as China.The global agency decided to issue a statement on China to share available information, as it received a number of queries about it from media, WHO China said in an emailed statement.'Staggering' rise in global measles cases last year, say leading health organizationsThe ProMED alert was based on a report by FTV News in Taiwan that came out on Tuesday.Undiagnosed pneumonia was not mentioned at last week's press conference, according to a transcript, but one speaker said everyone felt like there had been an increase in respiratory illnesses this year compared with three years ago.The speaker said that global monitoring for mycoplasma pneumoniae had been at a low over the past three years and outbreaks were cyclical, occurring every three to seven years.WATCH | Brace yourself for a bad viral season: Brace for another big cold and flu season, experts say12 months agoDuration 0:01Canadian doctors are bracing for what could be another busy cold and flu season as cases of RSV and influenza are on the rise while COVID-19 continues to circulate.'Seasonal surge'The rise in respiratory illnesses comes as China braces for its first full winter season since it had lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions in December. Many other countries saw similar increases in respiratory diseases after easing pandemic measures."It is just a relatively large seasonal surge, perhaps partly due to chance and partly because there's a bit of 'immunity debt' from the lesser winter surges in the last three years," said Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at Hong Kong University.China's National Health Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Thursday, it published an interview with the state media agency Xinhua in which it advised parents what to do and mentioned that big hospitals were receiving a large number of patients and waiting times were long. It did not comment on the WHO notice.Elderly Canadians remain at higher risk of serious COVID from first infections, study suggestsSince mid-October, the WHO said northern China had reported an increase in influenza-like illness compared with the same period in the previous three years.It said China had systems in place to capture information on trends in illness incidence and to report that data to platforms such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.Crowded hospitalsIn recent days, media in cities such as Xian in the northwest have posted videos of hospitals crowded with parents and children awaiting checks.Some social media users have posted photos of children doing homework while receiving intravenous drips in hospital.The WHO said that while it was seeking additional information, it recommended that people in China follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness.Measures included vaccination, keeping distance from sick people, staying at home when ill, getting tested and medical care as needed, wearing masks as appropriate, ensuring good ventilation, and regular hand-washing, it said.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Since then, a number of other cases of symptomatic birds and above baseline mortality have been reported to the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI). Working in close partnership with British Antarctic Survey (BAS), swabs from four further sites were taken from brown skua and kelp gulls. These were returned to the UK and tested by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratories in Weybridge, where they returned positive results for HPAI H5N1.

In addition, a high level of mortality has been detected in elephant seal pups at three sites around South Georgia and animals have displayed symptoms which are consistent with HPAI. Swabs were also taken from these animals, but results did not confirm HPAI. Plans are being developed in conjunction with APHA to implement more appropriate sample collection over the next few weeks to confirm the cause of the mortality. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at King Edward Point, South Georgia. A higher than usual mortality rate of pups has been found around the island. BAS and GSGSSI, guided by the GSGSSI response plan, continue to carefully monitor the situation across the territory. BAS operates two research stations on South Georgia: King Edward Point and Bird Island. As a result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, most fieldwork involving contact with animals has been suspended. BAS staff are following the additional biosecurity measures adopted this season of enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment when moving between sites with high densities of wildlife, as well as remaining vigilant for signs of disease. Key elements of the wider science programme at King Edward Point and Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, grey-headed albatross, northern and southern giant petrels, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins. South Georgia has some of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. BAS and GSGSSI are working closely together to monitor the spread of the disease and its impact on the region’s wildlife.

Yippee. November 22, 2023 • By Craig L. Bowron, M.D. Save Content Please login to bookmark Username or Email Address Password Remember Me ©GettyImages SHARE: A week or so ago I had the worst kind of nostalgic feeling. A lump in my throat that felt like the size of an avocado seed, but with the scratchy texture of a peach pit. Then the sense that someone had painted my sinuses with the neighbor‘s horseradish jalapeno sauce; followed later by chicken feathers ticklishly dusting my lungs — but when I try to cough them up, they transmogrify into burrs. Ouch! It was a good run. I hadn’t had a “cold” — more accurately, an upper respiratory infection — since before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic went viral. Mind you, I thought I was coming down with COVID every time I came home from working at the hospital. A full day of yelling at patients and fellow staff members from behind an N95 mask and a face shield inevitably left me with a sore throat and nasal congestion. But by the next morning, all that was gone. It was back to the trenches, battling the tiny fragment of RNA that had turned the world upside down. Who knows what the next COVID variants will be capable of, but this much is clear: As we drop the masking and the social distancing and return to normal — gatherings, concerts, crowded shopping centers, sporting events and the like — the common cold and influenza will certainly return. The term “#Tripledemic” is now trending, a reference to rising RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and influenza rates on top of percolating baseline COVID infection rates. Worn out staff and over-filled and understaffed hospitals are unfortunately in no position to handle a “Tripledemic” surge, or even a “Uni”- or “Doubledemic” surge. What pathogens make up this “common cold” category? RSV along with parainfluenza viruses are responsible for 20% of colds. Wimpier, non-COVID-19 versions of coronaviruses add another 20% and human rhinoviruses add as much as 40%. Adenovirus and human metapneumovirus (formerly Facebookpneumovirus) round things out. RSV has a well-deserved reputation for being a pediatric scourge. By the age of 2, almost every child has had it, and an RSV infection can get very serious for infants: 1% to 2% of infants under 6 months will end up being hospitalized. However, RSV is very capable of faking out our immune system by morphing its appearance, and adults get re-infected on average every 3 to 10 years. One thing influenza and RSV have in common is that they strike the youngest and the oldest hardest, particularly those who have other serious medical problems. They differ in that influenza has vaccines and specific anti-viral treatments, whereas RSV has zero vaccine options (getting close though!) and only supportive treatments. The symptoms of RSV are indistinguishable from those of any other cold, and the symptoms of the ‘Tripledemic’ have some overlap that can make it challenging to decide which particular infective ilk one is dealing with. A very instructive table from Germany’s Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care does a nifty job of teasing out symptom ‘trendencies.’ Here is the summary of that table: Typical COVID-19 symptoms include fever and dry cough. Typical ‘Cold’ symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat; a cough is a frequent but not typical symptom. Typical Flu symptoms include fever, fatigue, achy joints, headache, and dry cough. Of course, all of us are excited about the idea of putting the COVID pandemic behind us and “getting back to normal,” except that “normal” includes influenza and an average of 2 to 3 colds per year. At that rate, the average Joe or Josephine will spend five years of their life suffering from the common cold, and a year of that sentence is severe enough to land you in bed. In his recent sendoff address published in the New England Journal of Medicine, titled “It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over … but It’s Never Over — Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases,” Dr. Anthony Fauci suggests it’s unlikely we will ever go back to “normal.” He writes, “Today, there is no reason to believe that the threat of emerging infections will diminish, since their underlying causes are present and most likely increasing.” Bah humbug, Dr. Tony, but I’m guessing you’re right. Having mostly recovered from my recent cold, I am left with an occasional cough and the question “Was this a particularly bad cold, or did I forget how bad a cold can be?” I favor the latter, but it’s hard to know. Nostalgia isn’t what it used to be.

Share Tweet New Delhi: The Union Health Ministry on Friday (November 24), said that it is closely monitoring the reported outbreak of H9N2 cases (novel avian influenza virus) and clusters of respiratory illnesses in children in China. The Ministry said that India is at low risk from the avian influenza cases. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) recently held a meeting to discuss the preparedness measures against the Avian Influenza in the country against the backdrop of a case in October 2023 reported from China. The Union Health Ministry stated, India is prepared for any kind of public health emergency. India is embarking on a One Health approach to adopt a holistic and integrated roadmap towards addressing such public health issues.

Additionally, the Prime Minister Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) was launched to develop the capacities of health systems and institutions at primary, secondary and tertiary levels for responding to any future outbreaks. What Is H9N2 And How Is One Contracts It? H9N2 is a subtype of the influenza A virus, which causes human influenza as well as bird flu. According to the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), H9N2 virus is found worldwide in wild birds and are endemic in poultry in many areas. A recent Lancet study stated that Poultry is considered a genetic incubator for the origin of the H9N2 novel avian influenza virus that infects humans. What Are The Symptoms Of H9N2 And How To Prevent Contracting It? According to the World Health Organisation, exposure to the avian influenza virus can lead to infections ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms or eye inflammation to severe, acute respiratory disease or death. The severity of the disease depends on the virus causing the infection and the characteristics of the infected individual. To prevent contracting the virus, individuals must minimise contact with animals in areas known to be affected by animal influenza viruses, including farms and settings where live animals may be sold or slaughtered, the WHO states. Maintaining personal and hand hygiene, including washing hands with soap, before and after contact with animals is essential to avoid being infected by the virus, the WHO states.

The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India’s different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change. It has now been described as a “code red for humanity.” The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.

And after a roller-coaster of viral dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic, some say this season could mark a return to relative normalcy.Respiratory syncytial virus activity is higher than expected, with COVID-19 and flu also circulatingLauren Pelley · CBC News · Posted: Nov 22, 2023 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: November 22, 2023Brace for another big cold and flu season, experts say12 months agoDuration 0:01Canadian doctors are bracing for what could be another busy cold and flu season as cases of RSV and influenza are on the rise while COVID-19 continues to circulate.Social SharingOn a weekday afternoon, coughs and cries echo throughout the brightly lit waiting room of the Just for Kids Clinic at St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto.It's clear this year's respiratory virus season is already underway, said Dr. Anne Wormsbecker, chief of pediatrics at the hospital, one of three health-care sites making up Unity Health Toronto. While most children who arrive for outpatient appointments aren't given tests to figure out which virus is making them sick, she said inpatient units where patients are tested upon admission are seeing a striking trend."In the last couple of weeks, the respiratory syncytial virus — or RSV — has just shot up," she said.Country-wide data also shows RSV is on the rise. So far, 1,220 cases have been detected since late August, with roughly five per cent of tests coming back positive, according to the most recent respiratory virus report from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)."Activity of RSV is increasing and slightly above expected levels for this time of year," the report noted.The virus usually causes common cold symptoms, but can turn serious among both the young and old.WATCH | 4 key vaccines available for Canadian seniors this fall:What seniors need to know about vaccines this fall1 year agoDuration 4:16Four key vaccines are available for seniors this fall, including an updated COVID-19 shot and Canada’s first vaccine for RSV. CBC health reporter Lauren Pelley breaks down what seniors — and those who care for them — need to know.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is still circulating as well, and influenza activity is also increasing, although still within the typical levels for November, PHAC data shows.After a roller-coaster of viral dynamics during the pandemic — including a period where influenza nearly vanished, followed by an unusual RSV surge last year — some say this season could mark a return to relative normalcy, but with SARS-CoV-2 now firmly in the mix.However, "normal" doesn't mean it'll be smooth sailing for either the public or Canada's strained health-care teams, said McGill University infectious diseases specialist Dr. Donald Vinh."The pattern that we're seeing is not new, but it's the return of what we've been used to — with COVID now superimposed," he said.Pandemic caused unpredictable viral dynamicsIn Canada, RSV typically poses a problem from October onward, said Vinh, with flu following behind, then possible subsequent waves of infections later in the season."That's actually been the norm, for years, if not decades," he said. "But COVID wiped that out — not the public health response to COVID, but [the virus] itself.Second OpinionHow seniors can access 4 key vaccines this fall — for COVID, flu, pneumonia, and RSV"It was such a transmissible virus that it smothered the transmission of other viruses until we had a partially immune population to COVID."Medical experts call that phenomenon "viral interference" — it's what happens when a virus like SARS-CoV-2 pushes out other pathogens at a population level for a period of time, possibly because widespread infections keep people's immune systems on high alert. COVID-19 numbers down, flu and RSV up in B.C.Other researchers have argued society-wide public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing likely mattered more in keeping other viruses at bay. Indeed, after COVID restrictions were lifted, infections from other threats such as RSV began to surge. Wormsbecker said health-care teams like hers are bracing for another winter where high numbers of children are hospitalized. "We're certainly hoping not to see that again this year," she added, "but that's what we're preparing for."Respiratory virus season is underway in Canada, with RSV cases on the rise across the country. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Quebec's RSV reports are rising quickly, Vinh said, while data from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control shows in that province, "RSV test positivity continues to increase and is higher in children."One Toronto pediatric clinic is seeing visits for a variety of respiratory ailments are spiking fast."Our baseline is about 300 visits a day, and now in the past two weeks we bumped up to 400 patients a day," said Dr. Daniel Flanders of Kindercare Pediatrics.Ottawa enters 'diciest' weeks for viral transmissionPhysicians are also concerned about the impacts on seniors as these viruses spread to older populations. "We're seeing some RSV outbreaks in long-term care facilities, but compared to COVID they're way, way down," said Dr. Allan Grill, chief of family medicine at Markham Stouffville Hospital, north of Toronto. "But what's to come in the next few months is hard to predict."As for flu, more than 180 influenza-associated hospitalizations have already been reported since late August, PHAC said. Adults aged 65 and older made up slightly more than half of those reported hospitalizations.Flu, COVID-19 numbers in kids rising, likely to 'get worse before they get better': Winnipeg doctor"The good news is that, in the Southern Hemisphere — which gets an influenza season earlier than we do here in North America and Canada — they didn't get an overwhelming flu season like we've seen in the past," Grill noted. "So, we're hoping that the same will happen up here."WATCH | First-time COVID infections still a risk for seniors:New COVID-19 data warns of risks to seniors not yet infected1 year agoDuration 1:47New Canadian data shows that more than four in 10 elderly adults may have avoided a COVID-19 infection so far. But they remain at the highest risk for hospitalization and death and researchers say keeping up-to-date with vaccinations is still the best way to reduce that risk.Vaccines available for COVID, flu, RSVVinh warned that many Canadians could still get hit hard, given varying levels of immunity to each virus within the population. The majority of the public has already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated against it, or both, Vinh noted, but there are also "populations that have not built up any partial immunity to RSV or flu who will be contracting either virus for the first time."ListenWhat do we know about the new RSV vaccine, especially its cost?The silver lining, he added, is that Canada is still at the beginning of the season, which means there is time to mitigate dire consequences through widespread vaccination, including with updated COVID vaccines that better match circulating strains of the virus.Ontarians urged to get both flu, COVID-19 shots ahead of respiratory virus seasonHealth Canada also approved an RSV vaccine earlier this year for adults aged 60 and up. Many Canadians will have to pay out of pocket — at a cost of upwards of $200 — though Ontario is also providing it for free to residents of long-term care facilities."It is not too late to get your COVID vaccine if you haven't been updated, or your flu shot if you haven't gotten it," Vinh said.

PUBLISHED : 20 Nov 2023 at 07:00 Small Medium Large 1 According to a 2023 report from Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, over 300,000 Thai people were infected with influenza. Specialists believe probably one million people annually come down with the flu due to year-round occurrence. Moreover, unvaccinated people are at greater risk of recurring flu infection and the elderly are susceptible to flu-related severe illness or deaths because comorbidities can complicate their symptoms. The Influenza Foundation (Thailand) calls on the Thai Government to increasing offer free flu shot to people over 65 years of age and expand free flu vaccination to cover more school children who are likely to spread the disease. The flu vaccine is worth this investment and has been recognised as a cost-effective preventive measure for over 80 years.Associate Professor Tawee Chotpitayasunondh, President of the Influenza Foundation (Thailand), reveals “flu is a seasonal disease. Since COVID-19, fewer people have been catching the flu due to preventive measures and so people are now less immune to it. According to the report from Ministry of Public Health, during the January-October period of 2023, over 300,000 flu patients were infected with influenza and 21 of them died. In fact, many more with less severe illness were infected without needing hospital admission. The report did not include patient data from those who did not receive treatment due to mild symptoms or those who received treatment at private clinics. It is believed by the end of 2023 probably one million people will have experienced a flu infection.” "Analysis of flu infection data in Thailand reveals a distinct seasonal outbreak contrast with countries located in temperate climates, like the US, certain European countries, Japan, or Korea. In those regions, flu is seasonal, mostly peaking in winter and waning or nearly disappear in warmer months. However, Thailand, located in the tropical zone, experiences flu outbreak consistently throughout the year. The rainy season will see a surge in cases due to high humidity, increased close contact in enclosed spaces, and the beginning of the school semester. These factors contribute to flu transmission within families, putting at increased risk both young children and the elderly, who face greater risk of severe illness or death due to comorbid conditions. However, young adult flu cases are typically less severe without complication. In summary, influenza appears year-round, affecting all age groups, and vaccination is the most cost effective for flu prevention in all age groups as well." Associate Professor Tawee adds, “research regarding influenza-related hospital admission in Thailand measured the direct and indirect economic costs of the flu – finding that the annual direct cost of flu treatment is 1.1 billion THB and the annual indirect loss of business/work opportunities is 1.3 billion THB. So, the annual cost of the flu in Thailand is 2.4 billion THB. However, the best and most cost-effective measures for influenza prevention is vaccination. The Thai Government currently offers free flu vaccination to people of at-risk groups, including young children, people with certain comorbid conditions, pregnant women, and the elderly.” Since Thailand is an aging society, we must expand flu prevention and control measures, including providing free vaccines more accessible. For example, Thailand should make use of teams of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals to provide vaccination services at drive-thru stations, like in the US and Europe. Associate Professor Tawee believes the flu vaccine holds the highest level of acceptance among Thai society, since it has been safely administered for over 50 years. The flu vaccine’s record of efficacy and safety prove it is worth the investment. Regarding the elderly at risk of flu-related severe illness or death, the vaccine lessens the severity of symptoms & complications, duration of hospital stays, and mortality. If the Thai Government would increase the number of free doses distributed to the elderly and other at-risk groups – especially children who are an important transmitter or for flu virus in addition to being an at-risk group, the financial burden of the flu could be greatly reduced. Professor Sasisopin Kiertiburanakul, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University reveals “the elderly are susceptible to flu infection for three reasons. The first is lower immunity as when we are older, our ability to fight off infection decreases. We cannot fight off germs the way we could when we were young. So, the elderly are easily infected by the influenza virus. When infected, their symptoms can be severe. Secondly, the elderly usually suffer from other comorbid health conditions. For example, some elderly people suffer from emphysema. When they catch the flu, they become even shorter of breath as the virus infects the lungs, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Some have heart conditions, and the flu can worsen heart health. If they have diabetes, the immune system is weakened, causing complications and other comorbidities. Lastly, elderly people can be malnourished. They generally eat less and do not get enough nutrients in their diets. These factors contribute to higher chances of catching the flu and higher risks that their symptoms would become severe.” These factors are the main reasons why the elderly should be vaccinated. The benefits of vaccination against the flu include reduced symptoms, reduced pulmonary inflammation, and lower risk of hospitalisation and death. There are also steps we can take in daily life to reduce flu transmission like mask wearing, frequent hand washing, social distancing. However, these steps cannot be taken all the time and they alone cannot reduce the risk to zero. The Infectious Disease Association of Thailand recommends everyone 6 months of age and up get vaccinated against the flu. Currently, there are 2 types of flu vaccines available in Thailand: The standard dose contains 15 mcg of antigen per strain of flu per dose. It is appropriate for everyone 6 months of age and up, including the elderly. The high dose contains 60 mcg of antigen per strain of flu per dose. It is an option for those at higher risk – like being 65 or older and is better at symptom reduction than the standard dose by 24%, while further reducing the risk of hospitalisation, pneumonia, and death by greater margins than those of the standard dose. However, injection site pain can be a little more acute for patients receiving a high dose vaccine. Associate Professor Tawee closed by commenting, “The important thing I want to stress about the flu vaccine is there is no need to wait one full year between shots. People should get vaccinated as soon as the new flu vaccine comes out, usually between April and May, as long as 6 months have passed since the date of last vaccination. Members of government mandated at-risk groups can get vaccinated free of charge at public hospitals or by calling the 1422 hotline. The general public can receive the flu vaccine at either public or private hospitals at their own expense.” KEYWORDS Mahidol University Ramathibodi Hospital Influenza Foundation Do you like the content of this article?

For an added perspective on the figures and trends percentage, country sentinel sites reporting for WKs 44 & 45 are also shown. Please refer Seasonal Influenzafor Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) - ILI Surveillance Actual increase in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Solomon Islands, Tonga, CNMI, Wallis & Futuna, RMI and Fiji. The increased ILI cases seen in New Caledonia may be due to the increased number of sites reporting for the week. The reduction in the number of ILI cases has been seen in Palau and Cook Isla. The decreased ILI cases seen in Samoa may be due to the decreased number of sites reporting for the week. No ILI cases have been reported from Pitcairn Islands. No reports were available from Kiribati, FSM, Guam, Vanuatu, Tokelau and Tuvalu for the week. American Samoa and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease. Influenza updates from PICs: Fiji has reported 3 positive cases for Influenza A/H3 out of 9 samples in WK 45. For WK 45, French Polynesia has reported 6 new cases of influenza A out of 62 tests, 2 of these cases required hospitalization. Additionally, During week 45, 30 new confirmed COVID-19 cases from 94 test results, 113% of increase compared to WK44, with a positivity rate of 32%. and one case has been admitted to the hospital. Omicron sub-variants XBB.1.5, EG.5.1 (ERIS), and the most recent known sub-variant, JN.1 (derived from BA.2.86) were identified through sequencing at the ILM. Source: Bulletin de surveillance sanitaire Polynésie française N°43 - 2023 -WK45/2023. CMNI reported 12 positive influenza cases. Among these, 6 were influenza A, 5 were influenza B, and 1 cases showed positive results for both influenza A and B. Co-infection with two different influenza strains in one patient is unusual. The CHCC laboratory plans to analyse subsequent samples testing positive for both Flu A and B using the GeneXpert machine, and they will also send these samples to GPHL for further subtype and lineage testing. This approach aims not only to confirm co-infection but also to track the continued circulation of these strains despite a decline in ILI and Influenza cases. In addition, 4 positive cases of SARS-Cov-2 for week 45 (Situation report WK 45 ends 11/11/2023). China is seeing the circulation of multiple infectious respiratory illnesses this winter, with surging cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, rising cases of influenza flu, but a downward trend in COVID-19 cases in recent days, said health authorities and experts, The media reported. Avian Influenza Weekly Update** :** Between 10 November and 16 November 2023, one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus was reported from Guangan city, Sichuan province, China.

Malaysia reported approximately 64,078 dengue fever cases in 2022, 26,365 cases in 2021, and 90,304 cases in 2020. The data also indicates a rise in dengue-related fatalities, with 73 deaths recorded by October 22, 2023, compared to 29 deaths during the same period in 2022. Dengue fever infections are surging across large swaths of Asia, spurred by climate change and unusually rainy weather, with infections up roughly 200% on the year in Thailand and Cambodia, while Taiwan, China is seeing a rapid surge, media reported. Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue, and Diarrhea (LTDD) On November 17, following cyclone Mal and heavy rainfall in Fiji, the Ministry of Health has emphasized the increased risk of Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue, and Diarrhea (LTDD) outbreaks during intense rainfall. The Ministry has issued warnings to the public, urging them to take measures to keep the environment clean and prevent pollution, as the spread of these diseases is closely tied to the surroundings. Collaborating with WASH, NGOs, the Ministry is actively responding to prevent LTDD, particularly in flood-prone areas, while community initiatives are focused on maintaining clean water, clean environment and safe living conditions.

(Trevor Pritchard/CBC)Social SharingPublic health experts urge residents to stay vigilant and get vaccinated as flu season arrives amid rising COVID-19 numbers in the Ottawa area."We're entering those weeks where things are the diciest," said Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa, on CBC Radio's All In A Day. The colder weather brings the triple threat of higher COVID-19, influenza and RSV transmission, as residents learned last fall.Ottawa Public Health (OPH) data suggests COVID-19 activity increased last week, compared to the week before. Wastewater signals are very high and increasing, while 54 additional patients were admitted to Ottawa hospitals last week due to COVID-19. Rising COVID-19 numbers reported in Ottawa, eastern Ontario So far, influenza and other respiratory viruses have remained more stable than in 2022, according to OPH.That's a promising sign, said Dr. Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health at the Eastern Ontario Health Unit."If you ask me for a prediction, yes, we're going to have a respiratory season," he said. "Yes, we're going to have three viruses simultaneously circulating, but not, I don't think, to the point of that simultaneous, sudden surge we had last year."That surge overwhelmed hospitals during last year's cold and flu season, which Roumeliotis said is not happening so far in 2023.COVID-19 levels are similar to last year, while flu cases were actually double or triple current levels and RSV peaked at the same time as COVID."We're seeing a slower increase in [RSV and flu levels]," he said. "Certainly not to the levels we had last year, which is good news."All in a Day5:49COVID-19 numbers are on the rise in OttawaThis week's Ottawa Public Health data shows that COVID-19 numbers are rising at either high or very high levels, with RSV trends following suit and flu trends a mixed bag.COVID could be stabilizing, experts sayRoumeliotis said he also sees some signs that COVID-19 trends could be stabilizing. Deonandan sees indications of that too, though he remains wary about where other viruses could head in the near future."Some modelling suggests that we're at the peak right now. It's unclear," he said of COVID-19. "But definitely we do not want to increase transmission, especially as the RSV numbers are just beginning to pick up, and especially as we're at the early stages of the flu season." What's expected this respiratory virus season and what can you do? Both experts urged the public to follow public health measures, like staying home when you're sick and washing your hands. Deonandan said people should also consider "strategic masking" in high-risk environments. Above all, they said, get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu.Deonandan worries people seem to have "taken their foot off the brake pedal" in fighting infection. Uptake of the new booster shots against COVID-19 remains low, he said, despite the booster seeming to be effective against the most recent variants."It's really a shame," he said. "It's a very good booster. It seems to produce good quality neutralizing antibodies, the laboratory studies suggest, which means not only would it help us stay out of the hospital and out of the morgue [but also would give] a pretty good chance of preventing symptoms and transmission altogether."ABOUT THE AUTHORArthur White-CrummeyReporterArthur White-Crummey is a reporter at CBC Ottawa.

This disease has led to the slaughter of five million birds in the US this year in an attempt to prevent an outbreak. The experts, though, could not rule out other diseases like Ebola and outbreaks from insect-borne diseases like malaria and yellow fever.There was a silver lining, however. They pointed to rapid advances in vaccine technology and antivirals as a sign the pharmaceutical industry would be able to rapidly rollout treatments against a pandemic disease when the next arises.Below DailyMail.com reveals the opinions of three experts on what could cause the next pandemic and where it could come from: Dr Leonard Mermel: Avian influenzaAn infectious disease expert told DailyMail.com he believes the next pandemic will be caused by an avian influenza that mutates to spread rapidly between humans.Avian influenza, also referred to as bird flu and H5N1, is a virus that primarily infects birds and tends to be spread via respiratory droplets. In rare cases, this virus can cross the species divide and infect mammals — including humans.Dr Leonard Mermel from Brown University who has studied viruses for decades, said the next virus would likely appear when a poultry worker sick with human flu is infected with the avian strain at the same time. Dr Leonard Mermel, an infectious diseases expert in Rhode Island, suggested the next pandemic could be caused by avian influenzaHe explained: 'These two viruses would then meet inside one of their cells and swap genes to create a new chimeric virus.'A chimeric virus is one that contains genetic material from more than one virus. The supervirus would then start to spread rapidly from human to human via respiratory droplets, he explained, spreading around the world and triggering the next pandemic.The Rhode Island-based researcher warned in the beginning the strain could kill 30 to 40 percent of people it infects. For comparison, when Covid first emerged it had a fatality rate of five percent in the epicenter of Wuhan.China is the most likely place the new virus would first appear, he said, because the country often records cases of human infection with avian influenza.Data from the World Health Organization showed China has the third-highest number of human avian influenza cases recorded since 2003, at 55 infections.It is behind Vietnam at 128 and Cambodia at 58, but the data is reliant on the number of cases submitted by each country — meaning the true toll may actually be much higher due to reporting delays and cases not being recorded.Dr Mermel said: 'Something that has concerned me for a long time is avian strains of influenza being transmitted in humans, that is of grave concern.'One particular strain is H5N1, which has made incremental changes over the past 10 to 20 years, but is yet to evolve to be easily transmitted from human-to-human.'It has gained some mutations so it can infect humans, which is scary. On the other hand, it has been around for a while, but I think we may be in a false sense of security at the same time. I think this is because these viruses can mutate very quickly.Next pandemic could kill millions more than Covid The next major pandemic is coming. It’s already on the horizon, and could be far worse — killing millions more people — than the last one. Advertisement 'It is certainly possible that it could cause a pandemic within the next 10 to 20 years, there would be consensus over that time span. But it could also take longer.' Concerns over avian influenza have been increasing since 2022 and farms have been obligated to slaughter their entire poultry flock when just one bird tests positive for the virus since at least the 1980s.Last year, an estimated five million chickens were slaughtered at farms across the US after avian influenza was detected in their flocks. While this is a decline from the nearly 58million slaughtered in 2020, the recurring infections show the virus has found a way to survive the summer months and keep infecting flocks.Last year, a prison inmate in Colorado tested positive for bird flu, but did not pass on the disease to others.Dr Mermel also did not rule out it is 'possible' that a future pandemic could be triggered by a lab leak.He said: 'There is some evidence that one of the flu pandemics may have come from a lab in Russia.'In 1977, a flu pandemic swept the world infecting millions of people and killing approximately 700,000.It was caused by an H1N1 flu strain that emerged in the former Soviet Union that scientists said was a close match to an earlier strain that had circulated worldwide from 1946 to 1957. Scientists at the time also noted the virus was infecting primarily younger people, who had never been exposed to this flu before, but mostly steering clear of older individuals who had lived through the initial outbreak and likely had a level of immunity.Dr Mermel did suggest there was hope for the next pandemic, however, pointing to work to develop a universal flu vaccine and improvements in antivirals.He said vaccine research would be turbo-charged in the event of another pandemic, using Covid's vaccine development as an example and highlight it took just under a year for the first Covid vaccines to be made available after the virus emerged. The above graphic shows how an avian influenza could be spread to humans, which may trigger the next pandemic The above graphic shows the number of human infections with avian influenza reported in select countries by yearDr Martin Hirsch: Avian influenza or coronavirusesA virologist, a doctor who studies the management and prevention of infection, with more than 50 years of experience and who has worked in the most high-risk BSL-4 labs also said the next pandemic could be sparked by an Avian influenza, but added it could also begin with a coronavirus.Dr Martin Hirsch, currently at Massachusetts General Hospital, warned the outbreak would likely be sparked when the viruses infect an intermediary animal — like a pig — and mutate, allowing them to be transmitted among humans.A pandemic involving a coronavirus, the family of viruses to which Covid-19 belongs, could come from bats, he suggested, while the avian influenza would likely jump from domestic poultry. Dr Martin Hirsch, who has more than 50 years of experience with viruses, said the next pandemic could be triggered by an avian influenza or coronavirusHe said this was likely to occur in either the US, Europe or China, where many animals are kept in dirty, cramped conditions — ripe for diseases to spread.As for when it would happen, he said this was 'very hard to predict' but added flu outbreaks tend to be from 10 to 40 years apart.The last major flu outbreak was the 2009 swine flu pandemic, when 1.4billion people were infected across the globe and 284,000 died from the respiratory infection.'I think coronaviruses and influenza would be most likely to cause the next pandemic,' he told DailyMail.com.He added: 'But I wouldn't rule out other viruses like HIV, Ebola, yellow fever, dengue, which are spread by different routes. They are certainly possibilities.'But, in my mind, I see a respiratory virus as having the greatest chance of quick worldwide transmission.'Certainly, Covid spread that way and also influenza spreads that way, and almost all the major and most recent pandemics and epidemics have been spread due to RNA viruses.'An RNA virus is one that uses RNA protein strands as its building blocks instead of DNA. These viruses are more prone to mutations because RNA is less stable than DNA, raising the risk they could cause a pandemic. Asked whether the next pandemic would be worse than the Covid outbreak, he said: 'That is impossible to say. Nobody expected the last one, but it is possible.'Like Dr Mermel, he also said it was 'possible' that a lab leak could start the next pandemic rather than a natural transmission event. 'I don't think we can rule that out,' he said. 'It is certainly possible that that kind of lab accident can occur and, on rare occasions, it has occurred,' he told DailyMail.comHe added: 'It is extremely important that we maintain rigorous procedures for safety at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs. Scientists also should not be cavalier about what they work with and how they work with it.'I feel strongly that the "gain of function" laboratories should be closely monitored. Their experiments should not be done unless there is a very good reason and they are done under very rigorous containment procedures.'Dr Elmer Gray: Insect-borne diseasesAn entomologist, or a scientist specialized in the study of insects, has warned Americans cannot dismiss disease outbreaks caused by mosquitoes and ticks.Dr Elmer Gray, at the University of Georgia, said warming temperatures coupled with globalization had generated a situation where the US must take it 'year by year' when it comes to disease outbreaks, though he stopped short of saying these kinds of viruses would spark an all-out pandemic.He warned warmer overnight temperatures were fueling the growth of mosquito populations, leaving people at greater risk of infections. Dr Elmer Gray, an entomologist at the University of Georgia, warned insects and ticks could spark outbreaks of infectious diseases in the coming yearsHe also said there was a risk of once-vanquished diseases returning to the United States, such as malaria and dengue fever.This year, Florida, Texas and Maryland all recorded locally-transmitted cases of malaria, causing a flurry of concern among public health experts and officials.Malaria, which is nearly always fatal if left untreated, was eradicated from the US in the 1950s — but cases continue to be imported every year via international travel.Dengue fever — which can leave sufferers with a severe headache, pain behind the eyes and skin rashes — was eradicated in the US in the 1940s and 50s but there was a resurgence in the early 2010s.Dr Gray said another, entirely 'unknown disease' spread by mosquitoes could also take the US by surprise in the coming years.'Every year has the potential for an insect-borne disease outbreak,' he told DailyMail.com. 'This year, we didn't have a tremendous amount of hurricanes... but all the eggs deposited this year are still there and will be ready for the next hurricane for sure.'What really concerns me though is the longer warm seasons.'At night, the water stays warm now allowing those larvae to grow so much faster and that speeds up their life cycle — raising mosquito numbers.'He added: 'Insect-borne diseases are not going to cause the next pandemic, but there is definitely potential for outbreaks and for large areas of concern.'He pointed to several examples from within the last two decades of insect-borne diseases being introduced to the United States and quickly taking root.West Nile Virus, which can cause inflammation of the brain and lifelong disability, now causes an estimated 400,000 infections and 130 deaths per year in the US.It arrived in the US in 1999 in New York and within five years had spread across the entire country. Despite regularly spraying pesticides to stop the disease — which is carried by mosquitoes — from spreading, it has now become endemic across the country.

The cases are on a rise resulting in the most hospitalisations in the monsoon months, says a survey done by the directorate of public health in Chennai. While monsoon rains have also contributed to the flu season, the cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal have also affected the weather conditions in the city.

Blood serum samples of 300 people who were suffering from cold, cough and body pain have been screened by the state public health department in Anna Salai in the past few days. Samples from government and private hospitals were tested and nearly half of them came out positive for Influenza A which is one of the four types of influenza. H3N2 which causes the common flu was seen to be the most common strain followed by H1N1 flu, commonly known as swine flu.

District collector Kranthi Kumar Pati said in a statement that the northeast monsoon is triggering the surge in the flu cases across the district. He advised use of masks in crowded areas, drinking boiled water, washing hands with soap frequently and high protein intake. Health camps are being conducted in the city along with fever camps. The government is also taking data of those being admitted at both government and private hospitals to keep a track of the number of cases. The cases have increased from 20-30 per day to 50 cases per day. The situation in Coimbatore is however not alarming and at an epidemic stage and preventive measures that have been issued will ensure that the virus does not spread further.

Heading straight to the hospital could mean entering a cesspool of viruses.” Published 12 months ago on November 22, 2023 By Manya Koetse Share Tweet In the early morning of November 21, parents are already queuing up at Xi’an Children’s Hospital with their sons and daughters. It’s not even the line for a doctor’s appointment, but rather for the removal of IV needles. The scene was captured in a recent video, only one among many videos and images that have been making their rounds on Chinese social media these days (#凌晨的儿童医院拔针也要排队#). One photo shows a bulletin board at a local hospital warning parents that over 700 patients are waiting in line, estimating a waiting time of more than 13 hours to see a doctor. Another image shows children doing their homework while hooked up on an IV. Recent discussions on Chinese social media platforms have highlighted a notable surge in flu cases. The ongoing flu season is particularly impacting children, with multiple viruses concurrently circulating and contributing to a high incidence of respiratory infections. Among the prevalent respiratory infections affecting children are Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, influenza, and Adenovirus infection. The spike in flu cases has resulted in overcrowded children’s hospitals in Beijing and other Chinese cities. Parents sometimes have to wait in line for hours to get an appointment or pick up medication. According to one reporter at Haibao News (海报新闻), there were so many patients at the Children’s Hospital of Capital Institute of Pediatrics (首都儿科研究所) on November 21st that the outpatient desk stopped accepting new patients by the afternoon. Meanwhile, 628 people were waiting in line to see a doctor at the emergency department. Reflecting on the past few years, the current flu season marks China’s first ‘normal’ flu peak season since the outbreak of Covid-19 in late 2019 / early 2020 and the end of its stringent zero-Covid policies in December 2022. Compared to many other countries, wearing masks was also commonplace for much longer following the relaxation of Covid policies. Hu Xijin, the well-known political commentator, noted on Weibo that this year’s flu season seems to be far worse than that of the years before. He also shared that his own granddaughter was suffering from a 40 degrees fever. “We’re all running a fever in our home. But I didn’t dare to go to the hospital today, although I want my child to go to the hospital tomorrow. I heard waiting times are up to five hours now,” one Weibo user wrote. “Half of the kids in my child’s class are sick now. The hospital is overflowing with people,” another person commented. One mother described how her 7-year-old child had been running a fever for eight days already. Seeking medical attention on the first day, the initial diagnosis was a cold. As the fever persisted, daily visits to the hospital ensued, involving multiple hours for IV fluid administration. While this account stems from a single Weibo post within a fever-advice community, it highlights a broader trend: many parents swiftly resort to hospital visits at the first signs of flu or fever. Several factors contribute to this, including a lack of General Practitioners in China, making hospitals the primary choice for medical consultations also in non-urgent cases. There is also a strong belief in the efficacy of IV infusion therapy, whether fluid-based or containing medication, as the quickest path to recovery. Multiple factors contribute to the widespread and sometimes irrational use of IV infusions in China. Some clinics are profit-driven and see IV infusions as a way to make more money. Widespread expectations among Chinese patients that IV infusions will make them feel better also play a role, along with some physicians’ lacking knowledge of IV therapy or their uncertainty to distinguish bacterial from viral infections (read more here) To prevent an overwhelming influx of patients to hospitals, Chinese state media, citing specialists, advise parents to seek medical attention at the hospital only for sick infants under three months old displaying clear signs of fever (with or without cough). For older children, it is recommended to consult a doctor if a high fever persists for 3 to 5 days or if there is a deterioration in respiratory symptoms. Children dealing with fever and (mild) respiratory symptoms can otherwise recover at home. One Weibo blogger (@奶霸知道) warned parents that taking their child straight to the hospital on the first day of them getting sick could actually be a bad idea. They write: “(..) pediatric departments are already packed with patients, and it’s not just Mycoplasma infections anymore. Cases include influenza, Covid-19, Norovirus, and Adenovirus. And then, of course, those with bad luck are cross-infected with multiple viruses at the same time, leading to endless cycles. Therefore, if your child experiences mild coughing or a slight fever, consider observing at home first. Heading straight to the hospital could mean entering a cesspool of viruses.” The hashtag for “fever” saw over 350 million clicks on Weibo within one day on November 22. Meanwhile, there are also other ongoing discussions on Weibo surrounding the current flu season. One topic revolves around whether children should continue doing their homework while receiving IV fluids in the hospital. Some hospitals have designated special desks and study areas for children. Although some commenters commend the hospitals for being so considerate, others also remind the parents not to pressure their kids too much and to let them rest when they are not feeling well. Opinions vary: although some on Chinese social media say it's very thoughtful for hospitals to set up areas where kids can study and read, others blame parents for pressuring their kids to do homework at the hospital instead of resting when not feeling well. pic.twitter.com/gnQD9tFW2c — Manya Koetse (@manyapan) November 22, 2023 By Manya Koetse, with contributions from Miranda Barnes Follow @whatsonweibo Get the story behind the hashtag.

Required fields are marked *Comment * Name * Email * Website China and Covid19 Weibo Watch: Small Earthquakes in Wuhan How Wuhan is shaking off its past with a new wave of innovation, the hot topics to know, and the Weibo catchphrase of the week: ‘the Three Questions of Patriotism.’ Published 2 months ago on September 27, 2024 By Manya Koetse PREMIUM NEWSLETTER | ISSUE #37 Dear Reader, “Wuhan Earthquake” (#武汉地震#) momentarily became the number one trending topic on Weibo this Friday night, after residents of Jiangxia District reported feeling their homes and buildings shake. “Was there an earthquake, or am I drunk?” some wondered. I also felt a bit tipsy in Wuhan this month. Neon signs, dancing livestreamers, flying drones, bustling night markets, and holographic lights. On my first night in Wuhan, the lights made me dizzy and I discovered that the city was nothing like I had imagined. Until now, I couldn’t help but associate Wuhan with the wet market, crowded fever clinics, and China’s first Covid hospitals. As the world watched the pandemic unfold in 2020, Wuhan became instantly famous as an early epicenter of the Covid-19 crisis. It became known as the quarantined city, the city of Dr. Li Wenliang, and the city of the “invincible Wuhan man.” At the time, it seemed like such a monumental event that Wuhan would not recover anytime soon, even after enduring the worst peak of Covid. Now, over four years later, everything feels different. I felt a rush of energy as I strolled through the lively streets. It was evident that Wuhan is much more than the city that gained global notoriety as the pandemic hotspot. Beyond its vibrant atmosphere, it is making international headlines for its leadership in autonomous driving, having emerged as the world’s largest testing ground for self-driving cars, particularly in unmanned ride-hailing services. Baidu’s Apollo Go, referred to as Luobo Kuaipao (萝卜快跑) in Chinese, is the driving force behind the robotaxi revolution in Wuhan. Since their arrival earlier this year, they have become a hot topic on Chinese social media, and I was eager to experience it for myself. (Brief explainer: Luóbo (萝卜) means radish or turnip in Chinese, but when pronounced, it sounds similar to “robo.” Kuàipǎo (快跑) translates to “run fast.” Combined, it creates a playful name that can be interpreted as “Radish Runs Fast” or “Robo Go.” I’ll use ‘Luobo’ here, as it is the most common way to refer to Apollo Go in China and has a cute sound.) In the areas where the robotaxis operate, people already seem to have become accustomed to the driverless ‘Luobo.’ During a 1.5-hour ride in the unmanned taxi—I took a long journey and then needed to return again—I was surprised to see so many of them on the road. Other drivers, motorcyclists, and passengers didn’t even bat an eye anymore when encountering the new AI taxi. Currently, there is an active fleet of 400 cars in Wuhan, and Baidu plans to expand this to 1,000 in the fourth quarter of this year. Although these taxis still comprise only a fraction of the city’s entire taxi industry, their impact is noticeable on the roads, where you will inevitably encounter them. I stood at one drop-off point near an urban shopping center for at least forty minutes and witnessed passengers being dropped off continually, with some proceeding their journeys into areas where Luobo doesn’t operate by calling the ride-hailing service Didi from there. As for the experience itself, it was thrilling to see the steering wheel move with no driver in the front seat. I was surprised at how quickly I adapted to something so unfamiliar. It’s incredibly comfortable to have a car to yourself—no driver, no worries—while you choose your own music (and sing along), set the air conditioning, and relax as the Luobo navigates the traffic. Even inside the vehicle, Baidu emphasizes the safety of their self-driving cars, providing information about how Apollo Go has accumulated over 100 million kilometers of autonomous driving testing without any major accidents, thanks to a strict safety management system. If you close your eyes, the experience feels like riding with a regular driver. Luobo speeds up, slows down, and occasionally makes unexpected maneuvers when a car or bike suddenly approaches. It ensures there’s enough space between itself and the car in front. While I can’t say that merging onto the highway or encountering unexpected traffic situations didn’t feel a bit scary, I soon felt at ease and came to rely on the technology. That said, there are still bumps in the road. Luobo has often been ridiculed on Chinese social media for getting stuck at a green light, stopping for a garbage bag, or struggling to make a U-turn. While riding and observing the robotaxis in Wuhan, I noticed plenty of honking and road rage as Luobo chooses safety first, often appearing sluggish, earning them the nickname ‘Sháo Luóbo’ (勺萝卜/苕萝卜, “silly radish”). While Luobo might still have its silly moments, it is a serious part of the future. Already, it is popular among commuters for its low cost, privacy, and convenience. After spending an entire morning riding and watching the Luobos, I excitedly felt like I had experienced a glimpse of the future. Right now, Luobo Kuaipao operates in various cities across China, including Beijing, but it’s still in the testing phase there—none of my friends from Beijing have ever seen or taken one yet. However, this will likely change soon, heavily relying on policy support. That night, I spoke to a young local in a busy commercial area near my hotel. Like many residents, he was curious about where I came from and what I was doing in Wuhan. (During the four days I spent there, I noticed very few foreign tourists.) We briefly discussed the pandemic; he reflected on the difficulties it brought but treated it as something from the past—just another bump in the road in the city’s long history. Instead of dwelling on the pandemic, our conversation focused on the future: Wuhan’s robotaxis, his confidence in China’s technology, and the rising importance of his country on the geopolitical stage. He was just one of several young people I spoke to, from shopkeepers to students, who seemed very focused on China’s growth and development and how its technological advancements reflect its position in a world where the U.S. is no longer leading. When it comes to China’s driverless innovations, they are shaking the foundations of transportation like an earthquake. Besides Apollo Go, companies like Pony.ai (小马智行), WeRide (文远知行), SAIC Motor (上汽集团), AutoX (安途), FAW (一汽), Changan Automobile (长安汽车), BYD (比亚迪), Yutong (宇通), and many other industry players are also working to realize driverless passenger cars, shuttle services, freight trucks, delivery vehicles, public transport buses, and much more. What we’re witnessing in Wuhan is merely a glimpse into a future under construction, actively promoted by Chinese state media. Over the past week alone, CCTV featured Luobo Kuaipao in three segments as a key example of China’s new technological advancements and the national strategy to build a strong tech-driven economy. As I left Wuhan in a traditional taxi, I suddenly felt like a time traveler. Wuhan was the birthplace of the 1911 revolution and will also appear in foreign history books as the initial epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, it is at the center of an international robotaxi revolution, and it won’t be the same the next time I return. While my friendly elderly driver—I estimated him to be in his late 50s—honked at other cars, I realized he had witnessed many other revolutions, including the Cultural Revolution as a young boy, the economic reforms, and the major social changes of the 1980s, as well as the digital revolution of the 2000s. With the growth of Wuhan’s robotaxi fleet, his job might be affected, adding another tremor to his city and his life—though he may already be retired by then. As he helped me with my luggage and wished me a safe trip home at the Wuhan Hankou Station, I couldn’t help but feel nostalgic about how everything always changes and gets shaken up as we move forward into a future driven by technology. As for Friday’s earthquake in Wuhan—it turns out it was a 1.6. Despite the online interest in the topic, it means virtually nothing in a city where things of much greater magnitude are happening. If you’d like to know more about my experiences and the slight setback I encountered while searching for Wuhan’s robotaxis, check out the short videos I made here: Part 1 (also on Instagram) Part 2 (also on Instagram). Best, Manya Koetse (@manyapan) What To Know A recap of hot highlights and online discussions 🚀 China’s First Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Test-Launch Since 1980 On the morning of September 25, China announced a successful test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) carrying a ‘dummy warhead’ into the Pacific Ocean. This marked the first ICBM launch in decades, described by official media as part of routine annual training. The People’s Daily Weibo account of the Communist Party shared a video of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) announcing the successful test launch, accompanied by suspenseful and patriotic music, specifically the “March of the Steel Torrent” (钢铁洪流进行曲) (see video). This launch quickly became a trending topic (#我军向太平洋发射洲际弹道导弹#). While Chinese state media claimed that Beijing informed relevant countries in advance, Japan stated that it did not receive any prior notice, further heightening tensions between China and Japan. 🇯🇵 Aftermath of Japanese Schoolboy Stabbing The incident in which a Chinese man fatally stabbed a ten-year-old Japanese schoolboy near the Shenzhen Japanese School on September 18 has become a widely discussed topic this month. The attacker, a 44-year-old Chinese national, was immediately arrested. However, discussions about the stabbing are ongoing, as it has sparked a wave of anger in Japan, where critics argue that anti-Japanese sentiments in China are fueled by official media and national education. Meanwhile, China and Japan have effectively resolved their diplomatic dispute regarding the Fukushima water discharge, with some suggesting a connection between the two events. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning (毛宁) stated on September 20 that the issues are not related (#中日共识与日本男童遇袭无关#). Beyond the geopolitical implications, the international media coverage of the stabbing incident has also provoked anger on Chinese social media, where many netizens reject the supposed negative portrayal of China. The topic is quite sensitive and continues to face significant censorship online. 📱 Huawei Trifold Phone The launch of Huawei’s ‘trifold’ phone earlier this month generated significant excitement in China, with many believing that Huawei—and, by extension, China—is now at the forefront of innovation in the folding screen smartphone race. The Mate XT is the first triple-folding screen phone, leading some top commenters to proclaim, “Huawei’s innovation capability is truly the best in the world. While other manufacturers are still researching foldable phones, Huawei has already released the trifold.” During my travels in China over the past few weeks, I visited several Huawei stores, but unfortunately, the trifold was never on display; it’s available only by reservation and has allegedly garnered millions of pre-orders, despite its hefty price tag of CNY 19,999 (USD 2,850). There’s also been some lighthearted banter surrounding the phone, including a viral post that humorously depicts what it looks like when you make a phone call with the screen unfolded (it looks ridiculous), and a user who taped two phones together to create a sixfold. 👴 Retirement Age Discussions News came out last week that China will raise its retirement age for the first time since the 1950s. China’s current retirement ages are among the world’s lowest. Facing an aging society and declining birth rates, the ages will now be increased in a step-by-step implementation process: 50 to 55 for women in blue-collar jobs, 55 to 58 for females in white-collar jobs, and 60 to 63 for male workers. This change, set to take effect on January 1, 2025, has already sparked considerable discussion this year after experts proposed the adjustment. A related hashtag has garnered over 870 million views on Weibo (#延迟法定退休年龄改革#), where many users expressed their dissatisfaction with the change. “Great, I’ll get to retire in September of 2051 now,” one young worker wrote. “We start studying earlier and retire later; how can we keep up with this?” 📷 Hidden Hotel Cameras After a Chinese blogger known as “Shadows Don’t Lie” (@影子不会说谎) recently discovered and exposed hidden cameras in the rooms of two guesthouses in Shijiazhuang, he faced significant intimidation and threats from the owners and employees, who accused him of staging the situation for attention. However, the situation turned out to be real, and local police arrested multiple suspects responsible for installing these cameras inside these hotel rooms, which are often rented by young couples for romantic short stays. The suspects reportedly did not know the guesthouse owners and had secretly set up the cameras to profit illegally. This incident, which continues to generate discussion online, has heightened public concern over privacy protection and the integrity of the guesthouse industry, particularly as this is not the first time such issues have been revealed. Weibo Word of the Week The catchword to know The Three Questions of Patriotism Our Weibo word of the week is 爱国三问 (àiguó sān wèn), which translates to “The Three Questions of Patriotism.” This phrase has recently gained attention on Chinese social media as it was highlighted and propagated by official media channels. The three questions are: 1. Are you Chinese? (你是中国人吗) 2. Do you love China? (你爱中国吗) 3. Do you wish China well? (你愿意中国好吗) These questions were originally posed in 1935 by Zhang Boling (张伯苓), the first president of the renowned Nankai University (南开大学) in Tianjin. Today, they are being revived on Chinese social media through various videos released by official channels. One notable video is part of a new online series produced by state media titled “Great Educators” (大教育家), which features reenactments of speeches by prominent Chinese educators. In this series, Zhang Boling’s speech, portrayed by actor Wang Ban (王斑), emphasizes the importance of unity in tumultuous times. Rather than dwelling on differences, Zhang urged people to recognize their shared identity: they are all Chinese, they love China, and they all aspire for the country’s prosperity. Another video features Nankai University’s current president, Chen Yulu (陈雨露), addressing students during a large event on September 21st. In his speech, Chen reiterates the three famous questions, prompting the hundreds of students in attendance to respond enthusiastically: “We are [Chinese]!” “We love [China]!” “We wish [China well]! We want China to be strong and prosperous!” This response is followed by enthusiastic applause. Additionally, another video from the same day features a meeting between Chen Yulu and an AI version of Zhang Boling, digitally resurrected to address the students and celebrate the start of the new school year. During this ‘virtual dialogue,’ Chen informs Zhang that his ‘Three Questions of Patriotism’ have become a cherished tradition at Nankai’s annual opening ceremony. According to Chinese state media, the students’ responses to these three questions illustrate how contemporary Chinese youth are aligning their personal aspirations with national progress. This alignment is seen as a revival of the patriotic spirit that Zhang Boling instilled in students during wartime. However, the current ‘revival’ of this sentiment appears to be largely reflected across various official channels, with limited engagement from ordinary netizens.

Continue Reading China and Covid19 Repurposing China’s Abandoned Nucleic Acid Booths: 10 Innovative Transformations Abandoned nucleic acid booths are getting a second life through these new initiatives. Published 1 year ago on May 19, 2023 By Manya Koetse During the pandemic, nucleic acid testing booths in Chinese cities were primarily focused on maintaining physical distance. Now, empty booths are being repurposed to bring people together, serving as new spaces to serve the community and promote social engagement. Just months ago, nucleic acid testing booths were the most lively spots of some Chinese cities. During the 2022 Shanghai summer, for example, there were massive queues in front of the city’s nucleic acid booths, as people needed a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours for accessing public transport, going to work, or visiting markets and malls. The word ‘hésuān tíng‘ (核酸亭), nucleic acid booth (also：核酸采样小屋), became a part of China’s pandemic lexicon, just like hésuān dìtú (核酸地图), the nucleic acid test map lauched in May 2022 that would show where you can get a nucleic test. Example of nucleic acid test map. During Halloween parties in Shanghai in 2022, some people even came dressed up as nucleic test booths – although local authorities could not appreciate the creative costume. Halloween 2022: dressed up as nucliec acid booths. Via @manyapan twitter. In December 2022, along with the announced changed rules in China’s ‘zero Covid’ approach, nucleic acid booths were suddenly left dismantled and empty. With many cities spending millions to set up these booths in central locations, the question soon arose: what should they do with the abandoned booths? This question also relates to who actually owns them, since the ownership is mixed. Some booths were purchased by authorities, others were bought by companies, and there are also local communities owning their own testing booths. Depending on the contracts and legal implications, not all booths are able to get a new function or be removed yet (Worker’s Daily). In Tianjin, a total of 266 nucleic acid booths located in Jinghai District were listed for public acquisition earlier this month, and they were acquired for 4.78 million yuan (US$683.300) by a local food and beverage company which will transform the booths into convenience service points, selling snacks or providing other services. Tianjin is not the only city where old nucleic acid testing booths are being repurposed. While some booths have been discarded, some companies and/or local governments – in cooperation with local communities – have demonstrated creativity by transforming the booths into new landmarks. Since the start of 2023, different cities and districts across China have already begun to repurpose testing booths. Here, we will explore ten different way in which China’s abandoned nucleic test booths get a second chance at a meaningful existence. 1: Pharmacy/Medical Booths Via ‘copyquan’ republished on Sohu. Blogger ‘copyquan’ recently explored various ways in which abandoned PCR testing points are being repurposed. One way in which they are used is as small pharmacies or as medical service points for local residents (居民医疗点). Alleviating the strain on hospitals and pharmacies, this was one of the earliest ways in which the booths were repurposed back in December of 2022 and January of 2023. Chongqing, Tianjin, and Suzhou were among earlier cities where some testing booths were transformed into convenient medical facilities. 2: Market Stalls Market stalls instead of nucliec acid testing booths. Image via Sina. In Suzhou, Jiangsu province, the local government transformed vacant nucleic acid booths into market stalls for the Spring Festival in January 2022, offering them free of charge to businesses to sell local products, snacks, and traditional New Year goods. The idea was not just meant as a way for small businesses to conveniently sell to local residents, it was also meant as a way to attract more shoppers and promote other businesses in the neighborhood. 3: Community Service Center Small grid community center in Shizhuang Village, image via Sohu. Some residential areas have transformed their local nucleic acid testing booths into community service centers, offering all kinds of convenient services to neighborhood residents. These little station are called wǎnggé yìzhàn (网格驿站) or “grid service stations,” and they can serve as small community centers where residents can get various kinds of care and support. 4: “Refuel” Stations In February of this year, 100 idle nucleic acid sampling booths were transformed into so-called “Rider Refuel Stations” (骑士加油站) in Zhejiang’s Pinghu. Although it initially sounds like a place where delivery riders can fill up their fuel tanks, it is actually meant as a place where they themselves can recharge. Delivery riders and other outdoor workers can come to the ‘refuel’ station to drink some water or tea, warm their hands, warm up some food and take a quick nap. 5: Free Libraries image via sohu. In various Chinese cities, abandoned nucleic acid booths have been transformed into little free libraries where people can grab some books to read, donate or return other books, and sit down for some reading. Changzhou is one of the places where you’ll find such “drifting bookstores” (漂流书屋) (see video), but similar initiatives have also been launched in other places, including Suzhou. 6: Study Space Photos via Copyquan’s article on Sohu. Another innovative way in which old testing points are being repurposed is by turning them into places where students can sit together to study. The so-called “Let’s Study Space” (一间习吧), fully airconditioned, are opened from 8 in the morning until 22:00 at night. Students – or any citizens who would like a nice place to study – can make online reservations with their ID cards and scan a QR code to enter the study rooms. There are currently ten study booths in Anji, and the popular project is an initiative by the Anji County Library in Zhejiang (see video). 7: Beer Kiosk Hoegaarden beer shop, image via Creative Adquan. Changing an old nucleic acid testing booth into a beer bar is a marketing initiative by the Shanghai McCann ad agency for the Belgium beer brand Hoegaarden. The idea behind the bar is to celebrate a new spring after the pandemic. The ad agency has revamped a total of six formr nucleic acid booths into small Hoegaarden ‘beer gardens.’ 8: Police Box In Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province, authorities have repurposed old testing booths and transformed them into ‘police boxes’ (警务岗亭) to enhance security and improve the visibility of city police among the public. Currently, a total of eight vacant nucleic acid booths have been renovated into modern police stations, serving as key points for police presence and interaction with the community. 9: Lottery Ticket Booths Image via The Paper Some nucleic acid booths have now been turned into small shops selling lottery tickets for the China Welfare Lottery. One such place turning the kiosks into lottery shops is Songjiang in Shanghai. Using the booths like this is a win-win situation: they are placed in central locations so it is more convenient for locals to get their lottery tickets, and on the other hand, the sales also help the community, as the profits are used for welfare projects, including care for the elderly. 10: Mini Fire Stations Micro fire stations, images via ZjNews. Some communities decided that it would be useful to repurpose the testing points and turn them into mini fire kiosks, just allowing enough space for the necessary equipment to quickly respond to fire emergencies.

During “Black Friday” weekend, a vaccination event will be held at Plaza Las Américas in Hato Rey from Friday to Sunday.By The Star StaffIn the face of the recent influenza epidemic in Puerto Rico, VOCES Puerto Rico’s Coalition for Immunization and Health Promotion called late last week for vaccination and a resilient attitude to face the public health threat, stressing the importance of preventive measures such as vaccination.“By getting vaccinated and taking precautions, we are strengthening the community’s capacity to overcome this serious health situation at risk,” VOCES CEO Lilliam Rodríguez Capó said. “There is protection for everyone from 6 months of age to older adults.” The Department of Health has declared a state of epidemic, the first since 2016, with more than 13,666 cases in young people, 9,656 in adults and 2,578 in older adults. The most affected regions are Caguas and Ponce, with mass vaccination underway throughout the island.“Vaccination is an act of solidarity to protect the most vulnerable in our society,” Rodríguez Capó added. “Together we can build an immunity barrier that benefits the entire community.”Flu symptoms include fever, chills, cough and sore throat, among others. In addition to the vaccine, it is recommended to avoid contact with sick people and maintain proper hygiene. VOCES is committed to educating about the importance of vaccination, with vaccines available at 330 Centers, pharmacies, and through health plans.Vaccination events will be held at Ralph’s Food Warehouse today in Humacao and Tuesday in Yabucoa. During “Black Friday” weekend, a vaccination event will be held at Plaza Las Américas in Hato Rey, San Juan from Friday to Sunday.Local18 views0 commentsPost not marked as likedRecent PostsSee AllYoung adults in PR face acute financial strains, study finds1382 comments2Post not marked as likedHouse of Representatives begins transition process2101 comment1Post not marked as likedMan held after woman’s body is found in suitcase740 comments0Post not marked as likedAbout UsContact UsPrint EditionsPrivacy PoliciesMoreUse tab to navigate through the menu items.© 2024 The San Juan Daily Star - Puerto Ricobottom of pageChina says no 'unusual or novel pathogens' after WHO queries respiratory outbreaks - BBC NewsBBC HomepageSkip to contentAccessibility HelpYour accountHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelMore menuMore menuSearch BBCHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsClose menuBBC NewsMenuHomeIsrael-Gaza warWar in UkraineClimateVideoWorldAsiaUKBusinessTechMoreScienceEntertainment & ArtsHealthWorld News TVIn PicturesBBC VerifyNewsbeatAsiaChinaIndiaChina says no 'unusual or novel pathogens' after WHO queries respiratory outbreaksPublished24 November 2023Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Mayur KakadeBy Phelan Chatterjee, Fergus Walsh & Tulip MazumdarBBC NewsChina has reported no "unusual or novel pathogens" in clusters of child pneumonia cases, the World Health Organization has said.Beijing has attributed a rise in flu-like illnesses to the lifting of Covid curbs, said the WHO, which had requested for more data on the cases.Still it urged residents in China to take precautions, like getting vaccinated and wearing masks.Local media had in recent days reported hospitals being overwhelmed.In a statement, external on Wednesday, the WHO said it requested China for more information on reports in the media and from ProMed - a global outbreak surveillance system - of "clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China".Pneumonia is a general medical term used to describe an infection and inflammation of the lungs. It can be caused by many different viruses, bacteria or fungi. After the WHO's request, state-run Xinhua news agency, external published an article which quoted officials of China's National Health Commission (NHC) as saying they were paying close attention to the diagnosis and care of children with respiratory illnesses.Later on Thursday, the WHO said in a statement, external that China has not detected any "unusual or novel pathogens", and that the increase in respiratory illnesses spreading in the north of the country was due to "multiple known pathogens".Since October, northern China has reported an "increase in influenza-like illness" compared to the same period over the past three years, the WHO said."Some of these increases are earlier in the season than historically experienced, but not unexpected given the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries," the statement said. The WHO said it is "closely monitoring the situation and is in close contact with national authorities in China".Relics of zero-Covid dot China as life moves on The childhood diseases making a post-lockdown comebackWhile mentions of China and a wave of infection can get people jittery as it brings memories of the Covid-19 pandemic, it's good practice for the WHO to ask for clarity. It is also not unusual for the WHO to ask countries for more information about a cluster of illnesses. They do so almost every day. A specialist WHO team combs through thousands of media reports and internal surveillance information on circulating diseases from countries on a daily basis. Experts then decide whether they need more information, in case it could have the potential to become a public health emergency of international concern.But it is unusual to announce the request for more information publicly. In general, this has previously been done through private channels between the WHO and health officials in a country. The UN agency is no doubt mindful that people might be more jumpy about viruses reported in China with the not so distant memory of Covid-19. The WHO is also trying to be more transparent in the aftermath of the pandemic.The UK's health security agency (UKHSA) said it was closely monitoring the situation. Last week, the Chinese NHC said there had been a rise in several respiratory diseases across the country: in particular influenza, Covid, mycoplasma pneumoniae - a common bacterial infection affecting younger children - and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Officials attributed the rise to the lifting of Covid restrictions.Other countries, including the UK and the US, saw similar surges in flu-like illnesses once pandemic restrictions were lifted."China is likely experiencing a major wave of childhood respiratory infections now as this is the first winter after their lengthy lockdown, which must have drastically reduced the circulation of respiratory bugs, and hence decreased immunity to endemic bugs," said Prof Francois Balloux of the University College of London Genetics Institute.Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia (UEA), said at present there was too little information to make a definitive diagnosis of what was causing the infections. He added: "Overall, this does not sound to me like an epidemic due to a novel [new] virus. If it was, I would expect to see many more infections in adults. The few infections reported in adults suggest existing immunity from a prior exposure."Related topicsPublic healthChildrenAsiaChinaRespiratory diseasesMore on this storyIs Covid now just a regular winter bug?Published31 October 2023'Long colds' can be a thing, like long CovidPublished6 October 2023Top storiesAssisted dying bill has strict safeguards, says MP proposing law changePublished29 minutes agoGary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the DayPublished5 hours agoWatch: 'Any good?'

(Photo: AFP) Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Nov 23, 2023 14:43 ISTChina, in the midst of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, is battling another health emergency. An unknown pneumonia outbreak is spreading through schools, leading to a surge in hospitalised children. The outbreak is concentrated in Beijing and Liaoning province, resulting in pediatric hospitals being overwhelmed. Classes in some schools have been suspended. The international disease surveillance platform, ProMed, issued an alert over the undiagnosed pneumonia affecting children. advertisementThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has requested detailed information from China on the increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children. Chinese authorities have attributed the increase to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens. The WHO has advised people in China to follow measures to reduce the risk of respiratory illness.While the outbreak's origin remains uncertain, medical professionals speculate that mycoplasma pneumoniae, also known as 'walking pneumonia', might be the cause. No deaths have been reported so far.What is pneumonia? Pneumonia, an infection impacting the lungs, can affect one or both lungs, leading to the filling of air sacs (alveoli) with fluid or pus. The culprits behind pneumonia include bacteria, viruses, or fungi, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. How is China's outbreak different?Common indicators include a cough, with or without mucus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. The severity of pneumonia is influenced by factors such as age, overall health, and the specific cause of the infection.However, in the case of China's pneumonia outbreak, the symptoms include high fever and lung inflammation, but no cough.Treatment approaches for pneumonia may involve antibiotics, antiviral medications, or antifungal drugs, and recovery can span several weeks.Dr Tushar Tayal, Consultant, Internal Medicine at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, told IndiaToday.In that, the situation is an outbreak of an influenza-like illness showing high-grade fever without any other symptoms. "Fever, with or without chills, is a common symptom of any viral or bacterial infection. Additional symptoms such as runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, and loose stools may be present, but they are not always necessary," said Dr Tushar Tayal. Numerous viruses, such as adenovirus, influenza virus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and Covid-19 virus, can cause such symptoms. Additionally, multiple bacteria and certain atypical bacteria, such as spirochetes and leptospira, can present with fever and pneumonia.What are the preventive measures?Dr Srivatsa Lokeshwaran, Lead Consultant and Head of Department, Interventional Pulmonology and Lung Transplant, Aster Whitefield Hospital, Bangalore, told IndiaToday.In that while it is too early to determine whether the current infection will develop into a pandemic, personal protective measures, such as wearing triple-ply masks, practising frequent hand sanitisation, and maintaining social distancing are set in place.Dr Lokeshwaran shared that since mid-October, the northern part of China has been witnessing several influenza-like cases in clusters among children.Are there specific signs or symptoms that doctors in India should be attentive to? The expert added, "When we say influenza-like illness we refer to symptoms of fever, sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, cough, and breathlessness. However, these symptoms have to be ready in the correct context and treated accordingly."Published By: Daphne ClarancePublished On: Nov 23, 2023ALSO READ | People who stuck by Covid rules have worst mental health.

The influenza vaccine is desirable for elders above 65 years and children between 6 months to 8 years.In a letter to deputy directors of health services and corporation health officers, Dr T S Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine said, "Seasonal influenza may affect all age groups and incidence is higher in children and senior citizens above 65 years. It is an air-brine from person to person through large droplets. If a person has symptoms such as chills, body ache, fever, temperature rise between 38.4 degree Celsius and 41 degree Celsius for more than three days they are advised to take a test."Those who are hospitalized tested positive for influenza should be discharged in a week after the symptoms subsided. And children should be discharged in 14 days. The official has instructed regarding wearing masks in public places that patients in isolated wards should wear a triple layer mask, the medical person should be provided with triple layer mask and PPE kit. Also, those who are working in critical care facilities, laboratories and mortuaries are urged to wear N95 masks as part of safety measures."The influenza vaccination is recommended for the prioritized groups such as healthcare workers working in casualty, emergency department, ICU and isolation wards.

Among the public, pregnant women, people with chronic illness and children having chronic diseases like asthma, neurodevelopmental conditions and heart diseases, " noted the guidelines.TamilnaduInfluenza CasesPreventive MedicineNortheast Monsoon SeasonHealth ServicesAir-BrineDTNEXT Bureau Next StoryRelated ArticlesMost Read About Us Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Use Subscription © Copyright | Powered by HocalwireXNepal on alert as China reports spread of mysterious pneumonia virusNationalPoliticsValleyOpinionMoneySportsCulture & Lifestyle NationalMadhesh ProvinceLumbini ProvinceBagmati ProvinceNational SecurityKoshi ProvinceGandaki ProvinceKarnali ProvinceSudurpaschim ProvincePoliticsValleyKathmanduLalitpurBhaktapurOpinionColumnsAs it isLettersEditorialCartoonMoneySportsCricketFootballInternational SportsCulture & LifestyleArtsBrunch with the PostMoviesLife & StyleTheaterEntertainmentBooksFashionHealthFoodRecipesTravelInvestigationsClimate & EnvironmentWorldScience & TechnologyInterviewsVisual StoriesCrosswords & SudokuHoroscopeForexCorrectionsLetters to the EditorToday's ePaper Tuesday, November 12, 2024 Without Fear or FavourUNWIND IN STYLE 17.12°C KathmanduAir Quality in Kathmandu: 153300+Hazardous0-50Good51-100Moderate101-150Unhealty for Sensitive Groups151-200Unhealthy201-300Very Unhealthy Tue, Nov 12, 202417.12°C KathmanduAir Quality in Kathmandu: 153 What's News :Dedicated and trunk lines disputes Dengue cases rise Floods & landslides havoc Large cardamom price Nepal Premier League Health Nepal on alert as China reports spread of mysterious pneumonia virusSeveral viruses, bacteria causing pneumonia outbreak in China said to be circulating here. ShutterstockbookmarkfacebooktwitterWhatsappmail Arjun PoudelPublished at : November 24, 2023 Updated at : November 24, 2023 07:37 Influenza, Covid-19, and respiratory syncytial are common viruses circulating in Nepal that lead to sickness and pneumonia. Likewise, Mycoplasma pneumonia and pneumococcus are common bacterial infections in the country that cause pneumonia, especially in children.According to reports, the same viruses and bacteria are responsible for the ongoing outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia in northern China.The World Health Organization on Wednesday made an official request to China for detailed information on the spike in respiratory illness and reported clusters of pneumonia in children.Since mid-October, northern China has reported an increase in influenza-like illness compared to the same period in the previous three years, according to the UN health body. Chinese authorities attributed the increase to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the circulation of pathogens.Health officials in Nepal said no agency alerted them to the mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in China. However, they say that they are aware of the news as well as the World Health Organisation’s request to the Chinese health authorities.“All the said viruses and bacteria are common in our country and are in circulation,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the National Public Health Laboratory. “We have been carrying out regular surveillance of those pathogens.”October-November is the peak flu season in Nepal, and multiple respiratory viruses have been spreading. Major hospitals in Kathmandu reported infection of respiratory viruses—influenza A(H1N1), A (H3) and influenza B—have already shot up.Though the Ministry of Health and Population has not reported a major spike in Covid cases, experts say the virus is still circulating in communities. As very few people in Nepal get flu shots, unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity will be at risk of getting severe infections of respiratory viruses, experts say.Seasonal influenza causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.“We have to step up the surveillance in the country and keep close vigilance on new developments about the outbreaks in China,” said Dr Shrawan Kumar Mishra, director at the Provincial Public Health Laboratory of Madhesh Province. “The Central Lab (NPHL), which carries out testing of the respiratory syncytial virus, should closely monitor the situation if the virus is causing a rise in infection rate.”Experts suggest authorities concerned carry out tests on samples for respiratory syncytial virus when the tests for influenza, Covid or other pathogens come back negative.“We have been conducting respiratory syncytial virus testing on some samples,” said Bhatta. “If needed, we are ready to increase such tests.”Experts say early diagnosis is crucial to preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Experts also said that both the severity of the disease and deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time.Public health measures—mask-wearing, handwashing, avoiding crowds, and maintaining social distancing—can cut down on infections, according to doctors.

Along with there being no outbreaks of bird flu in poultry in Ireland this year, there are fewer wild birds showing up positive for it.Mon, 20 Nov, 2023 - 16:25Kathleen O'Sullivan    The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) is seeking tenders for a €1m depopulation services contract for bird flocks on poultry premises in the event there are outbreaks of avian influenza (bird flu).The National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) is a division of the DAFM responsible for "maintaining contingency preparedness for, and control of exotic transboundary animal diseases".According to the tender request description by the department, under this remit, the NDCC may require the depopulation of poultry premises in the event of an outbreak of diseases such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird flu) and Newcastle disease because of the "potential impact an outbreak of either disease is likely to have on animal health, public health or trade". "Avian influenza remains a constant threat to the Irish poultry industry because of the risk from migratory wild birds," the department said. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza of the H5N1 subtype has been very prevalent across the EU in 2021/2022 and the most recent outbreak of avian influenza in poultry in Ireland occurred in November 2022. "Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have also been detected in wild birds in Ireland in recent years."Newcastle disease is also a threat to Irish poultry due to potential circulation in wild birds and pigeons and sporadic outbreaks occurring in other EU member states." Stringent measures In accordance with EU legislation governing both of these diseases, it is required that stringent measures are put in place in the event of a confirmed outbreak, including humane culling of all poultry on the affected premises in order to prevent the onward spread of the disease. The department said it requires "an end-to-end service for poultry depopulation using whole house gassing method using carbon dioxide, or other inert gas". The department said it is "extremely important to authorities in Ireland to deal with outbreaks of high impact poultry diseases" such as bird flu "in a timely manner in order to mitigate against the spread of the disease".Over 31m birds There is an estimated total poultry population of approximately 31.5m birds in the Republic of Ireland, according to the department's register.Based on the 2019 poultry survey, there are over 7,000 active poultry holdings registered with the department.Of these, over 1,300 keep greater than 1,000 birds, approximately 700 report capacity for over 10,000 birds, and over 250 holdings have capacity for greater than 40,000 birds. Bird cullings While Ireland emerged largely unscathed from the bird flu emergency last year, in November 2022, outbreaks of the disease were confirmed in two poultry flocks in Co Monaghan, which led to around 8,000 birds being culled.Strict measures were put in place to protect other flocks a year ago; farmers were ordered to house all poultry. This rule was then lifted in the following April.The UK and France suffered significantly with bird flu with huge culls taking place, and it had been feared this time last year that Ireland would experience the same fate.France in recent months has begun mass vaccination of its ducks against bird flu.Lower risk Along with there being no outbreaks of bird flu in poultry in Ireland this year, there are fewer wild birds showing up positive for it, Department of Agriculture senior superintending veterinary inspector Paul Corkery has said.The overall situation currently "looks good" and it is hoped an outbreak in poultry can be avoided — but Mr Corkery warns that "we can never be sure"."We’re looking at the risk, and the risk at this stage appears to be lower than it was last year that we would have an outbreak in poultry," he said.Mr Corkery added that in some wild bird populations “there seems to be more immunity”.Read More'Good news' for Christmas dinner as farms avoid bird flu this year more farming - agribusiness articles Revealed: billionaires are ‘ultimate beneficiaries’ linked to €3bn of EU farming subsidies Dairy giant Lactalis to cut 450 million litres from milk pool Sheep trade moves in one direction More in this section Revealed: billionaires are ‘ultimate beneficiaries’ linked to €3bn of EU farming subsidies Crypto vaccine launched for 2025 calvers Future under the spotlight at Nuffield event #Farming - Agribusiness#Farming - Pigs and PoultryBird Flu FTMTA Farm Machinery Show: First chance to see some of ag's most exciting innovationsREAD NOW Subscribe Now SEARCH FARMING TOPICS Agribusiness and Tech Beef and Sheep sector Columnists Dairy sector Emission targets 25by30 Munster farming Legal Matters Pigs and Poultry Rural Life Rural Property Signpost reports Spring Calving Tillage sector Weather BACK TO FARMING HOME PAGE Farming Newsletter Keep up-to-date with all the latest developments in Farming with our weekly newsletter, direct to your inbox every Thursday Sign Up Please click here for our privacy statement.

File photo: AFP China has reported no 'unusual or novel pathogens' in respiratory illnesses spreading in the north of the country, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. The National Health Commission told reporters last week that a respiratory illness spike was due to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens, namely influenza and common bacterial infections affecting children, including mycoplasma pneumonia. The World Health Organization says it asked China for information about a potentially worrying spike in respiratory illnesses and clusters of pneumonia in children, after recording an increase in "influenza-like illness" since mid-October when compared to the same period in the previous three years. The WHO said on Thursday that Chinese authorities had responded, advising "that there has been no detection of any unusual or novel pathogens or unusual clinical presentations, including in Beijing and Liaoning". It was a matter, the authorities said, of the "aforementioned general increase in respiratory illnesses due to multiple known pathogens". Beijing is currently experiencing a cold snap, with temperatures expected to plummet to well below zero by Friday, state media said. The city has "entered a high incidence season of respiratory infectious diseases", Wang Quanyi, deputy director and chief epidemiological expert at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state media.
