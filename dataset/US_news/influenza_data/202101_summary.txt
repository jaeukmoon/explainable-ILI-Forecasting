This news article discusses the role of vagal circuit-α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signaling in regulating lung inflammation and arginase 1 (ARG1) expression during an influenza infection. The study found that vagotomized mice had increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein and leukocytes, as well as higher levels of lung inflammatory cytokines, compared to control mice. Additionally, α7nAChR-deficient mice had reduced lung Arg1 expression and BAL Ly6C+CD206+ cells. Activation of α7nAChR by its agonist GTS-21 enhanced IL-4-induced Arg1 expression and reduced Nos2 and TNF-α expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages. The study suggests that vagal-α7nAChR signaling could be a therapeutic target for treating lung inflammation during an influenza infection.
