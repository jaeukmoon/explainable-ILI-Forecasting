Seasonal influenza vaccines typically consist of wild-type influenza A and B viruses that are limited in their ability to elicit protective immune responses against co-circulating influenza virus variant strains. Improved influenza virus vaccines need to elicit protective immune responses against multiple influenza virus drift variants within each season. Broadly reactive vaccine candidates potentially provide a solution to this problem, but their efficacy may begin to wane as influenza viruses naturally mutate through processes that mediates drift. Thus, it is necessary to develop a method that commercial vaccine manufacturers can use to update broadly reactive vaccine antigens to better protect against future and currently circulating viral variants. Building upon the COBRA technology, nine next-generation H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were designed using a next generation algorithm and design methodology. These next-generation broadly reactive COBRA H3 HA vaccines were superior to wild-type HA vaccines at eliciting antibodies with high HAI activity against a panel of historical and co-circulating H3N2 influenza viruses isolated over the last 15 years, as well as the ability to neutralize future emerging H3N2 isolates.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that these severe infections result in 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory related deaths every year1,2. In general, since 1968 when A(H3N2) viruses emerged in the human population, influenza seasons in which A(H3N2) viruses are prevalent, tend to be more severe with a greater number of hospitalizations and deaths3. The 2017–2018 influenza season, dominated by A(H3N2) virus circulation, was particularly severe and led to the third most outpatient visits for influenza virus-like illnesses in the last 20 years, causing over 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 deaths4,5. Influenza virus vaccine effectiveness estimates vary across seasons and between different age groups, but they are typically higher against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B than they are against A(H3N2) viruses6. During the 2018–2019 influenza season, the A(H3N2) component elicited immune responses that only protected individuals against ~ 9% of A(H3N2) virus infections7,8. Despite low vaccine effectiveness, vaccination remains the cornerstone to prevent influenza virus infection9. Annual seasonal influenza virus vaccines in the United States are typically composed of two influenza A strains representing the A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes and either one or two influenza B strains representing the Victoria and Yamagata lineages10,11. In some countries trivalent forms of the vaccine containing one H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B strain are still used. Strains from these Influenza A and Influenza B subtypes currently co-circulate and pose a threat to human health and well-being12. In particular, influenza A(H3N2) viruses are associated throughout recent history with widespread influenza virus induced illness13,14,15,16.Since their introduction to the human population in 1968, A(H3N2) influenza viruses have undergone extensive genetic drift and antigenic evolution leading to numerous seasonal epidemics, exemplified by the WHO recommending 29 A(H3N2) vaccine strain changes over the last 50 years17. The rapid evolution of influenza A(H3N2) viruses creates difficulties for experts to recognize and predict current and future epidemiological threats5,16,17. Typically, the strains that are chosen for use in the vaccine are selected based on predictions of predominant or emerging clades of influenza viruses derived from global surveillance information, but this method can often lead to the selection of antigenically mismatched strains that induce limited antibody protection against co-circulating viral variants1,8. Antigenic mismatches between the chosen vaccine strain and currently circulating viruses often lead to reduced vaccine effectiveness, requiring influenza vaccines to be updated frequently18.Designing an influenza virus vaccine that induces both broad antibody reactivity against co-circulating strains and neutralization across multiple future influenza virus seasons is a pivotal challenge for the development of new influenza vaccines19. In order to address the need for more broadly reactive influenza A vaccines, a previously reported methodology for enhanced antigen design, computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA), which utilizes multiple rounds of layered consensus building to generate influenza vaccine HA immunogens for H1, H3, and H5 influenza subtypes has shown great promise19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. COBRA HA antigens are capable of eliciting broadly reactive HA-specific antibody responses that can protect against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains that have undergone genetic drift19,23,24. These vaccine antigens have also been shown to inhibit viral infection and virus induced pathogenesis in various animal models including mice, ferrets, and non-human primates22,27,28,29.Adapting a broadly reactive influenza virus vaccine design technology, such as COBRA, to industrial settings would be extremely beneficial for both manufacturers and consumers. Aside from potentially reducing the need to update vaccines on an annual basis, technologies like the COBRA methodology provide a promising solution to increase the protection offered by seasonal vaccines against currently co-circulating strains as well as future emerging isolates. The current vaccine manufacturing process takes about 6–8 months from strain selection to vaccine availability and any delays in strain recommendation or antigenic characterization can lead to devastating reductions in the vaccine supply1,30. Thus, having a broadly reactive vaccine candidate, that has already been antigenically characterized, optimized for production, and is “shelf-ready” would save manufacturers a considerable amount of stress and time, while allowing for year-round production of more doses of vaccine.Previous COBRA design methodologies focused on developing antigens that are broadly reactive against historical and contemporary influenza vaccine strains22,24,26. However, since A(H3N2) viruses evolve so rapidly through genetic mutation and reassortment, it is likely that the protection offered by a broadly reactive vaccine candidate designed using historical isolates, antigenic eras, and outbreak groups will eventually begin to decline due to the diversity of newly emerging surface epitopes present in the circulating A(H3N2) viral population24,31 . Therefore, there is a need to develop a method for updating these broadly reactive vaccines on a seasonal basis to better reflect the diversity present in the population of currently circulating viruses. The method described herein utilizes recent seasonal surveillance information, in combination with novel consensus-based sequence building approaches to provide a unique method for updating broadly reactive influenza virus vaccines designs to better protect people against co-circulating viruses.In an effort to improve upon the COBRA methodology and enhance vaccine coverage within current and into future influenza A(H3N2) virus seasons, nine next-generation H3 HA antigens were designed utilizing two different scenarios of multi-consensus layering sequence alignment techniques that are unique to this method. These nine next-generation H3 COBRA HA antigens were expressed on the surface of virus like particles (VLP) and used to vaccinate immunologically naïve mice in a prime, boost, boost regimen . Serum samples collected from vaccinated mice were tested against a panel of historical and co-circulating A(H3N2) influenza viruses in both hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization assays. Seven of the nine next-generation H3 COBRA HA vaccine candidates outperformed wild-type H3 HA antigens from historical influenza vaccine strains, and displayed the ability to elicit protective HAI antibody titers against numerous co-circulating and future drifted influenza virus variants. The next-generation H3 COBRA HA vaccine antigens also elicited high neutralizing antibody titers against A(H3N2) influenza viruses across a timeframe where 4 different wild-type A(H3N2) vaccine strains were selected as seasonal influenza vaccine candidates. Overall, the H3 HA vaccine antigens produced utilizing this next-generation COBRA methodology were effective at eliciting protective antibody titers against historical, co-circulating, and future drifted strains of A(H3N2) influenza viruses.ResultsPhylogenetic characterization of H3 COBRA HAsThe next-generation COBRA multilayered consensus building approach was applied to 22,144 human A(H3N2) HA viral amino acid sequences collected from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2015, that resulted in the generation of 9 unique Next Gen HA sequences. These Next Gen HA antigens were designed to cover influenza A(H3N2) viral isolates over multiple influenza seasons. All next-generation H3 HA amino acid sequences were unique and did not match the amino acid sequence of any HA in a wild-type A(H3N2) isolate. The four HA antigens named TJ-1 to TJ-4 were uniquely designed using input H3N2 HA sequences from 2002 to 2007 and TJ-5 to TJ-9 HA antigens were designed using HA sequences from 2008 to 2015 (Fig. 1c). The antigens were divided into 2 groups because an antigenic shift occurred in H3N2 viruses around 2008 with the emergence of the Perth/09 antigenic cluster32.Figure 1Next-generation H3 COBRA HA multi-consensus sequence layering approach scenarios and final antigen designs. Secondary layer consensus sequences derived from influenza isolates spanning a 2.5 year period are used to generate a “backbone” consensus sequence (light grey bar). (a) Scenario 1. Secondary consensus sequences produced from the most recent 6-months of A(H3N2) influenza circulation are added into the backbone sequences, and secondary sequences from the oldest 6-month season of the 3-year period are dropped off. This process is repeated for each 6-month period of the design era. (b) Scenario 2. Secondary sequences produced from the most recent 6-months of influenza circulation are added to the “backbone” sequence and the oldest sequences from the design era are retained. This process is repeated for each 6-month period of the design era. (c) Description of the next-generation COBRA H3 HA vaccine antigens, their design eras, and the scenario used to generate them. TJ1–4 were designed utilizing wild-type influenza virus HA sequences from 2002 to 2007, and TJ5–9 were generated from HA input sequences that were in circulation from 2008 to 2015.Full size imagePhylogenetic analysis was performed by constructing a phylogenetic tree model utilizing a neighbor-joining tree building method through Geneious Bioinformatics software. The tree was rooted to the ancestral HA amino acid sequence of A/Nanchang/933/1995 A(H3N2) to determine the genetic distance between the designed Next Gen H3 HA proteins and wild-type H3 HA vaccine strains, as well as co-circulating variant HA antigens (Fig. 2).Figure 2Phylogenetic tree of next-generation COBRA and wild-type H3 HA antigens. The rooted (A/Nanchang/933/1995) phylogenetic tree was inferred from next-generation H3 HA and wild-type H3 HA amino acid sequences derived from representative A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated from 1995 to 2016 that were obtained from the GISAID EpiFlu online database. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 3.8.425 software, and the alignment was refined by Gblocks0.91b software. Phylogeny was determined using a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model and a neighbor-joining tree building method using Geneious bioinformatics software. Trees were rendered using Geneious tree builder software55. Wild-type vaccine strains are highlighted in blue.Full size imageThe TJ-1 to TJ-4 HA amino acid sequences phylogenetically cluster around HA sequences from wild-type viruses isolated between 2002 and 2007. This was expected, as the HA sequence of TJ-1 is most similar to the sequence of the A/Fujian/411/2002 strain and they differ by only two amino acids, V239I and I377T respectively. The HA sequence for TJ-2 is most similar to A/New York/55/2004, with four amino acid differences, A154S, G202V, S235Y, and A546V. TJ-3 is most similar to A/Malaysia/1674395/2006, but carries two amino acid differences at N391D and R466K. TJ-4 is most similar to A/Fujian/411/2002 with four amino acid differences F175Y, N205S, V239I, and P243S (Fig. 2).As expected, based on their input sequences the TJ-5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 HA sequences are closely aligned with HA sequences from viruses isolated between 2009 and 2014 (Fig. 2). TJ-5 is most similar to A/Madagascar/0648/2011 with five amino acid differences: L13R, I50V, T144A, K427R, and F550S respectively. TJ-6 is most similar to A/Victoria/361/2011, but with 2 amino acid differences at Y9H and S161N. TJ-7 is most similar to A/Hong Kong/12/2014 with 4 amino acid differences, Q49R, Y110H, S328N, and D505N. TJ-8 is most similar to A/Perth/16/2009 with 4 amino acid differences, N160K, H199L, I230S, and S328N. TJ-9 is most similar to A/Athens/112/2012 with 4 amino acid differences, I4V, S70R, N161S, and D503N (Fig. 2). The two traditional COBRA antigens fall in areas of the phylogenetic tree that are similar to the sequences used to design each antigen, with T8 clustering near wild-type viruses from 2009 to 2011, and T11 falling near wild-type viruses from 2010 to 2012 (Fig. 2).Antigenic characterization of TJ-1 to TJ-4 H3 COBRA HA proteinsIn order to assess the immunogenicity of the next-generation H3 COBRA vaccine antigens, BALB/c mice were vaccinated in a prime, boost, boost regimen with VLPs expressing the first set of next-generation H3 HA proteins, TJ-1 to TJ-4, that were designed for the 2002–2007 era, or VLPs expressing the wild-type H3 HA proteins representing historical vaccine strains from 2002 to 2007. Antisera was collected 14 days after the third vaccination and then tested against a panel of viruses representing A(H3N2) vaccine strains from 1995 to 2016 for HAI activity. Serum from mice vaccinated with TJ-1 VLPs elicited antibodies with HAI titers ≥ 1:40 against 3/12 H3N2 viruses in the panel (the 1997, 1999, and 2002 viruses) (Table 1). TJ-2 and TJ-3 VLP vaccines also elicited antibodies with HAI activity against 3/12 strains (the 2004, 2005, and 2007 viruses). Mice vaccinated with VLPs expressing the TJ-4 or Fuj/02 HA protein had antibodies with HAI activity against the 1999 and 2002 viruses, and vaccination with Wisc/05 or Bris/07 VLPs only elicited antibodies with HAI activity against the homologously matched virus. The mock vaccinated animals did not have antibodies with HAI activity against any of the strains in the panel (Table 1). The COBRA antigens TJ-2 and TJ-3 that were designed for the 2002–2007 era elicited HAI titers ≥ 1:40 against multiple A(H3N2) vaccine strains from the same era that they were designed for while the wild-type H3 vaccines from this era, Wisc/05 and Bris/07, only elicited HAI antibodies ≥ 1:40 against the homologously matched historical vaccine strains. Of note, the TJ-2 and TJ-3 vaccines elicited HAI antibodies against the historical influenza vaccine strains from 2005 and 2007 at titers higher than the homologously matched wild-type vaccine strains.Table 1 Historical influenza virus HAI panel.Full size tableSera collected from vaccinated mice was then tested for HAI activity against a panel of viruses representing co-circulating H3N2 influenza strains isolated between 2004 and 2007 (Table 2). Surprisingly, TJ-1 and TJ-4 VLPs were unable to elicit antibodies with HAI activity (≥ 1:40) against any of the viruses in the panel (Table 2). In contrast, mice vaccinated with TJ-3 VLPs had antibodies with HAI activity against 10 of the 12 strains in the panel and mice vaccinated with TJ-2 VLPs had antibodies with HAI activity against all 13 drift variant viruses (Table 2). This was superior to any of the wild-type vaccines tested from this era, of which the best ones, Wisc/05 and Bris/07, elicited HAI antibodies against at most 3/12 strains in the panel at a titer ≥ 1:40. In contrast, the Fuj/02 VLP vaccines were unable to generate antibodies with HAI activity against any of the strains in the panel (Table 2). Mice vaccinated with Wisc/05 VLPs elicited antibodies with seroprotective HAI titers against 3 out of 12 viruses (Malaysia/06, Thailand/07, and Trieste/07). Bris/07 VLPs also elicited seroprotective HAI antibody titers against the Thailand/07 and Trieste/07 strains. Mock vaccinated animals did not have detectable HAI activity against any of the strains in the 2004–2007 co-circulating strains panel (Table 2).Table 2 2004–2007 H3N2 Co-circulating influenza virus HAI panel.Full size tableAntigenic characterization of TJ 5–9 H3 COBRA HAsThe next-generation COBRA design methodology was then used to create a second round of H3 next-generation HA antigens designed to focus on the 2009–2015 time-frame. These constructs, TJ-5 to TJ-9, were compared to previously designed H3 COBRA VLPs and wild-type H3 VLPs that represented vaccine strains from 2009–2016 against a panel of historical A(H3N2) influenza virus vaccine strains from 1995–2019 for their ability to induce protective levels of HAI reactive antibodies (Table 3). Mice vaccinated with TJ-5 possessed serum with antibodies with HAI activity ≥ 1:40, seroconversion, against all 11 historical vaccine strains isolated from 2005–2019 at levels as high or higher than homologously matched wild-type VLP vaccines (Table 3). Additionally, TJ-5 was the only vaccine to induce seroconversion against the Kan/17 virus, although titers ≥ 1:40 were only achieved by 2 of the 5 animals in the group (data not shown). Vaccination of naïve mice with TJ-6, TJ-7, TJ-8, or Tx/12 induced seroconversion against 8 of the 16 strains in the panel including strains from 2005, 2009–2016, and 2019. TJ-6 also elicited seroprotective antibodies against the Switz/17 strain. TJ-9 and Vic/11 VLP vaccines generated antibodies with seroprotective HAI activity against all of the viruses from 2009–2016, and the SA/19 isolate. Mice vaccinated with T8 COBRA VLP’s generated sero-protective antibodies against H3N2 vaccine strains from 2004 to 2012, and mice vaccinated with T11 seroconverted against H3N2 vaccine strains from 2004 to 2014 (Table 3). The Perth/09 wild-type VLP vaccine caused the mice to seroconvert to the vaccine strains from 2009 to 2016 with the exception of the Switz/13 vaccine strain. Mice vaccinated with Switz/13 VLPs only produced antibodies with HAI activity against viruses from 2011–2013, while mice vaccinated with HK/14 seroconverted against the isolates from 2013–2016 and the SA/19 virus. The Sing/16 VLP vaccines elicited sero-protective antibodies against all of the strains from 2009–2019 with the exception of the Switz/13 and Kan/17 isolates, both of which belong to the co-circulating clade 3c.3a. Mock vaccinated animals did not have HAI activity ≥ 1:40 against any of the strains in the panel (Table 3).Table 3 Historical H3N2 influenza virus HAI panel.Full size tableSera collected from the vaccinated mice was then evaluated against a panel of co-circulating H3N2 strains representing 2010–2016 (Table 4). Mice vaccinated with Perth/09 possessed HAI activity against all of the strains in the panel isolated from 2010 to 2014. All of the next-generation H3 COBRAs, TJ-5 to TJ-9, VLP vaccines elicited similar HAI responses to Vic/11, Tx/12, Switz/13, and HK/14 generating HAI titers ≥ 1:40 against all of the strains in the panel from 2010 to 2016. However, mice vaccinated with TJ-5 had exceptional antibody titers that were as high or higher than the best wild-type vaccines across the panel of co-circulating strains. Mice vaccinated with Sing/16 VLPs or mock vaccines were unable to elicit antibodies with HAI activity ≥ 1:40 against any of the strains in the panel (Table 4).Table 4 2010–2016 Co-circulating H3N2 influenza virus HAI panel.Full size tableH3N2 neutralization assessmentThe ability of vaccine elicited antibodies to neutralize live virus infection was evaluated using a focal reduction assay (FRA) (Fig. 3). Mice vaccinated with TJ-2 or TJ-3 VLPs had the highest antibody neutralization titers amongst all of the next generation COBRA H3 vaccines against the Bris/07 virus, with a FRA50 Log(2) titer of 10.38 and 11.06 respectively. Mice vaccinated with TJ-5, TJ-6, or TJ-8 VLP vaccines also elicited a FRA50 against Bris/07 albeit at lower titers of 7.71, which was lower than sera from Bris/07 VLP vaccinated mice. Sera from mice vaccinated with TJ-7 and TJ-9 were unable to elicit antibodies that inhibited Bris/07 infection at a level ≥ 50% (Fig. 3a). However, most of the VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA antigens were also unable to elicit antibodies with neutralization titers against Bris/07, except for the homologous Bris/07 VLP (10.66 FRA50 titer) and the Tx/12 VLP (7.79 FRA50 titer) (Fig. 3b). Due to their lack of HAI breadth, serum from mice vaccinated with TJ-1 and TJ-4 were not tested in the FRA for their ability to neutralize future emerging strains.Figure 3H3N2 focal reduction assay. FRA neutralizing antibody titers were determined using pooled sera for each group of naïve mice vaccinated 3 times with one of 7 next-generation COBRA H3 HA antigens (TJ-2, TJ-3, or TJ5–9) or H3 VLP vaccines expressing wild-type HA proteins (Bris/07, Perth/09, Vic/11, Tx/12, Switz/13, HK/14, or Sing/16) from historical influenza virus isolates at day 70. (a,b) Average Log2 neutralizing antibody titers against the A/Brisbane/10/2007 H3N2 virus. (c,d) Average Log2 neutralizing antibody titers against the A/Texas/50/2012 H3N2 virus.

(i,j) Average Log2 neutralizing antibody titers against the A/Singapore/IFNIMH-16-2016 H3N2 virus. For each virus, the virus concentration was standardized to 1.2 × 104 FFU/mL. The dotted lines represent the 50% and 80% inhibition of viral infection by antisera compared to virus only control wells.Full size imageSerum samples collected from mice vaccinated with TJ-2 and TJ-3 VLPs had moderate neutralizing titers against Tx/12 virus, with a FRA50 titer of 6.82 and 7.84 respectively. In general, all of the other COBRA HA VLP vaccines, TJ-5 – TJ-9, had antibodies that neutralized the Tx/12 virus at levels greater than 80% in all of the serum dilutions tested (Fig. 3c). The wild-type VLP vaccines Switz/13, HK/14, and Sing/16 all elicited antibodies with moderate capacity to neutralize the Tx/12 virus, while Perth/09, Vic/11, and Tx/12 VLP elicited antibodies that were highly effective at neutralizing the Tx/12 challenge virus. The Bris/07 VLP and mock vaccinated animals did not have antibodies that could prevent Tx/12 infections of the host cells (Fig. 3d).TJ-5, TJ-7, TJ-8, and TJ-9, vaccines were effective at generating antibodies that inhibit Switz/13 infections with a FRA50 of ~ 11.0. Of the Next Gen H3 vaccines, serum collected from mice vaccinated with TJ-6 VLPs were most effective at neutralizing the Switz/13 virus. In contrast, TJ-2 and TJ-3 VLPs failed to neutralize Switz/13 viral infections (Fig. 3e). In general, mice vaccinated with either Vic/11, Tx/12, Switz/13, or HK/14 VLPs were most effective at neutralizing the Switz/13 virus. All of these vaccines neutralized more than 50% of the viral infections at almost all of the dilutions tested, with the homologously matched Switz/13 VLP vaccine eliciting antibodies with the greatest capacity to neutralize the challenge virus. The wild-type vaccines, Bris/07, Perth/09, Sing/16, as well as mock vaccinated animals were much less effective at neutralizing Switz/13 than the other wild-type strains (Fig. 3f).Mice vaccinated with TJ-2 or TJ-3 VLPs were unable to elicit antibodies that could neutralize the HK/14 virus. However, five COBRA vaccine antigens (TJ-5 to TJ-9) elicited levels of antibodies that were broadly neutralizing across the 2012–2016 timeframe, whereas the wild-type seasonal vaccine antigens from that timeframe elicited antibodies that were more strain specific and less cross reactive (Fig. 3g). Of the wild-type vaccines, Perth/09, Vic/11, Tx/12, HK/14, and Sing/16 VLPs all elicited antibodies that could neutralize the HK/14 with a FRA50 greater than 10. The Switz/13 VLP vaccines elicited neutralizing with a FRA50 of 8.37, while the Bris/07 VLP and mock vaccines were unable to prevent any virus infections (Fig. 3h).The TJ-5 to TJ-9 VLP vaccines all elicited antibodies had a FRA50 titer of 10.6 or higher against the Sing/16 virus at any serum dilution tested. However, mice vaccinated with either TJ-2 or TJ-3 were unable to neutralize the Sing/16 virus (Fig. 3i). In general, mice vaccinated with wild-type vaccines from 2009 to 2014 had antibodies that prevented more than 50% of the viral infections caused by the Sing/16 virus with an FRA50 titer of 9.88. In contrast, the homologously matched Sing/16 VLPs neutralized more than 50% of the infections at all dilutions tested. Switz/13 and Bris/07 VLPs, as well as the mock vaccinated animals, did not elicit antibodies capable of neutralizing the Sing/16 virus (Fig. 3j).Overall, the next-generation H3 COBRA HA vaccine antigens designed for the 2009–2015 era elicited high levels of neutralizing antibody titers across a timeframe, 2012–2016, where 4 different wild-type A(H3N2) vaccine strains were chosen to be included in the seasonal influenza vaccine. Additionally, the TJ-5 – TJ-9 VLP vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized infections against the future drifted Sing/16 virus at titers two-fold higher than any wild-type vaccine other than the homologously matched Sing/16 vaccine.DiscussionThe overall objective of the next-generation COBRA methodology is to apply the usefulness of the in-silico vaccine antigen design process to a more commercial vaccine manufacturing-type setting where vaccines are produced in real-time in response to current antigenic and genetic viral variations. Although vaccines against the influenza virus were developed as early as the 1940′s, the use of inactivated wild-type viruses as vaccines are still the best method of inducing protection in the human population33. Current seasonal wild-type A(H3N2) influenza vaccines are typically strain specific and sometimes induce a narrow range of antigenic breadth against co-circulating viral variants1,30. However, there are some eras of H3N2 influenza virus circulation where the wild-type vaccines elicit highly cross-reactive antibodies. In this study, the wild-type vaccines that were isolated from 2009 to 2016 elicited cross-reactive antibodies against the strains of this era. This is in contrast to isolates collected prior to this time period that do not elicit cross-reactive antibodies and were often antigenically strain specific24. The relatively continuous genetic and antigenic drift of influenza A(H3N2) viruses requires the WHO to perform extensive genetic and antigenic surveillance on circulating isolates, as well as accurately predicting the protective efficacy of candidate vaccine viruses each season1. The selection of mismatched strains by the WHO can also lead to greatly reduced vaccine effectiveness, as observed during the 2014–2015 influenza season, where a poor match between the A(H3N2) vaccine strain and those viruses in circulation reduced the vaccine effectiveness to ~ 19% in the U.S.34.There is a need for more broad immune protection against co-circulating A(H3N2) influenza viruses, and improvements need to be made to both vaccine candidate selection and deployment against emerging viral strains31. From the moment that vaccine manufacturers receive the strain recommendation from the WHO in late February, there are ~ 6 months to produce and purify enough vaccine to make hundreds of millions of doses1. . Speed of production is critical and there would be less pressure if vaccine manufacturers could produce a vaccine that elicits long-lived protective immune responses33,35. In 2018, the U.S. government was tasked with expanding the capacity for more agile and rapid vaccine production methods to advance the development of broadly reactive vaccine candidates30. The accelerated pace of generating and selecting up to date next-generation COBRA-based antigens would be highly advantageous over traditional methods of selecting wild-type vaccine candidate viruses. Since these COBRA vaccine antigens are designed using the year-round influenza virus surveillance data, a candidate vaccine could be generated in real time, antigenically tested, and selected long before traditional strain recommendations. Therefore, broadly reactive vaccine candidates could be rolled out at any time to combat the antigenic diversity of co-circulating A(H3N2) viral strains.As a result of a combination of rapid viral mutation, reassortment, natural selection in hosts, and epidemiology, A(H3N2) influenza viruses are evolving in humans faster than any other subtype of influenza virus. The WHO has recommended to change the A(H3N2) influenza strain in the commercial seasonal vaccines 11 times for Northern hemisphere since the 1998–1999 season31. The high level of diversity of the surface epitopes present on A(H3N2) influenza viruses are challenging for both immune recognition and traditional vaccine effectiveness. However, the next-generation COBRA HA design approach presented in this report resulted in unique HA sequences that incorporated the antigenic epitopes from numerous co-circulating strains of A(H3N2) influenza viruses transmitting during the most recent influenza virus seasons. This next-generation process reduces potential biases in input sequences by weighting isolates based on sequence identity and time of isolation, thereby allowing the COBRA HA antigens to retain highly immunogenic and cross-reactive epitopes36.Antibodies directed against conserved regions in the HA protein can provide broad protection against many different influenza viruses37. It is likely that the next-generation H3 COBRA antigens elicited broadly reactive antibodies in a similar manner to traditional COBRA HA vaccine antigens, by driving diverse B cell responses and targeting conserved HA epitopes that are maintained in future A(H3N2) influenza drift variants. Unlike many other broadly reactive influenza virus vaccine candidates, that direct antibodies to the conserved regions of the HA stem, COBRA HA antigens preferentially direct antibodies against conserved structures of the HA globular head, such as the receptor binding site that remains relatively similar in structure to allow for sialic acid binding functions36. This is advantageous since antibodies directed against the HA globular head are induced at higher titers and with greater potency than those directed against the stalk37,38. However, whether or not these broadly reactive antibody responses are the result of synergistic polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple conserved epitopes, or are the product of a highly specific monoclonal antibody response targeting one epitope remains unclear. Although, COBRA HA based vaccines have been shown to elicit a broader set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) than wild-type HA antigens36. Therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) that COBRA HA proteins use to elicit broadly-reactive antibodies is important for the design and improvement of broadly reactive antigens and will be the goal of future investigations.The methodology presented herein differs from the approach used to generate previous COBRA HA antigens. The next generation strategy places an emphasis on current and recently circulating viruses rather than on historical influenza isolates, antigenic eras, or past outbreak groups. The previously published COBRA methodology is good for producing antigens that are broadly reactive for shorter periods of time, i.e. 5 to 10 year periods, but as wild-type viruses evolve and change, modifications to the broadly reactive vaccine candidate must be made to keep the vaccines up to date. The overall goal of this study was to develop a methodology that would allow manufacturers the ability to keep their broadly reactive vaccine candidates up to date in the event that their current vaccine begins to elicit suboptimal antibody breadth against the viruses in circulation.Two next-generation COBRA design scenarios were tested in this study for their ability to produce broadly reactive vaccine antigens that elicit antibodies against influenza strains from within and across multiple influenza virus seasons. However, neither scenario proved to be advantageous over the other. In fact, for many of the seasons modeled in this study, both scenarios produced identical antigens (data not shown) further emphasizing that both design scenarios are capable of producing broadly reactive antigens. However, both design approaches also produced antigens, TJ-1 and TJ-4, that were not very broadly reactive. This is likely because the HA sequences of TJ-1 and TJ-4 are most similar to the A/Fujian/411/2002 virus, which belongs to a different antigenic era than the H3N2 influenza viruses in circulation between 2004–200724,39. Both TJ-1 and TJ-4 possess a lysine at HA site 161, which is located in antigenic site B, and a valine at site 242 in antigenic site D, which is identical to the amino acids in those positions for A/Fujian/411/2002. Contrastingly, TJ-2 and TJ-3 possess an asparagine at site 161 and an isoleucine at site 242 which is also carried by the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 strain. Together, these amino acid changes are likely responsible for the observed differences in HAI activity between TJ-1/TJ-4 and TJ-2/TJ-3, especially the differences at site 161 as mutations in antigenic site B are often immunodominant and responsible for antigenic drift40. Future studies will focus on deconvoluting the differences between the quality of antigens produced by each of the design scenarios, and their ability to induce antibody breadth against both dominant and co-circulating influenza virus strains within and across multiple influenza seasons.Overall, the H3 COBRA HA antigens designed using both of the next-generation methodologies were able to broadly elicit both HAI reactive and neutralizing antibodies against historical, co-circulating, and future drifted strains of A(H3N2) influenza viruses at a level that was equivalent or greater than wild-type antigens from the same era. Two of the vaccine candidates in particular, TJ-2 and TJ-5, elicited the strongest anti-influenza antibody responses against the era for which they were designed, as well as against future A(H3N2) influenza virus strains. Subsequent studies will focus on further characterizing the immune responses generated by these two vaccine candidates in various animal models.Despite the value of testing potential vaccine candidates in immunologically influenza-naïve animal models, these systems only provide information about how these antigens will stimulate a de novo immune response, but most human adults have previously been exposed to influenza viruses either through infection or vaccination and possess immunological memory that will differentially drive immune responses to subsequent vaccinations41. Future investigations will aim to determine if the breadth of response generated by these next-generation H3 COBRA vaccines are the result of the stimulation of a larger number of pre-existing memory B cells leading to a more diverse antibody repertoire than those stimulated by wild-type vaccines. Therefore, evaluation of these vaccine candidates in animals with pre-existing immunity elicited by previous exposure(s) to influenza viruses will provide information on how an individual’s immune history plays a role in generating effective antibody responses following vaccination.In summary, this next-generation antigen design methodology is an effective and novel approach for designing broadly reactive subtype-specific seasonal A(H3N2) influenza virus antigens in real time. This process allows the natural evolution of influenza viruses to dictate the antigen design process, and places an emphasis on currently drifted strains rather than historical strains or making predictions on emerging strains that may or may not become dominant in circulation. Designing custom influenza HA antigens through this next-generation process is likely to reduce the need for frequently updating vaccine components and increase protection within a season. This would be highly advantageous for commercial vaccine manufacturers since it would decrease the risk of including a mismatched strain in the vaccine, while increasing vaccine effectiveness, and allow year-round vaccine production. This next generation methodology provides a way to update broadly reactive influenza vaccine candidates with the use of in-silico designs and real time surveillance information, rather than relying on annual predictions, which is a necessary step forward in the fight to protect humans against the ever-changing landscape of co-circulating H3N2 influenza viruses.Materials and methodsAntigen construction and synthesisFull length wild-type influenza A(H3N2) HA protein amino acid sequences, residues 1–566 (starting with Methionine as the first amino acid), from 22,144 human H3N2 virus infections collected from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2015 were downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu online database and organized by their date of collection. Unlike the traditional COBRA antigen design method, where input sequences are separated based upon the year in which they were collected, this next generation methodology separates isolates based on the representative influenza “season” in which they were collected20,24,26. In this approach, the downloaded sequences were separated into periods of time representing the “Northern” and “Southern” Hemisphere influenza seasons spanning from 2002 to 2015. The “Southern Hemisphere” season was defined to include sequences from all over the globe isolated from 5/1/XX to 9/30/XX of a given year, and each “Northern Hemisphere” season was defined to include sequences from around the world that were isolated from 10/1/XX to 4/30/XY of the following year. For example, sequences included in the 2009 “Southern Hemisphere” collection timeframe included those isolated between 5/1/2009 and 9/30/2009, and the isolates included in the 2009–2010 “Northern Hemisphere” collection contains sequences that were isolated between 10/1/2009 and 4/30/2010, regardless of where the sequences were isolated geographically. The HA amino acid sequences for each season were then aligned using Geneious bioinformatics software (Biomatters, Ltd. Auckland, New Zeland), and separated into multiple distinct clusters, which were then used to generate “primary” consensus sequences. The primary sequence clusters were derived using a 99% identity cutoff, which correlates to approximately 5 amino acid differences in the HA molecule. This cutoff was chosen based on the suggestion that influenza virus strains with more than 4 amino acid differences in their HA proteins are of epidemiological importance34,42. This approach differs from the traditional influenza subtype specific COBRA antigen design approach that builds the primary level of consensus sequences from either outbreak groups, antigenic eras, or historical isolates, rather than from the most recent seasons of influenza circulation20,24,26.For each round of primary consensus generation, a multiple-sequence alignment was performed using the Geneious MUSCLE 3.8.425 alignment algorithm, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model and a neighbor-joining tree building method, such that trees were rooted to the oldest sequences collected. The full-length HA sequences were then aligned and clustered based on 99% identity. Then the most common amino acid residues found among each designated cluster of viruses was used to generate a primary consensus sequence. The multiple primary consensus sequences from each 6-month season were then aligned, phylogenetically analyzed using the previously described method, and clustered into groups based on phylogenetic similarity from which “secondary” level consensus amino acid sequences were generated. The secondary level sequences were then input into 2 different COBRA consensus building scenarios, which is unique to this next-generation COBRA methodology (Fig. 1). Both scenarios start by collecting the secondary sequences from 2.5 years, representing 5 consecutive influenza seasons, aligning them, and using those generate a “backbone” consensus sequence. The first scenario moves forward with time in such a way that the secondary sequences derived from the most recent 6-month period are added to the backbone and the secondary sequences from the oldest season of the now 3-year period are removed (Fig. 1a). This process creates an antigen design window that marches forward with time, placing an emphasis on newly emerging strains and eliminating contributions from older strains. The second COBRA consensus building scenario starts with the same 2.5-year back bone and incorporates secondary sequences from the most recent 6-months of influenza virus circulation. This scenario differs from the first, in that it retains the secondary sequences from the oldest influenza season and also adds in the secondary consensus sequences from the most recent 6-month time period (Fig. 1b). This scenario places value on past sequences while also incorporating sequences from the most recent influenza virus season.Multiple rounds of consensus assembly were layered in both scenarios to yield secondary, tertiary, and quaternary consensus sequences that were designed to represent different antigenic spaces that overlapped periods of time for which multiple wild-type vaccine strains were recommended for inclusion in seasonal vaccine formulations from 2009 to 2015. The antigens were deliberately designed up to 2015 so that these antigens could be tested as vaccines against future emerging H3N2 isolates. This process generated a combination of 27 COBRA antigen sequences from both scenarios of which 9 were unique. The final set of nine amino acid sequences were named the TJ-series. The nine H3 COBRA HA antigens, TJ-1 through TJ-9, were then synthesized and inserted into the pTR600 plasmid expression vector, as previously described and generated as VLPs43. The H3 next-generation HA antigens were designed to represent discrete time periods of recent A(H3N2) influenza virus circulation in humans. For example, as a proof of concept, constructs TJ-1 through TJ-4 were designed to represent past periods of time spanning 5 years, constituting the A(H3N2) influenza antigenic space from 2002 to 2007. This timeframe was chosen such that the antibodies elicited by these antigens could be tested against future A(H3N2) influenza isolates. In a similar manner TJ-5 through TJ-9 were generated using the two multi-consensus layering approaches to represent the time period of 2009–2015 (Fig. 1c).Vaccine preparationMammalian 293 T cells were transfected with each of three plasmids expressing either the influenza neuraminidase (A/mallard/Alberta/24/2001, H7N3), the HIV p55 Gag sequence, and one of the various influenza A(H3N2) wild-type HA or H3 COBRA HA expressing plasmids in previously described mammalian expression vectors44. A(H3N2) wild-type influenza HA sequences were obtained from the GISAID EpiFlu database using MDCK passaged sequences which were inserted into the pTR600 expression vector21. This included the HA sequences for following H3 antigens: A/Fujian/411/2002 (EPI_ISL_11184) MDCK passage 1 (MDCKP1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (EPI_ISL_115646) MDCKP2, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (EPI_ISL_110723) MDCKP1, A/Perth/16/2009 (EPI_ISL_87516) MDCKP2, A/Victoria/361/2011 (EPI_ISL_121879) MDCKP2, A/Texas/50/2012 (EPI_ISL_170149) MDCKP1, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (EPI_ISL_166310) MDCKP2, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (EPI_ISL_198222) MDCKP2, A/Singapore/IFNIMH-16-0019/2016 (EPI_ISL_296168) MDCKP1. Additionally, the T8 and T11 COBRA HA sequences, which were generated using the traditional H3 COBRA methodology were inserted into the pTR600 expression vector and synthesized as VLP’s to serve as comparators between the traditional methodology and the newly proposed next generation methodology. T8 was designed using H3 wild-type sequences from 1999 to 2012, and T11 using H3 sequences from 2011 to 201324. Following 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, supernatants from transiently transfected HEK 293-T cells were collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and filtered through a 0.22 μm pore membrane. Mammalian virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified and sedimented by ultracentrifugation on a 20% glycerol cushion at 135,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. VLPs were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and total protein concentration was assessed by conventional bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA)19. Hemagglutination activity of each preparation of VLPs was determined by adding equal volume of 0.75% guinea pig red blood cells (RBCs) to a V-bottom 96-well plate and incubating with serially diluted volumes of VLPs for a 60 min incubation at room temperature (RT). The highest dilution of VLP with full agglutination of RBCs was considered the endpoint HA titer.Determination of HA contentA high-affinity, 96-well flat bottom ELISA plate, Immulon 4 HBX (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA), was coated with 5–10 μg of total protein of VLP and serial dilutions of a recombinant H3 antigen (3006_H3_Vc, Protein Sciences, Meriden, CT) in ELISA carbonate buffer (50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.5) and the plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker. The next morning, plates were washed in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), then non-specific epitopes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST solution for 1 h at RT. Buffer was removed then stalk-specific Group 2 human antibody CR8020 (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) 1 mg/mL, was added to the plate in blocking buffer at a working dilution of 1:4000, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C45. Plates were washed, then probed with goat anti-human IgG horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 mg/mL) diluted in blocking buffer at a working dilution of 1:4000 (2040-05, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed then freshly prepared o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (P8287, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) substrate in citrate buffer (P4922, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to wells for 3–5 min, followed by 1 N H2SO4 stopping reagent. Plates were read at 492 nm absorbance using a microplate reader (Powerwave XS, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) and background was subtracted from negative wells. Linear regression standard curve analysis was performed using the known concentrations of recombinant standard antigen to estimate HA content in VLP lots19. COBRA constructs were also analyzed for glycan content by searching for potential glycosylation motifs in the amino acid sequence. Using the sequence motif, N{P}[ST]{P}, to search for potential N-linked glycosylation sites using Geneious annotation software, it was determined that TJ5 through TJ9 all possess the same 12 potential glycosylation sites, and these sites are consistent with those found in wild-type HA’s isolated in the last 10 years.Phylogenetic comparison of next-generation COBRA H3 HA antigensA rooted (A/Nanchang/933/1995) phylogenetic tree was inferred from next-generation H3 HA and wild-type HA amino acid sequences derived from representative H3N2 viruses isolated from 1995 to 2016. Sequences were aligned with MUSCLE 3.8.425 software, and the alignment was refined by Gblocks0.91b software. Phylogeny was determined using a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model and a neighbor-joining tree building method with Geneious bioinformatics software. Trees were rendered using Geneious tree builder software (Biomatters, Ltd. Auckland, New Zeland) (Fig. 2).Viruses and HA antigensInfluenza A(H3N2) viruses were obtained through the Influenza Reagents Resource (IRR), BEI Resources, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or provided by Virapur (San Diego, CA). Viruses were passaged once in the same growth conditions as they were received, in either embryonated chicken eggs or semi-confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell culture as per the instructions provided by the WHO46. Virus lots were titered with 0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence of 20 nM Oseltamivir, and made into aliquots for single-use applications.The A(H3N2) 1995–2019 WHO recommended historical influenza vaccine strain viral panel included the 16 following viral strains: A/Nanchang/933/1995 (Nan/95) egg passage 3 (EP3), A/Sydney/05/1997 (Syd/97) EP2, A/Panama/2007/1999 (Pan/99) EP4, A/Fujian/411/2002 (Fuj/02) MDCKP1, A/New York/55/2004 (NY/04) EP6, A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (Wisc/05) EP4, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (Bris/07) EP3, A/Perth/16/2009 (Per/09) EP4, A/Victoria/361/2011 (Vic/11) EP4, A/Texas/50/2012 (Tx/12) EP4, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (Switz/13) EP4, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK/14) EP11, and A/Singapore/IFNIMH-16-0019/2016 (Sing/16) EP3, A/Kansas/14/2017 (Kan/17) EP1, A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (Switz/17) EP1, A/South Australia/34/2019 (SA/19) EP1.The panel of 24 co-circulating H3N2 viral variants from the period of 2004–2016 included:, A/Florida/02/2006 (Fla/06) EP2, A/Santiago/7981/2006 (Santiago/06) EP1, A/Nepal/921/2006 (Nepal/06) EP1, A/Taiwan/760/2007 (Taiwan/07) MDCKP1, A/Texas/71/2007 (Texas/07) MDCKP1, A/Henan-Jinshui/147/2007 (Henan/07) EP1, A/Uruguay/716/2007 (Uruguay/07) EP2, A/Alabama/05/2010 (Ala/10) MDCKP2, A/Hessen/5/2010 (Hess/10) MDCKP3, A/Netherlands/009/2010 (Neth/10) MDCKP2, A/Norway/1330/2010 (Nor/10) MDCKP3, A/Madagascar/0648/2011 (Mad/11) MDCKP2, A/Norway/1186/2011 (Nor/11) MDCKP2, A/Utah/12/2011 (Utah/11) MDCKP2, A/Athens/112/2012 (Ath/12) MDCKP2, A/Jordan/30502/2012 (Jord/12) MDCKP2, A/Denmark/96/2013 (Den/13) MDCKP2, A/Hong Kong/12/2014 (HK/12/14) MDCKP2, A/Stockholm/28/2016 (Stock/16) MDCKP2.When viruses could not be obtained, H3-A/Thailand/1/2004 N1-Gag VLPs were synthesized using codon optimized HA sequences. This included the following antigens for the 2004–2007 drift panel: A/Hong Kong/CUHK53726/2004 (HK/04) (EPI_ISL_14373) MDCKP1, A/Denmark/13/2006 (Denmark/06) (EPI_ISL_16064) MDCKP1, A/Malaysia/1674395/2006 (Malaysia/06) (EPI_ISL_120397) MDCKP1, A/Thailand/359/2007 (Thailand/07) (EPI_ISL_20528) MDCKP1, and A/Trieste/25/2007 (Trieste/07) (EPI_ISL_98951) MDCKP1.Phylogenetic comparison of co-circulating variants (2004–2016)Selection of the co-circulating variants was based upon multiple sequence alignments that were performed on extracted HA sequences; sequences were organized based on collection during the representative “Northern” or “Southern” Hemisphere influenza seasons from 2004 to 2016. Phylogenetic tree models were assembled using a Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model, and a neighbor-joining tree building method in Geneious bioinformatics software (Biomatters, Ltd. Auckland, New Zeland). Branches were compared for sequence similarity to the panel of 24 drift viruses described above. The number of sequences that branched within 99% HA sequence identity of one of the 24 antigens was counted, and frequencies were calculated based on the total number of sequences available per season as described previously19.VLP Vaccination of miceBALB/c mice (Mus musculus, female 6–8 weeks old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), housed in microisolator units, and allowed free access to food and water. They were cared for under the University of Georgia Research Animal Resources guidelines for laboratory animals. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with purified H3 VLPs (3.0 ug HA/mouse/vaccination) based upon HA content from the ELISA quantification, and vaccines were delivered via intramuscular injection at week 0 (3ug) and then boosted with the same vaccine antigen and dose on weeks 4 (3ug) and 8 (3ug), as performed in previous studies24. Vaccines were formulated with an emulsified squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, Addavax (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA). The final concentration after mixing 1:1 with VLPs is 2.5% squalene. Mice were vaccinated with either one COBRA H3 (TJ-1 through TJ-9) VLP vaccines or one wild-type (Fuj/02, Wisc/05, Bris/07, Perth/09, Vic/11, Tx/12, Switz/13, HK/14, Sing/16) H3 VLP vaccine with HA antigens representing selected vaccine strains isolated from 2002–2017. Fourteen days after each vaccination, blood samples were collected via the submandibular vein and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and serum samples were removed and frozen at -20 °C ± 5 °C24.Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assayThe hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was used to assess functional antibodies to the HA that are able to inhibit agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes. The protocols were adapted from the WHO laboratory influenza surveillance manual46. Guinea pig red blood cells are frequently used to characterize contemporary A(H3N2) influenza strains that have developed a preferential binding to alpha (2,6) linked sialic acid receptors47,48. To inactivate nonspecific inhibitors, sera samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Co., Japan) prior to being tested. Briefly, three parts of RDE was added to one part of sera and incubated overnight at 37 °C. RDE was inactivated by incubation at 56 °C for 30 min. RDE-treated sera were diluted in a series of twofold serial dilutions in in v-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of each A(H3N2) influenza virus, adjusted to approximately 8 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 μl in the presence of 20 nM Oseltamivir carboxylate, was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then 0.75% guinea pig erythrocytes (Lampire Biologicals, Pipersville, PA, USA) in PBS were added. Red blood cells were washed with PBS, stored at 4 °C, and used within 24 h of preparation. The plates were mixed by gentle agitation, covered, and the RBCs were allowed to settle for 1 h at room temperature. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last well that contained non-agglutinated RBCs. Positive and negative serum controls were also included for each plate. All mice were negative (HAI ≤ 1:10) for pre-existing antibodies to currently circulating human influenza viruses prior to vaccination, and for this study sero-protection was defined as HAI titer > 1:40 and seroconversion as a fourfold increase in titer compared to baseline, as per the WHO and European Committee for Medicinal Products to evaluate influenza vaccines49. Mice are naïve and seronegative at the time of vaccination, and thus seroconversion and sero-protection rates are interchangeable in this study.Focus reduction assay (FRA)The Focus Reduction Assay (FRA) used in this study was initially developed by the WHO collaborating Centre in London, U.K. and modified by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Thomas Rowe, personal communication). MDCK-SIAT1 cells (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were plated at 2.5–3 × 105 cells/mL (100 µL/well in 96-well plate) one day prior to use in the assay. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, Geneticin (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), in 96-well flat bottom plates overnight to form a 95–100% confluent monolayer. The following day, the cell monolayers are rinsed with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2 (PBS, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA), followed by the addition of twofold serially diluted RDE treated serum (50uL per well) starting with a 1:20 dilution in virus growth medium containing TPCK-treated trypsin (1 µg/ml), VGM-T, (DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (100 U/mL Penicillin, 100 ug/mL Streptomycin solution), and 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). 50uL of A(H3N2) influenza virus (1.2 × 104 focus forming units (FFU)/mL, which corresponds to 600 FFU/50 μl) in VGM-T was added to the wells of each plate, or VGM-T only was added to cell control wells. Virus stocks were standardized by previous titration in the FRA50,51. Following a 2 h incubation period at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cells in each well were then overlaid with 100uL of equal volumes of 1.2% Avicel RC/CL (Type: RC581 NF; FMC Health and Nutrition, Philadelphia, PA, USA) in 2X Modified Eagle Medium containing 1 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, 0.1% BSA and antibiotics52. Plates were incubated for 18–22 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The overlays were then removed from each well and the monolayer was washed once with PBS to remove any residual Avicel. The plates were then fixed with ice-cold 4% formalin in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by a PBS wash and permeabilization using 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PBS/glycine at room temperature for 20 min. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20; PBST) and then incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody against the influenza A nucleoprotein51,53,54 obtained from the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) (Manassas, VA, USA) (FR-1217) (1 mg/mL), diluted 1:2000 in ELISA buffer (PBS,10% horse serum, 0.1% Tween-80). Following washing (3X PBST), the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labelled IgG (Sera Care, Inc., Milford, MA, USA) (KPL 474–1802) (1 mg/mL), diluted 1:2000 in ELISA buffer for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed again (3X PBST) and infectious foci were visualized using TrueBlue substrate (Sera Care, Inc., Milford, MA USA) containing 0.03% H2O2 incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by washing five times with diH20. Plates were air dried and foci enumerated using a CTL BioSpot Analyser with ImmunoCapture 6.4.87 software (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The FRA titer was reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum corresponding to 50% foci reduction compared to the virus control minus the cell control.In order for a plate to pass quality control, both the average of the octuplet virus control wells (VC), as well as the average of the octuplet cell control wells (CC) must pass. The virus controls initially were between 150 to 650 foci and the cell controls must be less than 21 foci. The virus control wells were subsequently expanded to between 200 and 1600 foci. Additionally, the positive control, A(H3N2) historical influenza vaccine strain, virus was run in triplicate plates in each individual assay and at least two out of three plates must pass VC and CC criteria and homologous ferret antisera, previously generated through infection with A(H3N2) influenza virus at 1e6 PFU/mL and collected 14 days post infection, must have the same titer across the plates19. Each assay plate (one virus per plate) contained a panel of ferret reference antisera, as well as a human influenza vaccine serum control to assess overall assay consistency24. The percentage of infected cells reported in the assay is calculated by averaging the foci count from the positive control (virus and cell only) wells, and dividing the number of foci in each experimental well by the average of the positive control.

This is the first reported detection of this strain of avian influenza in humans. The human infections occurred on a poultry farm in Astrakhan, Russian Federation, and were reported to WHO by Russian health officials via channels of the International Health Regulations (2005).Concerns were raised when 101 000 out of 900 000 egg-laying hens on the farm died in early December 2020. An investigation by Russian veterinary public-health authorities detected avian influenza A(H5N8), which was then confirmed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory and the Federal Centre for Animal Health in the city of Vladimir, Russian Federation.No clinical evidence of onward transmissionFollow-up tests on the 7 workers from the poultry farm suggested recent infection with the virus, though they showed no symptoms. There was no clinical evidence of onward transmission to families or close associates of the workers. Further information on serology among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.Dr Richard Pebody, who leads the High Threat Pathogen Team at WHO/Europe, was quick to reassure: “The people who were reported to be infected did not develop symptoms and they were all exposed to an infected poultry flock in the course of their work. The infection does not appear to have come from other human beings – which is good news.”Dr Pebody added, “The poultry flock has been culled and no further infections in humans have been found. It is also encouraging that this incident shows the system that alerts local and international authorities is working. However, this underlines the ongoing importance of global surveillance in the face of constantly evolving influenza viruses. Changes to the influenza virus must be closely monitored in animals and humans alike; this is a good example of the One Health approach, recognizing that human and animal health are intertwined and depend on each other.”Low risk of human-to-human transmissionBased on available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low and WHO recommendations have not changed as a result of the incident. When avian influenza is circulating in an area, farms and contact with live animals, for example in markets, should be avoided. Precautions must be taken by those working with poultry.WHO is now following up with public health authorities in the Russian Federation and other relevant organizations. Although this strain of influenza has not previously been known to affect humans, it has been detected in farmed and wild birds in countries across the European Region, including Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and now the Russian Federation.

Diagnostics Testing|Mar.05, 2021 Waking up with a runny nose wouldn't be cause for alarm in "normal times." However, that's all changed thanks to COVID-19. Now the slightest runny nose or cough can cause alarm. Is it COVID-19? Is it just a cold? The flu? Amid this pandemic, distinguishing one respiratory illness from another has never been so important. Even though we're experiencing a mild influenza season due to social distancing and additional COVID-19 precautions, combining the COVID-19 pandemic with any infection season can create anxiety about the unknown. For some, concern about the flu has taken a backseat to concern about COVID-19, but that isn't a reason to overlook the effect other respiratory illnesses might have on your health. Influenza and COVID-19, along with the colder months pointing to increases in respiratory illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), make having answers regarding your health especially crucial. That's why we've developed AlinityTM m Resp-4-Plex, a new assay running on our advanced Alinity m system that tests for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV using only one swab. The ability to use just one swab during a healthcare visit, rather than four separate tests, aims to decrease discomfort, lessen cost demands for doctors and lab workers, and eliminate unnecessary stress for everyone. Minimizing the number of swabs used and time spent in a healthcare setting, like a doctor's office, has never been more important as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continue to surge. Not only can receiving streamlined answers about the health of you and your loved ones provide peace of mind — it can help you make informed next-steps on how to proceed with treatment and possibly prevent disease transmission. The benefits of simultaneous testing for infectious diseases Alinity m Resp-4-Plex's simultaneous testing will not only increase convenience and decrease discomfort for the patient — it aims to help stretched healthcare workers and save high demand testing supplies as well, by increasing laboratory and hospital efficiency and decreasing resources (such as swabs) used. These four common respiratory illnesses are posing stress to an already burdened healthcare and laboratory system: Influenza types A and B are known to cause seasonal flu epidemics annually in the U.S.RSV is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, common-cold-type symptoms but can be severe for both young infants and older adults.And, of course, COVID-19 is the latest, now common virus the world is battling. These four common viruses share a variety of common symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, and fatigue), making distinguishing one from the other more difficult. The test will run on our Alinity m platform, our most advanced laboratory instrument which uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. This technology is known for its high sensitivity in detecting infectious diseases. Alinity m also provides true random access, meaning that any compatible test can be run at any time. This flexibility allows for the testing of multiple infectious diseases while still producing fast results — ultimately improving lab speed. When it comes to your health, you deserve flexibility and speed. You deserve an easier path for finding peace of mind. We're committed to providing needed answers in the most comfortable, simple way. INTENDED USE: The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is a multiplex real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and differentiation of RNA from influenza A virus (flu A), influenza B virus (flu B), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 in nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected by a healthcare provider (HCP), or in nasal swab specimens that are self-collected at a healthcare location, from individuals suspected by their HCP of respiratory viral infection consistent with COVID-19. Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory viral infection due to SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV can be similar. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. § 263a, that meet requirements to perform moderate or high complexity tests. Results are for the identification and differentiation of RNA from influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2. The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is not intended to detect influenza C virus. RNA from influenza A, influenza B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 is generally detectable in respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of active infection but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other pathogens not detected by the test. Clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all SARS-CoV-2 results to the appropriate public health authorities. Negative results do not preclude influenza A, influenza B, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. Testing with the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is intended for use by trained operators who are proficient in performing tests using the Alinity m system and in vitro diagnostic procedures. The Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration's Emergency Use Authorization. For in vitro diagnostic use. Rx Only. Like this article IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION For use under an Emergency Use Authorization only. • This assay is for in vitro diagnostic use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization only. • Use of the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is limited to personnel who have been trained in the procedures of a molecular diagnostic assay and the Alinity m System. • Laboratories are required to report all SARS-CoV-2 results to the appropriate public health authorities. • The instrument and assay procedures reduce the risk of contamination by amplification product. However, nucleic acid contamination from positive controls or specimens must be controlled by good laboratory practices and careful adherence to the procedures specified in this package insert. • Optimal performance of this test requires appropriate specimen collection, storage, and transport to the test site (refer to the SPECIMEN COLLECTION, STORAGE, AND TRANSPORT TO THE TEST SITE section of this package insert). • Detection of flu A, flu B, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be affected by sample collection methods, patient factors (eg, presence of symptoms), and/or stage of infection. • Recent patient exposure to FluMist® or other attenuated influenza vaccines may cause inaccurate positive results for flu A and flu B due to the presence of attenuated viruses. • False-negative results may arise from degradation of the viral RNA during storage and transport of the specimens. • As with any molecular test, mutations within the target regions of Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay could affect primer and/or probe binding resulting in failure to detect the presence of virus. • Results should be interpreted by a trained professional in conjunction with the patient's history and clinical signs and symptoms, and epidemiological risk factors. • Negative results do not preclude infection with the flu A, flu B, RSV, or SARS-CoV-2 and should not be the sole basis of a patient treatment/management or public health decision. Follow up testing should be performed according to the current CDC recommendations. • Self-collected under supervision of or healthcare provider collected nasal swabs are additional acceptable upper respiratory specimens that can be tested with the Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay; however, performance with this specimen type has not been validated. • Influenza was validated in the clinical study by testing archived, selected specimens only.

As I’ve researched past pandemics, such as the 1918 "Spanish" flu, I couldn’t help but notice COVID-19’s contrasting effects on society—in particular, these pandemics’ impact on the lives of women. Much of the recently published literature compares various aspects of the 2 pandemics—statistics, mitigation efforts, economic impact—but there has not been much comparison of gender issues and attitudes. The 1918 influenza pandemic was pivotal in advancing women’s role in the workplace and eventually the right to vote. However, as one of my colleagues recently wrote, COVID-19 seems to have sent women backwards. What lessons can today's women learn from the past? The Great War & The Great Pandemic The H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known (somewhat inaccurately) as the "Spanish flu" pandemic, had a profound impact on the United States; furthermore, the role of women in society was forever changed by the events of the decade. World War I set the stage for extensive spread of the flu virus, which hit the U.S. in the spring of 1918. Woman working at a typewriter during 1918 flu pandemic. Source: https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemicecords-list.html The war, combined with increased flu deaths in 1918, left substantial vacancies in the workforce. These vacancies provided an opportunity for women to step into lines of work previously deemed inappropriate or too dangerous, such as the textile industry and manufacturing, science and research and even medical laboratory occupations. Following the war, the number of women in the workforce was 25% higher than it had been previously, and by 1920 women made up 21% of all gainfully employed individuals in the country. Women’s willingness to rise to the challenges of these positions not only allowed them to gain social and financial independence, but also inspired them to become more active in promoting women's rights—including the right to vote. As a result of the pandemic, authorities banned crowds and large meetings, rendering women’s rights activists unable to speak at election campaigns and rallies. With the right to vote hanging in the balance, suffragists quickly adapted their strategy to circulate their message among smaller groups of neighbors and friends. The critical role women played throughout World War I and the H1N1 flu of 1918 earned them recognition in the political arena. Thanks to their momentous contributions, dedication to serving the nation and political perseverance, women eventually won the right to vote when the 19th Amendment was passed in 1920. Fast Forward to Today Today the world finds itself amid a pandemic, not entirely unlike that of 1918. However, women have been hit particularly hard this time around, and as their roles in society have shifted over the years, the systems meant to support them have not kept up. Low wages and inadequate childcare options are not new barriers—women have had to overcome these, and others, for ages. Nonetheless, when schools and daycares shut down or moved to a virtual platform, women’s jobs were disproportionately affected because they are still the primary care givers in the home. In one survey, 1 in 4 women who became unemployed in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic did so due to lack of childcare—double the rate of men. Women are also more likely than men to work in low-wage jobs, and in 2-income households where one partner must leave the workforce, it is typically the person with the lower income: the woman. A United Nations report released in 2020 found that gender bias against women is still prevalent and is observed in both men and women: 91% of men and 86% of women exhibit bias against gender equality in areas ranging from politics and education to intimate partner violence and women’s reproductive rights. Furthermore, the report states that approximately 50% of men and women surveyed across 75 countries consider male political leaders superior to females, and over 40% believe men are better business executives than women. Recently published reports and surveys such as this make it seem like much of the progress women have made has come to a halt, or worse, started to regress. But what if the pandemic is actually an opportunity? Lessons From the Past When flu cases exploded in 1918, suffragists seemingly suffered a setback in their movement for women’s rights. They were entering the workforce at a rapid pace, while today women are leaving the workforce at a high rate. Between 2020 and 2021, more than 2.3 million women in the U.S. dropped out of the country’s labor force, causing women’s labor force participation rate to fall to 57%—a 33-year low. Even though each pandemic had drastically different effects on women, we can learn from the way women in 1918 reacted to their ever-changing environment: Don't Give Up Suffragists had been advocating for women’s rights long before the pandemic of 1918 hit. They remained active throughout the Great Pandemic and the Great War, and their determination paid off. The pandemic we are experiencing today has presented many challenges, especially for working women. However, it has brought to light many of the barriers women have faced for a long time, which have employers considering alternatives to the traditional workday. Women in the workplace have been fighting for better childcare and more flexible work schedules for decades. Now is not the moment to abandon working towards policies that better support women who work outside the home while raising families. Stay Adaptable Suffragists were ultimately successful due, in part, to their ability to adapt to rules and regulations put in place because of the pandemic. They quickly changed their strategy to align with new pandemic guidelines in much the same way today’s society has during COVID-19. The ability to adapt to frequent changes in procedures, recommendations and expectations demonstrates our value as members of any team. Adopting flexible advocacy techniques is also essential to the future success of professional women. Seize Opportunities The labor force vacancies created by widespread war and flu deaths opened a world of possibilities for women on the home front. Women recognized this as an opportunity to prove they were capable. Similarly, women can use the opportunities afforded to them by the current pandemic to prove they are capable—of being both mothers and scientists, of balancing work and life, of being productive outside of the office. Sure, women have been doing these things for years, but why not seize this opportunity to highlight just that? Forward-Focused The focus for women in science has long been on increasing their numbers in research, industry and academia, but the barriers preventing many women from furthering their education, obtaining large grants, spending countless hours in the lab, etc., still exist. COVID-19 has brought many of these into the spotlight and forced employers to find alternative solutions or risk losing a significant and valuable portion of their workforce. Some of the alternatives that have been offered to workers have the potential to contribute to a substantial reduction in barriers that stand between women and careers in science, and women need to take this opportunity to focus advocacy on what is likely to be accomplished because of this pandemic. Make Education More Accessible Without having the chance to further their education, women simply cannot break into science-based careers. The tradition of going off to college or graduate school has been trending towards major transformation for a while, but COVID-19 forced academia to adapt to the times much more quickly. While not a perfect solution, offering college or graduate courses virtually allows for schedule flexibility, which is necessary for many women to access higher education. Those already in academia must consider this option and what it could mean for helping more women enter scientific fields that were previously “off-limits.” Insist on Better Childcare Options Childcare in the United States is cost prohibitive for some families, let alone single mothers with little to no support system. Children attending school gives parents some reprieve, but traditional office hours are often longer than school hours, leaving parents to find childcare for both before and after school. When the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic forced schools and day cares to close, society’s reliance on an already inadequate system became painfully obvious. Because the subject of childcare is currently dominating conversations, this is the time to examine what changes are necessary and start working toward those changes. Flexible Work Schedules Public health guidelines for social distancing and staying home to flatten the curve compelled employers to allow telecommuting when feasible. As it turns out, permitting employees to work from home does not always result in decreased productivity; in some cases, productivity increased. What is especially noteworthy about telecommuting, though, is how accommodating it can be for women with obligations both in and out of the office. Acknowledging these benefits and allowing workers to continue telecommuting may increase job satisfaction, attract more women to scientific disciplines and help retain women presently employed in science-based occupations. Progress Is Tough, but So Are We The 1918 influenza pandemic was pivotal in advancing women’s role in the workplace and eventually helped them earn the right to vote. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on working women. Despite the differences, there are lessons to be learned from the women who endured the Flu of 1918. The 1918 pandemic, along with the war, was a tumultuous period during which women made great sacrifices. Yet, they continued to fight hard for their voting rights and their new status in society. Looking back, we can find inspiration and hope that the sacrifices and contributions women are making now will end in success. Women in science must continue to promote change, support each other and advocate for more women to join us. Progress is tough, but we are too. Stay persistent—our daughters are watching.

A recent study published in Science Translational Medicine shows that a new flu vaccine appears to protect monkeys against influenza strains that are likely to cause a global pandemic, giving researchers hope that this vaccine could hold the key to providing a future universal flu vaccine for humans. Approximately 50,000 Americans die from the flu every year. Compared with the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, influenza viruses mutate at a much faster rate, resulting in multiple new strains each year. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 virus typically mutates into different variants of the same virus, rather than mutating into a completely different strain. Because influenza changes so rapidly, flu vaccines that are designed to combat flu strains that are circulating during the winter in the Southern part of the world might be ineffective once the Northern part of the world enters its winter. In the new study, researchers added an adjuvant to a flu vaccine to increase the immune system response to the shot among nonhuman primates. Monkeys’ immune systems are similar to humans’, which is likely why the vaccine worked well in the primates compared with mice or ferrets, two animal models featured in the researchers’ prior work. When the monkeys received the vaccine, they produced a high number of neutralizing antibodies to several different dangerous influenza strains. Given the promise of this vaccine having a broad protective effect against influenza viruses, the investigators of this study said they have now moved toward testing this vaccine in small human clinical trials. These trials are working toward evaluating the safety and possible immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy adult volunteers. In December, another group of developers of a universal vaccine candidate published promising results of their vaccine in Nature Medicine. The vaccine focuses on the stalk of the hemagglutinins, viral proteins that stud their surfaces, resulting in the production of stalk-reactive antibodies in humans. While the Phase I study only tested the safety and immune response associated with this vaccine, the investigators subsequently found that the antibodies produced from the vaccine in mice protected them from the effects of influenza virus after transferring vaccine-triggered human antibodies into the mice and challenging them with the flu virus. Developing a universal flu vaccine has been on the forefront of many pharmaceutical companies’ development plans for years, but some companies have found that making headway into developing an effective vaccine has been lackluster at best. BiondVax, a biopharmaceutical company in Israel that is focused primarily on developing a universal influenza vaccine, said in October that their universal flu vaccine candidate M-001 did not lead to a significant reduction in flu illness and severity compared with placebo in a Phase III trial. “The significant need for better, more proactive flu protection is well-understood by clinicians and public health experts around the world, and we have devoted many years in pursuit of this worthy goal,” said BiondVax’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ron Babecoff, in a statement. “Unfortunately, this study did not have the efficacy outcomes that we anticipated for M-001 on a standalone basis. We have observed in seven previous studies that M-001 safely provoked an immune response to a broad range of flu strains, but ultimately this was not sufficient on a standalone basis to show protection.” Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print Brandon May LATEST Alzheimer’s Leqembi, Kisunla and Beyond: The Next Wave of Alzheimer’s at CTAD 2024 November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · Kate Goodwin Huntington’s After Decades of Failure, First Disease-Modifying Huntington’s Treatment on the Horizon November 11, 2024 · 7 min read · Heather McKenzie Opinion Drugs Are Becoming “Smarter.” Here’s How November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · David Benshoof Klein Huntington’s 5 Huntington’s Therapies to Watch November 11, 2024 · 5 min read · Kate Goodwin Alzheimer’s disease Eisai Cuts Fiscal 2024 Guidance for Biogen-Partnered Leqembi as Sales Disappoint Analysts November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac FEATURED STORIES Editorial Lilly vs. Novo: The ‘He Said, She Said’ Row About Catalent’s GLP-1 Work November 8, 2024 · 4 min read · Greg Slabodkin Funding Navigating a Biotech Exit in a Rebounding Market November 6, 2024 · 8 min read · Ana Mulero Job trends Cell Therapy Biotechs Hunt for Autoimmune Expertise in Pivot From Oncology November 6, 2024 · 6 min read · Annalee Armstrong Business Lacks Family Lawsuits Seek Share of Profits Stemming from HeLa Cells November 5, 2024 · 7 min read · Sanjukta Mondal CAR T CAR T and Related Therapies Home In on Autoimmune Disease November 4, 2024 · 9 min read · Shawna Williams MORE ON THIS TOPIC China AstraZeneca’s China Head Taken Into Custody by Chinese Authorities: Reports November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac China Pfizer Makes $1B Commitment in China to Boost Innovation, Targets Chinese Market November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac Layoff Tracker Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Will Lay Off 45% of Employees November 7, 2024 · 176 min read · BioSpace Editorial Staff Layoffs Viracta Therapeutics Cuts 42% of Staff as Part of Resource Reprioritization November 7, 2024 · 2 min read · Angela Gabriel BioSpace is the digital hub for life science news and jobs.

WaxmanMarch 4, 2021 12:20 PM ESTAfter being closed for almost exactly a year, New York City plans to partially reopen movie theaters on Mar. 5. While many questions remain as theaters slowly reopen across the county, one thing is certain: people have missed going to the movies in the past year as much as they did during the 1918 pandemic.Newspaper articles in the digital archive of the Influenza Encyclopedia, produced by the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, reported elation about the reopening of theaters. Back then, if people weren’t watching movies in theaters, they weren’t watching them at all. Unlike film buffs in the early 20th century, most people in the COVID-19 pandemic have been able to watch movies the entire time, streaming them from home or even going to outdoor screenings. But just like today, there was trepidation about heading back to an enclosed theater, along with great excitement about seeing movies again.From around 1905 and 1908, movies became the premiere form of entertainment for the masses. Dubbed the nickelodeon era because films usually cost a nickel, theaters ranged from a storefront to setting up chairs and a projector and a screen. Filmmaking itself was also more diverse, where virtually anyone with a camera and a couple of actors could make a movie, according to William J. Mann, author of 2014 book Tinseltown: Murder, Morphine, and Madness at the Dawn of Hollywood. But from 1908 to 1917, movie palaces noted for their gilded and red velvet interiors opened to cater to a more affluent clientele, and the studio system started to emerge.“1918 to 1920 is a turning point for the industry,” says Mann. “There was already a move within the industry to consolidate and create a more structured production system and more efficient distribution and exhibition system, and the fact that the pandemic happened in the midst of that made those changes even more profound. Movies had been just novelties in 1910, but by 1918, they’re huge moneymakers, a vital part of the economy.”As the deadliest wave of the 1918 flu pandemic hit in early fall on the East Coast, movie theaters closed for several weeks, and as the virus made its way West, pictures houses in those regions shut-down too.On Oct. 9, 1918, the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry announced it would stop sending new releases to America’s 17,500 movie theaters from Oct. 13 to Nov. 9 until “the grip crisis” has “subsided”—a move that impacted more than a million employees, the New York American reported. About 60% of film production in California came to a halt. The movie industry worried it was “the beginning of the end,” Benjamin Hampton wrote in his 1931 A History of the Movies, and filmmaker and writer Lewis Jacobs said insiders feared “seemingly imminent ruin” in his 1939 The Rise of the American Film.About a week after the Chicago health department closed picture houses, an editorial headlined “We Miss Our Movies” ran in the Oct. 22, 1918, edition of the Chicago Herald And Examiner:Until the grip closed the movies, few persons of whatever age realized how important the pictures had become in their lives. In a few years, and so gradually as to be almost imperceptible, the custom of watching them has grown upon individuals of all mentalities to a greater extent than they realized until they suddenly were deprived of them. Who would attempt to calculate the volume of light that has been shed upon humanity by the spinning film! ‘An hour to kill’ no longer exists in the scheme of things… Before the ‘flu’ arrived some of us may have felt of the motion picture that we could ‘take it or leave it alone.’ Our belief is slipping…Just like during the COVID-19 pandemic, people in the early 20th century found a variety of ways to still watch movies.The Atlanta Constitution reported that people applauded Charlie Chaplin’s face as it was projected onto a large screen outdoors. In Nashville, prominent businessman Tony Sudekum introduced a mobile movie projector, mounting a moving picture machine onto a three-ton white truck, decking it out with Liberty Loan posters and hit the road to show patriotic films. One of his teammates on this venture boasted that the “moving movie getup” could have “the whole shootin’-match rigged up into the ding-bustedest traveling circus that ever bit the sawdust trail, by heck.”Not all movie theaters closed, however. In Michigan and New York City, some were enlisted to fight the epidemic. A speaker would explain how influenza spreads and the dangers of the virus, and then show educational slides on good hygiene practices. “The moving-picture theatre was of great assistance to the Department of Health in furthering the work of public health education during the epidemic,” New York City Health Commissioner Royal Copeland wrote in a Dec. 17, 1918, letter to the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry.The rationale behind keeping these movie theaters open was that that they were among the only ways to disseminate public health to mass audiences in the era before the golden age of radio and TV, according to Ben Strassfeld, film historian who wrote “Infectious Media: Debating the Role of Movie Theaters in Detroit during the Spanish Influenza of 1918” published online by the Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television in 2017.The movie industry also hoped the public health campaigns would improve public perceptions of movies. The educational use of movie theaters came at a time when “the industry has spent the last decade trying to achieve respectability, and appeal to middle class, upper class audiences and women,” says Strassfeld. “Part of the way that they did that was by building newer, safer theaters that obeyed fire safety codes and had better ventilation to distance the industry from its early roots in storefront Nickelodeon theaters.”By the end of 1918 and early 1919, many cities thought they were over the worst of the pandemic, and thought they knew how to keep it under control. So when movie theaters did reopen, the precautions will sound familiar in the COVID-19 era. They ranged from spaced-out seating to mask requirements.“The gauze guard must adorn countenances,” as the Nov. 14, 1918, Oakland Tribune reported. In nearby San Francisco, moviegoers packed sold-out theaters “en masse and also en masque,” as the San Francisco Chronicle put it. In Spokane, Wash., theaters opened at half-capacity, keeping every other row of seats vacant for social distancing. In San Antonio, Texas, the health department said anyone who coughs in a movie theater must immediately leave to “avoid the embarrassment of being requested by the ushers to do so,” and each theater was supposed to assign a man “who shall have as his sole business the spotting of any person in the audience who coughs,” reported the Jan. 15, 1919, San Antonio Express. One man in Rochester, N.Y., took it upon himself to inspect the city’s motion picture houses and wrote a letter to the Rochester Times-Union editor on the “abomination” of conditions, “bodies packed together, like sardines” in “muggy warm” theaters, observing that “half the audience was coughing and sneezing, spitting and hawking.” Running in the Dec. 31, 1918, edition, the watchdog called for ushers to patrol the showings every hour with “antiseptic loaded guns spraying the atmosphere,” otherwise, “there is not the slightest possibility of stamping out the epidemic of influenza in Rochester.”Nationwide, many movie theaters opened to sold-out audiences, boosting not only morale, but local economies. In Portland, Ore., the reopening of movies “probably means more to more people than any other feature of the re-established order of things” because ticket buyers also hit up the “late lunch houses,” sweets shops, and “chocolate counters,” per the November 16, 1918, edition of the Oregon Daily Journal.“Unmuzzled” movie lovers also flooded the theaters in Seattle the day they re-reopened, the Nov. 13, 1918, edition of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported, noting that excitement about theaters re-opening was boosted by with excitement over the end of the fighting on the Western Front. “The health commissioner must have realized what a martyrdom he had imposed on the people when he saw the joy with which they cast the six layers of medicated cheese cloth from their countenances and emerged from their disguises,” the paper reported.But not all picture houses and production companies were able to restart so quickly. Smaller studios either went under or were bought by larger studios, according to Strassfeld. Mann points out that movie theater chains crop up, as mom-and-pop movie theaters had to shut down, enabling people like [Paramount co-founder] Adolph Zukor to swoop in, buy them up. Studios also began to control theaters. (The U.S. Supreme Court ruled this system of controlling the means of production, distribution and exhibition of films violated anti-trust laws in the late 1940s.)The movie business has changed over the last century, but why people love films has stayed the same.“That we never appreciate the things we have until we lose them was shown clearly yesterday when the theaters and movies of Atlanta opened their doors again at the regular hours after the long intermission due to the ‘flu’,” according to the Oct 29, 1918, edition of the Atlanta Constitution. “For years Atlantans had taken it for granted that the best amusements available would be furnished them, and a certain blasé feeling resulted. For the last few weeks, however, with all these good things barred, this feeling vanished quickly, and the patrons would have been glad to see the very poorest movie of the period of the two or three reelers, or the very worst vaudeville or miniature musical comedy now on the market.”“Get out new masks for the whole family,“ wrote San Francisco Examiner columnist Annie Laurie, whose Nov. 16, 1918, column described seeing actors on the big screen again as “the sunshine after a day of hanging fog and gray mist; it’s like a light in the room when the shadows begin to fall and sad memories lay their icy fingers upon the human heart.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerRobert Zemeckis Just Wants to Move YouHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhy Vinegar Is So Good for YouMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersWrite to Olivia B.

This case-crossover study analyzed data from Taiwan’s real-world National Health Insurance Research Database. This study included elderly (≥ 67 years old) patients with CKD having incident PAOD from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2015. We defined 1 year before PAOD onset as the index date for the self-control group. A conditional logistic regression model was used to investigate exposure to an influenza vaccination for estimating the risk for incident PAOD following vaccination. In total, this study included 46,782 elderly patients with CKD having incident PAOD. The odds ratios for incident PAOD were 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.77–0.94), 0.85 (0.79–0.92), 0.84 (0.79–0.90), and 0.85 (0.81–0.90) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months after an influenza vaccination, respectively. We observed consistent results for the subgroups of patients with CKD and concomitant diabetes. However, we did not observe any beneficial effects of influenza vaccination in patients with advanced CKD or end-stage renal disease. This study demonstrated that influenza vaccination may be associated with a reduced risk of incident PAOD among patients with early-stage CKD.

Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence rates of CKD and ESRD worldwide2,3. Additionally, diabetes mellitus (DM) is the primary cause of ESRD in 40–50% of patients in Taiwan3. Patients with CKD have a higher rate of cardiovascular mortality, which is predominantly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), than age-matched controls without CKD4.Increasing evidence has revealed that CKD and ESRD are key risk factors for noncardiovascular morbidity, and after cardiovascular disease, infection is the second leading cause of hospitalization5,6,7. Patients with CKD are at a high risk of contracting influenza6. Among elderly individuals aged 65 years or older, those with CKD are at a higher risk of major influenza-related complications considering their altered immune response and persistent low-grade inflammation5,8. Major complications of influenza can lead to hospitalization or even cardiovascular mortality. Observational studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of first acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the hospitalization rate, and the mortality risk among elderly patients with CKD or ESRD8. In clinical practice guidelines, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all adults with CKD5.PAOD is a systemic atherosclerotic process, with the same critical risk factors as those for CAD and stroke. Major risk factors for PAOD include DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, advanced age, and cigarette smoking9. PAOD prevalence increases with age; it is estimated to be 10% in adults older than 55 years10. PAOD comprises a wide range of clinical presentations from asymptomatic lesions to critical limb ischemia. However, patients with PAOD are usually asymptomatic and their conditions may remain undiagnosed. The majority of patients with PAOD also develop severe CAD11. Studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of recurrent major cardiovascular events in patients with CAD12,13. On the basis of this evidence, annual influenza vaccination is recommended as a class 1 indication for patients with PAOD, despite the lack of direct evidence14.Recent studies have revealed an increased risk of PAOD in patients with CKD15,16. The protective effect of a vaccine for preventing PAOD progression in elderly patients with CKD is not completely understood. To assess the potential benefit of influenza vaccination for reducing PAOD risk in elderly patients with CKD, we conducted a population-based case-crossover study by using reimbursement claims data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan.Materials and methodsData sourceIn this case-crossover study, data were obtained from the NHIRD in Taiwan between January 2004 and December 2015. Taiwan’s NHI program was implemented in March 1995 and covered 99.6% of the Taiwanese population of 23 million by 2015. In the NHIRD, the data of registration files and medical claims for all beneficiaries can be linked through encrypted identification numbers (details available at http:/hird.nhri.org.tw/en/index.htm). Diseases in the NHIRD were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes (until 2015). Detailed description and reviews of this database are provided elsewhere17. The current study was approved by the Taipei Medical University-Joint Institutional Review Board (TMU-JIRB No.: N201908050). The requirement for informed consent was waived by the TMU-JIRB because all data from the NHIRD have been anonymized. Our research was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Study populationWe identified all patients with CKD having incident PAOD between January 1, 2006, and June 30, 2015. We used a 2-year washout period (2004–2005) to ensure that patients with CKD did not have a prior PAOD diagnosis (Fig. 1). Patients were considered to have PAOD if they had at least three outpatient visits or at least one hospitalization associated with the following ICD-9-CM codes: 440.2, 440.3, 440.8, 440.9, 443, 444.22, 444.8, 447.8, or 447.9. Patients with CKD, including CKD patients whose disease progressed to ESRD, were identified as those with at least three outpatient claims records or at least one inpatient claims record with the following ICD-9-CM codes before PAOD onset: 250.4, 274.1, 283.11, 403, 404, 440.1, 442.1, 447.3, 581–582, 585–589, 642.1, or 646.2. We did not include chronic pyelonephritis as CKD patients due to coexisting chronic inflammation and pyogenic infection. Besides, polycystic kidney is an inherited, multisystemic, and progressive disorder characterized by cyst formation and enlargement of the kidney and other organs (e.g., liver, pancreas, and spleen), which was also excluded in our study. Patients with ESRD were identified as those receiving dialysis without a kidney transplant before PAOD onset.Figure 1Flowchart of the selection criteria and process for eligible patients with CKD and PAOD. CKD chronic kidney disease, PAOD peripheral arterial occlusive disease.Full size imageSeasonal influenza vaccinationIn Taiwan, the influenza vaccination has been free of charge and recommended for the high-risk elderly population since 1998 and for all adults older than 65 years since 20018. The vaccine usually includes a mixture of two influenza A strains and one or two influenza B strains. Almost all people in Taiwan receive the same components of the seasonal influenza vaccine. The vaccination status was identified using the ICD-9-CM code V04.8 and/or the use of a vaccine (confirmed based on drug codes).case-crossover design and exposure measurementThe case-crossover design is a special type of case-only study, which includes only cases, and the cases serve as their own control18,19. Time-invariant confounders are implicitly adjusted for because of the within-person comparison. We defined the 1 year before the onset of PAOD as the index date for the self-control group. The extra 1 year period before the index day of self-control is essential for the comparison with PAOD case. For the above reasons, we recruited patients with incident PAOD when they were 67 years or older, assuring that all study population are eligible to receive free influenza vaccines. A previous study demonstrated that the effect of the vaccine does not commence within the initial 2 weeks of administration20. Therefore, we did not consider 2 weeks prior to the incident PAOD diagnosis and index date as the exposure window (Supplementary Fig. S1). The effect of influenza vaccination was measured from 2 weeks before the index date to 6 weeks before the index date for a 1-month exposure window in both the case and control groups. We considered the length of the exposure window to be either 1, 2, 3, or 4 months prior to 2 weeks before the index date for both the case and control groups. We also excluded patients who received two consecutive influenza vaccinations within less than 1 year due to the possible misclassification of no exposure in the self-control group in the case-crossover design (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, patients with missing data for age or sex, those aged less than 67 years, or those without CKD were excluded (Fig. 1).CovariatesWe identified DM based on the presence of at least 1 admission record or at least 3 outpatient visits with the ICD-9-CM code 250 within 1 year before the index date in both the case and control groups. In this study, advanced CKD was defined as the presence of the relevant codes for CKD and concomitant reimbursements for prescriptions of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), which are initiated when patients with CKD have serum creatinine levels of > 6 mg/dL (approximately equivalent to the glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and hematocrit of < 28%21; in the absence of treatment with an ESA, early-stage CKD was confirmed21.Statistical analysisWe first estimated the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of incident PAOD by using a conditional logistic regression model and subsequently stratified the study population by sex. We also performed subgroup analyses among patients with DM, early-stage CKD, or advanced CKD/ESRD. To reduce selection bias, we excluded patients who were hospitalized for more than 30 days within 1 year prior to PAOD onset, because influenza vaccination may be delayed or may not even be provided to these patients due to their fragile status. All analyses were performed using the SAS statistical software package (SAS System for Windows, Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).ResultsAfter excluding patients with missing data, we identified 46,782 elderly patients with CKD having incident PAOD. The flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. The characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1. The mean age of patients with CKD having incident PAOD was 77.6 ± 6.7 years. Figure 2 shows that the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs; in parentheses) for PAOD in the study population were 0.85 (0.77–0.94), 0.85 (0.79–0.92), 0.84 (0.79–0.90), and 0.85 (0.81–0.90) for the exposure windows of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. For men, the ORs were 0.84 0.74–0.96), 0.82 (0.74–0.91), 0.82 (0.75–0.89), and 0.83 (0.77–0.90) for the exposure windows of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. For women, the ORs were 0.86 (0.74–1.00), 0.89 (0.80–1.00), 0.88 (0.80–0.97), and 0.88 (0.81–0.96) for the exposure windows of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively.Table 1 Characteristics of patients with PAOD.Full size tableFigure 2ORs for incident PAOD after influenza vaccination in patients with CKD when the control was selected from 1 year before PAOD. CKD chronic kidney disease, PAOD peripheral arterial occlusive disease, ORs odds ratios.Full size imageSupplementary Figures S2 and S3 illustrate the subgroup analyses of patients with DM and early-stage CKD, respectively. The results were identical to those of the main analysis for all patients. However, the ORs for influenza vaccination for the exposure windows of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months were not statistically significant and were close to unity among patients with advanced CKD/ESRD (Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, in sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were hospitalized for more than 30 days prior to PAOD onset, the ORs and 95% CIs (in parentheses) were 0.88 (0.80–0.98), 0.87 (0.81–0.95), 0.88 (0.82–0.94), and 0.89 (0.84–0.95) for the exposure windows of 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. The results were similar to those of the main analysis for all patients (Supplementary Fig. S5).DiscussionOur case-crossover study provided several critical findings regarding the potential protective effects of an influenza vaccination. First, elderly patients with CKD and who received influenza vaccinations exhibited a lower risk of incident PAOD within 4 months of vaccination, and these protective effects were consistently observed in patients with DM. Second, after study population stratification, in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD, influenza vaccination did not exhibit protective effects against PAOD. Our findings support the hypothesis that influenza vaccination reduces the PAOD risk only in elderly patients with early-stage CKD.Patients with CKD are at a substantially higher risk of ASCVD3,4,22,23,24,25,26. Khalique et al.22 demonstrated that patients with an eGFR of < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 had a 4.1-fold higher risk of developing triple-vessel CAD than patients with an eGFR of > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2. A meta-analysis including over 1.2 million participants revealed a linear association between lower eGFR and the risk of cardiovascular mortality23. Cerebrovascular accidents are also commonly observed in all stages of CKD. A meta-analysis of 21 studies showed that an eGFR of < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 was associated with a 43% higher risk of incident stroke24. Patients on dialysis have higher risks of CAD and stroke. Rostand et al. reported that 73% of patients on hemodialysis had developed significant CAD25. A large study based on the NHIRD in Taiwan revealed a threefold higher risk of ischemic stroke in patients on dialysis than the general population26. A study revealed a cumulative increase in ASCVD risk during the transition from CKD to ESRD3. In addition to CAD and stroke, PAOD is highly prevalent among individuals with CKD because of the shared risk factors16,27. In an international collaborative meta-analysis including 0.8 million individuals, patients with mild-to-moderate CKD had a 1.5–4 times increased risk of PAOD than the general population27.The prevalence of PAOD is approximately 3–10%, and it increases with age28. Nearly 75% of patients with PAOD are asymptomatic, resulting in poor diagnosis and late treatment29. Symptomatic PAOD is divided into the following stages: intermittent claudication, ischemic pain at rest, and ulcer or gangrene formation30. Incident PAOD is associated with stroke, CAD, and all-cause mortality11,29,31. The etiology of ACS or stroke is the thrombotic occlusion of culprit vessels. Similarly, the presence of symptomatic PAOD is largely due to acute thrombotic events, and collateral circulation is not promptly developed to compensate for the acute ischemic burden.Influenza vaccination has been observed to promote the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques and generate atheroprotective immune responses in ApoE-deficient mice32. In a 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of eight randomized trials, Clar et al. found that in patients with cardiovascular disease, influenza vaccination may reduce cardiovascular mortality and combined cardiovascular events33. Three large and important randomized trials, namely IAMI, IVVE, and INVESTED trials, also provide highly relevant clinical data on the efficacy of influenza as a secondary preventive measure of severe cardiovascular disease34,35,36. Chen et al. demonstrated that in elderly patients with CKD, patients receiving influenza vaccination exhibited a lower risk of hospitalization for ACS, and they noted a trend of decreased risk with an increase in the number of vaccinations8. As mentioned earlier in the text, the influenza vaccine is effective for ACS or stroke prevention in elderly patients with CKD. For the same reason, we assumed that the vaccine would also be effective for the prevention of acute thrombotic events in patients with asymptomatic or undiagnosed PAOD.Although several studies have indicated that the influenza vaccine could reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and the hospitalization rates in patients with ESRD, evidence of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for the primary prevention of ASCVD in ESRD is lacking37,38. This may be attributable to the considerably lower response rates of patients with ESRD to the influenza vaccine39.Data on immune responses to high-dose vaccination in patients on dialysis are limited and conflicting40,41. Tanzi et al. reported that the administration of an additional second dose of the influenza vaccine did not improve the humoral response40. An observational study revealed that the administration of the high-dose influenza vaccine may be associated with lower hospitalization rates in patients on dialysis41. The effectiveness of the high-dose influenza vaccine among patients with ESRD remains unclear because of the lack of randomized trials; a low overall high-dose vaccination rate has been reported in a cohort study42.According to vaccination guidelines by the advisory committee on immunization practices, routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all people aged ≥ 6 months43. Influenza vaccination is critical for individuals who are at an increased risk of severe complications from influenza, including patients who have CKD and older patients. A consensus reached by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology suggests that patients with ASCVD should annually receive influenza vaccination as secondary preventive measure44. In our study population, influenza vaccination exerted a preventive effect against the risk of incident PAOD within 4 months after exposure. A study reported that the effectiveness of vaccination declines with time, and optimum protection is achieved within 3–4 months following vaccination45. The antibody response in elderly patients is considerably lower than that in young adults18. The effects of influenza vaccination on ASCVD were observed for 1 year or more8,36,37,38. However, the immune response generated by the influenza vaccine could not be maintained for such a long duration, particularly in elderly patients. Our observation period was 4 months, during which time we evaluated the protective effects of influenza vaccination more accurately.To our knowledge, our study is the first large study to assess the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of incident PAOD. Inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have been well documented, and infection is one of the most common factors affecting the inflammatory process46. Increasing evidence supports the effect of bacterial infections and human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and herpes zoster infection on PAOD development47,48,49; however, data on influenza are scant and unclear. Therefore, we used the NHIRD to identify an optimal sample size and applied a case-crossover design to minimize unmeasured confounders.The present study has several strengths; it was a large national population-based study without dropouts that used a well-established research database. We used a case-crossover design based on within-individual comparisons, which can implicitly minimize confounding bias through adjustment for time-invariant confounders. In addition, to improve the robustness of data regarding the potential protective effects of the influenza vaccine, we performed a sensitivity analysis after excluding patients with a fragile status and limited the exposure window from 2 weeks to 4 months; the results remained consistent.This study has several limitations. First, a PAOD diagnosis was identified based on ICD-9-CM codes, and diagnostic accuracy may be a concern. Because PAOD is clinically diagnosed, we identified PAOD patients based on the presence of three or more outpatient visits or one discharge claims record to ensure that diagnoses were reliable and valid. Second, the NHIRD does not provide detailed information on health-related factors, such as cigarette smoking, nutrition status, functional status, and family history of PAOD. These unmeasured confounders were likely avoided in this case-crossover study, except that patients were consistently 1 year older in the PAOD group than in the self-control group. As a result, the cumulative effect of aging on the risk of incident PAOD could lead to the underestimation of the protective effect of the vaccine (Supplementary Fig. S6). Accordingly, although better health condition in the controls, this difference wouldn’t change our study outcome. Third, information on the effects of DM and the CKD stage is lacking in this database. A sensitivity test was conducted to investigate the aforementioned effects (Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). The results remained consistent after stratification by DM and early-stage CKD. Fourth, because of the database limitation, advanced CKD without ESA may have been classified as early-stage CKD; nevertheless, the CKD stage was determined over a period before incident PAOD diagnosis, and approximately 85% of patients with advanced CKD stage 5 received ESA therapy in Taiwan21,50. The impact of misclassification of the CKD stage was expected to be minimal. We believe that the large study population drawn from the entire population of a country and the exhaustive patient enrollment criteria ensured that the results were robust. Fifth, the relationship between vaccine exposure and the risk of unnoticed or asymptomatic PAOD may exist. However, the primary objective of this study was to investigate whether the influenza vaccine provides protection and prevents disease progression or acute events of PAOD. Finally, our results pertained only to elderly Taiwanese patients; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to patients aged < 65 years or different populations. The prevalence of PAOD increases with age, and influenza vaccines are mainly received by elderly people; thus, our study results are valuable. The clinical relevance of this study must be further verified by large-scale prospective randomized control trials.ConclusionsIn the present population-based case-crossover study, we observed that elderly patients with CKD receiving influenza vaccination had a reduced risk of incident PAOD. However, the study did not include patients whose CKD had advanced to the dialysis stage or kidney transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to assess the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of PAOD. The protective effect of the influenza vaccine on patients with early-stage CKD may differ according to dosage; additional clinical trials are required to confirm these benefits.

Today, we woke up to images of the military erecting tents to serve as makeshift morgues outside Bellevue hospital as New York is bracing for potential surge in coronavirus victims. Sometimes, what the mirror reflects back is too horrifying to look at.”More from TVLineNew Amsterdam EPs Talk Doc's COVID Crisis, [Spoiler]'s Return and Telling 'More Human' Pandemic StoriesNew Amsterdam Season 3: Ryan Eggold Previews the Toll of COVID, Says It's 'Time to Address' Max and HelenChicago P.D.'s LaRoyce Hawkins Talks Police Shooting Episode, Race Discussions With Patrick John FluegerBut even a year later, Schulner and executive producer/director Peter Horton tell TVLine that the “lost” hour won’t make it to TV. “It’s a great episode. I hate that we can’t show it,” Horton laments, adding that the coronavirus pandemic is “so loud and huge that I just don’t see a justification for doing some sort of story about another outbreak. Nothing’s going to compare to what we’ve all been through and what we’ve already shown. So it’s not going to air.”Instead, the EPs chose to “cannibalize [the episode] and make it part of Season 3” by using some of the footage in this week’s season opener, Horton shares.“In that [Season 2] episode, Kapoor caught the influenza virus, and [having the character contract COVID] gave us an opportunity to use this footage that we shot, some of it in our large Bellevue atrium that we obviously can’t shoot at anymore,” Schulner explained in TVLine’s premiere post mortem. Plus, “we even used some of the footage for Iggy because it was so good,” Horton adds.New Amsterdam fans, are you disappointed the episode won’t air?

Highlighted comments from the transcript: The FDA’s emergency use authorization of Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine – part of Johnson & Johnson – is exciting news on many fronts. A single dose vaccine stored at refrigerated temperatures, that prevents hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, has the potential to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the U.S. and globally. BARDA has partnered with Janssen since 2015, working together on influenza and an Ebola vaccine. In February of 2020, BARDA and Janssen partnered again to develop a COVID-19 vaccine utilizing the same technology behind their Ebola vaccine that was licensed in the European Union. Janssen has leveraged BARDA’s Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing and our fill-finish manufacturing network – resources we created after the 2009 influenza pandemic – to manufacture this vaccine in the United States. Through the development of this vaccine, we are seeing the results of years of work on platform technologies and public-private partnerships coming to fruition.

In America, 675,000 people died of the disease.U.S. ARMY VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONSA 100-Year History of PandemicsLooking back at four public health crises and the effects of each on FordhamBy AIZA BHUIYAN and LUKE OSBORNFebruary 28, 2021COVID-19 isn’t the only pandemic the Fordham community has lived through. Over the past 100 years, the international community has faced different infectious diseases that disturbed our sense of normalcy. From the early 1900s to present day, each pandemic was unique in regard to the type of pathogen circulating and the subsequent public health response. While facing each virus head-on, researchers and government officials developed protocols and treatment plans that would later prepare them for future pandemics. This list of pandemics highlights how the Fordham community responded to each event in history. Spanish Flu Pandemic: 1918-1920 The dean of Fordham’s now-defunct medical school prescribed “rest, alcohol, simple diet, and the free use of mustard plasters and hot mustard footbaths” as a regimen to protect oneself against infection. In the early 20th century, the 1918 H1N1 virus, also known as “the Spanish flu,” swept across the planet, infecting about one-third of the world’s population. The flu claimed the lives of over 50 million people globally and 675,000 in the United States, including 20,000 New Yorkers. This number is comparable to the 26,000 New Yorkers who lost their lives in the COVID-19 pandemic so far. The 1918 H1N1 virus was incorrectly named the “Spanish flu” as it did not originate in Spain. During the first World War, Spain was a neutral entity. The free press in Spain consistently released information about the growing number of cases there. Other nations, however, did not provide accurate case counts among their populations. Because Spain was publishing the first recorded cases, many believed that the virus originated there and subsequently called it the Spanish flu. The 1918 H1N1 had a high mortality rate among children under five, healthy adults between 20-40 years of age and the elderly. Initially, the flu made its way through soldier populations on battlefields across Europe because of malnutrition, lack of hygiene and cramped conditions. The virus affected both the upper and lower respiratory tract of those who were infected, making it highly contagious and often lethal. The first wave of the pandemic was relatively innocuous. It was the second wave that claimed the majority of the lives lost. The efforts to contain the virus were through nonpharmaceutical interventions. Officials imposed limits on public gatherings, increased quarantine efforts and encouraged good personal hygiene and the use of disinfectants. Moreover, infected patients were forced into self-isolation. Although many of these precautions were effective, the pandemic revealed that the public, and even some physicians, did not know much about infectious diseases. For example, in 1918, the dean of Fordham’s now-defunct Medical School prescribed “rest, alcohol, simple diet, and the free use of mustard plasters and hot mustard footbaths” as a regimen to protect oneself against infection. During the summer of 1919, people began to build an immunity to the flu. Though the rate of infection decreased, the legacy of the pandemic remains today. Over the next few decades, many studies surrounding the 1918 H1N1 virus were conducted. The virus was sequenced and reconstructed in laboratory settings in order to help humans deal with future pandemics. AIDS Pandemic: 1981-present In West Africa during the 1920s, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) developed in a chimpanzee and was transferred to humans. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Toward the end of the 20 century, the virus spread across the globe. Currently, around 40 million people are living with HIV. In 1982, 335 people in the U.S. were infected with HIV, and 136 were killed by AIDS. Initially, the virus was called “gay-related immune deficiency” because public health officials believed gay men were the most susceptible to it. The virus was known as the “gay plague,” although people were affected regardless of their sexual orientation or gender. Because of the stigmatization and unfounded fear of only gay men spreading the virus, the FDA enacted regulations that banned them from donating blood. In a 1988 piece in The Fordham Observer, Stephen Shafer vehemently critiqued the administration’s denial of responsibility to provide a sexual education for students. In 1984, researchers figured out that the cause of AIDS was HIV. By 1985, there were over 20,000 cases globally. In 1987, AZT, the first antiretroviral medication for HIV, was developed. By the end of the ’80s, there were 100,000 cases of AIDS in the U.S. and over 400,000 cases worldwide. According to a 1987 issue of The Fordham Ram, Margaret McQuillian, the director of the University Health Center, said, “We, as a private institution in the Jesuit tradition, here more or less follow along with the Catholic Church’s finding on no pre-marital sex, and no extra-marital sex.” McQuillian further explained that every person has the right to act in whatever way they are inclined. “If you are sexually active it is very important that you be aware of the dangers that come with that and that you take the proper precautions to protect yourself,” she continued. Related Stories Why Vaccinated People Are Not Exempt From Mask Mandates Fordham Plans Ahead As Vaccine Rollout Slugs Along From the Archives: Black History Month Students on both campuses had contradictory views on the Fordham administration’s response to the crisis. In a 1988 piece in The Fordham Observer, Stephen Shafer vehemently critiqued the administration’s denial of responsibility to provide a sexual education for students. He cited the Fordham Residential Life Handbook which stated that the Catholic Church “mandates that sexual intercourse be reserved for marriage.” In the past few decades, researchers developed more treatment options and medications for the disease. Compliance with this therapy can reduce the rate of transmission from mother to child and partner to partner. In the ’90s, cases began to decline globally after widespread medical intervention. Currently, 64% of people with the virus live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2005, Cynthia Poindexter, associate professor at Fordham University’s Graduate School of Social Service, emphasized that in the U.S., the number of women infected rose significantly. This was primarily among Black and Latinx women, who, combined, constitute 80% of all women with AIDS in the U.S. even though they comprise only a quarter of the female population. It is crucial to increase research for treatment options and address these disparities. H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic: 2009-2010 Lincoln Center saw 12 cases of H1N1, whereas the majority, totaling 165, were at Rose Hill. In late spring of 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged in the United States. This virus, which scientists called (H1N1) pdm09, infected 60.8 million people, sent 274,304 individuals to the hospital and claimed 12,469 deaths in America alone. Nevertheless, by Aug. 10, 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the pandemic had finally come to an end. Since the virus had genes similar to influenza viruses known to infect pigs, scientists started referring to it as “swine flu” early on in the pandemic. Like the current coronavirus, humans came into contact with the H1N1 virus through exposure to animals, and in the case of H1N1, pigs were to blame. Though the NYC Department of Health (NYCDOH) noted cases of H1N1 as early as April 23, 2009, the case count amounted to 1,666 during the first wave, which took place from April to June of 2009. Two waves followed, one in the summer of 2009 and another from Oct. 2009 to March 2010. H1N1 made its way to Fordham in the fall of 2009. Lincoln Center saw 12 cases of H1N1, whereas the majority, totaling 165, were at Rose Hill. In Oct. 2009, Marc Girard, Fordham College at Lincoln Center ’10, possibly contracted H1N1 and had to quarantine in an empty three-bedroom suite on the 19th floor of McMahon Hall. With a 104-degree Fahrenheit fever at the beginning of the quarantine, Girard stayed in isolation until he was fever-free for 24 hours. Students at Fordham exhibited a fair amount of vaccine hesitancy toward the H1N1 vaccine. By the end of the fall semester in 2009, University Health Services had a surplus of 300 H1N1 vaccines. Keith Eldredge, the dean of students at Fordham College Lincoln Center at the time, sought first to isolate infected students from the rest of the student body. Eldredge expressed reservations about closing campus even if a large outbreak were to take place. In that event, the dean planned to relocate sick students to Pope Auditorium. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the H1N1 vaccine on Sept. 15, 2009, and Fordham received 1,000 doses to allocate to its students in November. University Health Services made these vaccines available to students on a first-come, first-serve basis with a $15 co-pay. Students at Fordham exhibited a fair amount of vaccine hesitancy toward the H1N1 vaccine. By the end of the fall semester in 2009, University Health Services had a surplus of 300 H1N1 vaccines. Young people were the target demographic for the vaccine due to their high susceptibility to getting sick, yet several Fordham students cited “common sense” practices like handwashing and staying home while sick as sufficient ways to stop the spread of H1N1. Coronavirus Pandemic: 2020-Present On Jan. 9, 2020, the WHO announced the spread of a pneumonia-like illness among residents of Wuhan, China. At that time, there were only 59 reported cases. The disease later became known as COVID-19, and the extent of its spread reached pandemic status by March 11. New York became the epicenter of the pandemic by March, and on March 9, University President Rev. Joseph M. McShane, S.J., announced that classes would cease meeting in person until March 30. Classes would meet virtually starting the following Wednesday, and McShane encouraged students living in residence halls to return home early for spring break. The plan to return to face-to-face instruction on the 30th was short-lived as McShane issued an email on Friday, March 13, stating that classes would remain online for the remainder of the semester. McShane ordered resident students to leave campus “as quickly as they can.” On March 19, the first cases of the virus were confirmed on campus. On March 20, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order that closed nonessential businesses and nonprofit institutions, which would go into effect at 8 p.m. that Sunday, March 22. This policy restricted students from returning to campus to retrieve their belongings from the dorms. By April, COVID-19 cases peaked in New York City, and the case count slowly dropped as the summer months rolled around. The administration postponed spring 2021 classes until Feb. 1 in anticipation of the winter spike in cases. The vaccine remains largely unavailable to members of the Fordham community. As New York state started to open in response to the decreasing number of cases, Fordham offered its students three modalities to learn in the coming semester: McShane announced on July 20 that students could choose to “learn fully online, in person, or a hybrid combination of the two.” Students returning to campus must complete a daily questionnaire on VitalCheck and get tested four times throughout the semester. The administration also ordered students entering residence halls to quarantine prior to returning to campus. Over the course of the fall semester, phase three clinical trials successfully produced two viable vaccines. On Nov. 9, Pfizer announced that its vaccine was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection in its clinical trials; a week later, Moderna announced that its vaccine was 95% effective. Both vaccines eventually became available via an Emergency Use Authorization through the Food and Drug Administration, but as supplies remain limited, only certain groups, including people aged 65 and older or essential workers, can get vaccinated. The administration postponed spring 2021 classes until Feb. 1 in anticipation of the winter spike in cases. The vaccine remains largely unavailable to members of the Fordham community. Though the ultimate endpoint of this pandemic is still in the future, COVID-19 isn’t the first virus Fordham and, more broadly, New York has weathered through. Adherence to public health guidance while also remaining hopeful and tenacious will ensure that we see the end of COVID-19.

(Representational image, Pixabay) Can a computer algorithm be the answer to a pan-influenza vaccine? Possibly yes, says a new paper published in Nature Communications journal. The novel computer program can create a reactive influenza vaccine for swine flu and is also indicative of how creating a pan-influence vaccine that suffices for kinds of viral infections, even coronavirus.The algorithm termed epigraph has earlier been helpful in finding out candidates with therapeutic HIV vaccine and also can show the pathway to develop a vaccine for Marburg or Ebola viruses when used on an animal model. The vaccine created following the Epigraph pathway showed the development of strong cross-reactive antibodies in mice. The same exercise developed antibody and T-cell responses in swine.An author of the research paper belonging to Los Alamos, which functions under the US Department of Energy, Bette Korber said the novel algorithm can in theory be applied to a diverse range of pathogens and using its tool vaccine makers can create a ‘cocktail of vaccines’ that can maximize efficacy across a diverse population.Also Read Tighter H1B visa rules in Republican regime could hurt business for IT firms Excitel launches affordable high-speed internet and OTT content packages in Hyderabad How effective are flu shots in protecting you from seasonal coughs and colds?

The immune response that the vaccine creates is promising against various kinds of viruses. In the long run, the computational biologist is hopeful that it will create a pan-coronavirus vaccine for future coronavirus mutations.Since pigs are susceptible to all kinds of pathogen attacks like swine flu, Avian flu and human influenza, they serve as the perfect “mixing vessel” to carry research on novel reassorted viruses, the study notes. This cocktail of viruses has the potential of affecting humans from pigs and be the reason for another pandemic as seen with HiN1 swine flue in 2009.Other institutes that collaborated with Los Alamos National Laboratory are the Nebraska Center for Virology at the University of Nebraska and the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

When her baby died on the rock, the woman put a curse on it.The second variation, more relevant to current events, takes place during the 1918 flu pandemic. While a vicious strain of influenza spread across the world and killed millions of people, a man was driving down this remote road to take his sick wife and child to the hospital. Realizing that they wouldn’t make it in time, the man made a seat out of rocks so his family could rest comfortably in their final moments. Ever since then, the Cursed Stone Couch has been, well, cursed.According to the legend, if you sit on it once, mysterious scratch marks appear on your body. Sit on it twice, and a loved one dies. Sit on it three times, and you die. Kris Birshell, from Hazleton, sat on the Cursed Stone Couch three times.“Suffice to say,” Birshell said, “I am still alive.”The legend of the “couch” has bridged the gap between one pandemic and another.On June 4, 2020, Birshell visited the Cursed Stone Couch and filmed it for her YouTube channel, DD Explores, in which she explores unique historic places throughout Northeast Pennsylvania.But the Cursed Stone Couch is more bizarre than any old cemetery or abandoned mineshaft. “Creepy looking, ain’t it?” Birshell says to the camera. “Come on, let me tell you about it.”Myth and tragedyBirshell first heard of the legend in high school, but she says that the legend, passed down through generations, is dying out. Much more urgently, so is the memory of the 1918 flu, the event that partially inspired the legend.Just ask Jake Wynn, a Williamstown native who is the director of interpretation at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine in Frederick, Maryland. When Wynn brings up the 1918 pandemic, most people have never heard of it. To the majority of Americans, he says, it is either forgotten or merely an “anecdote,” something you can tack onto a local legend.“I suspect that won’t be the case anymore,” Wynn said.How did the influenza of 1918, one of the most devastating events in the history of the region and country, get folded into a bizarre piece of local folklore? The true story of the 1918 flu pandemic in Pennsylvania’s coal region is far more complex, tragic and resonant than legends of death from a stone “couch,” especially in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.“Societies have different ways of dealing with tragedy,” Wynn said, “and myth has long been a way to try to make sense of horror and death on such a massive scale.”Wynn studies the local impact of the 1918 flu and frequently posts about it on his blog, Wynning History. His great-great-grandmother died of flu while volunteering at the emergency hospital in Williamstown, one of many created created at the time to handle the influx of flu patients.“She risked her life to save others and died in the process,” he said. “It fascinated me.”Miners sufferedThe 1918 pandemic devastated the anthracite region. More than 400 people died in Pottsville and 338 died in Hazleton, and thousands more were hospitalized. According to James Haluska Jr., assistant director of the Schuylkill County Historical Society, this was because the region was full of coal miners whose lungs had already been weakened.“When the flu turned to pneumonia,” Haluska said, “their lungs did not have much room for the fluid.”In Minersville, one fourth of the population was sick with flu and more than 500 people – almost 6% of the population – died. One estimate was that 25% of Schuylkill County’s flu deaths were in Minersville.A Schuylkill County native living in Seattle, where residents were required to wear masks, wrote a letter to the Pottsville Republican. If the flu was as bad in Seattle if it was in Minersville, he wrote, the people of Seattle “would have to be encased in a sack, head, feet and all.”The Schuylkill County native finished his letter complaining that flu may have been an unpleasant way to die, but masks were “torture.”Meanwhile, Schuylkill County doctors were reportedly working 20 hours a day. Families were wiped out. Newspapers described seemingly endless lines of ambulances, hearses and funeral processions. Undertakers could not make enough coffins to keep up with demand. In 2015, a mass grave was discovered during road construction in Schuylkill Haven. The current theory is that it was for 1918 flu victims. So many people died in such a short period of time that not everyone could get an individual burial.Novelist John O’Hara, one of Pottsville’s most famous sons, was 13 years old during the pandemic. His memories of it inspired his short story “The Doctor’s Son.”“The mines closed down almost with the first whiff of the influenza,” O’Hara wrote. “Men who for years had been drilling rock and had chronic miner’s asthma never had a chance against the mysterious new disease, and even younger men were keeling over.”Patriotism survivesBy October 1918, every school, church, saloon and store in Schuylkill County was closed. The closure of the mines created a shortage of coal that in turn created fear of a winter without heat. There was little opposition to public health measures because the nation was fighting both the pandemic and the first World War. Americans, filled with patriotic spirit, were willing to do their part in both conflicts.“Today, we have none of that,” Wynn said. “Instead, a bitterly divided nation uses any opportunity or crisis to bash their political opponents even if that means resorting to conspiracy theories and ignoring the medical realities that are staring us all in the face.”That is not to say that there were no conspiracies in 1918. Germany, America’s enemy in World War I, was blamed for the outbreak. A September 1918 headline in the Pottsville Journal claimed that the flu originated from “Hun U-Boats.” In fact, the war is why the 1918 pandemic is often, and erroneously, called “Spanish flu.” Spain was neutral in World War I, and one of the few countries that could accurately report on the flu without wartime censors getting in the way.“Governments deemed it too important to protect this information lest it give the enemy psychological or propaganda victories,” Wynn said.Candidates for the true origin of the pandemic flu strain include China, the United Kingdom and even the United States.Censorship also came close to home. An Oct. 17, 1918 article in the Pottsville Republican said that “health authorities” told the newspaper not to disclose death numbers in order to avoid “panic.”“I suspect that in Pottsville and surrounding communities,” Wynn said, “this censorship had little impact. If only because the outbreak was so bad that nearly everyone knew someone who was sick or was sick themselves, and knew many people who died. It impacted every single person in Schuylkill County at a close and visceral level.”The taste of iodineAcross the coal region, emergency tent hospitals, like the one that Wynn’s great-great-grandmother worked in, combatted the pandemic. A reporter for the Pottsville Republican wrote about conditions in one of these makeshift hospitals. He described children losing their parents and a mother screaming for her child, who died the day before. He described the taste of iodine, which was “terrible” but “did the work, so why complain?” He also observed that the flu brought people together. Many of the nurses who cared for him and other patients were not nurses at all, but local women who joined the fight against the flu. He saw a washerwoman and “an exclusive society woman,” both emergency nurses, talking to each other on the same level. Women of all social classes were cooking, cleaning and caring for the sick.“Some of the persons who have been judged as the most heartless,” the reporter wrote, “were the most tender, when it came to assuaging the grief of the bereaved ones.”It sounds a lot like the “we’re all in this together” rhetoric that we have heard through the worst of COVID-19.“Residents, medical personnel and officials did their best in communities like Pottsville and Minersville to manage the pandemic they were experiencing,” Wynn said, “and did a remarkable job in quite possibly the worst situation imaginable.”He said that COVID-19 outbreaks in cities like New York and Los Angeles are “tame” compared to what the small towns and mine patches of Schuylkill County experienced in 1918.“It really is sobering and incredible what the nurses and doctors faced at tremendous personal risk.”In a blog post about this 1918 report, Wynn wrote that “there’s only a matter of time” before the next pandemic. That blog post was written on Sept. 13, 2018.“It would be naive to believe that this was not possible again,” Wynn said. “Viruses don’t care whether or not politicians or entire countries, like China, lie about them. Viruses do what viruses do.”Philadelphia was hit harder by the pandemic than any large city in America because authorities held large gatherings in support of the war effort while downplaying signs of an outbreak. Wynn suspects that “trainloads of people” traveling from Philadelphia brought the first flu cases to Schuylkill County.Not if, but whenThe 1918 flu moved so quickly that it disappeared about as quickly as it came. Come November, Pottsville newspapers took on a more hopeful tone.“Some scholars liken it to a forest fire that ran out of fuel,” Wynn said.Waves of influenza continued to hit communities across America in 1919 and 1920, but the worst was over. All told, 17,000 people in Schuylkill County contracted influenza and several thousand died. The pandemic created 3,000 orphans. Ten percent of the county was hospitalized, and Wynn estimates that another 10 percent recovered at home because hospitals were too full to accept them.As the Roaring ’20s began, Schuylkill County, along with the rest of the country, wanted to forget what they went through. Over time, the so-called “Spanish flu” was forgotten.Over 100 years later, Wynn believes that the story can teach future generations, even though his warnings of a new pandemic have already been ignored once.“I’ll emphasize that it is going to be supremely important to study the 2020-21 pandemic in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic,” he said. “It’s not a matter of if but when and how severe.” Originally Published: February 28, 2021 at 9:00 AM ESTShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Most PopularObituariesObituariesDown but not yet out, Democratic Sen.

You study the catastrophe, but not the panic.”Advertisement 3Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Western University professor Jonathan Vance, who studies the history of panic, says almost everything we’ve seen during the COVID-19 pandemic has happened during past disease crises. (File photo)Still, this generation has never experienced the likes of the polio pandemic or the scourge of scarlet fever, and that’s why it all seems so new and scary, one expert said.“Now that we’re coming through it ourselves, (we understand) this intangible feeling of living through something, and holding within all the stress and having to navigate it daily . . . we’re living through it for the first time,” said Shelley McKellar of Western, who studies the history of medicine and disease.What’s clear is that London has a long record of weathering pandemics and other crises. And history always shows that, eventually, pandemics end. So, too, will COVID-19.MASK SLACKERSToday, they’re known as anti-maskers, but the same reluctance to strap on a fabric facial covering to guard against spreading disease also emerged more than a century ago amid the Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918. Those early doubters were dubbed “mask slackers,” though the resistance then wasn’t as widespread as it is today.Politicians then also navigated the same waters, McKellar said, debating how far to take mask rules and enforcement.Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentFines were predominantly issued to working-class men and women, the essential workers of the day, and mask use was encouraged outdoors since the science on how viruses spread wasn’t as clear as it now.“They’re just trying to protect themselves – it was a sense of doing something,” McKellar said. “I think that’s how we all navigate uncertainty.”THE HUCKSTERSWhere there’s panic, there’s opportunity for those out to make a fast buck. But instead of marking up the price of hand sanitizer or pushing miracle teas, predatory entrepreneurs in 1910 were hawking anti-comet pills. They were the silver bullet tonic for low-level hysteria. Preying on the fear of Halley’s Comet, which some junk science had led many to believe might carve a path of destruction, or even destroy human life, sugar capsules and other non-medicinal “cures” were peddled as protection against the comet that appears about once every 75 years.“People were selling comet pills and becoming very rich, and on the other hand, people were pouring their life savings into comet pills,” Vance said. “In these panics, there’s always people willing to take advantage of the fear. The desire to profit has always been part of it.”Advertisement 5Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content Hucksters traded on the fears of the gullible when Halley’s Comet streaked across the sky in 1910, hawking pills like the ones advertised here to protect against the cyanide gas in the comet’s tail.THE HELPERSMrs. Carling donated two dozen eggs, Dr. Wood offered four baskets of apples, and A.M. Smith, a grocer, handed over two dozen packs of jelly powder, 30 pounds of sugar, two tins of barley and two dozen rubber rings . . .The London-area board of health minutes from October 1918 reveal an outpouring of community support to help those in need of sustenance amid the Spanish flu pandemic. A kitchen was set up in a King Street school, where volunteers cooked meals for home nurses caring for patients sick from the virus and prepared dinners for families needing help.In the early days of COVID-19 last year, more than a century later but just a few blocks away, a bagged lunch campaign was launched to help the homeless during another pandemic. Call it back to the future.“What the food did was, it mobilized compassion and charitable instincts,” London historian Hilary Neary said of the 1918 pandemic, when London was only a fraction of its size today.“It’s an example of how many organizations, both volunteer and permanent, were mobilized to help out amongst the city in general. It’s very gratifying to see that kind of engagement,” she said.Advertisement 6Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content London historian Hilary Neary says a bagged lunch campaign to help the homeless weather COVID-19 echoes a community relief kitchen set up in the cIty amid the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. (Mike Hensen/The London Free Press)LOCK IT DOWNBattling disease outbreaks has always come down to “non-pharmaceutical interventions,” what McKellar calls the traditional tools of public health — ways to try to stop, and prevent, the spread of contagion. That goes all the way back to Medieval times, when European towns locked down to ward off the Black Death plagues of the 14th Century.“Let’s isolate the sick, lock down our borders, and if we’re going to bring anyone into our city, they have to have a health pass, because we have to protect our trade,” McKellar said, summarizing the Middle Ages approach.Lockdowns, and quarantines of the sick or those without a clean bill of health — familiar to all after a year of COVID-19 — were also features of the Spanish flu pandemic, Vance said. But the government of the day had an edge, because wartime powers — the globe had just endured the slaughter of the First World War — gave it clout it never had before, such as during an 1885 smallpox epidemic when people pushed back against public health controls.“They could do all the things they wished they could do in 1885, and that they are doing now — closing movie theatres and dance halls, keeping schools closed, closing churches,” Vance said.Advertisement 7Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“Everybody recognized then, as now, you put a bunch of people together and that gives the disease a great way to spread. You keep people apart, and you can break the chain. It’s not rocket science.”IN THE LINE OF FIREEssential workers were the first London casualties of the Spanish flu pandemic. A railway worker and taxi driver were the first recorded deaths Neary said, underlining the risk that critical workers then, as now, faced as the pandemic raged.The virus first touched down at Carling Heights Military Camp, now known as Wolseley Barracks, and whipped through the soldiers there, despite huge effort to keep them quarantined and limit movement.“It was a training facility for the military, but there would also be people employed at the barracks who would have lived in London proper. We don’t know the to-ing and fro-ing between the barracks and the regular city. There would definitely have been potential for contagion,” Neary said.Nurses that provided home care, a precursor to today’s personal support workers, also put themselves in harm’s way to care for patients sickened by the flu.Advertisement 8Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThe economic and social realities people face in the teeth of a pandemic have always loomed large as exposure risks, McKellar said. The health care workers and grocery store clerks so applauded amid COVID-19, have in various forms been in the line of fire for centuries.REMOTE SCHOOLThere was no internet, but schools were closed and kids had to learn from home. sometimes on radio broadcasts, during severe outbreaks of polio, a viral disease that plagued North America in the first half of the 1900s and wasn’t brought under control until the Salk vaccine arrived in 1955. Young children were especially vulnerable to what was known as “infantile paralysis,” so-called because the virus ravaged nerve cells that control muscles. Many were stricken.Newspapers published lessons for high schoolers during the 1937 polio outbreak, McKellar said. Teachers connected with their students by phone.“They’re using the technology that’s current to their day. We’re using Zoom and laptops, and they’re using newspapers – remember, they came out twice a day – and the telephone,” she said.Advertisement 9Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThe same political calculations dogging governments today were also made then, weighing up when and how long to close schools and gauging whether the risk to children was higher in class or at home. Remote learning, 1930s-style: Chicago school children gather around the radio during a polio outbreak to take their school classes, just as many children have been learning online at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Polio crippled thousands of Canadians until a vaccine was introduced in 1955. School closings, quarantines for the sick and restricted travel were not uncommon in the years the disease flared. (Getty Images)THE HEALTH-CARE CRUNCH“The decision-makers in 1918, the doctors, at the beginning were saying ‘this is only going to last a month. This doesn’t look like a really bad case, we don’t really have to worry about this,’ and then suddenly they became overwhelmed,” Neary said.London’s Victoria Hospital cared for only the most severely sick patients. Others were treated, largely by volunteers, at two auxiliary hospitals — one on Talbot Street and the other on Maitland Street.There was no race to a vaccine, because an effective one didn’t exist. One Toronto-based option was used in small quantities, but there wasn’t enough — and it didn’t work well enough — to vaccinate an entire population, Neary said.“It couldn’t be efficacious against what they were battling. It might have been administered to the physicians treating people, but there wasn’t nearly enough.”Instead, Londoners counted on other treatments, such as pneumonia jackets to warm the chest and help rid the body of phlegm.mstacey@postmedia.comRecommended from Editorial Column: Lessons in global cooperation from the Spanish Flu, 100 years later Next pandemic could kill a billion people: researchers Column: Some parallels today to 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic The forgotten horrors of the Spanish influenza The birth of a pandemic: How COVID-19 went from Wuhan to Toronto Advertisement 10Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentDo you have questions about life in London?

By: Priya SarinPartner, Sherrard Kuzz LLP With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines underway in Canada, many employers are now asking whether they can or should implement a mandatory vaccination policy to ensure worker safety. The ability to make vaccination a mandatory condition of employment depends on a number factors, including the nature of an employer’s business, whether employees are unionized, and if there are any human rights issues at play. An organization whose employees work in a higher risk environment or with vulnerable populations (e.g., a hospital, school, or retirement home), is more likely to be able to require vaccination for health and safety reasons, than an organization whose employees can easily work from home, or continue to work safely using personal protective equipment (PPE). Although an employer may be able to require vaccination as a condition of employment, proactive measures to encourage voluntary COVID-19 vaccination may be preferable, as they will minimize potential legal risks (described below). Further, a mandatory vaccination policy may ultimately be unnecessary if employees choose to receive the vaccine at the earliest available opportunity due to their fear of contracting COVID-19 and becoming seriously ill. Mandatory Vaccination in a Non-Unionized WorkplaceSubject to human rights and privacy considerations, an employer may implement a mandatory vaccination policy for new non-unionized employees. This vaccination requirement should be expressly included in an offer of employment. An employer may also implement a mandatory vaccination policy for existing employees (subject to human rights considerations); however, this could result in potential liability. If an employee refuses to be vaccinated on the basis of personal choice and the nature of the employee’s work is not “high risk”, the employer may have no option but to terminate that individual’s employment without cause. Similarly, if the employee is not permitted to work without being vaccinated, this could result in a constructive dismissal claim. In either scenario, the employer could be liable for statutory, contractual or common law termination entitlements. Mandatory Vaccination in a Unionized WorkplaceIn a unionized workplace, a mandatory vaccination policy could be grieved on the basis that it violates the collective agreement. If challenged, the employer would be required to establish that the policy is reasonable for health and safety reasons, among other factors. To date, no arbitral decision has considered the reasonableness of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. Arbitrators have previously found mandatory flu vaccination policies to be reasonable; however, those decisions may be of limited assistance because the flu vaccine decisions principally arose in the healthcare sector and in respect of workers who provide direct care to vulnerable patients. Further, none of the flu vaccine policies which were upheld made vaccination a mandatory condition of employment. Instead, if an employee refused vaccination, the flu vaccine policy provided for non-disciplinary measures such as taking an unpaid leave of absence for the duration of the influenza outbreak or continued use of PPE (i.e. masks). As such, if a vaccination policy is implemented in a unionized workplace outside of healthcare, an employer should consider consulting with the union first and offering non-disciplinary alternatives for those who choose not to be vaccinated. Human Rights ConsiderationsIf an employee is unable to receive the COVID-19 vaccine due to a medical or religious reason, or any other human rights protected ground, an employer has a duty to accommodate the employee to the point of undue hardship. Some examples of accommodation include: an exemption from the requirement to be vaccinated; moving the individual to a location that does not require direct contact with coworkers, customers, residents or the public; and continued use of PPE to mitigate the risk of transmission. If an employer asserts they are unable to accommodate an employee to the point of undue hardship, the employer should be prepared to demonstrate that vaccination is a bona fide occupational requirement of the position. Bottom line: if an employer determines a vaccination policy is necessary, even if the policy does not make vaccination mandatory, the employer should work with experienced legal counsel to ensure the policy complies will all applicable privacy, human rights and health and safety-related requirements.
