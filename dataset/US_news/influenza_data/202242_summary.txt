Influenza and COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage Among Health Care Personnel—the CDC recommends annual influenza vaccination for all healthcare personnel (HCP) to reduce morbidity and mortality. In the 2021-22 season, HCP influenza vaccination coverage was 79.9%. Additionally, 87.3% of HCP completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, and 67.1% received a COVID-19 booster dose. Influenza, primary COVID-19, and booster coverage were higher among HCP with employer vaccination requirements for these vaccines. Coverage was lowest among HCP working in long-term care settings. It is important to enhance efforts to improve HCP vaccination coverage for both influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to protect HCP and their patients.
