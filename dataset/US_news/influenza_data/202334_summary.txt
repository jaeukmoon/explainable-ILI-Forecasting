Vaccine Recommendations: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States recommends routine annual influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older, without contraindications. For the 2023-24 influenza season, all available vaccines are quadrivalent and include hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. Available vaccines include inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4).

Timing of Vaccination: For most individuals who only require one dose of influenza vaccine during the season, vaccination should ideally be offered in September or October. However, vaccination should continue throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating and there is available unexpired vaccine. Vaccination may be available as early as July or August, but for adults aged 65 years and older, and pregnant individuals in the first or second trimester, vaccination during those months should be avoided unless there are concerns about availability later in the season. Children aged 6 months to 8 years who require two doses should receive the first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine is available.

No Preferential Vaccine Recommendation: ACIP does not make a preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when multiple licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccines are available, except for adults aged 65 years and older. For this age group, ACIP recommends the preferential use of quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4), quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4). If none of these vaccines are available, any age-appropriate influenza vaccine can be used.

Primary Changes and Updates: The primary changes and updates to the recommendations include information on the available vaccines for the 2023-24 influenza season, timing of vaccination, and preferential recommendations for adults aged 65 years and older.

These recommendations aim to facilitate vaccination coverage and reduce the burden of influenza, particularly among high-risk populations and healthcare workers.
