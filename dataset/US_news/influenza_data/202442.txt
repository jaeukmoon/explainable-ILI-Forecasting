What to Know In this week's spotlight, CDC provides an update on the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in California and how CDC is supporting outreach to farmworkers and to the California Department of Public Health(CDPH). Situation Update October 18, 2024 – CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by a multistate outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or "H5N1 bird flu," in dairy cows, poultry and other animals in the United States. CDC is working in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), state public health and animal health officials, and other partners using a One Health approach. Since April 2024, CDC, working with state public health departments, has confirmed avian influenza A(H5) infections in 27 people in the United States. Nine of these cases were associated with exposure to H5N1 bird flu-infected poultry and 17 were associated with exposure to sick or infected dairy cows 12. This includes 13 cases in California, seven of which were confirmed by CDC during the week of October 13, two of them on Friday, October 18. All California cases have occurred in dairy workers on affected farms. All available data so far suggests sporadic instances of animal-to-human spread. The farm workers who were diagnosed with avian flu infections in California all described mild symptoms, many with eye redness or discharge (conjunctivitis). None of the workers were hospitalized. CDPH is monitoring hundreds of workers in affected counties, and any who develop symptoms are being tested; if the test is positive in the state lab, the sample is sent to CDC for confirmatory testing. CDC is reporting confirmed cases, by state and source of exposure, in a table on its website, which is being updated three times weekly. The source of the exposure in one case, which was reported by Missouri on September 6, could not be determined. Serological testing of the contacts of the Missouri case are pending. To date, human-to-human transmission of avian influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. CDC believes the immediate risk to the general public from H5N1 bird flu remains low, but people with exposure to infected animals are at higher risk of infection. On the animal health side, since March 2024, USDA has confirmed infected cattle in 320 dairy herds in 14 U.S. states. The number of affected herds continues to grow nationally, with almost all new infections identified in herds in California. USDA reports that, since April 2024, there have been H5 detections in 38 commercial poultry flocks and 26 backyard flocks, for a total of 21.43 million birds affected. Among other activities reported in previous spotlights and ongoing, recent highlights of CDC's response to this include: Laboratory Update To date, CDC has confirmed 13 farm workers have been infected with H5N1 bird flu in California. Genetic sequencing of six of these cases confirms that all are H5N1 viruses from clade 2.3.4.4b and that all are closely related genetically to the virus causing infections in domestic dairy cattle. CDC has been able to sequence the full genomes of viruses detected in two cases from California (A/California/135/2024 and A/California/147/2024) and to confirm that both are B3.13 genotype viruses. Specimens from four other California cases were partially sequenced. That sequencing information showed no changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) associated with increased infectivity or transmissibility among people. Additionally, there are no mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to available treatments (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors or polymerase inhibitors) and no mutations identified in other genes indicating additional mammalian adaptation. Genetic sequencing for those six cases has been posted in GISAID and GenBank. Additional sequencing data will be posted as it becomes available. CDC has successfully isolated virus from specimens from nine of the thirteen cases. Attempts to isolate virus from additional specimens are ongoing. Antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility testing are underway. Antigenic characterization will inform whether existing H5 bird flu candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) provide good inhibition of these viruses. Epidemiology Update At the invitation of the California Department of Public Health, CDC is deploying a multilingual epidemiological field team to assist efforts to learn more about how this outbreak began in California and how to lower risk to farm workers with exposure to infected cows. Two staff are on the ground, and additional staff are ready to deploy if needed. CDC staff are assisting with active surveillance efforts, including field assessments of suspected cases and household contacts; testing and treatment; and dissemination of information to farm workers and the community. Surveillance Update CDC continues to support states that are monitoring people with exposure to cows, birds, or other domestic or wild animals infected, or potentially infected, with H5N1 bird flu. To date, more than 5,100 people have been monitored as a result of their exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, and at least 260 people who have developed flu-like symptoms have been tested as part of this targeted, situation-specific testing.. More information on monitoring can be found at Symptom Monitoring Among Persons Exposed to HPAI. In addition, since February 25, 2024, more than 54,000 specimens have been tested for avian A(H5) or other novel influenza viruses at public health labs. One of the specimens, collected as a part of routine surveillance, was identified as presumptive A(H5) positive and was confirmed as H5N1 positive by CDC. CDC also continues to monitor flu surveillance data using CDC's 2024-2025 influenza surveillance strategy, especially in areas where avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have been detected in dairy cows or other animals, for any unusual trends, including in flu-like illness, conjunctivitis, or influenza virus activity. Overall, for the most recent week of data, CDC flu surveillance systems show no indicators of unusual flu activity in people. Outreach Update CDC has posted a Spanish-language collection of videos aimed at informing the U.S. public in general, and U.S. farm workers in particular, about H5N1 bird flu – what it is, how to prevent it, and what to do if they develop symptoms. English-language versions of the videos were first posted in September. The videos, each under a minute long and available on YouTube, answer commonly asked questions, such as "Who is at risk for getting H5N1 bird flu?", "How can I protect myself from getting H5N1 bird flu?", and "What do I do if I get H5N1 bird flu?" CDC continues to support outreach to farm workers around the topic of H5N1 bird flu. This includes targeted outreach to farm workers in affected counties through Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and digital display and audio (Pandora). CDC also is running advertisements on local radio stations about 30 times each week to reach people who may not be on social media platforms. These resources provide information in English and Spanish about potential risks of H5N1 bird flu infection, recommended preventive actions, symptoms to be on the lookout for, and what to do if people develop symptoms. Outreach metrics are summarized in Table 1 (below). CDC also is developing an outreach strategy to raise awareness about the free seasonal flu vaccinations being offered to farm workers in affected states this season. CDC Recommendations As a reminder, CDC recommends that: People should avoid exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows), if possible. People should also avoid exposures to animal poop, bedding (litter), unpasteurized ("raw") milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, if possible. People should not drink raw milk. Pasteurization kills avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, and pasteurized milk is safe to drink. People who have job-related contact with infected or potentially infected birds or other animals should be aware of the risk of exposure to avian influenza viruses and should take proper precautions. People should wear appropriate and recommended personal protective equipment when exposed to an infected or potentially infected animal(s). CDC has recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in people. Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person's risk and containing the overall public health risk. In addition to limiting interactions between infected animals and people, containing the outbreak among animals also is important, which underscores the urgency of the work being done by USDA and animal health and industry partners. This is an evolving situation, and CDC is committed to providing frequent and timely updates. Table 1.

It was also likely the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from a cow globally. A second human case associated with the dairy cow outbreak was identified in Michigan on May 22, 2024, followed by a third case in Michigan on May 30, 2024. The fourth human case was identified in Colorado on July 3, 2024. None of these cases are associated with the others. Cumulatively, there have been 14 human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. On July 14, 2024, CDC confirmed four human cases of H5 bird flu in Colorado, and additional (fifth and sixth) cases in Colorado were confirmed at CDC and were reported on July 19, 2024. Three additional cases in Colorado from a different farm were confirmed by CDC on July 25, 2024. Nine of these 14 cumulative human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States have been confirmed as avian influenza A(H5N1). The first human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported on April 28, 2022, in a person in Colorado who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in depopulating poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu. The 2022 human case was not related to dairy cows. The person only reported fatigue without any other symptoms and recovered. Bird Flu Avian influenza or bird flu refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses.

Getting vaccinated in the fall can lower your chances of getting the flu (influenza). Flu is a serious disease, caused by influenza viruses, that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Every flu season is different, and the substantial health impacts can vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. Your best defense against influenza disease is to get a flu vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration every year. To find a flu vaccine near you, visit this page. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that during the 2023-24 U.S. flu season, there were: 35 million to 65 million flu illnesses. 16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits. 390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations. 25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deaths. The CDC estimates that during the 2022-23 season, flu vaccination prevented: 6 million influenza-related illnesses. 2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits. 65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations. 3,700 influenza-associated deaths. Compared with past seasons, the severity of the 2022–23 flu season was considered moderate, with high severity observed among children. A Flu Vaccine Is the Best Prevention The CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. Even if you wait until after October, the vaccine will still be beneficial and provide protection. For more information on recommendations, visit this CDC page. If you have already been sick with the flu this season without getting vaccinated, getting a flu vaccine is still important because it helps prevent disease caused by three different strains of flu viruses. You likely were infected with one type of flu virus strain, so the vaccine would offer protection against the strains that you haven’t already had. Flu viruses are spread by droplets when people infected with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. Flu may also be spread when a person touches a surface or object that has flu viruses on it and then touches their own mouth, nose or eyes. You also can reduce the spread of the flu and its effects by taking practical measures such as washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when you’re sick. Why We Need a New Flu Vaccine Every Year The FDA plays a key role in ensuring that safe and effective flu vaccines are available every flu season. Flu vaccines are approved by the FDA for the prevention of influenza disease caused by three different influenza virus strains. The vaccine typically changes each year and contains the three flu virus strains that are expected to circulate and cause illness in the U.S. during the upcoming flu season. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient, the types of circulating influenza viruses, and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine. The flu vaccine will trigger your immune system to produce antibodies to protect against influenza disease — it will not make you sick with the flu. It can take about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body, which is an important reason to get your flu vaccine early, before flu activity starts. The task of producing a new vaccine for the next flu season starts well before the current season ends. For the FDA, it’s a year-round initiative. There are several reasons a new flu vaccine must be made each year. Flu viruses can change from year to year, so the vaccine is updated to protect against the influenza virus strains that are expected to circulate in the U.S. In addition, the protection provided by the flu vaccine a person received in the previous year will diminish over time and may be too low to prevent influenza disease into next year’s flu season. Who’s Most at Risk of Getting Sick with Flu Anyone can get sick with flu. Typically, children and people age 65 and older are most at risk of developing serious complications from influenza. In addition, pregnant people and those with certain chronic medical conditions are also most at risk of complications. The best way to protect babies who are too young to be vaccinated is to make sure the people around them are vaccinated. Occasionally, a flu virus will circulate that disproportionately affects young and middle-age adults. If you do get the flu, there are FDA-approved antiviral drugs, available by prescription, to treat it. There are several FDA-approved antiviral drugs recommended by the CDC for use against circulating influenza viruses. These drugs work best if started soon after the onset of symptoms (within 48 hours). How Vaccine Flu Virus Strains Are Selected Every year, in late February or early March, before that year’s flu season ends, the FDA, the World Health Organization, the CDC and other public health experts collaborate on collecting and reviewing data from around the world to identify the flu viruses likely to cause the most illnesses during the next flu season. Following that process, the FDA convenes its vaccines advisory committee, consisting of outside experts, to discuss the WHO recommendations and to consider which flu viruses are expected to circulate in the U.S. The committee reviews data about which flu viruses have caused illnesses in the past year, how the viruses are changing, and disease trends for the U.S. The FDA takes that information into account before it selects the virus strains for those manufacturers that have an FDA-approved influenza vaccine to include in their updated vaccine for use in the upcoming U.S. influenza season. The closer the match between the vaccine virus strains and the circulating virus strains causing disease during flu season, the better the protection that the flu vaccine provides. Although the vaccine and circulating viruses may not be an exact match in some years, that does not mean the vaccine is not benefiting people. Available data show that the vaccine can reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. FDA-Approved Flu Vaccines Are Safe A rigorous evaluation of laboratory and clinical trial data was conducted by FDA scientists and physicians to determine the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccines for initial approval. If a vaccine meets the FDA’s scientific and regulatory standards, it receives an FDA approval. To ensure that updated seasonal flu vaccines are safe, effective and of high quality, the FDA prepares and provides reagents (materials to standardize vaccines) to those manufacturers that have an existing FDA-approved influenza vaccine to ensure that they can make their updated influenza vaccine and to verify its identity and potency. The FDA also inspects manufacturing facilities regularly and evaluates each manufacturer’s vaccine annually before it can be approved for use for the upcoming flu season. The FDA’s oversight doesn’t end there. After manufacturers have distributed their vaccines, the FDA and CDC work together to routinely evaluate reports of adverse events following vaccination submitted by vaccine manufacturers, health care professionals and vaccine recipients (or their parents/guardians) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Additional systems are in place to monitor the safety of vaccines. The FDA partners with private organizations that collect health care data (such as health insurance companies) and other federal agencies (such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Veterans Health Administration and CDC) to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the influenza vaccines. The Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) System is one of the programs the FDA utilizes to assess vaccine safety and effectiveness in real-world conditions, reflecting patient care and the real-world use of the influenza vaccine and other vaccines in use in the U.S. In addition, the CDC maintains the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) program, which evaluates the safety of vaccines similar to the BEST System. VSD receives its data from integrated health care organizations in the U.S. Content current as of: 10/15/2024 Regulated Product(s) Biologics Drugs Flu Vaccine Health Topic(s) Children's Health Vaccinations Infectious Disease Flu Consumer Updates Animal & Veterinary Children's Health Cosmetics Dietary Supplements Drugs Food Medical Devices Nutrition Radiation-Emitting Products Tobacco Products Vaccines, Blood & Biologics Artículos para el consumidor en español Consumer Updates Email Subscribe to receive Consumer Updates email notifications.

As a result, U.S. flu vaccines have been redesigned. Shots Health News From NPR Your Health Treatments & Tests Health Inc. Policy-ish Public Health Twitter Shots - Health News The flu shot is different this year, thanks to COVID October 17, 20249:30 AM ET By Sarah Boden People getting the flu shot this year will be vaccinated against three commonly circulating strains instead of four, after one went extinct during the pandemic. Mark J. Terrill/AP hide caption toggle caption Mark J. Terrill/AP This year’s flu shot will be missing a strain of influenza it’s protected against for more than a decade. That’s because there have been no confirmed flu cases caused by the Influenza B/Yamagata lineage since spring 2020. And the Food and Drug Administration decided this year that the strain now poses little to no threat to human health. Scientists have concluded that widespread physical distancing and masking practiced during the early days of COVID-19 appear to have pushed B/Yamagata into oblivion. This surprised many who study influenza, as it would be the first documented instance of a virus going extinct due to changes in human behavior, said Dr. Rebecca Wurtz, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. Sponsor Message “It is such an interesting and unique story,” Wurtz said, adding that if it were not for COVID, B/Yamagata would still be circulating. Health No needles required: The FDA approves an at-home flu vaccine One reason COVID mitigation efforts were so effective at eliminating B/Yamagata is there was already a fair amount of immunity in the population against this strain of flu, which was also circulating at a lower level, said Dr. Kawsar Talaat, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was a brand new virus that no one had encountered before; therefore, masking and isolation only slowed its transmission, but did not stop it. The absence of B/Yamagata won’t change the experience of getting this year’s flu shot, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends to everyone over 6 months old. And unvaccinated people are no less likely to get the flu, as B/Victoria and two influenza A lineages are still circulating widely and making people sick. Talaat said the disappearance of B/Yamagata doesn’t appear to have lessened the overall burden of flu, noting that the level of illness that can be attributed to any strain varies from year to year. The CDC estimates that between 12,000 and 51,000 people die every year from influenza. Sponsor Message However, the manufacturing process is simplified now that the vaccine is trivalent — designed to protect against three flu viruses — instead of quadrivalent, protecting against four. That change allows more doses to be produced, said Talaat. Ultimately, the costs of continuing to include protection against B/Yamagata in the flu shot outweigh its benefits, said Talaat. "If you include a strain for which you don't think anybody's going to get infected into a vaccine, there are some potential risks and no potential benefits," she said. "Even though the risks might be infinitesimal, the benefits are also infinitesimal." Scientists and public health experts have discussed for the past couple years whether to pull B/Yamagata from the flu vaccine or wait for a possible reemergence, said Kevin R. McCarthy, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Vaccine Research. But McCarthy agrees that continuing to vaccinate people against B/Yamagata does not benefit public health. Additionally, there is a slight chance of B/Yamagata accidentally infecting the workers who manufacture the flu vaccine. The viruses, grown in eggs, are inactivated before being put into the shots: You cannot get influenza from the flu shot. But worker exposure to live B/Yamagata might occur before it's rendered harmless. That hypothetically could lead to a reintroduction of a virus that populations have waning immunity to because B/Yamagata is no longer making people sick. While that risk is very low, McCarthy said it doesn’t make sense to produce thousands of gallons of a likely extinct virus. It is possible that B/Yamagata continues to exist in pockets of the world that have less comprehensive flu surveillance. However, scientists aren’t worried that it is hiding in animals because humans are the only host population for B lineage flu viruses. Scientists determined that B/Yamagata disappeared in a relatively short period of time, and this in and of itself is a success, said McCarthy. That required collaboration and data sharing from people all over the world, including countries that the U.S. has more tenuous diplomatic relationships with, like China and Russia. Sponsor Message “I think the fact that we can do that shows that we can get some things right,” he said.

Although mammalian spillover events are rare, H5N1 viruses have an estimated mortality rate in humans of 60%. No human cases of H5 infection have been reported in Malaysian Borneo, but HPAI has circulated in poultry and migratory avian species transiting through the region. Recent deforestation in coastal habitats in Malaysian Borneo may increase the proximity between humans and migratory birds. We hypothesise that higher rates of human-animal contact, caused by this habitat destruction, will increase the likelihood of potential zoonotic spillover events. In 2015, an environmentally stratified cross-sectional survey was conducted collecting geolocated questionnaire data in 10,100 individuals. A serological survey of these individuals reveals evidence of H5 neutralisation that persisted following depletion of seasonal H1/H3 HA binding antibodies from the plasma. The presence of these antibodies suggests that some individuals living near migratory sites may have been exposed to H5 HA. There is a spatial and environmental overlap between individuals displaying high H5 HA binding and the distribution of migratory birds. We have developed a novel surveillance approach including both spatial and serological data to detect potential spillover events, highlighting the urgent need to study cross-species pathogen transmission in migratory zones.

Of particular concern is the influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b, which has been responsible for a striking increase in deaths in wild birds and domesticated poultry since 20201. The World Organisation for Animal Health estimated that in 2022 at least 131 million domestic poultry succumbed to the virus or were culled due to exposure to the virus2.Migratory shorebirds and waterfowl are known hosts for avian influenza viruses (AIVs), including H5N13,4. The global movements of these species can facilitate the dispersion and increased genetic diversity of the virus. Climate change and extreme weather events may be one cause of the recent increased pervasiveness of H5N14,5. Habitat destruction resulting from these environmental changes, including coastline destruction, influences the distribution of migratory species, which in turn impacts the dynamics of viral spread4,5,6. As habitats and food sources become increasingly scarce, there is potential for higher contact rates amongst different migratory avian species and between wild and domesticated birds. This increased contact creates more opportunities for viral reassortment and for the virus to jump between hosts.In 2022 and 2023, several notable spillover events into mammals were caused by 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses7, including seals8, mink9, and sea lions10. There is no evidence of sustained community transmission amongst humans, with the number of human cases remaining limited2,11. Mammal-to-mammal spread has been observed in the ongoing H5N1 dairy cow outbreak in the United States and in mink in Spain in 202212,13. As human cases of H5N1 can be clinically severe with a high mortality rate, there are concerns that the virus will reassort or mutate to enable community transmission1. To prevent further viral spillover, it is crucial to understand current rates of H5N1 exposure. If there are subclinical or non-severe cases of H5N1, the symptoms of such cases may be indistinguishable from that of other influenza subtypes, so exposure to the virus would remain undetected unless an infected individual receives medical care. Therefore, the global prevalence of H5N1 exposure in humans is presently unknown and is likely to be underestimated14. Consequently, there is an urgent need to study serological exposure to these H5N1 viruses in humans.We investigated H5N1 in humans in Malaysian Borneo, due to a unique confluence of environmental and ornithological factors in the region. Borneo is an important migratory stop for wild shorebirds transiting along the East-Asian Australasian flyway, which spans from Russia to Australia. Malaysia contains 13 important stopover sites for 20 species of migratory shorebirds, with four such sites in Malaysian Borneo15. Although Malaysian Borneo has an extensive coastline, it is also a region that has experienced much environmental change in the last 50 years16,17. Between 1973 and 2015, the island of Borneo lost an estimated 50% of its forests16. Habitats that would usually be home to these migratory shorebirds, including freshwater swamp forests18, mangrove forests19, and peat swamp forests20, have been cleared and logged to make room for industrial agricultural efforts15.Several of the migratory species known to transit through Malaysian Borneo are carriers of various influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes, including H5N1 viruses21,22,23. However, the only recorded outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Malaysian Borneo to date was a clade 2.3.2.1c virus outbreak in a commercial poultry farm in 2018 in the Sabah state24. An estimated 30,000 birds were either culled or succumbed to the virus during a month-long period25. Although this poultry outbreak was severe, there have been no human cases of H5N1 reported in Malaysian Borneo.Here, we perform a serological survey of human influenza exposure in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, to examine the immunological footprint of H5N1 in the region. We additionally present a method for minimising the impact of IAV hemagglutinin (HA) subtype cross-reactivity on serological results. We define species distributions of domesticated poultry and migratory wild shorebirds and demonstrate that environmental covariates can be used as a proxy to model wild shorebird contact. We additionally identify shared spatial distributions and environmental risk factors between the presence of migratory shorebirds and clade-specific H5N1 seroprevalence using a Bayesian framework. This study highlights the need to increase surveillance for rare zoonotic diseases at migratory sites and presents an approach for modelling the distributions of serological results and reservoir species.ResultsIdentification of heterogeneous patterns of influenza binding and pseudo-neutralisationIn 2015, 10,100 individuals from 2650 households in Northern Sabah were sampled26. The surveyed population age ranged from 3 months to 105 years and was 47% male (n = 4776) and 53% female (n = 5324)27. The locations of the sampled villages and shorebird sightings throughout Sabah are displayed in Fig. 1. 14% (n = 359) of these households were situated within 10 km of previously recorded wild shorebird sightings. 51% of the population are poultry owners (n = 5137), mostly evenly distributed throughout the entire sample region27.Fig. 1: Distribution of sampled villages (blue) and migratory shorebird sightings (red) in Sabah.Sampled villages are in the Northern Sabah region, while migratory shorebird sightings are distributed throughout Sabah. This figure was generated in QGIS 3.30.262. Natural Earth raster map data was used to generate the canvas map. Source data for migratory shorebird sightings are provided as a Source Data file.Full size image2000 of these individuals were randomly selected for serological testing of IAV exposure by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which measure antibody (IgG) binding to HA. HA is a glycoprotein and the dominant immunogenicity in IAV. 500 individuals were selected from each of the four geographic regions sampled in the study: Kudat, Pitas, Ranau, and Kota Marudu (Supplemental Fig. 1). The mean age of the selected samples was 29. By region, the mean age in the selected samples from Kudat is 29, in Pitas the mean age was 27, in Ranau mean age was 27, and in Kota Marudu the mean age was 31. The study population was exposed to two known potential sources of avian influenza spillover: domesticated poultry and wild shorebirds. 23% (n = 454) of the randomly selected individuals lived within 10 km of a migratory shorebird sighting, and 51% (n = 1024) were poultry owners. 47% (n = 217) of individuals living within 10 km of migratory shorebird sightings were also poultry owners. The categories of poultry owners and those living near these migratory sites were used to examine differences in the binding and later, neutralisation of H5 viruses.We used four HAs as our viral antigens for ELISAs. Antibody binding was reported in absorbance units (AU), where higher AU indicates increased antibody binding to the HA.Two HAs were used in our ELISAs to capture binding to the subtypes of seasonal viruses that would have been circulating prior to sample collection in 2015: H1N1 (A/California/07/pdm2009) and H3N2 (A/New York/55/2004). Two H5 antigens were used to examine binding to avian viruses. A/Duck/Laos/3295/2005(H5N1) belongs to the H5 clade 2.3.4. This clade was circulating in Asia from 2003 to 2013 in avian species before breaking off into sub-lineages28. A/snow goose/Missouri/CC15-84A/2015(H5N2) belongs to clade 2.3.4.4, which did not become the predominant avian flu clade in Asia until 201829. There are 38 amino acid differences between these two viral HAs (~93% identity) (Supplementary Table 1).Seasonal influenza binding was evenly distributed throughout the population, irrespective of exposure to potential IAV reservoirs (Fig. 2a). Median H3N2 binding was 1.437(±0.035, standard deviation) AU, and there were no differences when the population was categorised by poultry ownership or proximity to wild shorebirds. There were a wide variety of H3N2 responses, with 23 above 3 AU, 517 above 2 AU, and 1414 above 1 AU. H1N1 binding was not as strong in the study population (median of 0.3287(±0.0109) AU). Poultry owners within the population had a slightly higher mean rank binding to the H1N1 HA than non-owners, 0.31 versus 0.29 AU (p = 0.0174) by a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Two responses were above 2AU and 22 were above 1AU.Fig. 2: Individuals living in proximity to migratory shorebirds have increased H5 HA binding and neutralisation.As the data is non-parametric, the medians of each group were compared using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney test in GraphPad Prism 10.0.3. a Represents ELISA-binding data of n = 2000 samples, where the population is 51% (n = 1024) poultry owners and 23% (n = 454) were living in proximity to wild shorebirds (<10 km). Statistically significant p-values are 0.0174 (H1N1 binding, poultry ownership), 0.0156 (H5N2 binding, proximity), and 0.0012 (H5N1 binding, proximity). The nonsignificant p-values were 0.4707 (H3N2 binding, poultry ownership), 0.0612 (H3N2 binding, proximity), 0.7503 (H1N1 binding, proximity), 0.7633 (H5N2 binding, poultry ownership), and 0.1997 (H5N1 binding, poultry ownership). All samples were tested in duplicate at a 1:50 dilution. b Displays NT50 values for H5N1 pseudovirus microneutralisation assays (n = 204 for A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/Bar headed goose Qinghai/1A/2005; n = 174 for A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018). NT50 is here defined as the dilution factor of the serum necessary to reach 50% inhibition of the pseudovirus. The samples tested against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/Bar headed goose Qinghai/1A/2005 pseudoviruses were 52% (n = 108) poultry owners, and 34% (n = 69) lived within 10 km of a shorebird sighting. The samples tested against A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018 pseudovirus (n = 178) were 50% poultry owners (n = 89), and 33% (n = 58) lived within 10 km of a migratory shorebird. The p-value for proximity comparisons for H5N1 Qinghai NT50s was <0.0001 (0.000007), and the p-value for poultry ownership for H5N1 Sabah NT50s was p = 0.0035. The nonsignificant p-values were 0.0950 (H5N1 Indonesia, poultry ownership), 0.1461 (H5N1 Indonesia, proximity), 0.4328 (H5N1 Qinghai, poultry ownership), and 0.0687 (H5N1 Sabah, proximity). The figure was generated in GraphPad Prism 10.0.3. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThere were no significant differences (p < 0.05) in H5 binding to either HA when the population was sorted by poultry ownership. However, those living within 10 km of wild shorebirds had a statistically significantly higher mean rank than those living further away for both H5 antigens by a Mann–Whitney test. Population medians were 0.25 and 0.21 AU (p = 0.0012) for the 2.3.4 pre-2015 virus and 0.12 and 0.11 AU (p = 0.0156) for the post-2015 2.3.4.4 virus. Responses to A/snow goose/Missouri/CC15-84A/2015(H5N2) were modest, with one response above 2 AU and only 10 above 1 AU. A/Duck/Laos/3295/2005(H5N1) was a more reactive antigen with one response above 3 AU, 20 above 2 AU, and 161 responses above 1 AU. High binding to one antigen did not correlate with similar binding to a different antigen. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (r) of binding to H5 antigens was r = 0.22, and the other correlations ranged from r = −0.03 to 0.13 (Supplemental Fig. 2a). The Scottish blood donor cohort showed higher correlations between the H5 and the seasonal H1 antigens (r = 0.19, r = 0.25) and almost no correlation between the H5 antigens (r = 0.02) (Supplemental Fig. 2b). These Spearman r values indicate that the binding to one ELISA antigen was not linearly related to binding of a different antigen. These results also suggest that there are population-level differences in HA binding between the Scottish and Malaysian cohorts.204 samples were selected for follow-up pseudotyped microneutralisation assays (PNA) against two viruses from prior to 2015: A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1) and A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1 A/2005(H5N1). The generated pseudotyped lentiviruses displayed HA on their surface but were replication-deficient30. This allowed for the study of the ability of the cohort plasma to inhibit viral growth by binding to HA without the risk of working with a fully replicating virus.The 20 samples that exhibited binding above 2 AU to A/Duck/Laos/3295/2005(H5N1) were chosen for inclusion in subsequent neutralisation experiments, and the remaining samples were randomly selected based on the quantity of available pseudovirus. 52% (n = 108) of the population tested for neutralisation were poultry owners, and 34% (n = 69) lived within 10 km of a shorebird sighting. The neutralising abilities of a sample were evaluated based on the NT50 value, which is the 50% inhibitory concentration (i.e. the concentration of serum or plasma necessary to achieve 50% virus inhibition). Previous studies have used 1:100 as a cut-off for seropositivity30, but instead the highest NT50 from a cohort of negative control samples was used here to reduce the likelihood of including cross-reactive neutralising (false positive) samples in subsequent experiments (1:1173 for A/Indonesia/05/2005 and 1:1015 for A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005), as in Thompson et al.31 (Supplemental Fig. 3).Three samples were considered seropositive in their neutralising ability (1.5% seropositivity rate) against A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1) pseudovirus, of which two (67%) were poultry owners and all three (100%) lived within 10 km of wild shorebird migratory sites (Fig. 2b). The samples were 6.8% seropositive (n = 14) against A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005(H5N1) pseudovirus. Six of these seropositive individuals owned poultry, and all 14 lived in proximity to wild shorebirds. When comparing differences in NT50, there were no significant differences based on poultry ownership to either virus. Individuals with proximity to wild shorebirds did have a statistically significant increase in mean rank NT50 over those living further away, 210.4 versus 59.24 (p < 0.0001) by a Mann–Whitney test.We then sought to determine whether the individuals in the rural Malaysian cohort had serological responses to the virus responsible for the 2018 outbreak (Fig. 2b). Another H5N1 pseudovirus presenting A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018 HA (Clade 2.3.2.1c) was generated for these experiments. Of the 204 samples originally tested for neutralisation only 178 had sufficient volume to be repeated with two replicates in this assay. 50% of the 178 samples were poultry owners (n = 89) and 33% (n = 58) lived within 10 km of a migratory shorebird. 12 samples neutralised the pseudovirus above the seropositivity cut-off (NT50 > 1:1358) (Supplemental Fig. 3c). This is a seropositivity rate of 6.7%, which is akin to the observed rate for A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1 A/2005(H5N1) pseudovirus of 6.8%. 50% (n = 6) of the seropositive samples against A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018(H5N1) pseudovirus were individuals living within 10 km of a wild shorebird migratory site. 75% (n = 9) of the seropositive samples were from poultry owners.Persistence of pseudo-neutralisation upon depletion of cross-reactive antibodiesWe developed a bead-based antibody depletion assay to determine the role of cross-reactivity in these neutralising responses. We conjugated magnetic non-fluorescent beads to several HA for seasonal influenza strains (Supplemental Fig. 4). The beads were then incubated with the plasma. Using a magnet to pull down seasonal influenza antibody-bound beads, unbound antibodies can be extracted. This plasma extract is depleted of cross-reactive seasonal influenza responses and was tested in neutralisation assays for a maintained H5 response. Neutralisation assays were repeated with the treated plasma against A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005(H5N1).Pooled positive control serum was obtained from a vaccination trial (vaccinated with A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1)) from BEI Resources (NIH, NIAID). The two negative control samples were low and high titre human H1N1 convalescent sera and were assumed not to have been exposed (i.e. the observed neutralisation is likely due to cross-reactive antibodies). The high and low tire responses are relative to each other according to the supplier (BEI Resources). Neither positive pool experienced a statistically significant change in NT50 before and after treatment (plasma dilutions of 1:1915 vs. 1:1857 and 1:2436 vs. 1:2166) (Fig. 3a). The first negative sample (low titre) experienced a 72% reduction in NT50 after treatment (1:595.1 reduced to 1:163.7), which was considered statistically significant (p = 0.0010) via a sum-of-squares F Test comparing the logNT50 values. The NT50 for negative control 2 (high titre) experienced a 74% reduction upon treatment with the beads, from 1:1850 to 1:486.8, which was also statistically significant (p < 0.0001).Fig. 3: H5 neutralisation is not depleted upon treatment with seasonal flu beads.NT50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 10.0.3. Each plot displays the nonlinear curve fit used to calculate NT50 and 95% confidence interval bands of the nonlinear curve fit. Each plot is the average of two replicates minimum (Negative 1, n = 3; Negative 2, n = 5). LogNT50 values before and after treatment were compared via a sum-of-squares F Test in GraphPad (two-sided). All p-values for statistically significant differences in logNT50 are listed, while non-significant (p > 0.05) changes are listed as ns. a Displays the control serum for the depletion assay. Negative controls 1 and 2 are H1N1 convalescent sera (low and medium titre, respectively), while positive control pooled serum was exposed to a sub-virion H5N1 vaccine. Both sets of controls were obtained through BEI Resources. Positive pool 1 is a medium titre pool and positive pool 2 is a low titre pool, according to the supplier. For negative controls 1 and 2, the change in NT50 was statistically significant (p = 0.0010 and 0.00004, respectively), while for the positive pools, these changes were not significant (p = 0.8467 and 0.5636, respectively). Eight samples with unknown exposure history from the Malaysian cohort were treated by the same method in b. All samples were treated with five rounds of fresh protein-conjugated beads in a cocktail mixture at a concentration of 100 beads/μL per bead and aspirated upon incubation with a magnet. The changes in NT50 were not significant for any of these samples (p = 0.0958, 0.3534, 0.0813, 0.7387, 0.8763, 0.6636, 0.4321, 0.8414 for high neutraliser 1, 2, and low neutraliser 1 through 6, respectively). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageOnly two of the fourteen original high neutralisers (NT50 > 1000) from our sample cohort could be tested via this method (due to limited plasma volume), along with six low neutralisers where the NT50 was above 100 but below 1000. Neither the high nor low neutralisers experienced a statistically significant reduction in NT50 after treatment with the beads (Fig. 3b). This suggests that the neutralising response measured in these Malaysian Borneo samples may be H5-specific and not a cross-reactive neutralising response stemming from seasonal influenza exposure.Spatial and environmental overlap of H5 binding and wild bird distributionsFrom July 1979 to August 2023, there were 86,502 observations of the 20 species of shorebirds known to migrate through Malaysian Borneo in the Sabah region15,32. These observations were submitted to eBird from 7636 unique entries. The cumulative abundance of each species ranged from 2 to 28,631 observations (Table 1). The distributions of shorebirds were included across the whole-time frame of data availability (1979–2023), rather than just the year of sample collection (2015), to model species distribution and reduce year-to-year variability.Table 1 Abundance of species observed in the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo from July 1979 to August 2023 and reported to the eBird database32Full size tableThere are regions of high and low domesticated poultry ownership distributed throughout the Northern Sabah region, while wild shorebird contact and high H5 binding are confined to several distinct areas (Fig. 4a, Supplemental Fig. 6). There is a clear section of overlap between wild shorebird contact and high H5N1 binding in the north-western portion of our sample region, in a district known as Kudat. This high H5N1 binding cohort included 20 samples that have an AU > 2. An AU > 2 was considered high binding as the highest response in the control cohorts had AUs of 1.28 (urban Malaysia cohort) and 0.47 (Scottish control cohort) (Supplemental Fig. 5). ELISA binding was chosen for this spatial analysis over neutralisation, as this allowed us to include data on binding at 2000 locations.Fig. 4: Spatial overlap between wild shorebird contact and H5 binding exists that is not seen when comparing domesticated poultry contact and H5 binding.a Estimated mean probability of wild shorebird contact and estimated mean probability of high H5 binding (to A/Duck/Laos/3295/2006) from Bayesian geostatistical models predicted across the study site in Northern Sabah (Fig. 1). Posterior probabilities were estimated using 1000 posterior samples. These posterior probabilities were then used to predict the probability of the outcome variable (H5 binding or species distribution) across the whole study region at 30 m spatial resolution. A total of n = 2000 samples were tested in duplicate by ELISA at a 1:50 dilution, and IgG binding to H5 HA was measured in absorbance units (AU). High H5 binding is considered greater than 2.0 AU based on comparison to the control cohorts. b Adjusted odds ratios for environmental predictors in mixed effects modelling of contact and H5 binding are shown along with 95% confidence intervals for each odds ratio and statistical significance, where p ≤ 0.10 (.), p ≤ 0.05 (*), p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001 (***). Odds ratios greater than 1 (shown in blue) indicate a factor that increases the odds of high H5 binding or of migratory shorebird sightings. Odds ratios <1 (shown in red) decrease the odds of those outcomes. p-values for the risk factors for the odds of wild bird sightings are 3.07 × 10−6 (model intercept), 6.88 × 10−10 (Euclidean distance from roads), 0.001 (elevation in meters above sea level), 0.001 (distance from the sea in meters), 6.90 × 10−5 (maximum temperature of warmest month in °C), 4.68 × 10−9 (precipitation of the wettest month in mm), 0.094 (distance from bush forest in meters) and 0.01 (distance from old forest in meters). p-values for the risk factors for the odds of H5N1 binding are as follows: 0.018 (normalised differential vegetation index), 3.93 × 10−6 (elevation in meters above sea level), 1.67 × 10−6 (distance from the sea in meters), 4.79 × 10−5 (mean diurnal range in °C), 4.85 × 10−7 (minimum temperature of coldest month in °C), 0.04 (precipitation of the wettest month in mm), 0.084 (precipitation seasonality), and 0.027 (distance from irrigated farmland in metres). Source data are provided as a Source Data file including mean posterior estimates, odds ratios, and confidence intervals.Full size imageDistributions of wild shorebird contact and H5N1 binding (by ELISA to A/Duck/Laos/3295/2006) were then plotted as probabilities of species distribution or antibody binding (Fig. 4a). We identified environmental risk factors for shorebird distribution and ELISA binding, reported as adjusted odds ratios based on generalised linear mixed effects modelling (Fig. 4b, Supplemental Figure 8). The model of H5 binding (Supplemental Table 2) and of the wild shorebird distribution (Supplemental Table 3) had several shared environmental risk factors (Fig. 4b). Closeness to the sea increases the odds of wild shorebird contact by nearly 10 times, and the odds of high H5 binding over 800 times. Both H5 binding and wild shorebird sightings were more likely in areas with lower elevation and lower precipitation. Proximity to forested areas increased the odds of wild bird sightings along with Euclidean distance from roads (a measure of remoteness). Increased distances from irrigated farmland also increased the odds of H5 binding. The risk factors which associated with H5 binding and wild shorebird contact are indicative of remote habitats and low populous areas. Inclusion of poultry ownership within the household or surrounding villages did not improve the model fit for H5 binding (Supplemental Table 4).Using these environmental risk factors, we fit Bayesian models for wild shorebird species distributions and H5 ELISA data. All models had statistically significant spatial autocorrelation detected by Moran’s I after the inclusion of fixed environmental effects. The wild shorebird distribution indicates clustered data, with a positive Moran’s I value of 0.0191 (expected value of −0.0001, p < 2.2e−16). Similar results were observed for H5 binding, in which Iobserved = 0.1235, Iexpected = −0.0005, and p < 2.2e−16. Based on Moran’s I, we then fit geostatistical models, including spatially structured random effects. H1 (p = 0.6692), H3 (p ≈ 1), and H5N2 (p = 0.1641) binding did not show spatial autocorrelation via Moran’s I, so the results of these assays were not included in further geospatial analysis.We subsequently fit joint spatial models of wild shorebird distribution and H5 binding. Incorporating a shared spatial random effect between shorebird distribution and H5 binding improved model performance, suggesting common spatial processes between H5 exposure and migratory shorebird distribution (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6).DiscussionOur results show evidence of heterogenous serological responses to avian influenza in Sabah. These results are spatially correlated and follow the distribution and habitats of migratory wild shorebirds over domesticated poultry in the region. As contact with avian species is currently necessary for a spillover event, it is critical to consider these migratory sights as key interfaces in stopping the viral spread.Infection or vaccination with one influenza subtype is thought to generate memory B cells which could produce antibodies that bind to shared epitopes on other HAs33,34. The extent and pervasiveness to which these so-called cross-reactive antibodies exist across multiple HA subtypes and virus strains is not fully understood35. Seasonal IAV vaccination in Malaysia is limited, which removes one possible source of H5 cross-reactive antibody development36. Azami et al. reported 5.5% and 26.3% seasonal vaccine coverage in the elderly and healthcare workers in Malaysia37. Comparatively, in Scotland, the seasonal IAV vaccine coverage is 75.7% in the elderly and 42.4% in healthcare workers38. Although national vaccination rates are higher in Scotland, the Scottish blood donor cohort used in this study as a control cohort exhibited both lower antibody binding to H5 HAs and lower neutralisation titres against H5 pseudovirus (Supplemental Figs. 3, 5). This suggests that seasonal vaccination is unlikely to explain the high H5 responses in the rural Malaysian cohort.In this study, there was a lack of correlations in the ELISA binding to different antigens (Fig. 2a and Supplemental Fig. 2). This may serve as evidence that the observed responses are not driven by the presence of cross-reactive antibodies. A study by Nachbagauer et al. showed that cross-reactive antibodies against H5 HAs were present after H1 infection in mice and that these antibodies could be detected by ELISAs35. The cross-reactive binding responses shown in Nachbagauer et al. to H5 after H3 infection were limited when compared to the H1 results, as H1 and H5 belong to the same HA phylogenetic group34,39. Antibody binding in the Scottish blood donor cohort, which is presumed to be H5 negative, follows the trend observed by Nachbagauer et al. (Supplemental Fig. 2). In the Scottish blood donor responses, the observed correlations between H1 and H5 HA binding (r = 0.19, r = 0.25) are greater than in the Malaysian cohort, where they were nearly zero (r = 0.04, −0.03). Conversely, the H5 HA binding in the Malaysian cohort has higher correlations with H3 HA binding (r = 0.13, r = 0.13) than the Scottish cohort (r = −0.02, r = −0.06). The binding results for the Malaysian cohort present an unusual finding, which deviates from the Scottish cohort and the expectations established in the literature. If the H5 HA binding responses were the result of cross-reactive antibodies caused by H1 HA exposure, we would expect a stronger positive correlation (similar to that of the Scottish cohort) and spatial relationship between the H1 and H5 HA binding results in the Malaysian cohort. The highest correlation in the Malaysian cohort study is between the H5 HA antigens. As these are from the same HA subtype, some level of H5 cross-reactivity is likely33,34,35. When compared with the results of the Scottish cohort, the evidence supports our hypothesis that the binding to H5 HA is not due to some general influenza reactivity or recent seasonal infection/vaccination and could be H5-specific.H5 HA phylogeny adds further credibility to these binding results. A/Duck/Laos/3295/2005(H5N1) and 2.3.4 clade viruses were circulating in Asia for at least 10 years prior to sample collection28. If there was exposure to an H5 virus in the rural Malaysian study cohort, it is possible that it could have been a 2.3.4-like virus due to the timings of circulation. While a range of binding responses to the HA from 2.3.4 was observed, there were hardly any responses above AU 1 (n = 11, 0.55%) to the A/snow goose/Missouri/CC15-84A/2015(H5N2) 2.3.4.4 virus (Fig. 2a). As this second viral HA clade did not become dominant until 3 years after our sample collection29, it is highly unlikely that members of the study cohort could have had an opportunity to be exposed to a 2.3.4.4 virus. The phylogenetic specificity of our binding results amongst H5 responses would not be observed if these responses were exclusively cross-reactive.The observed trends in neutralisation are also supported by phylogenetic evidence. The 2.3.4 H5N1 ELISA antigen has more phylogenetic similarity with A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005(H5N1) (Clade 2.2, 18 amino acid differences) than A/Indonesia/05/2005(H5N1) (Clade 2.1.3.2, 20 amino acid differences) and A/chicken/Malaysia(Sabah)/6123/2018 (Clade 2.3.2.1c, 36 amino acid differences) (Supplementary Table 1). None of the high binding samples to Clade 2.3.4 HA by ELISA neutralised A/Indonesia/05/2005, one neutralised A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018, while 20% had NT50 > 1000 (n = 4) and 16 (80%) had NT50 > 100 against A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005. This suggests that the serological responses against H5 observed in this cohort are not general H5 responses. In fact, the responses are temporally and phylogenetically specific, which suggests that the individuals in our cohort may have encountered a virus closely related to the H5 clades 2.3.4 or 2.2. Although the recombinant HAs used by ELISA are not matching strains to the pseudoneutralisation HAs, the observed binding and neutralisation are in accordance with the phylogenetic distance.The persistence of these neutralising responses upon treatment with the seasonal flu-coated beads illustrates that the observed responses in the sample cohort were most similar to those of the H5 exposed positive controls (Figs. 2b and 3). Our study is limited in that a lack of PCR and health data makes it impossible to know if this population had genuine symptomatic cases of H5 avian influenza in this population. However, attributing the results of this study to previous seasonal influenza exposure would not fully explain the unusual responses we have observed. Previous work has highlighted the strong correlations between pseudovirus neutralisation and live virus neutralisation results for H5N1 IAV30,40, further validating these results even without access to health data. We propose that our depletion assay could be useful to other researchers seeking to contextualise the role of cross-reactivity in their influenza serology results when clinical data is not available.The geospatial distributions of the serological responses adds further support to the hypothesis of H5 exposure. Binding to seasonal influenza antigens exhibits a wide range of responses regardless of exposure to reservoirs, and this data is not spatially correlated (Fig. 2a). As seasonal influenza viruses are endemic, spatial homogeneity was expected. Indeed, if the seasonal influenza binding shared spatial trends with that of the avian influenza binding responses, it would be far more likely that the H5 results would be the result of cross-reactive antibodies from a previous seasonal influenza infection.There was no spatial correlation in H5 2.3.4.4 binding. As the samples for this study were collected in 2015, this population would likely not have had the chance to be exposed to this post-2015 virus. Therefore, spatially correlated responses would have been highly unexpected. Instead, H5 2.3.4 binding was higher amongst those living near migratory shorebird locations, and the data are highly spatially correlated (Figs. 2a and 4a). These spatial patterns suggest that the H5 2.3.4 results are distinct from the other ELISA responses and may represent a footprint of some genuine previous exposure.There are shared environmental risk factors between the wild shorebird distributions and H5 binding (Fig. 4b). The identification of proximity to the sea, low elevation (i.e. sea level) areas, closeness to the forest, and remote areas as risk factors indicates that wild migratory shorebirds were reported in their natural habitats18,19,20, and that these habitats are also areas where binding to the H5 HA 2.3.4 antigen was highest. Shared environmental risk factors and the overlapping spatial distributions between wild shorebirds and H5 HA binding, suggest that some form of contact may be occurring between humans and wild shorebirds in these locations, whether direct or indirect. Future studies could collect contemporaneous data on wild shorebird movements and pathogen presence.One mechanism of H5 spillover is the spread of the virus from wild shorebirds and waterfowl to domesticated poultry or swine and then into humans41. However, H5 2.3.4 binding is not related to poultry or swine contact in this study, as the inclusion of poultry or swine ownership as fixed effects did not improve model fit (Supplemental Table 7). This presents an unexpected finding, as poultry and swine farmers are often considered at risk of encountering IAV41 (Supplemental Fig. 6). Additionally, there were no recorded waterfowl sightings in the Kudat district of Sabah, where several of the individuals with high antibody binding to H5 HA 2.3.4 reside, but shorebirds were recorded in this area (Supplemental Fig. 7). While there are many possible routes of influenza spillover, our findings highlight that proximity with wild migratory shorebirds could be an overlooked source of H5 transmission. The threat of spillover from migratory shorebirds was highlighted by Wille et al., who identified that red-necked stints (Calidris ruficolis), known to stopover in East and Southeast Asia on their way to Australia, had HA inhibitory antibodies to HPAI H5 viruses23. Although migratory shorebirds have traditionally been implicated in the spread of low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses to poultry, Wille et al. highlight the possibility of migratory shorebirds’ role in HPAI spread. Our study presents serological data which suggests that migratory shorebirds could already be playing a role in H5 spillover into humans23,42. Thees findings suggest a need to consider individuals living close to these migratory sites as a part of regular surveillance efforts to determine the risk of spillover in these locations.Migratory shorebirds transiting between countries may carry influenza and expose individuals in the surrounding areas to avian viruses. These results presented in this study suggest that individuals living within 10 km of known migratory locations may have had previously unknown exposure to avian influenza of the H5 HA 2.3.4 or similar clade. As shorebird habits are being destroyed due to rising sea levels and land use changes, there is an urgent need to consider how this may force zoonotic reservoirs into closer contact with humans and increase the risk of HPAI spillover.MethodsSamples collection and ethical approvalScottish blood donorsA total of 63 serum samples from blood donors aged 17–80 collected by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) in 2020 were used for this study. Ethical approval was obtained for the SNBTS anonymous archive—IRAS project number 18005. SNBTS blood donors gave fully informed consent to virological testing; donation was made under the SNBTS Blood Establishment Authorisation, and the study was approved by the SNBTS Research and Sample Governance Committee.Cross-sectional survey of rural Malaysian Borneo (Sabah)Samples were collected, as a part of Fornace et al. 43 between September 17, 2015 and December 12, 2015, from individuals in the Pitas, Kudat, Ranau, and Kota Marudu districts of the Sabah region in Malaysian Borneo. All individuals in households selected for the environmental survey responses were asked to donate blood unless they were younger than 3 months old or could not be reached after three attempts. Whole blood was collected into precoated EDTA tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA). Samples were tested by ELISA and pseudoneutralisation assays after processing.Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants or a legal guardian. The Medical Research Sub-Committee of the Malaysian Ministry of Health (NMRR-14-713-21117), the Research Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (8340), and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (560-22) have approved this study.Urban Malaysian samples (Kota Kinabalu)678 samples were collected from blood donors in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysian Borneo from 2017 to 2020 for a cross-sectional study on Leptospirosis run in 2017 by Jeffree et al. 44. These samples were tested by ELISA in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia at the Borneo Medical Health Research Centre. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia (UMS).Sample selectionThe 2000 samples used for ELISAs in this study were chosen at random from the 10,100 samples in the rural cohort, including 500 samples each from the four districts in the study (Pitas, Kudat, Ranau, and Kota Marudu). The number of samples used at various points throughout this study is indicated by n.Viral proteins, antibodies, and antiserumAll viral proteins were obtained through BEI Resources, NIAD, NIH from various contributors (Supplemental Table 7). All HAs were produced in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system with a variety of purification methods and tags. All antibodies and antiserum for IAV HAs were sourced externally (Supplemental Table 8).Detection of IgG binding by ELISAThe binding of antibodies to a variety of seasonal and avian haemagglutinin was measured by IgG ELISAs in a protocol adapted from Thom et al. 45.MaxiSORPTM NUNC-Immuno plates were coated with 0.125 µg/mL of A/Duck/Laos/3295/2006(H5N1) (H5 Clade 2.3.4), A/snow goose/Missouri/CC15-84A/2015 (H5N1) (H5 Clade 2.3.4.4), and A/New York/55/2004(H3N2) or 1 µg/mL for A/California/07/pdm2009(H1N1) in 50 µL 1X PBS. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, plates were blocked with 200 µL BlockerTM casein in PBS for 1 h on a shaking incubator at RT. The plates were then washed six times with 200 µL of 0.05% PBST and tapped dry. All subsequent wash steps follow the same procedure. Serum and positive controls were added in duplicate at a 1:50 dilution in 50 µL BlockerTM casein in PBS and incubated for 1 hr, shaking at RT (each plate contained a human and goat antiserum control for intra-assay validation). Plates were washed and tapped dry.The detection/secondary antibody (either anti-human or anti-goat, Supplemental Table 8) was then added to the plate at 1:2000 in 100 µL, as recommended by the suppliers, and incubated for 30 min at RT. The plates were washed and tapped dry, and 100 µL of BioFX® TMB One Component HRP Microwell Substrate was added. The plates were allowed to develop for 15 min before stopping the reaction with 100 µL of BioFX® 450 nm Stop Reagent for TMB Microwell Substrates to prevent over-saturation. Absorbance was read at an optical density of 450 nm with a GloMax® Explorer Multimode Microplate Reader. Results were analysed manually (background subtraction and averaging of replicates) and plotted in R Studio46 with ggplot247, ggstatsplot48, and R 4.2.049 and GraphPad Prism 10.0.3.Polyclonal goat antiserum, post-H5 vaccination pooled human plasma, and H1N1 convalescent sera were used as positive controls (Supplemental Table 8). The Scottish blood samples were used as a control cohort which was presumed to be H5 negative. The urban Malaysian cohort was used to understand baseline binding to H5 HA in a more urban population from Borneo (Supplemental Fig. 5).Pseudotyped influenza virus productionPseudotyped lentiviruses displaying IAV H5 haemagglutinins were produced via transfection of the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Sigma, 12022001), as described in Thompson et al. 50 and Temperton et al. 30. 1.0 µg of gag/pol construct (p8.91), 1.5 µg of a luciferase reporter carrying construct (PCSFLW), and 1.0 µg of HA glycoprotein expressing construct were combined with 200 µL OptiMEM (Gibco™, 31985062) and 35 µL of 1 mg/mL polyethyleneimine (PEI) branched (Sigma, 408727). The p8.91, pCSFLW and the HA-expressing plasmids were obtained from CPT and NT; the A/chicken/Malaysia (Sabah)/6123/2018 HA plasmid, which was obtained from Twist Biosciences (USA).Transfections were performed in 10 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) 1X, high glucose, GlutaMAX™ (Gibco™, 10569010) with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco™, 16000044) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P4333) and left for 24 h. One unit of neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma-Aldrich, N2876) was added to fresh media to induce virus budding. After 48 h, pseudotyped viruses were removed and filtered with a sterile 0.45-µm Millex®-HA filter unit (Millipore, SLHA033SB). The HA glycoprotein constructs used for the production of the pseudotyped H5N1 lentiviruses were A/Indonesia/05/2005 (Clade 2.1), A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005 (Clade 2.2), A/chicken/Malaysia(Sabah)/6123/2018 (Clade 2.3.2.1c).The pseudotyped influenza viruses were titrated for use in microneutralisation assays. Pseudotyped influenza viruses with initial titres above 1 × 105 relative light units (RLU) were used (Supplemental Fig. 9).Pseudotyped microneutralisation assayNeutralisation of the pseudotyped influenza viruses was quantified using a microneutralisation assay. Sera was added in duplicate at a 1:20 dilution in 100 µL DMEM to a white Nunc™ MicroWell™ 96-well, flat-bottom microplate. Each serum sample was then serially diluted down the plate (Row A–Row H) 1:1 in 50 µL DMEM. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 50 µL 1 × 105 RLU pseudotyped influenza virus per well. One row per plate contained virus, cells, and no serum, and one row was a cell-only control.After 2 h, 50 µL of 1 × 105 HEK 293T cells were added to each well and incubated for a further 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed with 50 µL per well of a 1:1 mixture of Bright-GloTM Luciferase Assay System and 1X PBS. The RLU of the cell lysate was determined using a GloMax® Explorer Multimode Microplate Reader.Microneutralisation assay data was analysed in GraphPad Prism 10.0.3. The reduction of infectivity from the microneutralisation assay was determined by comparing the RLU in the presence and absence of serum and expressed as percentage neutralisation. The data was normalised using the virus and cell-only control wells, and a neutralisation curve was fit with non-linear regression (log-inhibitor versus normalised response). The 50%-neutralising titre (NT50) is here defined as the sample dilution at which viral RLU was reduced by 50% compared with control wells.A sample was considered neutralising if the dilution factor of serum needed to reach NT50 was greater than or equal to 1:100, as established by Temperton et al. 30. To account for cross-reactive neutralisation we used the highest NT50 from the cohort of negative control Scottish blood donor samples to create cut-offs for seropositivity (1:1173 for A/Indonesia/05/2005, 1: 1015 for A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005, and 1:1358 for A/Chicken/Malaysia(Sabah)/6123/2018) as in Thompson et al. 31 (Supplemental Fig. 4). Where applicable, NT50s were compared in Prism using the Extra sum-of-squares F-test, with p < 0.05 as the cut-off for statistically significant differences in NT50 values.Two post-H5 vaccination pooled human plasma samples were used as positive controls. The two H1N1 convalescent samples were used as a control that exhibited a cross-reactive neutralising response (Supplemental Table 8). The Scottish blood samples were used as a control cohort which was presumed to be H5 negative (Supplemental Fig. 3).Microsphere (bead) protein conjugationCarboxyl magnetic particles (beads) (Spherotech, SPHERO™ 4.2 µm) were conjugated with IAV HAs as described in Brown et al. 51, Barrett et al. 52, and Tomic et al. 53 for plasma depletion assays. Beads were coated with HAs from a variety of seasonal influenzas obtained from BEI Resources: A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2), A/California/07/2009(H1N1) and A/New York/18/2009(H1N1). A subset of beads prepared were not coated with any HA to test the effect of the beads themselves in assays (referred to as non-coated beads).All previously prepared beads were diluted to 200 beads/µL in an Assay Buffer (buffers described in Supplemental Table 9). 50 µL of each solution of beads was added to a 5 mL sterile, round bottom, polystyrene Falcon® test tube (Corning, 352054). Four conditions were prepared to test each bead: a blank tube with no secondary antibody, a positive control serum tube, a negative control serum tube, and an IgG isotype tube to identify any non-specific binding of the secondary antibody. The positive control serum was an individual who also exhibited high H1 and H3 antibody binding responses by ELISA relative to the negative control. The negative control serum exhibited lower antibody binding to the seasonal HA antigens by ELISA. Responses by ELISA were used to establish controls, as past influenza subtype exposure is often unknown.Serum samples were diluted 1:100 (50 µL) in Assay Buffer and incubated with beads for 1 h at RT, shaking at 700 rpm. Beads were pelleted on the EasyEights™ EasySep™ magnet (STEMCELL™ Technologies, 18103) for 1 min and the supernatant was gently aspirated without disturbing the bead pellet. Beads were washed three times using 1 mL Wash Buffer per tube. Beads were resuspended in 200 µL Assay Buffer. 100 µL of 1 µg/mL phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibody was added to the tubes, either the isotype control antibody (BioLegend #400112) or anti-human IgG (Southern Biotech #9040-09) depending on the condition. No secondary antibody was added to the blank condition. All tubes were then left to incubate for 1 h at RT in the dark, shaking. Beads were pelleted on a magnet and washed three times in 1 mL Wash Buffer. Samples were resuspended in 500 µL of Storage Buffer and vortexed.Samples were then acquired on the flow cytometer to determine if the conjugation of viral proteins to the beads was successful. Side scatter versus forward scatter plots were used to draw gate 1 to exclude debris and doublets. The count versus PE histogram was used to observe PE fluorescence in the different conditions (Supplemental Fig. 4). Data was analysed with FlowJo™ 10.8.2.Bead-based cross-reactivity depletionTo determine the cross-reactivity of any H5 IAV neutralising and binding antibodies, a serum depletion assay was developed using the previously HA-conjugated beads. The aim was to isolate antibodies that bound to seasonal IAV-coated beads and determine if any H5 binding or neutralising ability remained.For pseudotyped neutralisation assays, the bead mixture was diluted to a concentration of 100 beads/µL/bead (total concentration of 300 beads/µL). An equal concentration of A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2), A/California/07/2009(H1N1), and A/New York/18/2009(H1N1) coated beads were used. Human serum was added to this bead mixture at a 1:20 dilution. This was incubated for 30 min, and the mixture was incubated on the magnet. The flow-through (media and serum not bound to the magnet) was transferred to an Eppendorf™ tube with fresh beads. This process was repeated four more times, for a total of five passages through fresh beads. Five passages generated the optimal depletion (highest level of depletion whilst conserving resources) (Supplemental Fig. 10a).After the final passage, the mixture was incubated on the magnet for 1 min. While on the magnet, 100 µL of flow-through was added in duplicate to Row A of a white Nunc™ MicroWell™ 96-well plate and serially diluted to Row H. Each plate also contained untreated serum, a virus-only control row, and a cell-only control. The neutralisation assays were then completed and analysed as per the previous neutralisation results. NT50s of the treated and untreated conditions were compared in Prism using the Extra sum-of-squares F-test, with p < 0.05 as the cut-off for statistically significant differences in NT50 values.The effect of the beads themselves was also tested at the final assay concentration (300 beads/µL) using non-coated beads. No effect was observed with the uncoated beads (Supplemental Fig. 10b).As in the neutralisation assays, two post-H5 vaccination pooled human plasma samples were used as positive controls. The two H1N1 convalescent samples were used as a control that exhibited a cross-reactive neutralising response (Supplemental Table 8).Environmental risk factor analysisWe aimed to assess the spatial distribution of H5 binding, wild shorebird populations, and domesticated poultry. Binomial generalised linear models (GLMs) were used with the outcome as the proportion of individuals per household with high H5 binding. For poultry ownership the number of poultry owners per village was used as an outcome. For wild shorebird contact, the outcome was whether there was a shorebird sighting at a particular location.Households included in the study were geolocated and integrated with remote sensing-derived environmental data on land cover and climatic factors. All environmental data was curated as in Klim et al. 27 and Fornace et al. 43,54. Twenty environmental variables were considered for inclusion in the final models of shorebird contact and H5 binding. Elevation, aspect, and slope data for the region were obtained from the ASTER Digital Global Elevation Model55. The WorldClim56 database was used to collect data from 1970 to 2000 on average temperature, minimum temperature of coldest month, maximum temperature of warmest month, mean diurnal range (all in °C), precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), precipitation of wettest month (mm), and population density (per km2). Household distance in meters from mangroves, agricultural land, irrigated farmland, the sea, old (primary) forest, bush (secondary) forest, oil palm plantations, rubber plantations, and Euclidean distance from roads was calculated by Fornace et al. 43. The possible predictor variables were mean-centred and scaled and checked for collinearity before inclusion in final models (Supplemental Fig. 8).Fixed effects were selected by using the model with the lowest AIC was selected using MASS::stepAIC using a stepwise parsimonious approach (both forward and backward selection)57 (Supplemental Tables 2–4). Odds ratios were calculated and plotted using the sjPlot58 package in RStudio46,49.Spatial autocorrelation of the residuals from the GLM results was determined with Moran’s I, where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Models exhibiting residual spatial autocorrelation were integrated into a Bayesian framework with integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) in R-INLA59. Spatial effects were modelled as a Matérn covariance function, using the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) method60. For the model intercepts and fixed effects coefficients, weakly informative priors of Normal (0, 100) were used61.The final models were evaluated using the deviance information criteria (DIC). Posterior probabilities were estimated using 1000 posterior samples. These posterior probabilities were then used to predict the probability of the outcome variable (H5 binding or species distribution) across the whole study region. Uncertainty for these predictions was visualised through standard deviation. Posterior probabilities at 30 m spatial resolution (i.e. each pixel represents 30 m by 30 m) were visualised with ggplot247 and the wesanderson colour palette (copyright Karthik Ram, 2022).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

It aims to raise awareness of the importance of vaccination for people’s health and well-being and to increase the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination of people with underlying risk factors. Let's prevent flu from spreading this season! | #FluAwareness Campaign This content is hosted by a third party. By showing the external content you accept the terms and conditions of YouTube. Load once Don't ask again Influenza is usually mild and most people recover quickly, but some people are at high risk of serious complications, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death. The elderly, pregnant women, young children and people with underlying health conditions are more likely than others to develop severe disease if they should be infected. In addition, health care workers are more exposed to different viruses on a daily basis, including the influenza virus, and should be vaccinated to protect themselves and their patients. Influenza is a disease with high social and economic costs, and vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. As influenza viruses change, vaccination against influenza is needed every year to keep up with the circulating viruses. In the northern hemisphere, the seasonal influenza circulation is observed between November up to May, so October is the optimal time to receive an influenza vaccination. Join the initiative to increase vaccination coverage by raising awareness of the importance of vaccination!

She also consults on digital content for physician medical education. learn more In This Article View All In This Article Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatments Prevention Complications When To Contact a Healthcare Provider FAQs Close Oksana Shufrych / Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that influenza B accounted for 31% to 35% of confirmed cases in May 2024. Influenza B is a type of flu virus that causes symptoms in humans only. Symptoms of flu B often include a fever, coughing, and headache. Influenza B is known to cause seasonal epidemics along with influenza A, which is typically responsible for more severe illnesses. Most flu cases—around 70% of reported cases—are influenza A. The influenza B virus is the cause of the next most common type of flu. Influenza B Symptoms The symptoms of influenza B are similar to those of other strains of influenza A. Some of the most common influenza B symptoms include: CoughingFeverHeadache Influenza B largely affects the respiratory system. It can also cause symptoms that involve the entire body. You may also develop gastrointestinal symptoms, although they're less common. Respiratory Symptoms The flu is a respiratory infection, meaning it targets the lungs, nose, and throat. Some of the most common respiratory symptoms include: Congestion, or a stuffy nose Coughing Runny nose Sneezing Sore throat These symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections, such as the cold, but can be more severe. The flu can lead to complications, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, or worsen symptoms in people with asthma. Body Symptoms One of the most common systemic (whole-body) symptoms of the flu is a fever. It typically lasts three to four days and can reach 106 degrees in some people. Other body symptoms may include: ChillsBody or muscle achesHeadacheLack of energy Gastrointestinal Symptoms Some evidence suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms are more common with influenza B than influenza A, but the data is mixed. These symptoms can include: Abdominal pain Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Keep in mind that these symptoms are different from the “stomach flu,” which isn’t actually caused by flu viruses. This infection is medically known as viral gastroenteritis, which is commonly caused by norovirus and rotavirus. Causes The flu spreads when a person with the illness emits infectious droplets by coughing, sneezing, or talking. These droplets can land in your mouth or nose if you're standing close to them. You can also pick up infectious droplets that land on an object or surface, but it's less common. Diagnosis A healthcare provider can diagnose the flu based on the information you give them about your symptoms and if it's prevalent in your area. They can also use molecular and rapid antigen tests to diagnose the illness. Molecular tests provide rapid and highly accurate results to see if you have the flu. A healthcare provider may get a nose or mouth fluid sample to send to a lab for testing. A healthcare provider will use rapid antigen tests to get a flu diagnosis confirmation in less than an hour. These tests are typically less accurate than molecular tests. Influenza B Treatment The goal of treatment is to help reduce and resolve flu symptoms. Treatment options include antiviral medications and self-care measures. Antiviral Medications Antiviral medications can cut down the time you are sick with the flu. A healthcare provider may prescribe one of the following: Rapivab (peramivir)Relenza (zanamivir)Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate)Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) These medications aren't necessary for all flu cases, especially if you have mild symptoms. A healthcare provider may only prescribe them if you become very sick or have a higher risk of flu-related complications. Self-Care You can usually treat mild flu symptoms at home with the following self-care measures: Drinking plenty of liquids Getting a lot of rest Taking medications like Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) to reduce a fever or over-the-counter (OTC) cold medicines Using cough drops or throat sprays for a sore throat Prevention The best way to prevent the flu—both influenza A and B—is by getting the flu vaccine. The recommendation is for people 6 months or older to get vaccinated against the flu. Children aged 8 and younger need two doses during flu season. Those aged 9 and older would only need one dose. You can also prevent the flu by: Keeping your distance if you or someone else is sick Regularly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Staying home when you have symptoms Using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are unavailable Complications The main complication of the flu is pneumonia. Other possible complications include brain infection, meningitis, and seizures. Some people have a higher risk of flu-related complications, including those who: Are aged 2 and younger or 65 years and older Are more than three months pregnant Have diabetes, a weak immune system, or chronic heart, kidney, or lung conditions Live in a long-term care facility When To Contact a Healthcare Provider You don't have to see a healthcare provider for mild flu symptoms, regardless of the type of virus causing them. It's important to contact a healthcare provider, in contrast, if you're at risk of complications. You'll also want to see a healthcare provider if flu symptoms worsen and don't improve with home remedies. Get medical attention right away if you or your child have: High fever Shortness of breath Trouble breathing A Quick Review Influenza B is a type of flu caused by viruses from the Victoria or Yamagata lineages. Symptoms are similar to other strains of the flu, but they're mild in comparison. The flu is both treatable and preventable. Talk to a healthcare provider if you have problems with treatment and symptoms or may be at risk for complications. Frequently Asked Questions Is flu A or B worse? Influenza A tends to cause worse symptoms than influenza B. B viruses also change slower genetically compared to influenza A viruses. Some evidence suggests that some infections from influenza B can be just as severe as influenza A. What are the stages of flu B? Influenza B generally occurs in stages, such as:Incubation: This is the period during which the flu virus replicates in your body. You typically won't have symptoms, but it's important to note that you can be contagious.Early symptoms: Symptoms typically develop within two to three days after you come into contact with the virus and come on quickly. You might have a fever, chills, coughing, muscle aches, and sore throat.Peak illness: These symptoms usually peak after two to three days after onset. A fever goes away within three to four days, but it can last up to eight days in some people.Recovery: Most people with mild illness get better within one to two weeks. A lack of energy and coughing can linger for weeks after recovery. How long will flu B last? Flu symptoms generally get better within one week. Keep in mind that how long the flu lasts can be shorter or longer in some people. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Mayas © Credits Yemen begins sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centre in London 16 October 2024 Departmental update Reading time: Influenza virus sharing is essential to prepare the world against pandemics. Virus sharing also enables the development of candidate vaccine viruses, surveillance for resistance to antiviral medicines, and revision of diagnostic reagents and test kits. Owing to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, the country has been unable to share virus samples every year with the WHO Collaborating Centers under the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). However, in May 2024 Yemen succeeded for the first time in shipping the first 50 samples of seasonal influenza viruses to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in London, in the United Kingdom. This milestone was made possible by WHO’s continuous support to the country over several years.During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, Yemen’s Ministry of Public Health and Population designated the Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL) as the National Influenza Centre. Following the COVID-19 emergency, Yemen has adapted its respiratory disease surveillance system to monitor both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This was done with support from WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Since then, Yemen has been expanding its services for the subtyping of influenza and other respiratory viruses to feed into this new national integrated surveillance programme and GISRS. In March 2022, WHO headquarters and Regional Office experts arranged a mission to Yemen in coordination with the WHO Country Office in Yemen. The mission aimed to reactivate influenza sentinel sites, which had been suspended during the COVID-19 emergency; train Ministry of Public Health and Population and CPHL staff on virus testing and on sharing influenza viruses with human pandemic potential, in line with the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework; and to ensure that CPHL has met the WHO requirements for testing procedures for respiratory viruses.Since January 2023, samples are being collected at influenza sentinel sites and shipped to the CPHL’s governorate-level National Centre for confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. However, until May 2024, logistics constraints prevented the next step of sharing confirmed samples with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London – dry ice, which is needed to ship samples internationally, has been unavailable in Yemen since 2015 due to the war and an embargo.With support and facilitation from WHO, dry ice was received in Aden, Yemen, from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 13 May 2024. This was transported via a United Nations Humanitarian Air Service flight from Addis Ababa to Aden, and the same plane then took the packaged samples on to Amman, Jordan. The samples safely made the last leg of their journey via international courier from Amman to London, where they were received the next day by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza for further processing.The same coordination mechanism will be used for future shipments of influenza virus samples until Yemen can produce dry ice.

California now has 11 H5 cases in dairy workers. U. J. Alexander / iStock So far this year, 25 human H5 cases have been reported in the United States, all but 1 involving exposure to infected cows or poultry.Dairy workers in California continue to face a daunting threat from ongoing spread of the virus in the state’s dairy cows. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 15 more outbreaks in California dairy herds, bringing the state’s total to 120 and the national total to 320 across 14 states.USDA confirms outbreaks in Utah and Washington poultry flocksIn other avian flu developments, APHIS today confirmed an outbreak at a commercial poultry farm reported by Utah earlier this week. The facility in Cache County is a layer farm that has 1.8 million birds.Also, the agency confirmed an outbreak at a layer farm in Washington, which involves a facility in Franklin County that has nearly 840,000 birds. The event marks Washington’s first outbreak in poultry since December 2023. Study highlights demographic, socioeconomic disparities in C difficile infection News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile A study conducted at a California hospital found that people considered highly socially vulnerable were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with severe Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and die from it than less vulnerable people, researchers reported yesterday at IDWeek 2024.The study by researchers at Loma Linda University Medical Center included 206 adults admitted for CDI, which causes diarrhea and colitis, from January 2020 to June 2021. To assess the impact of external factors on CDI severity, and mortality, the researchers used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a composite measure of communities based on four major themes: socioeconomic status, housing characteristics, race/ethnicity status, and housing and transportation. Patients in the study with an SVI score of less than 0.5 were considered low vulnerability, while people above 0.5 were considered highly vulnerable. Large disparities across all SVI themesThe analysis found that high vulnerability scores across all four SVI themes were associated with increased CDI severity and mortality. Patients with high vulnerability scores in socioeconomic status and housing characteristics were three times more likely to have severe CDI than those with low vulnerability scores, while patients with high vulnerability scores for housing and transportation—including those living in multiunit structures, mobile homes, group quarters, and lacking a vehicle—were more than twice as likely to have severe CDI compared with people with low scores.When considering race/ethnicity status, patients with high vulnerability scores were 37 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe CDI and nine times more likely to die than those with low scores.“We need to conduct further research to gain a deeper understanding of the correlations between C. diff severity and mortality, race and environmental and socioeconomic factors,” Timothy Afable, PharmD, pharmacy resident at Loma Linda University and presenting author, said in an IDWeek press release. “This study is only a starting point to a broader understanding of health equity and the potential vulnerabilities patients with C. diff face.” Study shows vaccine uptake disparities among Black, White Americans News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Influenza Vaccines Misc Emerging Topics CDC / Lauren Bishop Data collected at the University Hospitals of Cleveland show that overall US vaccination rates for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remain below 50%, with Black individuals less likely to be vaccinated than their White peers.The data were presented this week at IDWeek in Los Angeles, and based on information collected from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), which looks at socioeconomic status, housing, and neighborhood characteristics that can be social determinants of health. Looking at the Cleveland metropolitan area, the researchers analyzed 341,029 patients who were diagnosed as having acute respiratory infections at University Hospitals of Cleveland between October 2023 and April 2024. More ED visits in low-income neighborhoods Black patients were overrepresented as 37% of the patient population, despite making up 14% of Cleveland’s population. Researchers found lower vaccination rates in areas with higher social vulnerability and in predominantly Black neighborhoods but higher emergency department (ED) visits for acute respiratory infections in those areas. The study’s findings maintain that neighborhood factors and race are significantly associated with vaccination status against common respiratory viruses"Even when controlling for demographic factors, household income, health insurance coverage and geographic location, the study’s findings maintain that neighborhood factors and race are significantly associated with vaccination status against common respiratory viruses," said Elie Saade, MD, medical director of infection control and quality at University Hospitals of Cleveland, in the news release. "Disparities this vast are not to be overlooked—they require multifaceted interventions that meet people where they are socially and increase access to essential preventive measures."

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Prevention Senior Flu Shots By Kelly Burch Updated on October 13, 2024 Medically reviewed by Chris Vincent, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Senior Flu Shots Types Benefits Timing Side Effects Close Senior flu shots are more potent influenza vaccines designed for persons 65 years and older. Older adults are at greater risk of flu-related complications and death, and their immune systems are less responsive to the standard annual flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all older adults (ages 65+) receive either a higher-dose vaccine or an adjuvanted vaccine, which contains compounds that boost the shot's effectiveness. These extra-strength flu vaccines address issues specific to the older population's immune systems and prompt a stronger immune response than standard flu shots, resulting in fewer hospitalizations and deaths. FatCamera / Getty Images What Is a Senior Flu Shot? The CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older (with a few, rare exceptions). However, the standard flu vaccine is not as effective in persons 65 years and older, and older adults are at higher risk for complications, and even death, from the flu. The immune system gets progressively weaker with aging, a process called immunosenescence. This causes a slowing of immune cell generation in response to pathogens, leading to an increased susceptibility to disease in the older population. In 2022, the CDC recommended that persons 65 years and older receive annual high-potency influenza vaccines instead of standard flu shots. These senior flu shots prompt a stronger immune response for greater protection against the influenza virus. A Word From Verywell The term "high-dose flu shot" can sometimes sound more intimidating than it really is. The intention behind these "higher-dose" vaccines is to ensure a full immune response and optimal immunity to the virus. Research shows that around and after age 65, the immune system begins to weaken. Administering a higher-dose vaccine compensates for a weaker immune system, resulting in a more typical immune response. — LINDSAY COOK, PHARMD, MEDICAL EXPERT BOARD Types of Flu Shots for Seniors Senior flu shots are available in two formulations: high-dose or adjuvanted. Three of these vaccines available for the 2024-2025 flu season include: Fluzone high-dose vaccineFlublok recombinant vaccineFluad adjuvanted vaccine These senior flu vaccines are formulated to address specific immune system issues in people 65 years and older. They help boost immunity and prevent complications from influenza. High-Dose Flu Vaccines High-dose flu vaccines contain higher amounts of flu virus antigens. Antigens prompt the immune system to produce antibodies against influenza strains. Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens and neutralize pathogens. The antibodies you develop from the flu shot help your immune system quickly mount a defense when exposed to the live flu virus. High-dose vaccines promote a stronger immune response because they have more antigens than standard flu vaccines. Studies show high-dose vaccines offer older adults 24% more protection against the flu than the standard vaccine. The following high-dose flu vaccines are available this season: Fluzone High-Dose contains antigen levels four times greater than standard-dose vaccines. Fluzone is only approved for people 65 years and older.Flublok contains antigen levels three times greater than regular flu shots. It is a recombinant vaccine manufactured without eggs. Flublok is approved for people age 18 and older and is not limited to older adults. Both these vaccines can be given with other live or inactivated vaccines. Adjuvanted Flu Vaccine The adjuvanted flu vaccine contains the same level of antigens as the standard vaccine but has an extra ingredient (an adjuvant) to trigger a stronger immune response. Fluad Quadrivalent is the only adjuvanted flu vaccine available for the current flu season and is only approved for people 65 years and older. Research in older adults shows the adjuvanted flu vaccine is more effective than the standard flu shot, helps to prevent complications and hospitalizations, and also appears to provide longer protection. Which Flu Shot Is Best for Seniors? According to the CDC, the best flu shots for people 65 years and older are Fluzone, Flublok, and Fluad. Known as senior flu shots, the CDC gives no preference to one over another.A 2023 study found high-dose vaccines offer slightly stronger immunity than adjuvanted ones, though the difference was not statistically significant. Consult your healthcare provider to determine which flu vaccine is best for you. Why You Should Get the Senior Flu Shot People 65 years and older are at the highest risk for influenza complications. About half of flu-related hospitalizations and up to 85% of flu-related deaths originate from this age group. An annual senior flu shot is critical to prevent these complications because immunity wanes over time, and the vaccine is tailored annually to the current most prominent flu strains. Research shows older adults often have weaker immune responses to the flu vaccine than younger people. The exact reason for this remains unclear, but investigators suspect two factors may contribute: Pre-existing antibodies from prior flu seasonsChronic inflammation from arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, or other underlying health conditions Senior flu shots address these issues to promote a stronger immune response and boost effectiveness. Prevent Flu Complications Both high-dose and adjuvanted flu shots provide older adults with better protection against potential complications from the flu. Compared to standard vaccines, senior flu shots reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. Some serious flu complications that require immediate medical care, include: Difficulty breathingChest or abdominal pain or pressureDizziness or confusionSeizuresSevere muscle pain or weaknessNot urinating, or other signs of dehydrationFever or cough that continues or worsensWorsening chronic medical conditions It's important to know that the flu can develop into pneumonia, a serious and potentially fatal lung infection. Pneumonia and flu symptoms can overlap, Always inform your healthcare provider about any unusual or worsening symptoms. What Flu Vaccines Should Seniors Avoid? Older adults should not be given Flumist, the nasal spray vaccine. This vaccine contains weakened, live influenza viruses and is not approved for use in adults over 50 years. The older population should also avoid getting the standard flu shot unless higher-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines aren't available. When Should Older Adults Get a Flu Shot? The best time for older adults to get the flu shot is late September through the end of October. This helps to ensure you have enough time (about two weeks) to build immunity before the holidays when flu activity starts to ramp up. People 65 years of age and older are advised against getting the flu shot too early in the season. The vaccine's protection fades faster in this population. An August vaccination could lose effectiveness before the end of flu season, typically at the end of May. However, a late flu shot is better than none at all. If you didn't get your annual influenza vaccine by the end of October, you can still get it in November or December. What Are the Side Effects? The extra immunity offered by senior flu shots is also more likely to cause some side effects vs. standard flu shots. For the most part, side effects of the senior flu shot are mild to moderate and only last a few days. Senior flu shot side effects can include: FatigueHeadachesInjection site pain and rednessMalaiseMuscle aches Rates of side effects vary among the different vaccines, as follows: Fluad: Injection site pain (16.3%), headache (10.8%), and fatigue (10.5%)Flublok: Injection site tenderness (34%), injection site pain (19%), headache (13%,) and fatigue (12%) Fluzone: Injection site pain (33%), myalgia (18%), headache (13%), and malaise (11%) Summary The CDC recommends more potent flu shots for people 65 years and older. This population has a higher risk of complications and death from the flu and tends to have a lower immune response to standard flu shots. The three flu vaccines preferentially recommended for seniors are the high-dose Fluzone and Flublok and an adjuvanted flu vaccine Fluad. Studies show these more powerful vaccines enhance seniors' immunity and decrease flu-related hospitalizations and deaths, compared to standard flu shots.

Here we present cryo-EM structures of fully glycosylated HAs from H5N1 and H5N8 influenza viruses. We find that the H5N1 HA can form filaments that comprise two head-to-head HA trimers. Multivalent interactions between the two HA trimers are mediated by glycans attached to N158. The distal Sia1-Gal2-NAG3 sugar moiety of N158 interacts with the receptor binding site on the opposing HA trimer. Additional interactions are observed between NAG3 and residues K222 and K193. The H5N8 HA lacks the N158 glycosylation site and does not form the filamentous structure. However, the H5N8 HA exhibits an auto-inhibition conformation, where the receptor binding site is occupied by the glycan chain attached to residue N169 from a neighboring protomer. These structures represent native HA-glycan interactions, which may closely mimic the receptor-HA interactions on the cell surface.

The polymorphic IAV particles have a membrane envelope that encapsulates eight segmented negative RNA genomes1. IAV infects mammals as well as birds2 and replicates mainly in the host intestinal tract or upper respiratory tract3,4. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two major surface proteins of IAV. HA is responsible for receptor binding and for mediating membrane fusion during virus entry and is the major target recognized by the immune system5. NA is responsible for virion release and plays a role in initiating virus binding and entry as having been indicated by recent studies6,7,8. The molar ratio of HA and NA on the surface of the virions is estimated to be 5:29. Cross-species infection of IAV is considered the major cause of pandemic flu. Surface antigens of IAVs that infect different species are significantly different and are strong stimulators to the immune system of the newly adapted hosts10.Binding of HA to the sialic acid (SA) receptors on the host cell surface is the first step of influenza virus entry. The SA receptors are complex glycans that have an SA residue at the distal end and are covalently connected to cell surface proteins or probably lipids. For avian influenza viruses, HA prefers binding the α-2, 3 sialylated glycans in a cone-like topology. Human-adapted influenza viruses bind specifically to the long-branched α-2, 6 sialylated glycans in either the cone-like or the umbrella-like topology11,12. Complex structures of HA and the receptor analogous glycan LSTa (α-2, 3 linked lactoseries tetrasaccharide, Sia-α2, 3-Gal-β1, 3-NAG-β1, 3-Gal-β1, 4-Glc) or LSTc (α-2, 6 linked lactoseries tetrasaccharide, Sia-α2, 6-Gal-β1, 4-NAG-β1, 3-Gal-β1, 4-Glc) revealed the detailed interactions between the terminal SA and the HA receptor binding site (RBS)13. Host SA receptors are a determinant factor of influenza virus tropism. The α-2, 6 sialylated glycans recognized by human influenza A viruses are rich on the surface of the epithelial cells in the human upper respiratory tract. The α-2, 3 sialylated glycans, which are specifically recognized by the HA of avian IAV, are rich on the surface of epithelial cells in the human lower respiratory tract and are barely accessible by the viruses14. The highly pathogenic avian IAV H5N1 has only limited transmission efficiency in human hosts. However, once the mutant HA (N158D/N224K/Q226L/T318I or H110Y/T160A/Q226L/G228S) of H5N1 is adapted to bind the α-2, 6 sialylated glycans, efficient airborne transmission of H5N1 could be enabled among ferrets15,16.Binding of the HA molecule to a single sialylated glycan is weak and multivalent interactions could be critical for efficient binding and subsequent virus entry into host cells17,18. The binding mode of HA to the glycan moiety on protein or lipid is not clearly defined. In addition, the exact functions of the glycans attached to HA have not been clearly understood. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of two recombinant HAs with complex glycan moieties. For the HA from H5N1, a large portion of the HAs form filaments through glycan-mediated multivalent interactions, which may represent the multivalent binding mode of the HA to cell surface receptors. We also observed in the HA of H5N8 that the receptor binding pocket is completely blocked by the glycan moiety attached to a neighboring protomer.ResultsProduction of the glycosylated H5N1 and H5N8 HAsCompared to the H3-HA, the H5 subtype of HA (H5-HA) lacks the N165 glycosylation site on the head but contains two additional glycosylation sites at N158 and N169. The N158 glycosylation site is commonly found in H5-HAs of avian influenza viruses that emerged during 2004–200519, such as the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain, which was first isolated from a human patient in 2004 and belongs to clade 1. However, as H5 avian influenza viruses continued to evolve, the N158 glycosylation site was eventually lost in certain strains. To investigate the impact of changes in glycosylation sites on HA during the virus’s evolution, we selected the HAs of two strains for study and comparison: A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) strain, which processes the N158 glycosylation site, and A/chicken/Czech_Republic/1566-1/2021 (H5N8), a strain from clade 2.3.4.4b that lacks the N158 glycosylation site.We expressed the full-length HA of the H5N1 avian influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, H5N1) (H5N1-HA) and the ectodomain (residues 1-526) of the avian IAV H5N8-HA (A/chicken/Czech_Republic/1566-1/2021, H5N8) in fusion with a C-terminal strep tag using HEK293F cells. To better mimic the behavior of native HA, stable H5N1-HA trimers were obtained without any trimerization tags, which are frequently used for the HA ectodomain expression20. The HAs produced in HEK293F are highly glycosylated, as indicated by the smear bands of the HA0, HA1 and HA2 on the SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Most of the precursor HA0 molecules were cleaved into HA1 and HA2 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis of the H5N1-HA showed two major peaks. The earlier elution peak at 12.56 ml from the Superose-6 column has an apparent molecular weight of ~400 kDa, which corresponds to a HA pentamer or hexamer (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The later elution peak at 14.25 ml has an apparent molecular weight of ~200 kDa, which corresponds to a HA trimer (Supplementary Fig. 1a). However, SEC analysis of the H5N8-HA showed only a minor peak at 12.08 ml and a major peak at 14.73 ml from the Superose-6 column (Supplementary Fig. 1b).Structure of the full-length H5N1-HACryo-EM analysis of the SEC elution peak of the H5N1-HA at 14.25 ml showed an HA trimer structure that is similar to the reported structures21. The structures were determined at a resolution of 5.8 Å for the H5N1-HA. The extracellular domain densities agree well with the reported crystal structures of H5N1-HA (Supplementary Fig. 2a)21. The transmembrane helices of the HA are blurry (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Further cryo-EM analysis of the HA trimer in complex with the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) domain of the neutralization antibody H5M9 (FabH5M9)22 improved the reconstruction, yielding a density map of the H5N1-HA and FabH5M9 complex at a resolution of 3.6 Å (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 5a). The structural model of the H5-HA complex was built with the crystal structure of the H5N1 HA-FabH5M9 complex (PDB: 4MHH) as a reference and was refined in real space. Residues 338–346 and 521–565 of the HA were not built due to the disordered density (Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1: Structure of the full-length H5N1 HA trimer in complex with FabH5M9.a Cryo-EM density map of the H5N1 HA in complex with FabH5M9 shown in a surface-rendered representation. Densities of the glycans are colored yellow. The density map is set at a contouring level of 0.0194 e−/Å3. The flexible transmembrane domains are not resolved in the density map and are shown as a cartoon diagram. b Ribbon diagrams show the complex structure of the H5N1 HA and FabH5M9. The H5M9 Fabs are colored light yellow. One of the HA2 subunits is colored salmon, and one of the HA1 subunits is colored blue. The sugar moieties are shown in sticks with C, N and O atoms colored yellow, blue and red, respectively.Full size imageThere are 6 predicted N-glycosylation sites in the H5N1-HA, including N21, N33, N158, N169, N289 in HA1 and N483 in HA2. Densities of the glycans could be observed at all 6 predicted glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). Mass spectrum analysis of the glycans at each site showed that 21% of the N-glycosylations have sialic acid modification (Supplementary Table 2). Lectin binding ELISAs showed that the complex glycans of the HA have both the α-2, 3 linked and the α-2, 6 linked sialic acid (Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, only the N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and beta-D-mannose (BMA) in the core part of the oligosaccharide are visible in the density map due to the flexible nature and the heterogeneity of the glycans (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 5a).The glycan-mediated interactions between the H5N1 HA trimersCryo-EM analysis of the SEC peak of the H5N1-HA at 12.56 ml showed long rod-shaped particles (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Three-dimensional classifications of the particles indicated that most of the particles are filaments with two HA trimers. Similarly, to further improve the reconstruction and obtain more details on the HA filaments, we used the FabH5M9 to improve particle alignments in the EM reconstructions (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4). Three-dimensional classifications showed that the particles could be grouped into three different major conformations A, B and C (Supplementary Fig. 3). After several rounds of classifications and refinements, the reconstructions were calculated at a resolution of 3.99 Å for conformation A, 6.19 Å for conformation B and 5.71 Å for conformation C (Supplementary Fig. 4). The filaments in conformation A are symmetric, while the filaments in conformations B and C are asymmetric (Fig. 2a). Structural models of conformations B and C were built by fitting the single HA-Fab trimer model into the corresponding density maps (Fig. 2a). The symmetric HA filament contains two head-to-head HA trimers, which are arranged in D3 symmetry. The HA1 heads face each other, and the transmembrane helices of the HA trimers are located at the distal ends of the filament (Fig. 2a). In the asymmetric HA filaments, the two HA trimers are not aligned along the three-fold axis, although the HA1 heads are also in proximity to each other. One HA trimer tilts for approximately 4.9° and 56.1° away from the three-fold axis of the other HA trimer in conformations B and C, respectively (Fig. 2a). Among the filamentous particles, particles in conformation A account for 25% of the total particles, while particles in conformations B and C account for 44% and 30% of the total particles, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 2: Structure of the filamentous H5N1 HA.a Different conformations of the filamentous H5N1 HA. The density maps are set transparent. The fitted HA-FabH5M9 structures are shown in ribbons. For the ribbon structures in conformation A, one pair of the HA protomers in each filament is colored green (dark green in class 1 and light green in class 2), while other HA protomers are colored gray. In the ribbon structure of conformation B, the HA protomers with the most significant conformation change, when compared with those in conformation A, are colored orange. In the ribbon structure of conformation C, the only pair of the HA protomers with N158 glycan chain-mediated interactions is colored purple. The sequence of the N158 glycan chain is shown as a cartoon diagram on the left.

The KD value presented is the average of two independent measurements.Full size imageStructure of the symmetric H5N1-HA filamentStructural analysis of the symmetric HA filament showed that the two HA1 heads have no direct interactions (Fig. 2a). The interactions between the two HA trimers are mediated by the glycans attached to the residue N158, which is located at the top tip of the HA1 head (Fig. 2a). One HA trimer has a relative rotation of approximately 60.6° around the three-fold axis against the other HA trimer so that the six HA protomers have a zigzag arrangement, with the protruding glycans from the residues N158 directing to and binding the receptor binding grooves of the corresponding HA1s at the opposite side (Fig. 2a, b). The six glycan chains crosslinking the two trimers have a similar length of approximately 24.6 Å and are featured with a branch in the middle of the chain (Supplementary Fig. 5c). In the initial 3D classifications without symmetry imposed, densities of the six glycan chains are nearly identical (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that the six glycan chains have the same components and structure. Further classifications of the particles showed that the relative rotational positions between the two HA trimers vary in different classes (Fig. 2b). The variation in the rotation angle (from 50.3° to 64.9°) is correlated with the degree of twist in the glycan chains, indicating the flexible nature of the glycan chains (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Movie 1). The flexibility, however, is the key factor that obscures the high-resolution structure determination of the H5N1-HA filament. We, thus, split each head-to-head particle into two HA trimer particles and performed 3D classifications and refinements against the split HA trimers (Supplementary Fig. 3).The reconstruction of the split HA trimers resulted in a density map at a resolution of 3.45 Å (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 5a). Densities of the sugar moieties at the proximate and distal ends are clearly visible in the final reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 5a). However, densities of the sugar moieties located in the middle of the glycan chain are smeared, confirming the flexible nature of the sugar chains that mediate the head-to-head interactions of the two HA trimers. Based on the density map, we can build three sugar residues (NAG-Gal-Sia) at the distal end and two sugar residues (NAG-NAG) at the proximate end. By combining the mass spectrum analysis and oligosaccharide structures from the Glygen database23, the core region of the glycan chain at N158 contains 7 monosaccharides, which from the distal end to the proximate end are Sia1-α2, 3-Gal2-β1, 4-NAG3-β1, 2-Man4-α1, 3/6-BMA5-β1, 4-NAG6-β1, 4-NAG7 (Supplementary Table 2). A branch extends from BMA5 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Based on this information, we built the structure of the whole glycan chain into the density map of the symmetric H5N1-HA filament (Fig. 2a, b).The glycan chain attached to N158 in each HA monomer extends and binds the receptor binding site (RBS) of the HA at the opposite side (Fig. 2b). There are totally three pairs of glycan-RBS interactions. Similar to previous studies, binding of the glycan to the receptor binding pocket of the H5N1-HA is mainly through the distal α-2, 3 linked sialic acid and galactose moiety (Sia1-Gal2) (Fig. 2b, c). The orientation and position of the distal Sia1-Gal2 moiety in the receptor binding pocket have no significant differences when compared with those of the reported crystal structures of the receptor analog and HA complexes (Fig. 2d)24. However, the third residue NAG3 at the distal end is in a completely different direction and location, which is likely attributed to the constraints introduced by the glycan-anchored proteins (Fig. 2d). Further structural analysis showed that the side chain of K222 forms a hydrogen bond with the acetylamino group of NAG3 (Fig. 2c), which has not been observed in previous studies. To explore the physiological function of this hydrogen bond, we immobilized the biotinylated avian receptor homolog 3’-Sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (3’ SLN) onto streptavidin biosensors to mimic the anchored receptor. The interaction of HA and 3’ SLN was examined by using the biolayer interferometry (BLI) and mutagenesis studies. BLI analysis showed that 3’ SLN binds H5N1-HA with a KD of 17.8 nM (Fig. 2e). The mutation K222A significantly reduced the binding affinity of the H5N1-HA (KD: 136.0 nM), indicating that the interaction between K222 and NAG3 plays a role in the specific recognition of the receptor.Structures of the asymmetric H5N1-HA filamentsThe asymmetric H5N1-HA filaments in conformation B have only two and a half pairs of the N158 glycan chain-mediated interactions. The lack of one N158 glycan-HA interaction reduces the restraints on the HA spikes, resulting in the tilt of one HA trimer away from the site where the glycan chain is missing. The tilt angle is approximately 4.9° (Fig. 2a). Comparisons of the glycan chains showed that the one in pairing with the missing glycan chain has a more extended conformation, whereas the glycan chains of the other two pairs adopt a more bent conformation when compared with these of the glycan chains from the symmetric filament (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Structural comparisons of the glycan chains in different conformations of the filamentous HA.a Structures of the glycan chains in different conformations viewed from the top of the HA spike. The glycan chains are colored from green to purple, based on their root mean square deviations from the symmetric position as in conformation A. b Structural superimpositions of the glycan chains in different conformations. The models are superimposed based on the protomers in the HA spike at the bottom of the filament. The glycan chains and the corresponding HA protomer are colored from green to purple, based on their root mean square deviations from the symmetric position as in conformation A.Full size imageThe asymmetric H5N1-HA filaments in conformation C have only one pair of the N158 glycan chain-mediated interactions. The HA trimer has a large tilt angle of 56.1° (Fig. 2a). The two visible glycan chains have similar conformation. Compared to these in the symmetric filaments and the asymmetric filaments in conformation B, the two glycan chains have the largest bending angle.Structure comparisons of the glycan chains showed that the distal two sugar residues are fixed in the RBS, while positions of the third sugar residue vary in different glycan chains (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 5d). Except for residue K222, residue K193 could also be in close contact with the third sugar residue NAG3 (Fig. 4a). Based on structural modeling results, NAG3 can flip to establish a hydrogen bond with K193 (Fig. 4b). To confirm the possible interactions with K193, we, thus, mutated residue K193 to alanine. BLI analysis showed that K193A also significantly reduced the binding affinity of the H5N1-HA to 3’ SLN (KD: 100.2 nM) (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4: Interactions between the glycan and H5N1 HA.a Structural superimpositions of the glycans in class 1 of conformation A and the glycans at position 1 of conformation B revealing possible residues in contact with NAG3. b Ribbon and stick diagrams showing possible interactions between the glycan with K222 or K193. c BLI analysis of the interaction of 3’SLN with K193A HA. The KD value represented is the average of three independent measurements.Full size imageThe glycan-mediated interaction within the protomers of the H5N8-HAIn December 2020, the first case of human infection with avian H5N8 was reported, despite the virus having circulated in poultry and wild birds since 201625. Compared to the H5N1-HA, the HA protein of the H5N8 strain does not contain the N158 glycosylation site at the tip of the globular HA1 head (Supplementary Fig. 6). Instead, the H5N8 HA1 head contains the conserved N169 glycosylation site (Supplementary Fig. 6), which is approximately 30 Å away from the N158 site. It is unlikely that the H5N8 HA can mediate the formation of filament-like structures through head-to-head interactions. To further investigate the possible new modes of interactions between the glycans and the H5N8 HA, we prepared the H5N8 HA sample. SEC analysis of the H5N8 HA showed only a tiny peak at 12.08 ml but a dominant peak at 14.73 ml (Supplementary Fig. 1). We determined the cryo-EM structure of the H5N8 HA at a resolution of 2.8 Å using the sample prepared from the 14.73 ml peak (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). Densities of the attached glycans could be observed on 5 glycosylation sites of the H5N8 HA, including N21, N33, N169, N289 and N483. Notably, the N169-associated glycan chain from one HA protomer binds the RBS of the neighboring protomer (Fig. 5a), indicating that the recombinant H5N8 HA is in an auto-inhibition state. We also performed cryo-EM analysis on the peak at 12.08 ml, and the results showed an asymmetric association of two HA trimers, in which the two HA trimers are aligned side by side (Supplementary Fig. 9). In comparison with the projections of the model, the interactions between the two HA trimers are mainly mediated by the glycans attached to N289 of HA1 (Supplementary Fig. 9).Fig. 5: Cryo-EM structure of the H5N8 HA.a Left: A cryo-EM map of the H5N8 HA reconstruction shown in the surface-rendered representation.

The KD values represented are the average of two independent measurements.Full size imageDensities of the N169-associated glycan chain can accommodate 7 monosaccharides (Sia1-α2, 3-Gal2-β1, 4-NAG3-β1, 2-Man4-α1, 3/6-BMA5-β1, 4-NAG6-β1, 4-NAG7) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10). The glycan chain extends from N169 but turns sharply in the middle toward the receptor binding site of the nearby HA protomer. Residues constituting the receptor binding sites of the H5N8 and H5N1 HAs are highly conserved (Fig. 5b). Differences were identified at 3 positions around the receptor binding site, including positions 137, 222 and 227. These positions of the H5N1 HA are occupied by S137, K222 and S227, respectively, whereas in the H5N8 HA, these are occupied by residues A137, Q222 and R227, respectively (Fig. 5b). The Sia1-Gal2 moiety forms hydrogen bonds with Y98, V135, S136, A137, H183, E190 and Q226 in the RBS pocket, which are similar to these in other reported receptor-HA interactions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10c). However, compared with these binding the H5N1 HA, the sugar moiety in the RBS of the H5N8 HA has a rotation of approximately 16° toward the peptide fragment 135–138 with the acetyl group of Sia1 as the pivot point. Since the hydrogen bond formed between the main chain of V135 and the acetylamino group of Sia-1 is well maintained, the shift brought by the rotation pushes the peptide fragment 135–138 outward by 1.4 Å (Fig. 5c). The α-2, 3-bonded Gal2 forms two hydrogen bonds with Q226 (Fig. 5d). NAG3 rotates for approximately 60° when compared with that of the H5N1 HA (Fig. 5c). The acetyl group of NAG3 is in close proximity to residues Q222 and R227 (Fig. 5d). To verify the possible interaction with Q222 and R227, we further mutated Q222 and R227 to alanine. BLI analysis showed that neither the mutation Q222A nor R227A significantly affected the binding affinity with 3’ SLN (WT-HA KD: 17.7 nM, R227A-HA KD: 28.1 nM) (Fig. 5e), indicating that unlike K222 of the H5N1 HA, Q222 or R227 of the H5N8 HA doesn’t play a vital role in binding the receptor. Previous studies showed that the mutations K222Q and S227R in H5N8-HA could enable the binding of H5N8 HA to sialyl Lewis x26,27. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of fucosylation in H5N8 HA. However, no additional fucose density was observed near NAG3 in the map likely due to its high flexibility or low occupancy.DiscussionSialic acid modification on glycoprotein or glycolipids has been certainly identified as the receptor of the influenza virus. Glycan arrays immobilized with glycans in various structures are frequently used to investigate the binding specificity of different HAs. However, the glycans decorated on the host cell surface are complex. Until now, the exact intricate interaction between the receptor and the HA is unknown, and the structure of a protein-anchored glycan in complex with HA has not been reported.HA proteins produced in mammalian cells and virions of some subtype influenza viruses tend to aggregate, and this aggregation is related to the glycosylation of HA28. Since the complex N‐glycans produced in mammalian cells prevent the crystallization of HAs, many previous structural studies of HA employ incompletely glycosylated HAs, such as those produced in insect cells21,29,30. The complex N‐glycans produced in mammalian cells contain terminal sialic acids, while the N‐glycans produced in insect cells are simpler and mainly contain terminal mannose residues. We used the mammalian cells for HA production, which can reflect the authentic glycosylation pattern of the influenza virus receptor. The glycan-mediated interactions within the filamentous HAs may mimic the multivalent interactions between HA and receptors. It was reported that individual HA–Sia interaction is weak and dynamic31. Theoretically, multivalent binding modes, particularly symmetric ones akin to that in the conformation A of the filamentous HA, could exponentially enhance binding affinity compared to the monovalent mode18,32. The high binding affinity could allow avian IAVs to specifically recognize the few available receptors of the host cells in the human upper respiratory tract14. Evidence supporting increased binding affinity through multivalent interactions has been observed in HA-glycan interactions studied using arrays decorated with branched glycans21,33. Even for the same scaffold, the complex nature of the glycans allows different multivalent interactions, as displayed in the three conformations of the filamentous HA. A certain glycoprotein receptor in a homotrimer state has not been reported. As our study mainly captured conformational states with more than two pairs of HA-glycan interactions, we reason that glycosylated cell surface proteins in a certain oligomeric state would be the preferred carrier for the glycan receptor of the influenza virus. This finding may help to narrow down the search region for molecules that carry the glycan receptor.NA cleaves cellular sialic acid residues and enables the release of newly assembled virions. We expressed NA from Clostridium perfringens and tested whether the observed filamentous HA can be destroyed in vitro. The multivalent interaction can be disrupted under 37 °C with the ratio of 1:5 (NA:HA, by weight) as shown by SEC and band shift on SDS-PAGE gels (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The SEC elution pattern of the digested sample showed a significant decay of the oligomer HA peak compared to the control without adding NA (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Sample of the NA-treated HA also displays a significant reduction of the filamentous dimers as shown in the analysis of cryoEM microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 11c). Thus, we postulate that the observed HA and receptor interaction form will not impede virus infection or release in vivo.It was reported that the NAs of most H5N1 strains circulating in 2003–2011 have a short membrane proximate stalk structure, which results in lower enzyme activity when compared with those with a long stalk structure. The lower enzyme activity of NA causes incomplete cleavage of the distal sialic acid and self-aggregation of H5N1 virions28,34. The residual Sia on some of the HAs may help aggregate the H5N1 virions through the strong ‘triple-pair’ interactions.H5N1-HA keeps the ability to bind to avian receptors with the α-2, 3 linked sialic acid. Sequence alignments of HAs reveal that the mutation of T160 to A160 causes the lack of N158 glycosylation in H5N8-HA (Supplementary Fig. 6). This loss is characteristic of more recent and currently circulating H5 subtype viruses. However, the N169 glycosylation site remains conserved in these H5 subtype viruses (from the GISAID database, https://www.gisaid.org/). The T160A mutation in HA has been reported to enhance the avidity to α-2, 6 linked sialic acid, which is the receptor of human influenza virus35,36. In the ferret transmissible variants, the HA protein also lacks the N158 glycosylation site15,16. The loss of N158 glycosylation would eliminate the strong ‘triple-pair’ interactions of the H5N1-HA and expose the site for binding the α-2, 6 linked sialic acid.The interactions with NAG3, as observed in the filamentous H5N1 HA, indicate that additional interactions with the glycans could occur and are probably virus-strain dependent. Sequence alignments of the HAs from different IAV strains showed that residues 193 and 222 of HA1 are not conserved among different virus strains (Supplementary Fig. 6). Previous studies showed that residues 193 and 222 can interact with and help to fix the α-2, 6 Sia-Gal moiety of the human receptor37,38,39. Residue K222 of the H1N1-HA can directly interact with the Gal2 of the human receptor through a hydrogen bond (Supplementary Fig. 12). Residue S193 of the H1N1-HA is in close proximity to the sugar residue Gal4 of the human receptor (Supplementary Fig. 12)38. These results indicate that residues K193 and K222 can also interact with the α-2, 3 linked glycan chain. Given the variation at these two positions, residues 193 and 222 could render certain virus strains a higher binding affinity to a certain receptor or even affect the host tropism of the virus27,40,41,42. Structural comparisons with other HA-glycan interactions show that positions of the bound Sia1s are all similar, and residues around the bound Sia1 are highly conserved30,43,44,45 (Supplementary Fig. 13). These conserved residues include Y98, W153, H183, and L/I194. However, the positions of the bound Gal2 and NAG3 vary. Correspondingly, residues around the bound Gal2 and NAG3 vary. These varied positions mainly involve residues 136, 186, 190, 193, 222, and 226 (Supplementary Fig. 13). The variations in position and residue types could be determinants for receptor preference of different HAs. Observations in previous studies and this study imply that the RBD of HA keeps the Sia1 binding site conversed but varies the binding sites for other glycan residues to establish complex interactions with the glycan receptors.It is reported that monosaccharide-modified HA protein could induce a stronger and cross-strain protective effect than fully glycosylated HA in mice immunization46. The glycosylation of influenza vaccines can influence the immunogenicity. The RBS region of the mammalian cell expressed HA could be occupied by terminal sialic acid of its own N-glycosylation modifications. Recent recombinant HA subunit vaccines are mainly produced by eukaryotic cells, including mammalian or insect expression systems. The recombinant HA protein produced from the mammalian system carries complex N-glycosylation, and the essential antigenic region RBS could be occupied by sialic acid, which may affect the immunogenicity of recombinant HA vaccines.Surfactant protein in the upper respiratory tract can block the infection of flu virus47,48. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of surfactant protein-D (SP-D) binds to mannose-rich glycans on HA and NA with the help of Ca2+, which is an important innate immune barrier to influenza virus infection49,50,51,52. The glycosylation site N165 of the H3-HA is highly glycosylated with mannose-rich glycans, and the binding of SP-D could interfere with the receptor binding at the RBS53,54. Here we show that different from the H3-HA, the N169 site of H5N8 HA around the RBS is of complex glycans that contain α-2, 3 linked terminal sialic acids, which is consistent with previous studies55. Thus, the H5-HAs should be resistant to SP-D binding and could escape the block mediated by SP-D.Represented by H5N8 HA in this study, currently spreading H5 subtype HAs possess both N158 glycosylation deletion and conserved N169 glycosylation site. The auto-inhibition state of such HAs could destroy the epitope around the RBS, which is a key epitope recognized by neutralization antibodies. Thus, special consideration should be made for the development of recombinant subunit vaccines against the H5N8 IAV. According to GISAID statistics, the N158 glycosylation site is dominant in HAs of H5Nx avian influenza virus circulating around 2004 and in H3N2 HAs from 2013 to present19,56. The N158 glycosylation of these recombinant HA vaccines could cause the dimerization of two HA trimers and impair epitopes important for the induction of neutralization antibodies.Materials and methodsGene synthesis and cloningThe genes coding H5N1-HA (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, Group 1) (Uniprot ID: Q6DQ33), H5N1-HA head antibody H5M9 (PDB ID: 4MHH), H5N8-HA and NA (A/chicken/Czech_Republic/1566-1/2021) were synthesized by Qinglan Biotech co., Wuxi, China. The codons of the genes were optimized for mammalian expression. The H5N1-NA gene (Uniprot ID: P10481.1) was optimized for E. coli expression and was also synthesized by Qinglan Biotech Co., Wuxi, China. Genes of the full-length H5N1-HA and the ectodomain of H5N8-HA (1-526) were PCR amplified and were then cloned into the vector pCMV, which introduces a C-terminal twin-strep tag to the recombinant proteins. Genes of the antibody heavy and light chains were cloned into a specialized vector with fragments that encode a signal peptide and the human antibody constant region. The gene encoding the ectodomain of the H5N1-NA was cloned into the vector pET22b that introduces an N-terminus 6×His tag to the recombinant protein. For BLI analysis, the ectodomains of H5N1-HA and H5N8-HA, along with the T4 trimerization peptide and a flag tag, were cloned into the vector pCMV. The gene encoding the full-length H5N8-NA was cloned into the vector pCMV that introduces a C-terminus 6×His tag to the recombinant protein.Expression and purification of the H5N1-HAThe plasmids were amplified and purified using standard plasmid extraction kits (Tiangen, Inc., Beijing, China). HEK293F cells were grown in SMM 293-TI medium (Sino Biological Inc.) supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS. For one liter cell culture, 2 mg plasmids were pre-incubated with 8 mg polyethylenimine (PEI) for 20 min before being used for cell transfection. The cells were transiently transfected when the cell density reached 2.5–3 × 106/ml. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail. The resuspended cells were sonicated, and the pellet of cell membrane was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane was resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (LMNG, Anatrace). After the removal of the insoluble pellet by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and applied to Strep-Tactin beads (IBA). The beads were washed with 3 column volume of the washing buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.003% LMNG) and eluted with the washing buffer containing 5 mM D-desthiobiotin (Sigma). Concentrated elution fractions were further purified through size exclusion chromatography with a Superose-6 Increase column (Cytiva). Fractions of the peaks were collected and concentrated to approximately 0.3 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation.Expression, production and purification of FabH5M9The plasmids were prepared following the same procedure as for the H5N1-HA plasmid. For transfection, one liter of cells was transfected with 1.5 mg of heavy chain plasmid, 1.5 mg of light chain plasmid, and 12 mg of PEI. The supernatant was collected 72 h post-transfection. Following concentration and buffer exchange, the medium was loaded to Protein A Sepharose beads (Cytiva). The beads were washed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Subsequently, the antibody was eluted by using 0.1 M glycine at pH 3.5. The elution was immediately neutralized by 1 M Tris-HCl at pH 9.0.To obtain the Fab fragment of H5M9, the protease HRV3C with a GST tag was utilized to cleave the Fc part. The enzyme was removed via affinity purification using Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Cytiva). The Fc portion was then eliminated through affinity purification using Protein A Sepharose beads (Cytiva).Preparation of the H5N1-HA and FabH5M9 complexThe purified H5N1-HA and FabH5M9 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:3 (HA:Fab). After incubation at 4 °C overnight, the complex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superose-6 Increase column (Cytiva) running in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.003% (w/v) LMNG. Fractions of the HA-filament peak were collected and concentrated to approximately 0.3 mg/ml for cryo-EM sample preparation.Expression and purification of the H5N8-HA ectodomainFor 1 L cell culture, the cells at a density of 2.5–3 × 106/ml were transfected with 2 mg plasmid and 8 mg PEI. The supernatant of the cell culture was collected 72 h post-transfection and was then buffer changed to 20 mM HEPES at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The supernatant was loaded onto Strep-Tactin beads. The beads were washed with the buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.8 and 150 mM NaCl. The recombinant HA ectodomain was then eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM D-desthiobiotin.Detecting the sialic acid modification by ELISAFor this, 100 ng/well HA was coated on ELISA plates (Costar) at 4 °C overnight. The plate was blocked by 100 μl carbo-free blocking solution (Vector) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the plate was incubated with 100 μl biotinylated SNA (Vector, 1:2000 diluted in carbo-free blocking solution) or MAL II (Vector, 1:200 diluted in carbo-free blocking solution) for 1 h. Each well was washed with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) six times. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated streptavidin (Proteintech) was diluted 1:1000 in carbo-free blocking solution and incubated for 30 min (100 μl/well) followed by PBST washing. 100 μl 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Biopanda) was added to each well and incubated for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl 1 M H2SO4. The signal was recorded by spectrophotometer (BioTek) at OD450 nm.N-glycosylation of HA analyzed by mass spectrometryThe SEC eluted samples of the H5N1 HA and H5N8 HA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels. The gel bands of HA0, HA1 and HA2 were excised from the gel, reduced with 5 mM of DTT and alkylated with 11 mM iodoacetamide, which was followed by in-gel digestion with sequencing grade modified trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted twice with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile aqueous solution for 30 min and then dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were redissolved in 20 μl 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 6 μl of extracted peptides were analyzed by Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer. For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the peptides were separated by a 120 min gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.30 µl/min with a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system, which was directly interfaced with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer. The analytical column was a homemade fused silica capillary column (75 µm ID, 350 mm length) packed with C-18 resin (1.9 µm, Dr. Maisch GmbH). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using Xcalibur 4.5.445.18 software, and there was a single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap (300–1800 m/z, 60,000 resolution). The normalized higher-energy collision disassociation (HCD) fragmentation energy steps were set to 27%, 30% and 33%.The tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra from each LC-MS/MS run were searched against the influenza virus database using PMi-Byonic (Version 2.11.0). The search criteria were as follows: trypsin was chosen as the specific enzyme; two missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; the oxidation (M) was set as the variable modification; precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm for all MS acquired in an orbitrap mass analyzer; and the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 0.02 Da for all MS2 spectra. Confidence levels were set to 1% FDR (high confidence). The MS data was searched from the mammalian N-glycan library. According to the Byonic score, results with scores lower than 30 were removed.According to the glycan composition determined by Byonic, we searched for the corresponding glycan structure from the Glygen database by the composition search functionality. We selected N-glycosylation results from human samples containing α-2, 3-linked sialic acids for presentation (Supplementary Table 2).NA expression and NA cleavage assayThe NA-pET22b plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) for the production of recombinant NA. Cultivation of the cells was carried out at 37 °C until reaching an OD600 value of approximately 0.6. Subsequently, the cultivation temperature was lowered to 16 °C, and Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce expression of the recombinant protein for 17 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and lysed by sonication using a lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. The cell membrane pellet was collected by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 h at 4 °C.The membrane was then resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 2% (w/v) Dodecyl Maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Following ultra-centrifugation at 150,000×g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and applied to cobalt-charged resins (BD TALONTM). The resin was washed by the lysis buffer containing 0.02% (w/v) DDM and 20 mM imidazole. Recombinant NA was eluted from cobalt resin using the lysis buffer containing 0.02% (w/v) DDM and 300 mM imidazole. The collected elution fractions were concentrated and further purified by SEC using a Superdex 200 increase (Cytiva) column with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) DDM.As NA monomer is of lower activity, we only selected NA oligomer fractions for the following HA glycan cleavage assays. Briefly, NA was added into HA elutes with a ratio of 1:5 (NA : HA, w/w), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 h, 2 h or 4 h, respectively. The cleavage efficiency was analyzed by using SDS-PAGE gels. Compared to the control group without NA, a treatment of 4 h showed an obvious band shift.Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collectionThree-microliter aliquots of purified full-length H5N1-HA or the H5N1-HA and 4MHH_H5M9 complex, at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, were applied to glow-discharged Lacey carbon grids (TED PELLA, Cu 400 mesh). To address the preferred orientation problem57, the ectodomain of H5N8-HA was mixed with CTAB (final concentration 4 mM) before being loaded onto glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, Cu 400 mesh, R1.2/1.3). Subsequently, the grids were blotted and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher).Images of the H5N1-HA and the H5N1-HA-Fab complex were recorded using a Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit Camera. The defocus series ranged from −2 μm to −3 μm. The pixel size was 1.32 Å, and each stack was exposed for 8 s with a total dose of approximately 50 electrons per Å2. Images of the H5N8-HA ectodomain were collected using a Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV, equipped with a GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV) and a Gatan K2 Summit camera. The defocus range was from −1.5 μm to −2.5 μm, with a pixel size of 1.0742 Å. Each image was dose-fractionated into 32 movie frames with a total exposure time of 8 s and a total dose of approximately 50 electrons per Å2. Data collection was performed using SerialEM and AutoEMation258,59.H5N1-HA-Fab cryo-EM data collection and processingA total of 6096 movie stacks of the H5N1-HA-Fab complex were collected (Supplementary Table 1). The frames within each movie stack were aligned, summed, and 2× binned using MotionCor2 v1.2.660. The Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) parameters of the micrographs were determined by Gctf v1.1861. Subsequently, a total of 1,197,104 particles were picked using Gautomatch v0.56.2D classifications performed with RELION v3.162 yielded two major classes: one containing a single HA trimer, and the other with two HA trimers arranged in a filament-like structure. The particles from each class were split for independent 3D classifications in RELION v3.1 without imposing symmetry.For the single HA trimer class, 806,267 particles were used for 3D classifications, and 198,231 particles were subjected to the final 3D refinement with C3 symmetry imposed, which resulted in a map at a resolution of 3.62 Å.HA filament particles were classified into three major conformations (A, B, and C) by 3D classifications. Of these, 25% exhibited a head-to-head symmetric conformation (conformation A). Subsequent 3D classifications further divided these symmetric particles into two dominant classes, differing in relative rotations between the head-to-head HA trimers (approximately 60° in class A1 and approximately 57° in class A2). For head-to-head HAs in class A1, 38,100 particles were selected for cryoSPARC v4.4.163 non-uniform refinement with D3 symmetry imposed, resulting in a map at a resolution of 3.99 Å. For head-to-head HAs in class A2, 46,732 particles were selected for cryoSPARC non-uniform refinement with D3 symmetry imposed, resulting in a map at a resolution of 4.25 Å (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary Table 1). To analyze the flexibility of head-to-head HA trimers, symmetric filamentous particles were classified by cryoSPARC 3D classification without symmetry imposed. Five classes of symmetric HA filaments exhibiting different relative rotation angles were obtained. Further 3D variability analysis indicated that the relative rotation angle of symmetric HA filaments varied from 50.3° to 64.9°. The twisting trajectory of the HA filament was recorded as a movie using Chimera64 (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Movie 1).The filaments in conformations B and C are asymmetric. Approximately 44% of HA filament particles have one HA trimer tilting slightly relative to the other HA trimer within the filament (Conformation B). A total of 60,487 particles exhibiting this conformation were selected for cryoSPARC non-uniform refinement without symmetry imposed, resulting in a map with a resolution of 6.19 Å. Furthermore, approximately 30% of HA filament particles have one HA trimer tilting significantly relative to the other HA trimer within the filament (Conformation C). A total of 86,297 particles exhibiting this conformation were selected for cryoSPARC non-uniform refinement without symmetry imposed, resulting in a map at a resolution of 5.71 Å (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary Table 1).To improve the reconstruction of the H5N1-HA symmetric filament, we split each filament into two HA trimer particles and performed 3D classifications and cryoSPARC non-uniform refinements against the split HA trimer particles. The final refinement resulted in an improved map with a resolution of 3.45 Å (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4).H5N8-HA cryo-EM data collection and processingA total of 4057 movie stacks of the H5N8-HA were collected, and the processing procedure was the same as that for the H5N1-HA-Fab dataset. A total of 2,728,124 particles were picked by Gautomatch v0.56 and subjected to 2D classifications. Subsequently, 1,409,642 particles with clear secondary structure features were selected for several rounds of 3D classifications without imposing symmetry. Particles in 2 classes with clear structural details were selected for 3D refinements with C3 symmetry imposed. To further remove the reconstructions, particles were subjected to 3D classifications without alignment and a total of 299,040 particles were then selected for cryoSPARC non-uniform refinements with C3 symmetry imposed. The final density map was applied with a negative B-factor of 126.1 Å2, and the final resolution of the map is 2.8 Å (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). The local resolution maps were calculated by cryoSPARC v4.4.1 with a threshold of 0.143.Model building and structure refinementAtomic models of the H5N1-HA-Fab, the split H5N1-HA-Fab from the HA filaments and the H5N8-HA were built with the H5N1-HA crystal structure as references (PDB: 2FK0)21. The models were adjusted by using COOT v0.9.665 and were refined by using the PHENIX v1.1966 cryo-EM real-space refinement tool. Models of the low-resolution H5N1-HA filament reconstructions were built based on fitting the high-resolution structures into the density maps with Chimera64. The interactions between HA and receptor were analyzed by using PISA67. Detailed parameters and statistics for data collection and processing are shown in Supplementary Table 1. All structural representations were prepared by using UCSF ChimeraX v1.368.Purification of the HA ectodomains for BLI analysisThe cell transfection procedure was the same as described above. The HA ectodomain and full-length NA were transfected separately. The cell cultures were then mixed with a volume ratio of 2:1 (HA:NA) 72 h post-transfection, and the mixed cells were co-cultured for 24 h to cleave the sialic acid of the HA. The supernatant was harvested and loaded to anti-Flag resin (Genescript). The resin was washed with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6 and 150 mM NaCl. HA was eluted by 3×flag peptide and concentrated for SEC analysis. We chose the later peak that contains the single HA trimer for BLI analysis.Biolayer interferometry analysisBLI analyses were conducted at 25 °C using a ForteBio Octet Red biosensor system (ForteBio). Biotinylated 3’ SLN (GlycoNZ, 0036-BP) was immobilized onto Streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio, 18-5019) to achieve a signal of 1 nm. The sensors were washed in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 180 s to establish a baseline. Subsequently, the biosensors were immersed into wells containing various concentrations of HA and HA mutants for 250 s, followed by a 250 s dissociation step in the same buffer as the baseline step. BLI data were analyzed using Octet software (version 9.0, ForteBio) in the standard 1:1 binding mode. Data availability The atomic coordinates and EM maps have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org) and the EM Data Bank (http://www.emdataresource.org), respectively, with the accession numbers EMD-60016 (single H5N1 HA in complex with FabH5M9), EMD-60010 (conformation A class 1 of symmetric H5N1 HA filament), EMD-60011 (conformation A class 2 of symmetric H5N1 HA filament), EMD-60015 (H5N1 HA split from symmetric H5N1 HA filament), EMD-60012 (conformation B of asymmetric H5N1 HA filament), EMD-60013 (conformation C of asymmetric H5N1 HA filament), EMD-60014 (H5N8 HA bound with N169 sialylated glycan chain), 8ZDW (atomic models of H5N1 HA bound with Sia-Gal-NAG), 8ZDV (atomic models of H5N8 HA bound with Sia-Gal-NAG-Man-BMA-NAG-NAG).

Vaccination is expected to play a key role in preventing hospitalizations. CDC will update this outlook every two months throughout the season, and as warranted by substantial changes in the spread of any of the three diseases. Overview CDC expects the fall and winter respiratory disease season will likely have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season. This assessment has not changed since CDC's outlook was initially published on August 29. As of October 11, overall respiratory virus activity is low nationally. The Respiratory Illnesses Data Channel has weekly updates about current surveillance of respiratory illness. COVID-19: COVID-19 activity is declining in most areas. COVID-19-associated ED visits and hospitalizations are decreasing overall. Laboratory percent positivity is 7.7%. Epidemic trend estimates indicate that COVID-19 infections are declining or likely declining in much of the country, as of October 8. Influenza: Nationally, seasonal influenza activity remains low. As of October 8, epidemic trend estimates indicate that influenza infections are growing or likely growing in 10 states, declining or likely declining in 9 states, and not changing in 18 states. RSV: Nationally, RSV activity remains low. However, signs of increased RSV activity have been detected in the southeastern United States, including Florida, particularly in young children. This outlook is intended to provide decision-makers with information to assist in public health preparedness during the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory virus season, such as when hospitals might prepare for the highest demand. Our assessments are based on expert opinion, current and historical surveillance data, and scenario modeling for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV. As with all long-range scenarios, there is inherent uncertainty, which we describe below. Role of vaccination COVID-19 In our initial outlook, published on August 29, we outlined two potential scenarios for COVID-19 hospitalization burden to demonstrate the range of possibilities for how the season could unfold. While we lack comprehensive hospitalization data for the U.S. summer months because mandatory reporting does not resume until November, other surveillance data suggest these two scenarios (Scenarios A and B) still reflect useful bounds for the coming season. According to data from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), the summer wave peaked in the week ending August 10, with an estimated 4.8 hospitalizations per 100,000. As a result, population immunity may be lower than it would be had the summer wave of infection continued to increase or if it peaked at a higher rate. We therefore expect the upcoming season to be more similar to Scenario A, with a winter peak that is higher than the preceding summer/fall peak, similar to COVID-19 trends over the last four years. This scenario model assumes variants will emerge this winter with similar severity and transmissibility to variants that drove last winter's peak, and the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine will have similar effectiveness as last year's vaccine. Regardless of the exact trajectory, vaccination is expected to play a critical role in preventing hospitalizations due to COVID-19 this season. As of October 5, 11.2% of adults 18 years or older have received the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, and this percentage is expected to increase as the season progresses. To understand the potential impact of vaccinations, we used scenario modeling to compare scenarios for high and baseline vaccine uptake. For our baseline vaccination scenario, we used data from the first week of collection of the National Immunization Survey. As of September 7, 23.9% of adults 18 years or older report that they "definitely will" receive a vaccine this yearA—down from 28.2% during the first week of collection last season (September 30, 2023B), a 15% relative reduction. Prior modeling indicates that vaccine sentiment at the beginning of the season may be predictive of end-of season vaccine uptake.C Results indicate that if there is a similar 15% reduction in uptake relative to last year, approximately 77,000 to 98,000 hospitalizations would be averted, assuming a 50% and 75% vaccine efficacy against hospitalization, respectively. However, in our high vaccination scenario where uptake is double that of last seasonD—still lower than overall uptake for the influenza vaccine—approximately 179,000 to 227,000 hospitalizations would be averted, assuming a 50% and 75% vaccine efficacy against hospitalization, respectively. For more details on scenario modeling, see our Behind the Model. The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub's latest results showed similar potential impact of vaccination on preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations. Vaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors. In addition to protecting vaccinated individuals, maternal vaccination can help protect infants who are not age-eligible for vaccination, but still experience high rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. Influenza Vaccination is expected to play a key role in preventing influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza this season. Recent modeling by the Influenza Scenario Modeling Hub indicates that a 20% increase in influenza vaccination compared to last season could lead to a 9–11% reduction in hospitalizations due to influenza this season. During the 2023-2024 influenza season, CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented between 105,000 and 240,000 hospitalizations. A recent study in five South American countries during the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season found that the 2024 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated hospitalization among high-risk groups by 35%. While we expect influenza vaccination rates to increase as the season progresses, 19.6% of adults 18 years or older have received the 2024-25 seasonal influenza vaccine, as of October 5, up from 16.6% of adults 18 years or older who received the 2023-2024 seasonal influenza vaccine as of October 7, 2023. As of October 5, 27.5% of adults 18 years or older report that they will "definitely" receive a vaccine this year. Vaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors. RSV Immunization is expected to play a key role in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV among infants and older adults this season. As of October 5, 36.9% of adults 75 years or older have ever received the RSV vaccine since it was first available last season, while an additional 13.9% indicate that they definitely will receive the RSV vaccine this year. Vaccination coverage and sentiment vary by jurisdiction, age, race and ethnicity, poverty status, health insurance and other social and demographic factors. Despite last year being the first year for RSV immunization products, more than half of eligible infants were protected against RSV by maternal vaccination or receipt of the RSV antibody nirsevimab, according to a CDC survey. Early estimates of nirsevimab effectiveness indicated that nirsevimab was 90% effective against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants. As of September 2024, among females with an infant born since April 1, 52.7% reported that they will definitely get nirsevimab for their infant. Factors, Key Uncertainties, & Methods Factors that could lead to higher peak hospitalization rate While we expect this season's peak hospitalization rate will be similar to or lower than last year, there is still a risk of a higher peak rate, underscoring the need to consider this possibility in planning and preparedness activities. The following factors could drive higher peak rate: Emergence of a new COVID-19 variant with an increased ability to evade the body's prior immunity, or a new COVID-19 variant associated with higher clinical severity. Predominance of an influenza subtype with more severe outcomes. Lower vaccine uptake or effectiveness, including: If there is lower than projected uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, influenza seasonal vaccine, or RSV vaccines and immunizations. If the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than that of the 2023-2024 vaccine. If influenza seasonal vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization is lower than projected. Key Uncertainties This outlook is a high-level assessment intended to provide scenarios for how the 2024-2025 respiratory season could unfold; it is not a precise forecast. We have noted several areas of uncertainty for specific diseases in sections above, including related to vaccination and circulating viral variants and subtypes. Additional uncertainties include the following: It is difficult to predict the size and timing of peak activity for each disease, as well as how the timing might overlap. Experts agree that some level of overlap in peak hospitalization burden may occur. These factors will affect the level of demand on the healthcare system. We note that while peak hospitalization rate is a key factor, cumulative burden can also impact hospital demand throughout the season. The virus that causes COVID-19 is constantly changing, and a new variant could emerge that is less effectively mitigated by immunity from past infections or from existing vaccines and treatments. COVID-19 occurs at meaningful levels throughout the year with periodic epidemics, which can vary in timing and magnitude. Avian influenza A (H5N1) is widespread in wild birds globally and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases in U.S. dairy and poultry workers. The current risk to the general public posed by the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus presently spreading in cows, poultry, and other mammals remains low. Particularly for RSV, estimates are less precise for the burden of illnesses and hospitalizations in past seasons which limits our ability to anticipate trends for this respiratory season. Immunization uptake is also less certain because RSV immunization for older adults, for pregnant people, and for infants and young children were recommended last year for the first time. Methods The outlook and this update are based on expert opinion, current and historical surveillance data, and scenario modeling for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV.

Here we present a group of short questions and answers that explains what participatory surveillance is, why the ongoing study of influenza is so important, how participatory surveillance has many advantages, and how this new publication supports setting up and conducting participatory surveillance.What is participatory surveillance?Participatory surveillance is an approach for gathering information from the community to monitor trends. Proactively engaging members of the community to regularly report on health events has been an approach adopted in many countries for different public health objectives. It complements other sources of surveillance information, such as from health care facilities and vital statistics.Why is the study of health and disease conditions, including of influenza, so important? Knowing factors of health and disease conditions such as the distribution (who, when and where), patterns, and determinants (health risks) in a specific population (which is known as epidemiology) is a foundation for public health. Studying the epidemiology of a disease such as influenza is particularly important to detect any usual trends that might signal a change in the circulating influenza viruses or the emergence of an influenza virus from animals that begins to infect people. Using surveillance to understand the epidemiology of influenza provides evidence to shape policy and take preventative measures, while also helping to inform other important public health issues. Health facility-based surveillance is the cornerstone of influenza surveillance as this approach allows for monitoring trends at varying levels of the disease pyramid (mild to severe) and allows for quality testing and characterization of viruses, as well as fulfilling many other influenza surveillance objectives.What are the advantages of participatory surveillance for influenza and influenza-like illness?Traditional influenza surveillance at health facilities relies on symptomatic people seeing a healthcare provider. Participatory surveillance is complementary to traditional health facility-based surveillance because surveillance information comes from both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, and from symptomatic individuals who may not initially seek health care. Information may also come from members of the population who may be underrepresented in traditional facility-based surveillance. Where participatory surveillance for influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) has been implemented experience indicates that such systems are accurate, flexible, cost-effective and robust with regard to changes in health care seeking behaviour. However, there are also a number of limitations, challenges and biases that must be taken into consideration. How does this publication support putting into practice participatory surveillance?This WHO document provides globally applicable guidance on implementing participatory surveillance for influenza and ILI based on expert input and abundant experience from countries in which such surveillance has been implemented. The document sets out best practices for public health officials to consider, either when looking to implement a participatory surveillance system or when making changes to an existing system.The publication can be found here: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240095038Look out for translations in other WHO languages… Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHOStudy shows vaccine uptake disparities among Black, White Americans | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

Looking at the Cleveland metropolitan area, the researchers analyzed 341,029 patients who were diagnosed as having acute respiratory infections at University Hospitals of Cleveland between October 2023 and April 2024. More ED visits in low-income neighborhoods Black patients were overrepresented as 37% of the patient population, despite making up 14% of Cleveland’s population. Researchers found lower vaccination rates in areas with higher social vulnerability and in predominantly Black neighborhoods but higher emergency department (ED) visits for acute respiratory infections in those areas. The study’s findings maintain that neighborhood factors and race are significantly associated with vaccination status against common respiratory viruses"Even when controlling for demographic factors, household income, health insurance coverage and geographic location, the study’s findings maintain that neighborhood factors and race are significantly associated with vaccination status against common respiratory viruses," said Elie Saade, MD, medical director of infection control and quality at University Hospitals of Cleveland, in the news release. "Disparities this vast are not to be overlooked—they require multifaceted interventions that meet people where they are socially and increase access to essential preventive measures." CDC confirms recent cases in California dairy workers as virus strikes 15 more farms News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 5 suspected H5 avian flu cases in California dairy workers, according to updated tables from the CDC and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). California now has 11 H5 cases in dairy workers. U. J. Alexander / iStock So far this year, 25 human H5 cases have been reported in the United States, all but 1 involving exposure to infected cows or poultry.Dairy workers in California continue to face a daunting threat from ongoing spread of the virus in the state’s dairy cows. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 15 more outbreaks in California dairy herds, bringing the state’s total to 120 and the national total to 320 across 14 states.USDA confirms outbreaks in Utah and Washington poultry flocksIn other avian flu developments, APHIS today confirmed an outbreak at a commercial poultry farm reported by Utah earlier this week. The facility in Cache County is a layer farm that has 1.8 million birds.Also, the agency confirmed an outbreak at a layer farm in Washington, which involves a facility in Franklin County that has nearly 840,000 birds. The event marks Washington’s first outbreak in poultry since December 2023. Study highlights demographic, socioeconomic disparities in C difficile infection News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile A study conducted at a California hospital found that people considered highly socially vulnerable were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with severe Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and die from it than less vulnerable people, researchers reported yesterday at IDWeek 2024.The study by researchers at Loma Linda University Medical Center included 206 adults admitted for CDI, which causes diarrhea and colitis, from January 2020 to June 2021. To assess the impact of external factors on CDI severity, and mortality, the researchers used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a composite measure of communities based on four major themes: socioeconomic status, housing characteristics, race/ethnicity status, and housing and transportation. Patients in the study with an SVI score of less than 0.5 were considered low vulnerability, while people above 0.5 were considered highly vulnerable. Large disparities across all SVI themesThe analysis found that high vulnerability scores across all four SVI themes were associated with increased CDI severity and mortality. Patients with high vulnerability scores in socioeconomic status and housing characteristics were three times more likely to have severe CDI than those with low vulnerability scores, while patients with high vulnerability scores for housing and transportation—including those living in multiunit structures, mobile homes, group quarters, and lacking a vehicle—were more than twice as likely to have severe CDI compared with people with low scores.When considering race/ethnicity status, patients with high vulnerability scores were 37 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe CDI and nine times more likely to die than those with low scores.“We need to conduct further research to gain a deeper understanding of the correlations between C. diff severity and mortality, race and environmental and socioeconomic factors,” Timothy Afable, PharmD, pharmacy resident at Loma Linda University and presenting author, said in an IDWeek press release. “This study is only a starting point to a broader understanding of health equity and the potential vulnerabilities patients with C. diff face.” ALL BRIEFS In case you missed it Previous Next Last patient discharged from treatment in Rwanda’s Marburg outbreak Mpox plateaus in a DR Congo hot spot, rises in other African nations Arkansas, Montana report CWD infections in deer, elk Africa CDC launches trial of smallpox drug for mpox CDC reports slight flu rise in children, first kid's flu death of season CDC tracks rise in pertussis activity Quick takes: Polio in 7 countries, lab monkey escape, pneumonic tularemia in Colorado Surveillance turns up 18 previously undetected cases of tick-borne Yezo virus in China This week's top reads Recent COVID-19 vaccination tied to lower risk of long COVID Overall, the risk of developing 28 out of 36 long-COVID symptoms lessened when vaccines were effective.

A promising strategy is to induce T-cell responses against internal proteins conserved across influenza strains. In this study, pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs were immunized by aerosol using viral vectored vaccines (ChAdOx2 and MVA) expressing matrix (M1) and nucleoprotein (NP). Following H3N2 challenge, all immunizations (M1, NP or NPM1) reduced lung pathology, but M1 alone offered the greatest protection. NP or NPM1 immunization induced both T-cell and antibody responses. M1 immunization generated no detectable antibodies but elicited M1-specific T-cell responses, suggesting T cell-mediated protection. Additionally, a single aerosol immunization with the ChAdOx vaccine encoding M1, NP and neuraminidase reduced lung pathology. These findings provide insights into BPIV development using a relevant large natural host, the pig.

An alternative approach is to target conserved antigens that induce CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, providing the basis for a broadly protective influenza vaccine (BPIV). Furthermore, although seasonal influenza vaccines are administered parenterally, administration of vaccines to the respiratory tract is a powerful route to control respiratory pathogens and has been shown to be highly effective in inducing broad protection1,2,3,4,5. The presence of protective immune responses in the lung is particularly important as severe influenza is due to lung infection, and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have tropism for the lower respiratory tract.The protective role of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in humans has been demonstrated in experimental influenza challenge studies6,7. Community cohort studies have further confirmed the association between T-cell responses against conserved internal proteins particularly polymerase binding protein 1 (PB1), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix 1 (M1) and reduced viral shedding and severity of disease8,9. Since most individuals have been repeatedly exposed to influenza viruses, they already have T-cell responses to the conserved influenza core proteins and therefore, immunization strategies aiming to boost these T-cell immune responses might be highly beneficial10. Immunization by both the replication deficient chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx and the replication deficient modified vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine (MVA) can boost M1- and NP-specific T-cell responses as demonstrated in clinical trials with young and older adults11. The inclusion of neuraminidase (NA) in the vaccines can further provide more robust and broad protection as although NA sequences do evolve over time, this occurs more slowly than for hemagglutinin (HA)12,13 and immunization with recombinant NA protein has been shown to induce protective immunity in different animal models, especially when the antigen is given mucosally14,15,16,17,18,19.We have previously demonstrated that the viral vectored vaccines ChAdOx2 and MVA expressing NP, M1 and NA2 are highly protective in pigs20. Pigs are a relevant natural large animal model to study immunity to influenza3,21,22,23. They have many genetic, physiological, anatomical and immunological similarities to humans and are infected by similar subtypes of influenza viruses in particular H1N1pdm09 (pH1N1)23,24,25,26,27. We used pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs to mimic the situation in humans who are repeatedly exposed to numerous influenza viruses and immunized them sequentially by aerosol with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 in order to reach the whole respiratory tract20. Immunization abolished viral shedding and lung pathology following H3N2 virus challenge. However, as the NA2 was matched to the challenge H3N2 virus we were not able to determine the contribution of the T-cell and antibody responses in protection, nor could the contribution of the individual antigens be assessed. Here we explored whether a single immunization with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 would provide protection in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs, a more easily deployable strategy in clinical practice. Additionally, we investigated whether both NP and M1 antigens are required for the observed protective effect.ResultsImmunogenicity and efficacy of single aerosol immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsFollowing the demonstration of the protective efficacy of heterologous prime-boost immunization with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA220, we next investigated whether a single ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 aerosol immunization would provide protection. Twelve pigs were inoculated intranasally with pH1N1, and viral shedding assayed by plaque assay, confirming the infection of all 12 animals (Supplementary Fig. 1). Twenty-four days after the pH1N1 exposure, pigs were randomly divided into two groups of six pigs. One group were immunized by aerosol (AE) with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 using a vibrating mesh nebulizer and the second group were unimmunized controls. Four weeks later all pigs were infected intranasally with H3N2, daily nasal swabs were collected to investigate viral shedding and 4 days later the animals were humanely euthanized (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Experimental design, viral shedding and lung pathology following single-dose aerosol immunization with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2.a Twelve pigs were infected with pH1N1 and 24 days later one group of six pigs were immunized with ChAdOx-NPM1-NA2 by aerosol (AE). After 28 days they were infected with H3N2 and after 4 days were culled. Control (C) animals were infected but not immunized. b Virus load within the upper respiratory tract was determined by plaque assay in daily nasal swabs post H3N2 infection (D1–D4). c Representative lung gross pathology, histopathology (H&E staining) and immunohistochemical (IHC) NP staining of each group. Gross pathology is observed as areas of consolidation (arrows). Bronchiolo- and broncho-interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates in the airways and parenchyma are observed with higher severity in the control group. Virus NP is detected by IHC (brown stain, arrows) within the bronchiolar wall and luminae and occasionally within the parenchyma. d Gross lesion scores, e percentage of lung surface with lesions using image analysis, f histopathology and g IHC NP scores (“Iowa”) are shown. The top of each bar indicates the mean and the line the SEM. Each symbol represents one animal. Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed (b) or with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (d–g). Bar = 100 µm.Full size imageThe immunized animals showed a reduction in H3N2 viral shedding in daily nasal swabs at days 2 and 3 post challenge, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.058 and p = 0.099, respectively) (Fig. 1b). No virus was detected in the BAL and lung of either group (data not shown). Representative lung gross pathology, histopathology and immunohistochemical NP staining are shown in Fig. 1c. Gross pathology was observed as areas of consolidation mostly affecting the cranial and medial lobes28. No significant difference in gross lung pathology was found between the immunized and control groups, although the percentage of lung lesion calculated with image analysis of the dorsal and ventral views of the lungs showed a significantly higher score in the control compared to the aerosol group (Fig. 1d, e). The histopathological analysis revealed significantly higher scores in the control than the aerosol immunized animals (Fig. 1f). Labeling of influenza NP by immunohistochemistry (NP-IHC) was observed in the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelia, cell debris and inflammatory cells within the airways luminae and occasional inflammatory cells within the lung parenchyma (Fig. 1c). The NP-IHC staining was significantly higher in the control group in comparison to the immunized group, as evaluated within the “Iowa” scoring system29 (Fig. 1g)We also assessed antibody and T-cell responses. Circulating (serum) virus-specific IgG against pH1N1, H3N2 and recombinant NA2 from H3N2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) and local (BAL) virus-specific IgG and IgA against pH1N1 and H3N2 (Supplementary Fig. 2d–g) were measured by ELISA. The immunized animals showed higher IgG responses in serum against pH1N1, H3N2 and recNA2 post vaccination compared to the control group, although statistical significance was not reached (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Similarly, no significant differences were observed in BAL antibody responses between immunized and control animals, although a trend for higher titers of IgG H1N1, H3N2 and IgA H3N2 was detected in the aerosol group. The IFNγ response following H3N2 challenge was evaluated by ELISpot in BAL (Supplementary Fig. 2h–l). A trend for higher number of IFNγ producing cells following stimulation with M1 (p = 0.06) and pH1N1 (p = 0.07) was observed in the immunized animals compared to controls, but this did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. 2i, k).Taken together these data suggest that a single aerosol administration of ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 significantly reduced the area of lung lesions and lung inflammation assessed by histopathology with a trend toward reduced viral shedding at days 2 and 3. This was correlated with increased antibody and T-cell responses in the immunized animals, although the changes were not statistically significant. Since we know that only 30% of the aerosol dose is deposited in the pig30, it may be that a single immunization with a higher dose would improve protection to the level achieved by prime boosting.Generation of single antigen vaccines and immunogenicity in miceTo determine the contribution of NP and M1 antigens for the induction of protective immune responses we generated ChAdOx2 and MVA vectored vaccines expressing NP only, M1 only or an NPM1 fusion protein and tested their immunogenicity in mice. Mice were immunized either intramuscularly (IM) or intranasally (IN) to stimulate intrapulmonary response as observed with aerosol immunization in pigs. Mice were vaccinated with 108 IU of ChAdOx-NP or ChAdOx-M1 or ChAdOx-NPM1 and after 4 weeks boosted with 106 PFU MVA-NP, MVA-M1 or MVA-NPM1 using the same antigen and route. Mice were culled 4 weeks later. IFNγ ELISpot responses were measure in fresh splenocytes following stimulation with NP (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and M1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) pools of overlapping peptides covering the NP and M1 proteins included in the vaccines. The frequencies of CD4+ and CD8 + IFNγ/TNF double secreting cells in fresh splenocytes and lung cells were also measured by intracellular cytokine staining after NP (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d, g) and M1 (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f, h) stimulation. The gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a.Intramuscular immunization induced higher splenic immune responses compared to intranasal immunization, although this was significant only for the M1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b, e, f) and NPM1 groups (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c, d). Significant reduction in M1-specific responses were detected in NPM1 immunized animals compared to M1 group (Supplementary Fig. 3b, f). No differences in responses were detected between NP and NPM1 immunization following NP stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3a, c, d).Lung immune responses following intranasal immunizations resulted in CD8+ IFNγ TNF producing cells specific to NP and M1 antigens (Supplementary Fig. 3h), which were also tissue resident memory cells as defined by their CD103 and CD69 expression (Supplementary Figs. 3i and 4b). M1-specific responses were significantly reduced in the NPM1 group compared to M1 (Supplementary Fig. 3h) while no differences in NP-specific responses between NP and NPM1 immunized animals were observed.These data indicate that the ChAdOx2 and MVA vaccines were immunogenic in mice, inducing both systemic and local lung CD4+ and CD8+ cytokine producing cells.Protection following prime-boost immunization with single NP, single M1 and NPM1 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsWe next wished to determine the contribution of NP and M1 antigens in the induction of protective immune responses, in the pre-exposed pig model. Twenty-four pigs were infected with pH1N1 and as with the previous study, nasal shedding was detected in all animals confirming successful infection (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Four weeks later, the animals were randomly divided into four groups of six pigs and immunized by aerosol using a vibrating mesh nebulizer with either ChAdOx2-NPM1, ChAdOx2-NP or ChAdOx2-M1. Six pH1N1-exposed but unimmunized pigs were used as controls. Four weeks later, the three immunized groups were boosted by aerosol with an MVA vaccine including the same antigens NPM1, NP or M1 as in the first ChAdOx2 immunization. Four weeks after the MVA boost all pigs were infected intranasally with H3N2. Animals were humanely culled 4 days later, and tissues collected for virological, pathological, and immunological analyses (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Experimental design, viral shedding and lung pathology following prime-boost immunizations with NP, M1 and NPM1 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs.a Twenty-four pigs were infected with pH1N1 and 4 weeks later groups of six pigs were immunized by aerosol with ChAdOx-NP, ChAdOx-M1 or ChAdOx-NPM1. After further 4 weeks they were boosted by aerosol with MVA including the same antigens. Four weeks after the MVA boost all pigs were infected with H3N2 virus and after 4 days pigs were culled. Control (C) animals were infected but not immunized. b Virus load within the upper respiratory tract was determined by plaque assay in daily nasal swabs post H3N2 infection (D1–D4). Significant differences in nasal shedding determined by the area under the curve (AUC). c Representative lung gross pathology, histopathology (H&E staining) and immunohistochemical (IHC) NP staining of each group. Gross pathology is observed as areas of consolidation (arrows). Bronchiolo- and broncho-interstitial pneumonia with necrosis of epithelial cells and inflammatory infiltrates in the airways and parenchyma are observed with higher severity in the control group. Virus NP is detected by IHC (brown stain) within the bronchiolar wall and luminae and occasionally within the parenchyma. d Gross lesion scores, e percentage of lung surface with lesions using image analysis, f histopathology and g IHC NP scores (“Iowa”) are shown. The top of each bar indicates the mean and the line the SEM. Each symbol (circle, square, diamond and triangle) represents one animal. Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed (b, d–g). Bar = 100 µm.Full size imageViral shedding was analyzed in nasal swabs by plaque assay (Fig. 2b). There was a significant decrease in viral shedding post H3N2 infection in the M1 and NPM1 immunized animals as assessed by the area under the curve. As in the previous experiment, no virus was detected in BAL and lungs, most likely because the virus was too diluted following the washing of the lungs.The control group showed significant gross and histopathological lesions as well as NP-IHC staining within the airway epithelium and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the airways and parenchyma (Fig. 2c). The immunized groups showed lower gross pathology score, with statistical significance for the NP and M1 groups (Fig. 2d, e). However, there was a significant reduction of histopathological scores for all the immunized groups compared to the controls, including the “Iowa” score which considers NP staining, with the M1 group showing the lowest scores29,31 (Fig. 2f, g). These results indicate that immunization with either NP or M1 is sufficient to reduce lung pathology and viral shedding following heterologous H3N2 virus challenge in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs and that there is no benefit in including both NPM1 antigens. In all measures of lung involvement M1 alone showed the greatest reduction compared to controls but there was no statistically significant difference between M1, NP and NPM1 immunized animals.Antibody responses following prime-boost immunization with single NP, single M1 and NPM1 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsSerum IgG against pH1N1, H3N2 and recombinant NP (Fig. 3a–c) and BAL virus-specific IgG and IgA against pH1N1 and H3N2 (Fig. 3d–g) were measured by ELISA. The NP immunized group had significantly higher serum pH1N1, H3N2 and NP IgG titers after the MVA boost in comparison to the control and M1 groups (Table 1 and Fig. 3a–c). Similarly, NPM1 immunization induced higher pH1N1, H3N2 and NP IgG titers compared to control and M1 groups (Table 1). M1 immunization did not boost antibody responses, which were comparable to those in the pH1N1 pre-exposed unimmunized control group. In BAL (Fig. 3d–g), NP immunization induced significantly greater IgG-pH1N1, IgG-H3N2 and IgA-H3N2 titers than M1 and control groups. Antibody titers in NPM1 immunized group, although higher than the control and M1 groups, were not statistically significantly different. No differences in pH1N1-specific IgA responses were detected between the groups.Fig. 3: Antibody responses following prime-boost immunization with NP, M1 and NPM1 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs.a pH1N1, b H3N2 and c NP-specific IgG responses in serum were determined by ELISA at the indicated time points. d pH1N1, e H3N2-specific IgG and f pH1N1 and g H3N2 IgA responses in BAL, were determined by ELISA 4 days after H3N2 challenge. The mean and standard error (SEM) is presented in each time point (a–g). The arrows below D0, D28, D56 and D83 indicate the time of pH1N1 challenge, ChadOx immunizations, MVA boost and H3N2 challenge respectively. Significant differences in antibody responses in serum are listed in Table 1. The top of each bar indicates the mean, and the line indicates the standard error mean (SEM). Each symbol (circle, square, diamond and triangle) represents one animal. Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test when the data were normally distributed (a–c, e) or with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (d, f, g).Full size imageTable 1 Significant differences in ELISA and ELISpot responses between NP, M1, NP/M1 and control groups at different time points after immunizationFull size tableIn summary, NP immunization boosted both serum and BAL antibody responses, while NPM1 boosted only the serum responses. M1 immunization did not boost virus- or M1-specific antibody response, suggesting that the antibody responses in the NPM1 immunized animals are due to the NP component.T-cell responses following prime-boost immunization with single NP, single M1 and NPM1 in pH1N1 pre-exposed pigsIFNγ ELISpot analysis was performed to quantify IFNγ producing cells in PBMC (Fig. 4a–d) and BAL (Fig. 4f–h) following stimulation with either pH1N1 and H3N2 live viruses or with pools of overlapping peptides covering the NP and M1 proteins included in the vaccines. M1 immunization significantly increased the M1-specific IFNγ responses 1 week after the prime with ChAdOx2-M1 and 1 week after the MVA-M1 boost (Fig. 4b and Table 1). NP-specific responses were significantly greater in the NP immunized animals 1 week after the boost (Fig. 4a), but not in the NPM1 group. On the last day of the study (D87), the NP immunized group exhibited the highest pH1N1, H3N2- and NP-specific IFNγ response of all the groups (Fig. 4a, c, d and Table 1).Fig. 4: IFNγ ELISpot responses in PBMC and BAL after immunization with NP, M1 and NPM1.IFNγ secreting spot forming cells (SFC) in blood (a–e) and BAL (e–h) were enumerated following stimulation with a pool of peptides covering NP (a, f) and M1 (b, g) proteins or pH1N1 (c, g) and H3N2 (d, h) viruses. The red arrows indicate the time of pH1N1 challenge, immunizations with ChAdOx and MVA, and H3N2 challenge. Significant differences are listed in Table 1. Each symbol (circle, square, diamond and triangle) represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Asterisks denote significance between indicated groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01) and were analyzed either by one-way ANOVA (a–d) and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test (g) when the data were normally distributed or with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved (e, f).Full size imageAs in blood, the NP-specific IFNγ responses in the BAL were significantly higher in the NP immunized group compared to the control and M1 groups (Fig. 4e). M1 immunization induced the highest M1-specific IFNγ response compared to control and NP groups (Fig. 4f). Following pH1N1 stimulation all immunized groups exhibited a significantly higher number of IFNγ producing BAL cells than the control (Fig. 4g), while H3N2-specific cells were significantly greater in the NPM1, and NP immunized groups compared to control (Fig. 4h). ChAdOx2 immunization did not significantly boost blood antibody or T-cell responses after pH1N1 pre-exposure (Figs. 3a–c and 4a–d). However, our previous studies have shown a strong boosting effect of ChAdOx2-NP/M1-NA2 and ChAdOx2-NP/M1-NA2 /MVA-NP/M1-NA2 in the BAL20,32 so that it is likely that respiratory tract immune responses are increased by the aerosol immunization used in the present study. We did not assess this, because it would have necessitated culling additional animals prior to influenza challenge.However, BAL T-cell responses after H3N2 challenge were analyzed by ICS, to assess IFNγ and TNF production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5). NPM1 immunization induced the highest frequencies of pH1N1 and H3N2-specific IFNγ producing CD4+ cells, which were significantly higher than the single M1 group. NP-specific CD4+ TNF and CD4+ IFNγ producing cells were highest in the NP immunized group, while M1-specific TNF and IFNγ producing CD4+ responses were highest in the M1 immunized group (Fig. 5a, b).Fig. 5: T-cell cytokine responses in BAL.BAL was collected 4 weeks after the MVA-NP, M1 or NPM1 immunization. Cryopreserved cells from D83 were thawed, stimulated with pH1N1, H3N2, NP and M1 and total IFNγ and TNF cytokine secretion was measured in CD4 (a, b) and CD8 (c, d) T cells by intracellular cytokine staining. Each symbol represents an individual animal, the top of the bar the mean and the line the standard error (SEM). Two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test were used to compare responses between groups and asterisks indicate significant differences (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). Representative FACs profiles showing IFNγ and TNF cytokine secretion by CD4 and CD8 cells as determined by intracytoplasmic staining (e). BAL cells from NP and NPM1 immunized animals were stimulated with NP peptides. BAL cells from M1 immunized animals were stimulated with M1 peptides.Full size imageAll immunizations induced much higher frequencies of cytokine producing CD8+ T cells in BAL compared to CD4+ T cells. IFNγ production following pH1N1 or NP stimulation was significantly greater in the NPM1 and NP groups compared to unimmunized controls (Fig. 5c). NP immunization also induced significantly higher H3N2-specific IFNγ response compared to controls (Fig. 5c). M1 immunized animals made IFNγ and TNF producing CD8+ cells following M1 stimulation, but these did not differ significantly from the pH1N pre-exposed animals (Fig. 5e).In summary, ICS and ELISpot data suggest that NP, M1 and NPM1 immunization induced strong IFNγ pH1N1 and H3N2 virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses within the lung. Strong NP- and M1-specific IFNγ responses were detected by ELISpot and both peptide specific TNF and IFNγ responses were detected by ICS. NP induced a strong CD8+ response following NP stimulation, while M1 induced more balanced CD4+ and CD8+ responses following M1 stimulation.Correlations between immune parameters and virological/pathological measuresCorrelations were assessed between sixteen immune parameters related to NP and M1 and five virological or pathological measures (H3N2 nasal shedding, gross pathology (Halbur), percentage lung involvement, gross pathology (Morgan) and NP staining (IHC)) using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) calculated from data for all pigs.The percentage of M1-specific TNF-secreting CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated with all five virological/pathological measures (−0.74 < ρ < −0.45), while the percentage of M1-specific IFNγ secreting CD8+ T cells and the M1 ELISpot response in BAL were both negatively correlated with four out of five measures (−0.68 < ρ < −0.52 and −0.56 < ρ < −0.43, respectively) (Fig. 6). In addition, the NP ELISpot response in PBMCs at D63, the NP ELISpot response in BAL, the percentage of M1-specific IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T cells and the percentage of NP-specific TNF-secreting CD4+ T cells were all negatively correlated with at least one virological or pathological measure, using data for all four treatment groups (i.e. controls, single M1, single NP and NPM1 immunized pigs) (Fig. 6). Scatter plots for the strongest correlations in Fig. 6 are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 7.Fig. 6: Correlations between immune parameters and virological or pathological measures.The plot shows Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ; indicated by the scale bar) between each immune parameter (row) and virological or pathological measure (column) using data for all four treatment groups (i.e. controls, single M1, single NP and NPM1 immunized pigs). Asterisks indicate correlation coefficients significantly different from zero (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).Full size imageThese negative correlations indicate that higher values of the immune parameter are correlated with lower values of the virological/pathological measure, suggesting a correlation with protection. Although there was no correlation with the NP-specific IgG titers in blood, it is still possible that both systemic and mucosal NP antibody responses may contribute to protection through Fc mediated functions.DiscussionThe development of BPIV will obviate the need to update seasonal influenza vaccines annually and would provide protection against novel epidemic and pandemic influenza virus strains. Several approaches have focused on the hemagglutinin (HA), including attempts to immunize against conserved epitopes of the HA stem and immunization against multiple HA variants33,34,35,36. More recently it has been recognized that induction of antibodies against the neuraminidase (NA) may be a useful strategy as this molecule is much less variable than HA12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. In this study, we explored a different strategy, the induction of T cell-mediated responses against conserved internal proteins of influenza, as well as investigating whether a vaccine combining internal proteins and NA, but not HA, is effective.Using pH1N1 pre-exposed pigs we show that single-dose aerosol immunization with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 significantly reduces lung pathology following H3N2 challenge. There was a trend toward reduced viral shedding which was correlated with increased antibody and T-cell immune responses. Although the reduction in viral shedding and lung pathology was less impressive than that the complete abrogation of viral shedding and lung pathology seen with prime-boost immunizations with ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA220, it is conceivable that it might prevent severe and life-threatening disease in humans. Because the vaccine contained the same NA as in the challenge H3N2 virus the mechanism of protection in this study remains unclear. However, the results suggest that this combined internal proteins plus neuraminidase strategy merits further study. Additional investigations will be required to establish if two aerosol doses of ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2, a more easily deployable regimen will provide protection comparable to the heterologous prime-boost regime of ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 and MVA-NPM1-NA2, or whether dose optimization could increase protection after a single dose. An adenoviral vectored vaccine against SARS CoV-2 administered by aerosol has been widely used in China37,38,39. Additionally, aerosol delivery has been utilized for a measles vaccine in Mexico and India40,41.We further evaluated the contribution of NP and M1 in protection in a vaccine containing only internal proteins and were not able to find clear benefits in using both antigens. Although immunization with either NP, M1 or NPM1 provided protection, M1 on its own induced a significant reduction of gross pathology, area of lung involvement, histopathology, and staining for NP within the lung compared to unimmunized controls. M1 immunization did not generate antibody responses but induced both CD4+ and CD8+ M1-specific T-cell responses which correlated with reduced lung pathology or viral load. The lack of detectable antibody response in M1 immunized pigs and the substantial genetic and antigenic differences between the pre-exposure pH1N1 and the challenge H3N2 viruses indicate that the observed protection is likely mediated by mechanisms other than antibodies, almost certainly the T-cell responses detected. In contrast, although NP immunization induced both non-neutralizing antibody responses and T-cell responses, this did not translate into better protection compared to M1. Although NP-induced reduction in lung pathology correlated with stronger T-cell responses (Fig. 6), it is still possible that Fc mediated systemic or mucosal NP antibody functions, which we did not measure, contributed to protection42. In our pig model most likely the pH1N1 pre-exposure induces a local lung response which was further boosted by the aerosol delivery of the vaccines with the resulting lung response sufficient to inhibit viral shedding and pathology. It will be important to confirm the role of the lung mucosal response and whether similar protection could be achieved following parenteral/intramuscular administration of NP, M1 and NPM1 vaccines to pre-exposed animals.As most humans are repeatedly exposed to influenza viruses which induce significant local mucosal T-cell and antibody responses, boosting these by immunization of the respiratory tract would be highly beneficial, especially as these responses tend to wane rapidly after natural infection9. However, strain-specific T-cell responses have been observed in children up to 1 year after live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination43 and influenza-specific lung tissue resident memory cells have been detected in older adults44 as well as antigen-specific memory T cells in the blood up to 15 years after infection45. These observations offer some hope for generating long-lived cellular immunity to influenza. Blood T-cell responses to M1 and NP can be boosted after heterologous prime-boost with ChAdOx and MVA in humans and were maintained at least up to 18 months in younger people11. Immunization with adenovirus expressing influenza nucleoprotein (AdNP) in mice, demonstrated that CD8 TRM in the lungs can be maintained for at least 1 year post vaccination, with continuing in situ proliferation of lung TRM up to 8 months after AdNP adminstration46. To fully assess the durability of immune responses induced by respiratory immunization, it will be important to perform immunization challenge studies with a longer interval between immunization and challenge, extending to at least 6 months, although it will be challenging as pigs gain weight rapidly.A limitation of the present study is that there is no empty vector or irrelevant antigen control to account for the possible non-specific protective effects of the viral vectors. Because of the logistics and challenges of housing many pigs in a high containment facility we only used unimmunized pH1N1 pre-exposed animals as controls. However, in a previous study, we used ChAdOx and MVA expressing Ebola glycoprotein, although the vaccines were administered intramuscularly and challenge was performed with pH1N147. In this study there was no difference in viral load between the unimmunised and Ebola-immunized pigs, while there were differences between these two controls and animals immunized with ChAdOx and MVA expressing NP, M1 and HA. Future studies should include an empty vector or irrelevant antigen control. Once the optimal antigen composition and route of administration are determined, larger group sizes should be used to increase the statistical power.The matrix protein is a structural protein which encodes at least two proteins M1 and M2. M1 is highly conserved and has been used as a target of BPIV48. M1 DNA vaccine provided partial protection against homologous virus challenge in mice49, while intranasal immunization with M1 protein vaccine formulated with chitosan provided full protection against homologous virus and partial protection against heterologous virus respectively50. The mechanism of protection was thought to be mucosal anti-M1 IgA antibodies and T-cell responses50. Influenza NP is crucial for the replication and transcription of the influenza genome. NP is a major target for CD8 + T cells51,52. It is highly conserved with over 90% homology between influenza viruses of the same type although differing greatly between A and B viruses. NP-based DNA, viral vectored and recombinant protein vaccines have been evaluated in animal models showing varying degrees of protection53,54,55. However, at least in mice, vaccines based on M1, M2 or NP alone provide less adequate protection than those with two or more influenza antigens48.Many murine CD4+, CD8+ and B cell M1 epitopes have been identified in A/WSN//33 (H1N1) or PR8 viruses56,57. A single M1 peptide epitope induced T-cell dependent influenza protection in HLA-A*0201/Kb transgenic mice58. In human epitopes of NP and M1 (and PB1) are immunodominant targets for cross-reactive T cells and similar epitopes were observed in mapping responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the entire genome of an H5N1 virus in unexposed individuals59. The inclusion of both antigens in the NPM1 group did not induce the strongest peptide specific responses in our study. Nevertheless, having both NP and M1 antigens might be beneficial as it increases the chances of inducing both CD4+ and CD8+ responses in a population with diverse MHC types.The rare adverse event vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) was associated with intramuscular administration of adenoviral vectored vaccines in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the use of aerosol delivery and the vaccine might be of particular interest to countries in the global South. Anti-vector immunity does not prevent re-use of the same vector. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has been administered to the same individuals four times with boosting seen each time, and a current clinical trial is assessing use of ChAdOx1 MERS in subjects who previously received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or an mRNA Covid vaccine (ISRCTN - ISRCTN17936606: A study of a new vaccine against the MERS virus in adults aged 50–70 years). We have previously demonstrated the protective efficacy of NP/M1-NA2 viral vectored vaccines in the pig pre-exposure model20. Here we show that there is no advantage in including both NP and M1 antigens, a critical finding for the development of a deployable vaccine. Omitting one of these antigens leaves space to include NA and/or HA in the vaccine to provide strain-specific antibody protection. This addition might complement M1’s or NP’s capacity to provide broader T cell-mediated protection.We have previously observed differences in vaccine-induced protection between pigs and mice31,47,60,61. In pigs, intranasal Ad5-HA1-NP and IL-1beta immunization induced increased NP-specific responses, which were associated with enhanced lung pathology following heterologous H3N2 challenge60. In contrast in mice, this regime was highly protective against both homologous and heterologous influenza challenge62. Similarly, Heinen et al. showed that immunization of pigs with DNA expressing either M2 or an M2-NP fusion protein exacerbated disease after challenge with H1N1 influenza virus63 whereas in mice immunization against M2 was protective. It is clear that memory T-cells resident in the lungs are important in mediating cross-protective immunity while at the same time they contribute to lung pathology64,65,66. Further work is required to understand how to deliver antigens to preferentially induce the right quantity and quality of cells in the respiratory tract to skew the balance toward protection over tissue destruction.Immunization is the most cost-effective public health strategy to combat influenza since its introduction 60 years ago, but current influenza vaccines are less effective against newly emerging influenza strains. Harnessing heterosubtypic immunity is necessary to develop influenza vaccines protective against a broad range of antigenically distinct influenza strains for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. We provide the first direct evidence that T-cell responses induced by aerosol immunization can be protective in the pig pre-exposure model and that single antigen immunization by M1 is sufficient to induce protective immune response. These findings provide valuable insights into the antigen composition of BPIV in a highly relevant large animal model and warrant the further development of cross-protective T cell-based influenza vaccines.Materials and methodsChAdOx2 and MVA viral vectored vaccinesThe production of ChAdOx2 NPM1, ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2, MVA-NPM1 and MVA-NPM1-NA2 vaccines has been described previously32. The NP and M1 protein ORFs were derived from A/swine/England/1353/2009 (GenBank accession number KR701098 and KR701100) and the neuraminidase (NA2) is from H3N2 strain A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (GenBank accession number MF801571).ChAdOx2 expressing single antigens, NP or M1 were generated by a similar method. Briefly, either the NP ORF and linker sequence or M1 ORF and linker sequence were removed from the Gateway® recombination shuttle plasmids used to generate ChAdOx2 NPM1 by inverse PCR and plasmid self-ligation. The resulting shuttle plasmids were used to insert the single antigen expression cassettes into the ChAdOx2 Gateway Destination plasmid by Gateway recombination as previously described67. Adenoviruses were generated and titred by Viral Vector Core Facility, University of Oxford.MVA vaccines expressing single antigens under the control of F11 promoter were generated by inverse PCR followed by self-ligation of the shuttle plasmids used to create MVA-NPM1. The resulting shuttle plasmids were used in generate MVA-NP and MVA-M1 through recombination with wt MVA in vitro by Viral Vector Core Facility, University of Oxford.Mouse immunogenicity studyThe mouse study was performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and with approval from the relevant local Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body at the University of Oxford (AWERB) (Project License PP2353929). Female, 6-week-old Balb/C mice were purchased from a Home Office approved breeder and supplier (Envigo RMS, UK LTD, INOTIV, UK). After a week of acclimatization and ensuring animals were over 18 grams of weight, vaccines formulated in endotoxin-free PBS were administrated by a 50μl intramuscular injection (IM) into the musculus tibialis of the left hind leg (3 groups, n = 5) or by intranasal immunization in the nose through a 30 μl slow drop-dripping pipetting (3 groups, N = 5). When feasible, staff performing vaccinations and sample harvesting were blinded to the groups and unblinded when data analysis is performed. Vaccine administration was performed under general anesthesia (Isoflurane, IsoFlo®) with full unconsciousness (pedal withdrawal reflex check) for IM route and lighter depth of anesthesia for IN route to allow deep breaths. Mice were immunized with 108 IU of ChAdOx2 NP, M1 or NPM1 vector vaccines and 4 weeks later boosted with 106 PFU of the same antigen vaccine candidate on MVA vector platform. All animals were humanely culled 4 weeks after the final vaccination by an approved Schedule 1 method: exsanguination via cardiac puncture under general anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation and a cervical dislocation with a posteriori exsanguination when lungs were needed to be collected. Once death is confirmed organs were harvested and processed in BSL2 cabinets.Pig challenge studiesThe pig studies were approved by the ethical review processes at VetQuest and the Pirbright Institute in accordance with the UK Government Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under Project Licence PP2064443.In the first study (ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA2 alone), twelve 6-week-old female Landrace x Large White pigs were divided into two groups of six. The pigs were screened by ELISA for the absence of serum IgG titers against pH1N1 and H3N2 and after a week of acclimatization, all pigs were challenged intranasally (IN) with 5 × 106 PFU of A/swine/England/1353/2009 (pH1N1) MDCK grown virus in a total of 4 ml (2 ml per nostril) using a mucosal atomization device (MAD, Wolfe-Tory Medical). Following the inoculation, daily nasal swabs were obtained for 1 week to assess viral load by plaque assays and blood was collected weekly. Twenty-four days following the pH1N1 inoculation, the pigs from one group were sedated by intramuscular injection with 3 mg/kg azaperone (Stresnil, Elanco, UK) and 1.5 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil, Virbac, France) and were immunized by aerosol with 5 × 108 infectious units (IU) of the ChAdOx2-NPM1-NA. For the immunization, 1 mL of the vaccine diluted in PBS was administered over 2–5 min using an Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen, Dangan, Galway, Ireland). This route of administration reaches both the upper and lower respiratory tract as previously shown using scintigraphy30. The unimmunized group served as the Control (C). Four weeks later, all 12 pigs were infected intranasally with 2 mL per nostril of 1.2 × 108 pfu of A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (H3N2) MDCK grown virus. Daily nasal swabs were collected to assess viral shedding as described above, and 4 days later all pigs were euthanized. The pigs were culled using intravenous pentobarbital (Dolethal 200 mg/ml) and after confirmation of permanent cessation of circulation, PBMC, lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were collected to assess viral load, lung pathology and immune responses as previously described20.For the second study to assess the contribution of NP and M1 antigens twenty-four 6-week-old female influenza-free Landrace x Large White pigs were infected intranasally with 3 × 106 PFU of A/swine/England/1353/2009 (pH1N1) MDCK grown virus in a total of 2 mL (1 mL per nostril). Daily nasal swabs were collected for 1 week to assess viral load following H1N1 infection. Four weeks after pH1N1 exposure pigs were randomly divided into four groups of six animals. Three groups were sedated and immunized by aerosol with either (A) ChAdOx2-NPM1, (B) ChAdOx2-NP or (C) ChAdOx2-M1. Each vaccine was administered at 5 × 108 IU in 1 mL using an Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. The last group of six animals did not receive any vaccine and served as control. Four weeks after the first immunization, the pigs were boosted by the same route with the same antigen 1.5 × 108 PFU each of MVA-NPM1, MVA-NP or MVA-M1. The control animals were pH1N1 infected but unimmunized. Four weeks later, all pigs, including the control group, were infected intranasally with 5.7 × 108 pfu of A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (H3N2) MDCK grown virus in a total of 4 mL (2 mL per nostril) using a MAD. Daily nasal swabs were collected to assess viral shedding. Four days later the animals were euthanized, lung pathology was assessed and PBMC and BAL were collected to investigate immune responses. Viral load was assessed by plaque assays as previously described20. Gross and histopathological analyses were performed as described in Vatzia et al.20.ELISAEndpoint ELISA for pH1N1, H3N2 and recombinant NA protein from H3N2 A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 (NA2) (sequence matched to the vaccine antigen, Genbank accession number: ATE49827, produced by The Native Antigen company) were performed for IgG in serum and IgG and IgA in BAL as described before20,32. NP ELISA was performed using a commercially available kit ID Screen Influenza A Nucleoprotein Swine Indirect (Innovative Diagnostics). Briefly, sera samples alongside with manufacturer provided positive and negative controls were diluted in the provided buffer and incubated with NP-coated plates in triplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed twice and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-pig antibody and developed using TMB substrate. End point titer was calculated following manufacturer calculation: Log10 end point titer = 1.2* Log10 (S/P) + 3.5, where S/P ratio = Test Sample OD/positive sample OD.Murine IFNγ ELISpot and intracellular cytokine stainingFresh mouse splenocytes and lung cells were used for ELISpot and ICS (Spectral flow cytometry). Spleen and lung cell suspension were prepared using C tubes and gentle MACS dissociator. Lungs homogenates were incubated in collagenase solution (Collagenase 0.7 mg/ml, Sigma; DNase, 0.03 mg/ml, Sigma) and stopped by adding fetus bovine serum. Homogenates were filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride lysis solution prior to resuspension in complete media (α-MEM, 10%FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 1% L-Gln). Cell suspensions were stimulated with pool of 15 mer peptides overlapping by 11 (Mimotopes), spanning the length of the proteins NP and M1 as previously described20,32. For ELISpots, cells and peptides were added to Hydrophobic-PVDF ELISpot plates (Merck) coated with 5 µg/ml of anti-mouse IFNγ (AN18, Mabtech). After 18–20 h of stimulation at 37 °C, IFNγ spot forming cells (SFC) were detected with anti-mouse IFNγ biotin (R46A2, Mabtech) followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Mabtech) and development with AP conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad, UK). Spots were counted using an AID ELISpot reader and software (AID).For ICS mouse splenocytes and lung cells, cells were stimulated at 37 °C for 5 h with 2 µg/ml peptide pool. Media and PMA positive control was included. A cocktail of 1 mg/mL GolgiPlug (BD) and CD107a-A647 (Clone 1D4B) was added to the stimulation cocktail. Viability of cells was detected by staining with Zombie NIR (BioLegend). Following surface staining with CD3-A700 (Clone 17A2) CD4-BUV496 (Clone GK1.5, BD), CD8-BV570 (Clone 53-6.7), CD11a-PECy7 (Clone H155-78), CD4-BV785 (Clone IM7), CD62L-PECF594 (Clone MEL-14), CD69-PECy5 (Clone H1.2F3), CD103-PerCPCy5.5 (Clone 2E7), CD19-BUV737 (Clone 1d3) and CD4 5-APCFire750 (Clone 30F11) diluted in Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained intracellularly with IL2-PE (Clone JES6-5H4, Thermo Fisher Scientific), IL4-BV711 (Clone 11B11), IL10-BV605 (Clone JES5-16E3), IFNg-BV421 (Clone XMG1.2) and TNF-A488 (Clone MP6-XT22) diluted in Perm-Wash buffer (BD). Unless stated all antibodies purchased from BioLegend. Sample acquisition was performed on an ID7000TM Spectral Cell Analyzer and data analyzed in ID7000 analysis software and FlowJo V10 (TreeStar). Antigen-specific T cells were identified by gating doublet negative (FSC-H vs FSC-A and SSC-H vs SSC-A), size (FSC-A vs SSC), on LIVE/DEAD negative, CD45+, CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and each individual cytokine. T cell subsets were gated within the population of IFNγ and/or TNF responses and are presented after subtraction of the background response detected in the corresponding media-stimulated control sample for each mouse. CD8+ tissue resident memory (TRM) cells in lungs were identified as CD44hi CD69+CD103+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 4).Porcine IFNγ ELISpots and intracellular cytokine stainingCryopreserved porcine BAL cells and PBMC were used to assess the frequencies of IFNγ-producing cells by ELISpot as described before32. The BAL T-cell responses were also assayed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). IFNγ, TNF and IFN/TNF production by CD4+ and CD8+ β T cells was measured following pH1N1, H3N2, NP1, NP2 and M1, stimulation (gating strategy shown in Supplementary Fig. 6) as previously described32. Briefly, BAL cells were either stimulated overnight with live pH1H1 or H3N2 virus (MOI = 1) or for 5 h with peptide pools covering NP and M1 proteins (2 μg/ml) and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The peptide sequences have been published previously32. One hour after the start of peptide stimulation, Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug™, BD Biosciences) was added. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin (BioLegend) was added as a positive control at the same time as the GolgiPlug. Four hours later, the cells were centrifuged for 4 min at 1500 rpm, washed twice with PBS and stained with the primary antibodies CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (74-12-4, BD Biosciences), CD8β-FITC (PPT23, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the Near-Infrared Fixable LIVE/DEAD stain (Invitrogen) for identification of the live cells. Twenty minutes after the surface staining and incubation at 4 °C, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and were then stained and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the anti-cytokine antibodies TNF-BV421 (MAb11, BioLegend) and IFNγ-APC (P2G10, BD Biosciences). Finally, the cells were washed twice, resuspended in PBS, acquired using a MACSquant Analyzer 16 (Miltenyi) and analyzed by FlowJo software version 10.8 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). The frequency of cytokine production shown is after subtraction of the frequencies found in medium control wells (unstimulated cells that were also seeded overnight and treated with Brefeldin A as described above).Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 9.2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all statistical analyses except for the correlation analysis. The data sets were first analyzed for normality and then subjected to either an unpaired t test when only one time point for two groups was compared (PM day for BAL and PBMC) and the data were normally distributed or to a Mann–Whitney test when the data were not normally distributed (pig experiment 1). When multiple time points were included (ELISAs pig experiment 1 time-course and all analyses for experiment 2) the data were first analyzed for normality and then subjected to a two-way-ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test if normally distributed or to a Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test when normality was not achieved. Significant differences were either presented on each graph or listed in the figure legends (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). To explore the correlation between immune parameters (16 in total) and virological/pathological measures (5 in total) Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) was computed for each pair of measures using data for all four treatment groups (i.e. controls, single M1, single NP and NPM1 immunized pigs). This analysis was implemented in Matlab (version R2020b; The Mathworks Inc.).

The surge in outbreaks at dairy farms has come with a steadily rising number of infections in dairy workers, who have reported mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed six infections, and follow-up testing is under way on five others identified during state testing.Utah reports outbreak at Cache County poultry farmElsewhere, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) reported the confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial poultry flock in Cache County. In a statement, UDAF said the state veterinarian’s office was notified about symptomatic birds and immediately dispatched a team to assess the situation.Utah reported its last avian flu outbreak in poultry nearly a year ago. Cache County is in northern Utah on the border with Idaho. PAHO issues alert about wastewater polio positives from French Guiana News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Polio The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) yesterday posted an epidemiologic alert about recent detections of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) in wastewater samples in French Guiana and urged countries in the region to keep polio vaccination levels above 95% to minimize the risk of outbreaks. varius-studios/ iStock The detection was first reported to PAHO in early August, based on a positive wastewater sample from Cayenne collected on June 26. The sample was one of five from five different sites collected as part of a research project by scientists at the French Research Agency for Emerging Infectious Diseases. Genetic sequencing found that it wasn’t related to any previously identified cVDPV3 strains. Additional positives genetically relatedAdditional wastewater testing at the Pasteur Institute in French Guiana found a positive in a sample collected on August 6 from a site in Remire-Montjoly, and a retrospective wastewater sample collected on May 15 from Saint Georges de l’Oyapock was also positive. More results are pending.The positive samples from the different sites are genetically related and confirm the presence of cVDPV3 in French Guiana, though no suspected cases have been reported, PAHO said.Health officials in French Guiana have stepped up surveillance and have asked healthcare workers to review patients’ polio vaccination status. For undervaccinated or hard-to-reach communities, PAHO said polio vaccination operations should include all antigens used in national immunization programs for children younger than 5 years old. The group also said the efforts should include active searches for suspected cases in health facilities and the community. WHO approves Jynneos for use in teens as study shows undiagnosed mpox common News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Mpox Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the approval of Bavarian Nordic's mpox vaccine, Jynneos, for adolescents aged 12 to 17. The move comes as the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is still raging, and infecting children at high rates. Seroprevalence study suggests many unreported casesIn other mpox news, a new seroprevalence study from German researchers publishing in BMC Infectious Diseases shows a high proportion of clinically undiagnosed mpox among Berlin’s population of men who have sex with men (MSM.)The study was conducted between April 11 and July 1, 2023, and included blood samples from 728 participants, who were recruited from eight private practices and two community-based checkpoints in Berlin.Only 70 (7.4%) participants reported a previous diagnosis of mpox. However serological testing revealed an additional 91 individuals with suspected undiagnosed mpox infection.Men who reported condomless sex with multiple partners were most likely to have mpox, and a substantial proportion of mpox infections were clinically undiagnosed, the authors said. The authors said the findings were cautionary and suggest many more undiagnosed cases in MSM communities. Many infections remain unrecognised and undiagnosed"Mpox control measures based on clinical diagnosis of mpox are likely to have limited effectiveness in preventing mpox transmission in outbreak situations because many infections remain unrecognised and undiagnosed,” they concluded. Study: Resistance to antibody rare in RSV breakthrough cases News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) FotoDuets / iStock A new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases describes the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) breakthrough infections after the widespread use of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (Beyfortus) in infants younger than 1 year.The study was based on outcomes seen among infants in France during the 2023-2024 RSV season, the first season the RSV antibody was approved for use in infants in the European Union and the United States. In France, roughly 210,000 single doses were administered last year.To understand the real-life potential for viral escape, the authors looked at 260 RSV full-length viral genome sequences from nirsevimab-treated infants with breakthrough infections and compared the RSV RNA to that from 285 untreated RSV-infected infants.In the breakthrough infections, 236 cases (91%) were RSV-A, and 24 (9%) were RSV-B.Resistance only seen in RSV-B casesThere were no known nirsevimab resistance–associated mutations in infections caused by RSV-A, and only 2 of the 24 RSV-B infections showed a mutation that conferred resistance to nirsevimab.Overall, breakthrough infections in France were rare, the authors said, and the antibody should be used again in the upcoming RSV seasons. As nirsevimab use becomes more widespread, collaboration between research and public health agencies becomes essential to assess the emergence of resistance.In a commentary on the study, the authors write, "This finding underscores the need for subgroup-specific surveillance strategies to help better explain the different prevalences of monoclonal antibody-escape mutants between RSV-A and RSV-B. As nirsevimab use becomes more widespread, collaboration between research and public health agencies becomes essential to assess the emergence of resistance." Kentucky reports state's first captive-deer CWD case, in Breckinridge County News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Richard Roche / Flickr cc The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources yesterday announced the detection of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a deer that died at a captive deer farm in Breckinridge County.The Kentucky Department of Agriculture (KDA) confirmed the case, the state's first in a captive cervid facility, and has issued a quarantine restricting the movement of live deer or deer products to or from the farm."Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials are in close communication with national, state and local partners and will reference the agency's CWD Response Plan in response to this new detection," the news release said. "Since 2002, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife has CWD-tested more than 40,000 deer and elk from across the state.​​​​"The state's first CWD case was identified in December 2023 in Ballard County.Hunters asked to participate in monitoringOfficials urge hunters to help with CWD monitoring by dropping off the heads of legally harvested and telechecked deer for free testing at self-service sample drop-off sites located throughout the state. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials are in close communication with national, state and local partners and will reference the agency's CWD Response Plan in response to this new detection.CWD, a neurologic disease caused by misfolded infectious proteins called prions, affects cervids such as deer, elk, moose, and reindeer. Prions are extremely resilient and can persist in the environment for years. CWD poses an ongoing threat to cervids, because it can spread from animal to animal and through environmental contamination. The disease isn't known to infect humans, but officials recommend not eating meat from a sick animal and using precautions when field-dressing or butchering cervids.

Here, we isolate an anti-N6 human monoclonal antibody, named 18_14D, from an H5N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) infected patient. The antibody weakly inhibits enzymatic activity but confers protection in female mice, mainly via ADCC function. The cryo-EM structure shows that 18_14D binds to a unique epitope on the lateral surface of the N6 tetramer, preventing the formation of tightly closed NA tetramers. These findings contribute to the molecular understanding of protective immune responses to NA of AIVs in humans and open an avenue for the rational design of NA-based vaccines.

Influenza viruses have two major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA). HA mediates the binding of viruses to the cellular sialic acid receptors and fusion of the virion membrane with the intracellular endosome membranes5. NA removes decoy receptors from mucins and cleaves off the sialic acid, allowing the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells6,7.Human protective antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection can bind to both the HA and NA proteins8,9. In the past years, the NA has been historically understudied compared to the surface protein counterpart HA. However, increasing studies highlighted the importance of NA-targeting antibodies and their implications for therapy and design of universal flu vaccines, as they have shown that NA-targeted immunity can confer protective efficacy against influenza virus challenge in animal models10,11,12,13. NA-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are shown to reduce the viral loads and symptoms in infected mice and even correlate with the protection in humans14,15,16, and antigenic drifts also occurred on NA protein16,17,18,19,20.Most of the NA-targeting antibodies directly inhibit enzymatic activity of the NA via binding to enzyme active site21,22,23,24,25, or indirectly inhibit enzymatic activity of the NA through steric hindrance24,26,27,28. Otherwise, there are some other NA antibodies with no inhibitory activity to the NA, could also contribute to protection through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)16.In addition to seasonal H1N1, H3N2 influenza A virus and influenza B virus, the recent rise in the frequency of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) infection has also raised serious public health concerns4,5,29. Among them, H5N6 AIV has obtained global attention. Severe disease occurred in 93.8% of human H5N6 infection cases, and the case fatality rate was >50%30. However, the role of NA in human immune response to H5N6 AIV infection has not been well investigated.Here, we isolated an N6-specific antibody, 18_14D, from an H5N6-infected human case in Shenzhen, China, in 2015. Antibody 18_14D can bind to N6 and weakly inhibit enzymatic activity of the H5N6 virus at a high concentration. Moreover, 18_14D could protect mice from lethal virus infection via ADCC function. Further cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure revealed that 18_14D recognize a distinctive epitope on the lateral surface of NA, and the antibody binding would induce conformational change to generate steric conflict at the interface of NA protomer in the tetramer under closed state, acting as a “bayonet” to unclench the N6 tetramer and keep the NA tetramer in an open state. These findings will contribute to the molecular understanding of protective immune response to the NA of AIVs in human, and provide a new direction for the rational design of NA-based vaccines.ResultsHuman infection with H5N6 AIV induces anti-N6 mAbPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected at 18 days post illness onset (d.p.o) from a hospitalized H5N6 AIV infected patient in Shenzhen, China31. IgG+ memory B cells were selected and cultured. On the 13th day of the culture, the positive rate of IgG+ B cells was 34.3%, and the positive rate of H5N6-positive B cells was 10.1%. A total of 9 cell wells were successfully amplified with heavy chain and light chain genes of antibodies and the antibody genes were analyzed (Supplementary Table. 1). The putative antibodies from the H5- or N6-positive cell wells were expressed by 293 T cells, and ELISA was used to measure their binding activities for H5 HA or N6 NA (Supplementary Table. 2). Finally, only one antibody named as 18_14D was identified to bind the N6 protein (Supplementary Fig. 1). 18_14D was encoded by the genes IGHV1-69/IGLV2-14. IGHV1-69 was one of the most polymorphic loci within the human IGHV gene cluster, and IGHV1-69 germline gene was frequently found in the broadly neutralizing antibodies to the stem domain of influenza A hemagglutinin32. Remarkably, the VH gene of 18_14D was entirely germline without any somatic mutation (Supplementary Fig. 2).The Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) assay showed that 18_14D Fab could bind both the N6_DQ (the head domain of NA from an H5N6 virus, A/Yunan/DQ001/2016) tetramer and monomer, with affinities of 26 nM and 18 nM, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). To assess the direct inhibition ability on virus reproduction for 18_14D, virus inhibition assay (Egress) and enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) were conducted. 18_14D could not inhibit the replication of the H5N6 virus and showed no NA inhibition activity in the ELLA even at 100 µg/mL (Fig. 1c,d). ELLA was also conducted using H5N6 virus, and the results showed that 18_14D exhibited about 70% inhibition activity at a high concentration of 1 mg/mL, which was weak compared with other anti-NA antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3). As several previously reported anti-NA antibodies conferred in vivo protection due to ADCC function16, the capacity of 18_14D to activate ADCC-signaling pathways was also assessed using an ADCC reporter assay. We found that 18_14D was capable of inducing ADCC reporter activity in both human and mouse cells (Fig. 1e,f).Fig. 1: In vitro functional activity of the 18_14D.The binding kinetics between 18_14D Fab and N6 monomer (a) or tetramer (b) were measured using BLI. (c) Inhibition of N6 enzymatic activity by 18_14D measured in ELLA. Fetuin was used as substrate. Data represents one of three independent experiments, shown as mean ± SEM of three technical replicates. 1G01 was used as a positive control. (d) Egress inhibition of H5N6 virus by 18_14D and 1G01. Data represents one of three independent experiments. 1G01 was used as a positive control. (e,f) ADCC activity of the 18_14D was measured. An anti-HA antibody FI6 was used as a positive control, and an anti-Ebola GP antibody 13C6 was used as a negative control. Data represents one of three independent experiments, shown as mean ± SEM (standard deviation) of two technical replicates. Both of human (e) and mouse (f) Jurkat cells were examined.Full size image18_14D protects against lethal H5N6 virus challenge in vivoThe prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against H5N6 AIV in vivo was further investigated in a murine model. 18_14D IgG with doses of 20, 5, 1 mg/kg were used in a prophylactic treatment setting before challenge with 3 LD50 (50% lethal dose) of A/Yunan/DQ001/2016 (H5N6, DQ001) virus. It shows that 18_14D conferred full protection (6 out of 6 mice survived) at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and 5 or 1 mg/kg of 18_14D was also protective (5 out of 6 mice survived per group) (Fig. 2a,b). In addition, 18_14D was administered at 48 hours post infection to test the therapeutic efficacy, and 18_14D provided partial protection against the H5N6 challenge, with 1 out of 6 mice, 3 out of 6 mice survived in the 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg groups, respectively, and all the mice experienced obvious weight loss (Fig. 2c,d).Fig. 2: In vivo protection activity of the 18_14D.6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice were used for prophylaxis and therapeutic study. The mean percentage of body weight change and survival curves post-infection are shown. Six animals were used per group (n = 6), and error bars indicate SEM. The humane endpoint, which was defined as a weight loss of 25% from initial weight on day 0, is shown as a dotted line. For prophylaxis study, 1, 5 or 20 mg/kg of wild type 18_14D (a–d) and 20 mg/kg 18_14D_LALA (e, f) were injected intraperitoneally 3 h before 3 LD50 of A/Yunan/DQ001/2016 (H5N6) virus challenge. For therapeutic study, 5 or 20 mg/kg of 18_14D were injected intraperitoneally 48 h after 3 LD50 of A/Yunan/DQ001/2016 (H5N6) virus challenge.Full size imageTo examine the importance of Fc effector function, we generated an 18_14D LALA variant to eliminate its Fc effector functions. The mice prophylactically administered with 20 mg/kg of 18_14D LALA variant had significantly more weight loss than those with wild type 18_14D, and only 3 mice survived (Fig. 2e,f). Taken together, we concluded that 18_14D protected mice from lethal infection with H5N6 AIV mainly via ADCC function.18_14D recognizes a unique antigenic site at the lateral surface of N6To elucidate the binding epitope of 18_14D on NA, we performed single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the three-dimensional structure of 18_14D Fab in complex with the N6_DQ. Firstly, N6_DQ tetramer was incubated with 18_14D Fab to generate the protein complex. Under negative staining EM, N6_DQ tetramer displayed different conformations including both closed and open states. The binding of 18_14D Fab made the N6_DQ tetramer into a fully open state with inhomogeneous performance, which could not be used to solve the structure (Supplementary Fig. 4). We then prepared a ternary complex (N6_DQ/18_14D/1G01), using N6_DQ monomer, 18_14D Fab, and the previously reported 1G01 Fab, a broadly protective human monoclonal antibody that targets the active site of influenza virus neuraminidase. Initially, we got a final EM map of 3.2 Å (Supplementary Fig. 5). In the map, we noticed the EM densities of the CH1 and CL of two Fabs were much weak and flexible, which would affect the alignment during 3D refinement. To improve the resolution and obtain better EM densities on the interfaces between NA and antibodies, we performed signal subtraction to eliminate the influence of CH1 and CL of two Fabs and focused on the NA, VH and VL of two Fabs for further refinement, and we got a final EM density map of 3.0 Å (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table. 3).The overall structure showed that 18_14D recognized a unique epitope far away from the enzyme active site of N6_DQ. Two antibodies bind to the N6_DQ in an almost vertical orientation. 1G01 binds to the enzyme active site, while 18_14D binds to the lateral surface of the neuraminidase head (Fig. 3a). Further analysis showed that there were 20 residues in the N6 involved in the interaction with 18_14D, in which 19 residues (N330, R365, I367, K369, E376, L378, P391, T392, S393, Y394, Q395, L396, N400, R454, L455, G456, S457, W458, W460) and 2 (Q401, S457) residues interacted with the antibody heavy and light chains, respectively (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table. 4). The heavy chain of 18_14D (including HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3) contributed to most of the interactions, while the light chain (including LCDR1 and LCDR2) contributed much less to the interaction, only with 8 atom-to-atom contacts (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table. 4). Residues G27, T28, Y32 in HCDR1 and R102, Y103, F104, D105 in HCDR3 form hydrogen-bond interactions with N6_DQ (Figure 3d). We also found that the main chain of HCDR3 (Y394, L396) formed 3 hydrogen-bond interactions with N6_DQ, while the side chain was away from the binding interface, which was relatively rare in the antigen-antibody interaction (Supplementary Fig. 6).Fig. 3: Cryo-EM structure of N6_DQ/18_14D/1G01 complex.a Overall structures of N6_DQ/18_14D/1G01, N6_DQ was displayed in a surface representation. The 18_14D heavy chain (orange), light chain (yellow), 1G01 heavy chain (blue), light chain (light blue) are shown in cartoon representation.

N6_DQ is colored in gray, CDR loop is labeled with the same colors as in (b). The residues involved in the interaction are shown in stick representation and labeled in saturated color. Red spheres represent the enzyme active site. Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr.Full size image18_14D acts as a “bayonet” to unclench the closed N6 tetramerNegative staining EM indicated that N6_DQ_tetramer in N6_DQ_tetramer/18_14D complex showed a more “open” form, compared with N6_DQ_tetramer alone or N6_DQ_tetramer/1G01 complex (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, we deduced that 18_14D could unclench the closed tetramerization state of N6. Structural analysis indicated the binding footprint of 18_14D was partially hidden in the NA tetramer, according to the previously reported N6 tetramer structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2CML]33. The 454–458 loop of NA was at the interface of the NA tetramer (Fig. 4a), and it forms intensive interactions with 18_14D.Fig. 4: 18_14D binding could induce conformational change in the interface of N6 tetramer.a The epitope of 18_14D is mapped onto N6 (PDB: 2CML) (orange). b Superimposition of the N6_DQ/18_14D/1G01 complex structure to an English duck N6 tetramer (PDB: 2CML, colored in gray) and N6_H3 (PDB: 4QN6, colored in light sea green). The N6_DQ, heavy chain and light chain of 18_14D are colored in purple, green and orange respectively. The side chain of residues involved in the interaction are shown in sticks. Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: D, Asp; G, Gly; I, Ile; L, Leu; N, Asn; P, Pro; R, Arg; S, Ser; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr.Full size imageBy superimposing N6_DQ/18_14D/1G01 complex structure to the previously reported two N6 tetramer structures (PDB: 2CML and 4QN6), we found that the 454–458 loop of N6_DQ showed a significant structural displacement compared with the apo N6 protomers in the two tetramer structures (PDB: 2CML and 4QN6) (Fig. 4b). The displacement of 454–458 loop would generate the structural clash between S457 in N6_DQ and N201 in the adjacent N6 protomer 2 (PDB: 2CML and 4QN6) and then unclench the N6 tetramer interaction (Fig. 4b).18_14D is an H5N6-specific antibodySequence alignment of different N6 proteins showed that the most of binding epitope residues of 18_14D were highly conserved except polymorphism on residues 392, 393, 394 and 396 (Supplementary Table. 5). We expressed an N6 protein from A/Chicken/Nanchang/7-010/2000 (H3N6, named N6_H3)34, and sequence alignment showed that there are 3 different amino acids on the epitope: I392, H394 and V396 (Supplementary Fig. 7). BLI results showed that 18_14D Fab did not bind to N6_H3. Therefore, we deduced that residues 392, 394 and 396 were critical for the binding. Mutagenesis experiment showed that Y394H or L396V single substitution significantly reduced the binding affinity of 18_14D, with KD values of 937 and 345 nM, respectively. T392I single substitution also slightly affect the binding ability. Combination of I392T, H394Y and V396L triple-substitution significantly increase the binding activity of N6_H3 to 18_14D antibody, with KD value of 185 nM (Fig. 5a). Structural analysis indicated that residues T392, Y394 and L396 interact with HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 of 18_14D (Fig. 5b). Y394H substitution would destroy the hydrophobic interaction between 18_14D residues and Y394, while T394I and L396V would also alter the interactions (Fig. 5c).Fig. 5: 18_14D is an H5N6-specific antibody.a Binding affinities of 18_14D and 1G01 Fabs to different N6 proteins.

N6_DQ is colored in light blue. c Paratope of 18_14D is shown in surface representation, N6_DQ is colored in light blue, and N6_H3 (PDB: 4QN6) is colored in light green. The residues 392, 394 and 396 involved in the interaction are shown in stick representation. Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: F, Phe; H, His; I, Ile; L, Leu; Q, Gln; R, Arg; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr.Full size imageAccording to the sequence analysis, except for clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6 viruses, >97% of H5N6 viruses contained Y394 and L396 for N6, indicating that the binding epitope of 18_14D is highly conserved. However, only about 20% of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6 viruses carried Y394 and L396, which indicated that 18_14D antibody would show weak or no binding to most of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N6 viruses. For other HxN6 subtypes AIV, such as H3N6, H4N6 and H13N6, most of them contain H394 (Supplementary Table. 5), while residue 396 showed more polymorphism, indicating that 18_14D may also show weak or no binding to these viruses. Other NA subtypes including N2, N3, N7 and N9 from group 2 and N5 from group 1 were also used to test the binding to 18_14D, and no binding was detected (Supplementary Fig. 8). Overall, the 18_14D is an H5N6-specific antibody.18_14D binds a distinctive epitope on the NA proteinPrevious studies have showed the antibody epitopes on NA can be mainly divided into four groups. (1) The enzyme active site. Generally, antibodies targeting enzyme active site or the edge of enzyme active site show strong enzyme inhibition activity and broad-spectrum neutralizing ability, such as FNI9, 1G01 and DA03E1721,22,25 (Fig. 6a). (2) The underside of NA, such as 1F04, 3A10, 3H03 and NDS.326,27,28 (Fig. 6b). (3) The region across adjacent NA protomers in the lateral surface, such as NA-22 and CD624,35 (Fig. 6c). (4) Another region in the lateral surface (not across the promoter-promoter interface), such as NA-6324 (Fig. 6d). The mAbs targeting the lateral surface or the underside of NA head can show good in vivo protection by both interfering NA cleavage of fetuin substrate and Fc effector functions.Fig. 6: Binding epitopes of different antibodies on NA tetramer.The NA tetramer is displayed in a surface representation, and the antibodies are displayed in a cartoon representation. Red spheres represent the enzyme active site. a Anti-NA antibodies targeting the enzyme active site, such as 1G01 (PDB: 6Q23, medium purple) and NA-73 (PDB: 6PZY, salmon) (b) Anti-NA antibodies targeting the underside of NA, such as 3A10 (PDB: 8EZ3, purple), 1F04 (PDB: 8EZ7, orange), 3H03 (PDB: 8E6J, green) and NDS.3 (PDB: 8GAV, sky blue). c Anti-NA antibodies targeting the region across adjacent NA protomers in the lateral surface, such as CD6 (PDB: 4QNP, blue) and NA-22 (PDB: 6PZW, hot pink). d Anti-NA antibodies targeting the other region in the lateral surface (not across the promoter-promoter interface), such as NA-63 (PDB: 6U02, cyan). e Anti-NA antibodies targeting the interface of the N6 tetramer, such as 18_14D (yellow).Full size imageUnlike the binding epitopes mentioned above, 18_14D recognizes a distinctive epitope on the lateral surface of NA head (Fig. 6e). 18_14D binds to the interface of the N6 tetramer, however, 18_14D only interacts with one NA protomer, which is different from NA-22 and CD624,35. Moreover, like a “bayonet”, 18_14D could unclench the N6 tetramer by inducing the conformational change of NA to generate steric clash between the NA promoters. We propose that the binding epitope of 18_14D would be a fifth group for classification of antibody epitopes on NA.DiscussionBoth anti-NA and anti-HA antibodies could confer protection against influenza virus in humans and animals. Recent studies of NA immunity showed that NA could be a promising target for broad-spectrum protection against influenza virus, and the antigenicity profiles of seasonal human influenza A virus N1, N2 and influenza B virus NAs have been widely investigated13,22,23,25,26,27. However, the role of N6 protein in highly pathogenic H5N6 AIV infection has not been well illustrated. A previous study has investigated murine mAbs to the N6 and found that the antibodies have broad reactivity across the American and Eurasian N6 lineages, but relatively little binding to the H5N6 NA36. Here, we described the isolation of a human anti-N6 mAbs induced by H5N6 AIV infection and characterized its protective function and binding epitopes.In accordance with most of mAbs targeting the lateral surface of NA, 18_14D confers protection against H5N6 lethal challenge in a murine model. Our results also showed that 18_14D could activate ADCC-signaling pathways, which help to suppress virus replication in vivo. Of note, the VH gene of 18_14D was entirely germline without any somatic mutation, and lack of affinity maturation might be responsible for the relatively low affinity. However, germline mAbs typically exhibit excellent drugability properties, especially lower immunogenicity. Therefore, 18_14D mAb could have great potential for prophylaxis and therapeutics of H5N6 infection in humans. Although 18_14D did not broadly interact with different NA subtypes, the binding epitope of 18_14D was still worthy of our attention due to its effectiveness and novelty. Antibodies targeting a similar region on other NAs may also exist, which deserves to be studied in the future.Previous studies have shown that tetrameric NA rather than monomeric NA confer protection in mouse model12,13,37. Ellis and Lederhofer et al. showed that NA could adopt different tetrameric conformations, including both “open” state and “closed” state, and tried to stabilize NA tetramer by introducing mutations38. Considering the unique epitope of 18_14D, we speculated 18_14D recognizes the “open” state of NA tetramer, and an “open” N6 tetramer is required for eliciting the protective antibodies like 18_14D. Overall, our results suggest that stabilized recombinant NA tetramers would not be the only road to Rome, and we could consider the strategy of multimeric NA monomers for the vaccine design.In conclusion, our results have elucidated a distinctive epitope on the NA, and help to further illuminate the dark side of NA in influenza immunity. These findings contribute to the molecular understanding of protective immune response to the NA of AIVs in human and promote the design of next-generation flu vaccine.MethodsEthics statementAll procedures in this study involving H5N6 AIV infection was performed in the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility and animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) facility. All the procedures in the murine study were reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, China. Written informed consent was obtained from the donor following the approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital, China.Mice6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Vital River and housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility on a 12-hour light/dark cycle under ambient conditions with free access to food and water.Cell LinesHEK293T cells and MDCK cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293F cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in SMM 293-TII Expression Medium (Sino Biological, M293TII). ADCC bioeffector cell FcγRIIIa cells (Promega, G7102) were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in RMPI 1640 with 10% FBS.Influenza virusH5N6 virus strain A/Yunan/DQ001/2016 (H5N6, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_200837, DQ001) was isolated by Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital.Screening of H5N6-NA fully human antibodyThe screening method of human antibody was carried out according to the method reported previously39. Memory B cells secreting IgG subtype antibodies from convalescent PBMC of H5N6 infected patients in Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital (collected on day 18 after illness onset) were sorted out by BD Aria III by gating of CD19+IgM–IgA–IgD– memory B cells and cultured three cells per well in 96-well cell culture plates (3T3-msCD40L-IL21 as feeder cells) (Antibodies purchased from BD Biosciences). ELISA was used to detect the secretion of IgG antibody and H5 or N6 specific antibody in the culture supernatant. The positive cell wells were screened, and the heavy chain and light chain coding genes of B cells in positive cell wells were amplified by primers specific to the heavy and light chains of human antibodies and sequenced using both the first-generation and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Due to being plated at a density of 3 cells per well, each well can obtain more than one heavy chain and one light chain gene sequences, and we will explore the different combinations of heavy chain and light chain genes in the same well.Expression and purification of IgG and preparation of FabThe heavy chain and light chain of antibodies (18_14D, 1G01, MEDI8852, 13C6, HENV-32 and mutant antibody) were cloned into pCAGGS plasmids, and plasmids were transfected into HEK293T or HEK293F cells at a ratio of 1:2 to express antibody proteins. After 5 days, the supernatants were collected, and soluble protein were purified using a Protein A column (Cytiva). The proteins were further purified via gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (Cytiva). 18_14D and 1G01 Fabs were generated by papain digestion and further purified by Protein A column (Cytiva) as described previously40,41,42. Briefly, antibodies were concentrated to ~20 mg/mL and digested using papain (Pierece) protease with an antibody to papain ratio of 160:1 (wt/wt) at 37 °C for 6 h. The digestion mixture was loaded into a Protein A column to separate the Fab fragment with the Fc region and undigested antibody. Fab fragments were collected, and purified via gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column (Cytiva).Expression and purification of NA, HA proteinsAll genes used in this study were synthesized by Azenda and performed codon optimization. For ELISA assay during human antibody isolation, the sequence encoding the ectodomain of HA from A/duck/Guangdong/04.23 DGQTXC213-O/2015 (H5N6, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_199291, H5_DG) or A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_207051, H5_TH002) was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) as previously described43,44, in-frame with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide for secretion, a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site, a trimerization foldon sequence and a His6-tag at the extreme C terminus for purification. The NA head domain, which contained residues 83-470 (N6 numbering) of DQ001 (N6_DQ), A/duck/Guangdong/04.23 DGQTXC213-O/2015 (H5N6, N6_DG) or A/Chicken/Nanchang/7-010/2000 (H3N6, N3_H6) was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) as described previously34, with a GP67 signal peptide, a His6-tag, a tetramerization sequence, and a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus. Transfection and virus amplification were performed according to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system manual (Invitrogen). HA or NA proteins were produced by infecting suspension cultures of Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Soluble proteins were collected from the cell supernatant by metal affinity chromatography using a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (Cytiva), and then initially purified by ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) using a RESOURCE Q column (Cytiva), and further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva).For NA binding affinity assay, ELLA and structural analysis, the NA head domain of A/Yunnan/DQ001/2016 (H5N6, N6_DQ, residues 83–470), N6_DQ T392I (residues 83–470), N6_DQ Y394H (residues 83–470), N6_DQ L396V (residues 83–470), N6_ H3 I392T/H394Y/V396L (N6_H3 MUT, residues 83–470), A/New York/3147/2009 (H3N2, N2, residues 80–466), A/swine/Missouri/2124514/2006 (H2N3, N3, residues 83–469), A/mallard duck/ALB/60/1976(H12N5, N5, residues 80–473), A/mallard/ALB/196/1996 (H10N7, N7, residues 81–490) and A/pigeon/Shanghai/S1423/2013(H7N9, N9, residues 78–465) was fused to an N-terminal signal peptide (signal peptide from low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, LNGFR), His6-tag, a human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) tetramerization domain, and a thrombin cleavage site, and constructed into pCAGGS vector and expressed in HEK293F cells. After 5 days, the supernatants were collected, and soluble proteins were purified using a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (Cytiva). The proteins were further purified via gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL. To generate N6_DQ monomer, thrombin enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 U/mg) was added into the protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C, The monomer was then acquired via gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Microtiter plates (Sangon Biotech) were coated with 100 ng of each recombinant proteins overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20 (PBST) and blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 5% w/v bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. On the day of the experiment, the plates were then washed once with PBST. The serially diluted sera or monoclonal antibodies were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Then the plates were washed five times using PBST and added 100 µL horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human or mouse IgG antibody solution (Sangon Biotech) to each plate, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Wash each plate with PBST five times, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sangon Biotech) was added to each plate at room temperature in the dark and reacted for 15 min. After the reaction, the plate was stopped with a 2 M HCL solution. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific).Biolayer interferometry (BLI) assayThe antibody binding affinity and the competitive binding of monoclonal antibodies were measured by biolayer interferometry (BLI) using the Octet RED96 system (FortéBio). All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the biosensors were pre-equilibrated in BLI buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20) for 10 min. For the antibody binding affinity assay, Biotinylated NAs were loaded onto SA biosensors for 160 s and baseline was measured in BLI buffer. Following baseline measurements, sensors were loaded with 18_14D or 1G01 Fab with different concentrations and association and dissociation was measured. The data were analyzed using the Octet-Red96 software.Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)ELLA experiments were performed described45. Briefly, each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning) was coated with 100 μL fetuin (Sigma) at 25 μg/mL in coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. The fetuin was discarded and washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). Then 100 μL blocking solution (5% skimmed milk) was added to the plate and incubated for 1 h. After washing the plate three times, 50 μL antibodies or sera at the indicated concentration in PBS were mixed with an equal volume of N6_DQ tetramer (0.014 mg/mL) or H5N6 virus in plate for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the mixture was added to the fetuin-coated plate and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plate was then washed four times with PBST. Subsequently, 100 μL of HRP-conjugated peanut agglutinin lectin (PNA-HRPO, Sigma–Aldrich) in PBS was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The plate was washed four times and incubated TMB (Sangon Biotech) for 15 min in the dark. Then 2 M HCl was added to the plate. Absorbance was read at 450 nm by microplate reader (Thermo Scientific). Data points were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was defined as the concentration at which 50% of the NA activity was inhibited compared to the negative control.Virus inhibition assayMDCK cells were seeded in a 96-well, flat-bottom cell culture plate (Thermo Fisher) and cultured for 24 h. 100 TCID50 virus was diluted using DMEM and was incubated with two-fold diluted antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h. MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with the antibody-virus mixture. After 48 h incubation, the presence of virus was detected by hemagglutination assay. The results were analyzed using Prism software.ADCC reporter bioassay100 μL/well MDCK cell (2 × 105) in DMEM media were seeded into white, flat bottom, 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were recounted and infected with DQ001 virus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3, and then were incubated at 37 °C. After 16 h, the medium was replaced with ADCC bioeffector cell FcγRIIIa cell (Promega) and 10-fold serial dilutions of mAb in RPMI 1640 media (starting at 100 μg/mL). After 6 h’s incubation, Bio-Glo Luciferase (Promega) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The luciferase was measured by a microtiter plate reader (BMG CLARIOstar), and the data was processed by Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 8.In vivo challenge of influenza virusIn the prophylactic study against DQ001 virus, groups of six BALB/c mice (Vital River) at 6–8 week age received doses of 1, 5 or 20 mg/kg of intraperitoneal (i.p.) 18_14D antibody or 5, 20 mg/kg of LALA mutant antibody respectively. An equivalent volume of PBS was i.p. administered as a control. After 3 h of treatment, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and then intranasally inoculated with 50 μL PBS containing a 3 LD50 of DQ001 virus. For the therapeutic setting, the mice were given 5 or 20 mg/kg mAb 48 h after infection with DQ001 virus. Body weights and survival rates of all mice were monitored and recorded for 14 days. Mice that displayed 25% or more weight loss were subsequently euthanized.Negative staining assayProteins were diluted to a final concentration between 0.01–0.02 mg/mL using 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids. The grids were either washed with double distilled water two times, and stained with stained directly with 1% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded at 100 k magnification in 1.02 Å/pixel. Data were collected with a JEM-1400 instrument (JEDL, Japan) equipped with an Orius SC1000A CCD camera using SerialEM79.Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collectionTo prepare the cryo-EM sample of NA in complex with Fabs, the Fab regions of 18_14D and 1G01 were added at 2 times molar excess to the N6_DQ monomer and incubated on ice for 20 min. About 3 μL solution was loaded onto a glow-discharged Au grid coated with graphene, which was blotted for 3.0 seconds with a humidity of 100% at 4 °C and then plunged frozen with an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV. Cryo-EM images were automatically collected using Serial-EM software (http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/) using beam-image shift imaging scheme. Stacks were recorded with a K2-subunit detector using the super-resolution counting mode at a pixel size of 0.82 Å. The exposure was performed with a dose rate of 10 e−1pixel−1s−1 and an accumulative dose of 60 e−1 Å2 for each micrograph, which fractionated into 32 frames. The defocus range of this dataset was roughly −1.0 to −2.5 μm.Image processingFor the dataset, 3,437 raw movies were aligned and corrected using MotionCor246 and the contrast transfer function (CTF) values of each micrograph were determined using CTFFind4. About 1,000,000 particles were picked out from 1000 micrographs using bolb picker, which were subjected to two-dimensional (2D) classification to generate good particles with different views for Topaz training47. All subsequent classification and reconstruction procedures were performed using cryoSPARC v3.148. A total of ~780,000 particles were selected from all micrographs using the Topaz model. After a round of 2D classification, about 720,000 particles were used for further heterogeneous refinement. After three rounds of heterogeneous refinement, 116,206 particles remained for non-uniform refinement and yielded a reconstruction map of 3.4 Å. To polish the resolution, we performed dose weighting using MotionCor2 by discarding the first two and last fourteen frames in each stack to generate a reduced dataset with total dose of 30 e−1 Å2 which generated a better density map of 3.2 Å. In the density map, we noticed that distal regions of CH1 and CL of two antibodies were much flexible and they had no interactions with the NA which would affect the alignment during reconstruction. Thus, we performed particle signal subtraction to focus on the NA and scFvs of two antibodies for another round of local refinement which yielded a final map with 3.0 Å resolution. The local resolution maps were evaluated by ResMap49.Model building and refinementThe structure of NA and 1G01 complex (PDB: 6Q23) was rigidly docked into the EM density maps using CHIMERA50. The structure of 18_14D was predicted using AlphaFold2 and then fitted into the EM density maps. The side chains were manually adjusted to improve the local fit using COOT51. The coordinates were refined against corresponding maps in real space using PHENIX52, in which the secondary structure restraints and Ramachandran restraints were applied. The stereochemical quality of each model was assessed using MolProbity. Structural figures were prepared by Pymol (https://pymol.org/) and CHIMERAX53.Statistical analysisAll statistical tests were performed as described in the indicated figure legends using GraphPad Prism software. The number of independent experiments performed is indicated in the relevant figure legends. No samples were excluded from the analysis.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

All of the sick people had contact with infected cattle on nine different farms.So far, all patients have had mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis. None of the people were hospitalized.Shipping delays and federal holiday slow confirmationShipping delays late last week and today’s federal holiday mean that the specimens are expected to arrive at the CDC early this week.California reported its first outbreak in dairy cattle in the Central Valley in late August, but the state—the nation’s largest dairy producer—has quickly become the hardest hit. So far, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed 100 H5N1 cases in dairy herds.If the CDC confirms California's five probable cases, the state’s number of infections in dairy workers would rise to 11. And if confirmed, the new cases would lift the national total since the first of the year to 25.

Herein, we characterized transcriptomic profiles of CD4+ T cells isolated from 234 recipients (≥ 65 years) of either MF59Flu or HDFlu vaccine, prior to vaccination and 28 days thereafter. We identified 412 and 645 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD4+ T cells of older adults after receiving MF59Flu and HDFlu, respectively. DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients were enriched in 14 KEGG pathways, all of which were downregulated. DEGs in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients were enriched in 11 upregulated pathways and 20 downregulated pathways. CD4+ T cells in both vaccine groups shared 50 upregulated genes and 75 downregulated genes, all of which were enriched in 7 KEGG pathways. The remaining 287 and 520 DEGs were specifically associated with MF59Flu and HDFlu, respectively. Unexpectedly, none of these DEGs was significantly correlated with influenza A/H3N2-specific HAI titers, suggesting these DEGs at the individual level may have a limited role in protection against influenza. Our findings emphasize the need for further investigation into other factors influencing immunity against influenza in older adults.

This high burden stems from a combination of chronic comorbidities and the lower effectiveness of influenza vaccines in older adults1, which is in turn driven by impaired immune responses with aging of both B and T cells to immunization in a phenomenon known as immunosenescence2,3,4,5. With an increasing portion of older adults in the global population, from 10% in 2022 and projected to be 16% in 20506, it is increasingly important to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms for impaired immune responses to influenza vaccines in this vulnerable group.To compensate for the lower effectiveness of influenza vaccines, two enhanced influenza vaccines, MF59-adjuvanted (MF59Flu) and high-dose (HDFlu) influenza vaccines, are preferentially recommended for older adults in the United States. MF59Flu contains 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) of each viral vaccine strain and is adjuvanted with MF59, a squalene-based, oil-in-water nanoemulsion. HDFlu is formulated with 60 µg of HA per viral strain and does not contain any adjuvants. A recent study examining both MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccines has found that both vaccines enhanced both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, compared to standard influenza vaccine7, confirming results from previous studies evaluating each vaccine separately8,9,10,11,12,13. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that MF59Flu and HDFlu had similar effectiveness in the prevention of seasonal influenza in the elderly14, which was consistent with results of a randomized clinical trial in which MF59Flu and HDFlu were found to induce similar rates of seroconversion against all vaccine viral strains15.Serum antibody titers are the only currently accepted correlate measure of vaccine effectiveness; in older adults, however, cellular responses to influenza have also been associated with protection16. Previous studies have also found that T cell responses were boosted by MF59Flu17, but not by HDFlu18, as compared to standard-dose influenza vaccine. Given that CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in protective immunity against influenza19,20,21, we hypothesized that the transcriptomic characteristics of CD4+ T cells may be differentially influenced by MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccination. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by comparing gene expression in CD4+ T cells isolated prior to immunization (Day 0) and 28 days post-immunization (Day 28) in older (≥ 65 years) recipients of either MF59Flu or HDFlu.ResultsSimilar demographics in two vaccine groupsThe demographics of our study participants are summarized in Table 1 of our previous publication22. Briefly, of 250 participants recruited for this study, 234 met all inclusion criteria and completed two blood draws. The included cohort consisted of 146 (62.4%) females, 1.7% Hispanic participants, and 0.4% African Americans with the remainder being Caucasian, reflecting the demographics of the local community (Olmsted County, MN). An equal number (n = 117) of participants received MF59Flu and HDFlu. Participants in both vaccine groups had a median age of 71 years. Other demographic variables, including height, weight, body mass index, race, were comparable between participants of the two vaccine groups, as previously described22.Table 1 Influenza H3N2-specific HAI titers in MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccine groups. The Wilcoxon ranked sum test was used to assess differences in HAI titer between the vaccines (MF59Flu vs. HDFlu) groups. Fisher’s exact test for count data was applied for HAI seroconversion.Full size tableSimilar levels of HAI titer induced by MF59Flu and HDFluInfluenza-specific antibody responses were quantified by the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, as described previously in our publication22. We focused on the influenza A/H3N2 strain in our assay, given its significantly greater impact on older adults23,24 and lower vaccine effectiveness against this viral strain25. At baseline (Day 0), participants in both vaccine groups had median HAI titers of 1:40, which similarly increased to a median titer of 1:80 at Day 28 (Table 1). Using a standard 4-fold increase in HAI titer as a threshold of seroconversion26, 29 (26.4%) and 42 (37.2%) participants in MF59Flu and HDFlu group achieved seroconversion, respectively (Table 1).Differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipientsWe compared gene expression levels in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu or HDFlu recipients at Day 0 and Day 28 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of 10,633 transcripts that met inclusion criteria (see Statistical Analysis), 182 and 230 genes were upregulated and downregulated (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1), respectively, in CD4+ T cells of the MF59Flu recipients (Supplemental Table S1). Among these DEGs, the top 10 upregulated genes (HIST1H1D, LCN12, RP11-220D10.1, RP11-577H5.1, SH2D1B, SHD, SMAP2, TLR7, TXNIP, XKRX) and the top 10 downregulated genes (CCL20, DNAJA4, FAM222A, HSP90AA1, HSP90AA2P, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA6, HSPH1, and PNLDC1) are displayed in Fig. 1A and B, respectively. Pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that these DEGs were enriched in 14 KEGG pathways, including endocytosis, prion disease, necrosis, MAPK signaling pathway, measles, toxoplasmosis, antigen processing and presentation, IL-17 signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, spliceosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, longevity regulating pathway, legionellosis, and lipid and atherosclerosis (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, all these enriched pathways exhibited a high degree of interconnectivity (Fig. 1D) and all were suppressed upon receiving MF59Flu (Fig. 1C).Figure 1Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients.

D) Enrichment map shows a close interconnection among these enriched pathways.Full size imageDEGs in CD4+ T cells of the HDFlu recipientsA larger number of DEGs were identified in CD4+ T cells of the HDFlu recipients, compared to the MF59Flu recipients. As such, of 645 DEGs identified in the CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients, 256 and 389 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively (Supplemental Table S2). The top 10 upregulated (CDO1, CLIC3, GUCY2D, LCNL1, NCAM1, NLRP7, PAPLN, PLS3, RP11-490K7.4, and TXNIP) and downregulated genes (ADRA2B, EPAS1, FAM222A, FGF18, HIST1H2BJ, LRRN1, PDE4C, PMEPA1, PNLDC1, and SEMA3B) are displayed in Fig. 2A and B, respectively. These DEGs were enriched in 11 activated KEGG pathways involved in a variety of physiologic processes including immune function (graft-versus-host disease, B cell receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, allograft rejection, hematopoietic cell lineage) and 20 suppressed KEGG pathways, including pathways in cancer, immunologically important signaling pathways (MAPK signaling pathway, hippo signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway), and response to infection (human papillomavirus infection, legionellosis) (Fig. 2C). An enrichment map demonstrated a moderate degree of interconnection between these pathways (Fig. 2D).Figure 2Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients.

D) Enrichment map shows a moderate interconnection among these enriched pathways.Full size imageShared and vaccine-specific gene expression signatures in CD4+ T cellsWe explored shared and vaccine-specific DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients. We found that CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients shared 125 DEGs, including 50 upregulated and 75 downregulated genes (Fig. 3A, Supplemental Table S3). Interestingly, the most significant DEGs (q-value < 0.01 in both vaccine groups) had similar expression patterns in both vaccine groups, including three up-regulated genes TXNIP, AMIGO1, and SESN1 and five down-regulated genes WDR47, RRP12, DYRK3, CACYBP, and UAP1 (Fig. 3B). We also found 7 shared KEGG pathways between CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients, including lipid and atherosclerosis, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK signaling, longevity regulation, estrogen signaling, legionellosis, and necrosis (Figs. 1C and 2C, and 3C). Of these 7 shared suppressed pathways, 5 pathways (legionellosis, estrogen signaling pathway, longevity regulating pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum) were highly interconnected (Figs. 1D and 2D). Meanwhile, 287 and 520 DEGs were vaccine-specific, in response to MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccinations, respectively (Fig. 3A).Figure 3Vaccine-specific and shared DEGs between CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients. A) Venn diagram of vaccine-specific and shared DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients. “MF59Flu-Up”: upregulated genes in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients; “MF59Flu-Down”: downregulated genes in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients; “HDFlu-Up”: upregulated genes in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients; “HDFlu-Down”: downregulated genes in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients. B) Shared DEGs between CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients. These shared DEGs were selected based on q-value (< 0.01) in both vaccine groups. Among these shared DEGs, 3 (TXNIP, AMIGO1, and SESN1) and 5 (WDR47, RRP12, DYRK3, CACYBP, and UAP1) genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. C) Venn diagram of vaccine-specific and shared KEGG pathways involving DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu and HDFlu recipients. All DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients were enriched in 14 suppressed pathways. “MF59Flu-Suppressed”: suppressed KEGG pathways involving DEGs in CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients; HDFlu-Suppressed”: suppressed KEGG pathways involving DEGs in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients; HDFlu-Activated”: activated KEGG pathways involving DEGs in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients.Full size imageCorrelation between gene expression and HAI titerWe further explored the correlation between the differences (Day 28 - Day 0) in gene expression in CD4+ T cells and the change (Day 28 - Day 0) in HAI titer. In CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients, the change in expression of only one gene (RBM42, encoding for RNA binding motif protein 42) was significantly correlated (FDR = 0.0789) with the difference in HAI titer (Supplemental Table S4). None of the genes exhibiting vaccine-induced changes in the CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients were significantly correlated with HAI titer (Supplemental Table S5).DiscussionCD4+ T cells are orchestrators of adaptive antiviral immunity with effector and helper functions, supporting B cells to produce high affinity and long-lived antibodies27,28, but their activities are reduced with aging29. Since the two influenza vaccines recommended for older adults use different molecular mechanisms of action to enhance immunogenicity, finding similarities and differences in CD4+ T cell transcriptomic responses to these two vaccines may provide insights to potentially improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in older adults. In addition, results from recent studies have suggested a difference in cellular responses induced by the two vaccines17,18, which were directly correlated to protection in older adults16. Our study of the transcriptional activity occurring in CD4+ T cells may provide genetic and therefore mechanistic insights into these differences.In particular, our gene expression analysis demonstrated both vaccine-specific and shared patterns of transcriptomic responses in CD4+ T cells across the two vaccine groups (Fig. 3A). Aligned with the results from a previous study15, MF59Flu and HDFlu induced similar levels of antibody responses in our study cohort (Table 1). Since CD4+ T cells provide costimulatory signals to B cells for the optimal generation of pathogen-specific antibodies28, the 125 shared DEGs identified in our study may explain the similar vaccine effectiveness seen clinically, and the equivalent seroconversion rates induced by MF59Flu and HDFlu observed in this study (Table 1) and by others14,15.However, our data also demonstrated that only a small portion (26.4% of MF59Flu recipients and 37.2% of HDFlu recipients), achieved seroconversion (Table 1). In addition, none of 7 shared KEGG pathways (between two vaccine groups) were directly related to known influenza-associated and/or antiviral/immune response pathways, rather they reflected basic cellular activities/functions such as protein processing, kinase signaling cascades, etc30,31. More importantly, none of the DEGs in either vaccine group was associated with an increase in HAI titer (Supplemental Table S1, S2, S4, S5). One possible explanation for this is that both vaccines failed to properly engage CD4+ T cell responses, leading to low seroconversion rates observed in this study. Alternative explanations also exist; it is possible that the influence of helper T cells on humoral immunity occurs soon after vaccination and T-cell gene expression at Day 28 is not related to antibody response at that point in time. Our data may also suggest that different regulatory mechanisms are at work in controlling the immune response to influenza vaccination in older adults.MF59Flu takes advantage of the MF59 adjuvant to trigger innate immune responses32,33, thereby mediating a stronger humoral response against influenza virus in older adults9,10. However, we did not observe the activation of any innate immune pathways in the CD4+ T cells of MF59Flu recipients at Day 28 post-vaccination (Fig. 1C). HDFlu is not formulated with any adjuvants, but has a four-fold higher dose of HA antigen34. We found that 20 of 31 KEGG pathways associated with DEGs in CD4+ T cells of HDFlu recipients were suppressed and none of 11 activated pathways were among the known influenza-associated pathways30,31,35. It is worth noting that among suppressed pathways in both vaccine groups were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and necrosis signaling pathways. MAPK signaling pathway plays a critical role in the transduction of extracellular signals and in the activation of cellular programs, including proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, in response to these extracellular signals in mammalian cells36. Necrosis, by releasing heat shock proteins, activates the NF-kβ pathway and delivers maturation signals to dendritic cells, and therefore is associated with host antiviral activities37,38,39. In fact, genes encoding heat shock proteins were among the top downregulated genes in this study (Figs. 1B and 2B). Therefore, suppression of these signaling pathways by both MF59Flu and HDFlu was an unexpected finding, and it may provide molecular insights explaining the low seroconversion rate of these two vaccines observed in this study.The strength of our study lies in our study design with sex- and age-block matched individuals recruited for each vaccine group. Our study design helps to minimize the confounding effects of demographic factors on immune responses40,41,42. However, even the relatively big sample size of our study design may not be optimal to detect differences in the levels of antibody response conferred by the two vaccines in older adults (i.e., we did not find statistically significant differences in the HAI titers). In addition, we characterized both transcriptomic responses in CD4+ T cells, a key cell type orchestrating adaptive antiviral immunity and modulating B cell activity and antibody responses. Therefore, our results provide an overall snapshot of CD4+ T-cell transcriptional activity at specific timepoints pre/post-vaccination, and information on the correlations between transcriptional responses and antibody responses induced by MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccination in older adults.Our study also has some limitations. First, the transcriptomic profiles of CD4+ T cells are affected by the timing of blood sampling. We sampled blood at 28 days after vaccination, a time at which the antibody responses to influenza vaccines would have peaked. However, the transcriptomic responses in CD4+ T cells and innate immune responses would logically peak earlier; therefore, the largest changes in transcriptomic characteristics in these cells may not have been captured in this study. Second, it is likely that poor adaptive immune responses are influenced by increased age-related inflammation, commonly referred to as “inflammaging”43. However, in this study, we did not characterize the inflammatory state of our participants. Follow-up studies should consider incorporating the inflammatory state as a confounder when analyzing immune responses in older adults following influenza vaccination. Third, older adults may receive multiple doses of influenza vaccines over the years, leading to the presence of pre-existing immunity that could influence subsequent immune responses to MF59Flu and HDFlu vaccination (e.g., immune imprinting or original antigenic sin)44. Another possibility is the induction of immune tolerance, similar to the desensitization used for allergens. This induced tolerance has been noted after both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccinations45,46,47,48. However, while we noted that higher pre-existing HAI titers correlated with lower response to vaccination, as has been observed by multiple groups49,50,51, we did not conduct a detailed evaluation of the impact of pre-existing influenza-specific antibody in this study.In conclusion, our data demonstrated vaccine-specific and shared transcriptomic characteristics in CD4+ T cells induced by two enhanced influenza vaccines, MF59Flu and HDFlu, recommended for older adults. The shared DEGs and their associated pathways may explain the similar HAI titers observed in both vaccine groups. However, our results also suggest that CD4+ T cell responses were poorly activated by vaccination. Such new information is critical and will assist future development of efficacious influenza vaccine for older adults.MethodsThe methods used in this study are similar or identical to the methods previously published in our studies22,41.Ethics statementThis study enrolled human participants and was approved by The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB# 17-010601). All protocols were performed under the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). All participants provided their written, informed consent before participation in any study-related procedures.Study participants and influenza vaccinesA total of 250 healthy older adults (≥ 65 years) were recruited into this study during the period of August to December 2018. The study participants were randomly allocated to receive either MF59-adjuvanted (MF59Flu, commercially named as Fluad) or high-dose (HDFlu, commercially named as Fluzone) influenza vaccine during the same influenza season. Both influenza vaccines were formulated with HA from three viral strains (i) A/H1N1 (A/Michigan/45/2015/pdm09-like strain), (ii) A/H3N2 (A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016-like strain), and (iii) B lineage (Colorado/06/2017-like Victoria lineage strain). During the period of this study, data from study participants were excluded from analyses if they exhibited influenza-related symptoms.Blood samplesBlood samples were collected and processed as detailed in our previous publication41. Briefly, blood from each study participant was sampled at two time points: i) before immunization (Day 0) and 28 days after immunization (Day 28). Blood was sampled into 2 different tubes for 2 different assays: (i) BD Vacutainer® tubes containing lithium heparin as the anticoagulant for the isolation of peripheral bone mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (ii) BD Vacutainer® tubes containing clot activator for the preparation of serum. PBMCs were isolated by gradient centrifugation in Ficoll Paque Plus tube (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), resuspended in a freezing media (20% heat-inactivated FCS, 10% DMSO in RPMI) at 1 × 107 cells/mL, and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. To prepare serum, blood was allowed to clot for 15 min and then centrifuged at 2000×g for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, serum was collected from the supernatant phase and stored at -80 oC for future use.Influenza hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assayThe titer of antibodies specific to influenza A/H3N2 virus (A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016/H3N2 strain) was quantified by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, as reported in our previous publication22. We chose the influenza A/H3N2 as vaccine strain for HAI assay, given its deleterious impact on older adults23,24 and lower vaccine effectiveness against the influenza A/H3N225. Briefly, sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) from Vibrio cholerae filtrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to eliminate non-specific inhibitors of hemagglutination. Treated sera were two-fold serially diluted with PBS in a V-bottom 96-well plate. Diluted sera (25 µL) were mixed with 25 µL of standardized influenza A/H3N2 virus solution containing 4 hemagglutination units (HAU) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, a 0.5% turkey red blood cell suspension (50 µL) was added to the mixture. The HAI titer was determined after a 45-min incubation and defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited hemagglutination. All dilutions were tested in triplicate. A positive pooled control serum was run with each batch of samples. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the HAI assay in our laboratory was 2.9%52.mRNA sequencingNext-generation mRNA sequencing in CD4+ T cells was performed using protocols as described previously53,54,55. Briefly, CD4+ T cells were first isolated from PBMCs via negative selection using the Miltenyi Biotec’s T cell isolation kit (catalog no. 130-096-533). Total RNA was extracted from isolated cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (catalog no. 74134) and Qiagen RNAProtect reagent (catalog no. 76104). The quantity and quality of extracted RNA were assessed by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and Agilent 2010 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) assays. The TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Library Prep v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to create cDNA libraries following the manufacturer’s protocol at Mayo Clinic’s Gene Sequencing Core Facility. Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 S2 Reagent Kit (100 cycles) was used to perform paired-end read sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Instrument. The MAP-RSeq version 3.0 pipeline was used to align reads using STAR to the hg38 human reference genome, and gene expression counts are obtained via feature counts utilizing the gene definition files from Ensembl v7856. Conditional Quantile Regression (CQN) was used for normalization57.Statistical analysisGenes with all zero counts were filtered out before normalization. After filtering, only “protein-coding” and “processes-pseudogenes” genes on chromosomes 1–22 and X were included. Conditional quantile normalization (CQN) was used to normalize the RNA-Seq data58. Genes with median count less than 16 at each timepoint were excluded from testing along with genes less than the 20th percentile of coefficient of variation post normalization. Subjects from each vaccine group were analyzed separately to identify differences in transcriptomic responses in CD4+ T cells. Specifically, negative binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with gene counts as response and visit as the predictor variable were used to identify genes showing differential expression between the two timepoints. The offset from CQN was used to normalize the data and an exchangeable correlation was used to account for within subject correlation59. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted using the ClusterProfiler package in R60, and the online KEGG module and pathway data sets61,62,63. Spearman’s rank correlation test was used to access the association between change in HAI titer and CQN-normalized gene expression. False discovery rate (FDR) control (Storey’s q-value method) was used to correct for multiple testing and an FDR < 0.1 was used as a threshold for statistical significance64,65.

In response to these emerging zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), working with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) through their joint initiative, the WOAH/FAO Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza (OFFLU), plays a critical role in global influenza surveillance and response efforts.Since 2011, FAO and WOAH, through OFFLU, have been contributing to the bi-annual World Health Organization (WHO) Vaccine Composition Meetings (VCMs). These meetings are crucial for assessing and updating candidate vaccine viruses for zoonotic influenza strains, which pose pandemic risks to humans. During the most recent meeting in September 2024, OFFLU provided valuable data on avian and swine influenza viruses that are circulating in animal populations worldwide, bringing crucial insights from the animal health sector to inform public health strategies. OFFLU's contributions enhance the tripartite collaboration between FAO, WOAH, and WHO, ensuring a coordinated and comprehensive approach to zoonotic disease surveillance. This collaboration involves the efforts of FAO and WOAH country offices, WHO Collaborating Centers (WHO CCs), OFFLU network laboratories, research programs, and global partners. Also, key platforms and databases—such as Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), GISAID, EMPRES Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i+), and World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS)—facilitate data sharing and reporting.Monitoring avian and swine influenza trends Between February and September 2024, 843 outbreaks of avian influenza were reported worldwide, with OFFLU analyzing more than 14,225 sequences of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses. These outbreaks affected regions including Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas, and even Antarctica. In the same period, over 1,009 swine influenza detections were reported globally across 15 countries and three continents. These detections involved 32 different lineages of the virus, highlighting the genetic diversity and ongoing evolution of swine influenza strains. OFFLU partners were instrumental in collecting and analyzing this data, ensuring swift responses to outbreaks. The data provided by the network allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how these zoonotic viruses evolve and spread. This is essential for identifying appropriate candidate vaccine viruses, which in turn are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response. After consultation, WHO proposed three new CVVs. A/Cambodia/SVH240441/2024-like CVV for Gs/Gd lineage clade 2.3.2.1c viruses, A/Jiangsu/428/2021-like CVV for H10 viruses, and A/Pennsylvania/27/2024 CVV for H1 clade 1A.1.1.3 variant viruses. Fostering international collaboration on zoonotic influenza OFFLU's role extends beyond data collection and analysis—it serves as a platform for fostering international collaboration between laboratories, research institutions, and government agencies. This cooperative approach enables member states to share critical epidemiological and genomic data, ensuring that health experts have the most up-to-date information to monitor and address zoonotic threats. This strengthens both animal and human health policies, reinforcing the importance of the One Health approach. Through the joint efforts of FAO, WOAH, and WHO, significant progress has been made in understanding the antigenic diversity of influenza viruses, leading to more targeted vaccine recommendations. FAO’s contributions ensure that timely, effective vaccines are developed, minimizing the impact of these viruses on both animal and human populations.

Given frequent spillovers and high mortality among mammals, coupled with our inability to predict which clade of H5 virus has pandemic potential, cross-clade protective HPAI H5 vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of a lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccine modality to induce cross-protective immunity against lethal HPAI virus infection.

Since then, the viruses have diversified into different antigenic clades, threatening wild and poultry birds and causing sporadic infections in humans with high mortality1. In 2016, HPAI H5 viruses of the clade 2.3.4.4b were first detected in Europe. The virus actively reassorted with different neuraminidases (NA) such as N6, N8 and N1 NA and spread globally, causing mortality among multiple species of wild and farm mammals/birds as well as sporadic human cases1,2. Meanwhile, HPAI H5 viruses of clades 2.3.2.1a and 2.3.2.1c have been circulating in poultry in Southeast Asian countries, leading to human fatal cases3,4,5,6,7. Given the recent global outbreaks of HPAI H5 viruses in wild birds and mammals, the risk of more frequent spillover to humans has increased. The most effective countermeasure to reduce influenza disease severity is vaccination; accordingly, vaccines that can mount cross-protective immunity against different clades of H5 viruses are urgently needed.We generated a monovalent lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA (LNP-mRNA) vaccine candidate encoding hemagglutinin (HA) from the clade 2.3.4.4b A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 (ch/Ghana) virus (DS8390). BALB/c mice (N = 5) were intramuscularly mock-immunized or immunized with 1 or 10 μg of DS8390 twice with a 2-wk interval (Fig.1a). At 2 wks after the second immunization, sera and spleens were collected. HA-binding IgG antibody titers were analyzed in an ELISA against the vaccine-homologous ch/Ghana HA and a heterologous HA from A/India/SARI-4571/2021 (India/S4571; H5N1 virus of clade 2.3.2.1a). India/S4571 HA has 43 amino acid substitutions compared to ch/Ghana HA (Supplementary Fig. 1). Binding IgG antibodies against the homologous ch/Ghana HA were significantly induced in a DS8390 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b), whereas the binding titers against the heterologous HA were lower compared to the homologous HA, as anticipated (Fig. 1c). Neutralizing antibody titers were also analyzed. Although the CPE-based neutralizing titer against the authentic virus was below the detection threshold in the assay, possibly due to the high replication efficiency of the virus, when we used pseudotyped virus bearing the homologous ch/Ghana HA, neutralizing antibodies were elicited in sera with a high dose (10 μg) of DS8390 (Table 1). We also examined antigen-specific splenic T-cell responses. Single cell suspensions (splenocytes) were prepared from spleens of individual animals, and were re-stimulated with the vaccine antigen-homologous ch/Ghana recombinant HA protein or heterologous India/S4571 HA in vitro. After a 3-day incubation, the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting cells were detected at equivalent levels with homologous or heterologous HA stimulation in an ELISpot assay (Fig. 1d, e), suggesting that T-cell responses were mounted at similar levels against homologous and heterologous HAs.Fig. 1: Immunogenicity of LNP-mRNA-H5HA vaccine in mice.a Timeline of mouse immunization. Groups of BALB/c mice (7-wk-old females; N = 5/group) were intramuscularly (i.m.) mock-vaccinated or vaccinated with 1 or 10 μg of DS8390 by using a prime & boost regimen. Two weeks after the boost immunization, serum was collected and single cell suspensions (splenocytes) were prepared from spleens of individual animals. Binding antibody titers against the homologous ch/Ghana HA (b) or heterologous India/S4571 HA (c) in sera were analyzed in an ELISA. Area under the curve (AUC) values for individual animals were plotted. Bars show the median of the groups. Splenocytes (2 × 105 live cells/well) were stimulated with 3 μg of the homologous ch/Ghana HA (d) or heterologous India/S4571 HA protein (e) at 37 °C for 3 days. IFN-γ-secreting cells were detected by use of an ELISpot assay. Statistical analyses were performed by use of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and corrected for multi-group comparisons by using Dunnett’s test. (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. n.s., not significant).Full size imageTable 1 Neutralizing antibody titers in pre-challenge sera analyzed in a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay with authentic virus or an assay with pseudotyped virusFull size tableFinally, we examined the protective effects of DS8390 against homologous or heterologous HPAI H5 virus challenge. BALB/c mice were immunized by the same vaccination regimen as used previously. Pre-challenge sera analysis at 2 wks post-boost (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1) showed similar results as the immunogenicity assay (Fig. 1). At 3 wks post-boost, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of homologous ch/Ghana virus or heterologous India/S4571 virus (Fig. 2a). The vaccinated animals were all protected from ch/Ghana virus, showing no body weight loss even with the low-dose (1 μg) vaccination, whereas the mock-vaccinated animals all died or were euthanized due to severe ( > 25%) weight loss or neurological symptoms by Day 10 post-challenge (Fig. 2b, c). Upon challenge with the lethal dose of heterologous India/S4571 virus, the vaccinated animals all survived regardless of whether they were vaccinated with the high (10 μg) or low dose (1 μg) of DS8390 whereas the mock-vaccinated animals all died by Day 10 post-challenge (Fig. 2d, e). These results demonstrate that the LNP-mRNA-H5HA vaccine potently induced cross-protective immunity in vivo.Fig. 2: Protective efficacy of LNP-mRNA-H5HA vaccine against homologous or heterologous virus challenge.a Timeline of the virus challenge study. Groups of BALB/c mice (7-wk-old females; N = 5/group) were intramuscularly (i.m.) mock-vaccinated or vaccinated with 1 or 10 μg of DS8390 by using a prime & boost regimen. Pre-challenge sera collected 2 wks post-boost were analyzed in an ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 2) and a neutralization assay (Supplementary Table 1). At 3 wks post-boost immunization, the animals were intranasally (i.n.) challenged with 10 MLD50 of homologous A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 (ch/Ghana; 6.1 × 102pfu/animal) virus (b, c) or heterologous A/India/SARI-4571/2021 (India/S4571; 3.2 × 102pfu/animal) virus (d, e). Survival rate (b, d) and body weight change (c, e) were monitored for 14 days (% compared to Day 0; mean + SD).Full size imageSerum binding antibodies were observed at higher levels against vaccine-homologous clade HA than heterologous HA (Fig. 1b, c), whereas the elicited spleen T-cell responses were similar levels against homologous and heterologous HA (Fig. 1d, e). Neutralizing antibodies titers were detected with pseudotyped virus, but were below or around the detection threshold with authentic homologous virus (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1), possibly due to the high replication efficiency of the virus in cells. A previous study found that binding antibody responses were induced against diverse H5 virus strains in vitro8. Here, we demonstrated that animals vaccinated with DS8390 are protected from a lethal homologous or heterologous virus challenge (Fig. 2), which may indicate that the T-cell immunity elicited by DS8390 is involved in protective immunity in vivo. Recent studies by other groups also showed that T-cell immunity induced by mRNA-based vaccine contributes to protective effects against H5 virus infection8,9,10. Our data demonstrate that DS8390 can induce potent cross-clade anti-HPAI H5 protective immunity against lethal infection in mice, validating the applicability of the LNP-mRNA vaccine modality for preparedness against the increasing risk of spillover events of HPAI viruses to humans and potential transmissibility among humans.MethodsCellsMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% newborn calf serum (NCS) and 1% Penicillin/streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293 T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Lenti-X 293 T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/streptomycin. MDCK-SIAT1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 Geneticin, 10% FBS, and 1% Penicillin/streptomycin .VirusesH5N1 viruses [A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 (H5N1; clade 2.3.4.4b), and A/India/SARI-4571/2021 (H5N1; clade 2.3.2.1a)] were generated by reverse genetics11 with synthesized gene fragments cloned to pHH21 plasmids based on the sequences from GISAID, and were propagated in MDCK cells in MEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5 µg/mL N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. The experiments with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were performed in enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories at the University of Tokyo, Japan, which are approved for such use by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Japan.Pseudotyped virusesA pseudotyped virus bearing the HA and NA proteins from the A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 strain was generated in Lenti-X 293 T cells by co-transfection with four plasmids: pCAG-H5HA and pCAG-N1NA containing the coding sequences of the H5-HA and N1-NA proteins, respectively; the lentiviral backbone plasmid pCI-neo synHIVgp-RRE, carrying the gag and env genes of HIV; and the pGreenFire Transcriptional Reporter Lentivector, which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the firefly luciferase reporter. Supernatants containing the pseudotyped H5N1 virus were collected 48 h after transfection and filtered. The TCID50 value of the pseudotyped virus was determined in MDCK-SIAT1 cells by measuring luciferase reporter activity.Preparation of DS8390T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription in vitro was used to synthesize the mRNA from a linearized DNA template, in which the open-reading frame of the human codon-optimized HA gene from A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021(H5N1; clade 2.3.4.4b) was flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and a poly-A tail. Messenger RNA for the HA was purified and then encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of ionizable lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid.Animal experimentsThe experiments with mice were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Animal Experiment Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo (approval number: PA20-06). Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia with isoflurane, and animals were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia with isoflurane to minimize any suffering after virus infection.Mouse immunizationBALB/c mice (7-wk-old females; obtained from Japan SLC, Inc.) were anesthetized with isoflurane and intramuscularly mock-immunized with vehicle buffer [10 mM histidine, 300 mM sucrose (pH 7.0)] or immunized with 1 or 10 μg of DS8390 in 20 μL twice with a 2-wk interval between immunizations for immunogenicity analysis and for virus challenge studies.Immunogenicity analysis in immunized miceFor the humoral immunity and T-cell response analysis, the immunized mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 2 weeks after their second immunization with DS8390, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture under deep anesthesia. After euthanasia by cervical dislocation, spleens were collected to prepare single cell suspensions.Micro-neutralization assayVirus neutralizing antibody titers against H5 influenza viruses were evaluated in serum samples. Serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka seiken) at 37 °C for 20 h, inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h, and diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two-fold serial dilutions of sera were prepared in MEM, and each dilution was incubated with the same volume of virus diluent (100 TCID50/50 µL) in MEM containing 1 µg/mL of TPCK-trypsin at room temperature for 1 h. The serum/virus mixture was added to 100% confluent MDCK cells that were plated a day prior in 96-well plates. The cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C and then cytopathic effect (CPE) was microscopically assessed by eye. Virus neutralization titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely prevented CPE. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate for geometric mean titers.Pseudotyped virus neutralization assaySerum neutralizing activity against the pseudotyped virus bearing HA and NA protein from H5 influenza viruses was evaluated. Sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka seiken) at 37 °C for 18–20 h, inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, and diluted 1:10 in OPTI/MEM. Two-fold serial dilutions of sera were prepared in OPTI/MEM, and each dilution was incubated with the same volume of virus diluent (100 TCID50/50 µL) in OPTI/MEM at 37 °C for 30 min. The serum/virus mixture was added to 100% confluent MDCK-SIAT1 cells that were plated a day prior in 96-well plates. The cells were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C then luciferase activity was measured by using Bright-Glo Luciferase detection system (Promega). The luminescence signal was measured using a plate reader (BMG Labtech). Cut-off value to determine that the virus is not infected based was set on the value of the negative control well, and virus neutralization titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely prevented. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate for geometric mean titers.Recombinant protein expression and purificationTo construct expression plasmids for soluble-form recombinant HAs (rHA) of A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 or A/India/SARI-4571/2021, the HA signal peptide and ectodomain (amino acid residues HA1-1–HA2-176) with stabilizing mutations to form disulfide bonds (HA1-M30C and HA2-K51C) and a detoxified cleavage site (KRRKR/G was substituted with A/G; the slash indicates the cleavage site), followed by a T4 foldon trimerization domain and a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus, were cloned into pCAGGS plasmids. Proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified by using TALON metal affinity resin (TaKaRa Clontech).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The ELISA was performed using rHAs for mouse sera. The ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 µl of the antigen protein at a concentration of 2 µg/ml in PBS. After blocking with PBS containing 1% BSA, the plates with incubated in triplicate with heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 minutes) serum that was 5-fold serially diluted in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-BT). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) four times and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000 dilution in PBS-BT) at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the plates were washed four times with PBS-T, and developed with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate Solution (Thermo Scientific). After a 10-minute incubation, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 N sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured immediately at a wavelength of 450 nm.Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assayMultiscreen 96-well plates with PVDF membrane (Millipore) were coated with anti-mouse IFN-γ capture antibody at 4 °C for overnight, and blocked in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FCS for 2 h. To prepare single cell suspensions from spleen, the spleen of each mouse was individually cut into 2–3 mm pieces, incubated with collagenase D in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) at 37 °C for 30 mins, and gently mushed on a 70-µm cell strainer (BD Falcon). The dissociated cells were centrifuged, treated in 1X RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 2 mins, and washed in HBSS. The cells were then re-suspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 1X MEM non-essential amino acid solution (Gibco), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco), and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Live cell numbers were determined by using trypan blue staining. Then, 2 × 105 live cells/well from each animal were plated in the pre-coated assay plates with 3 µg of the homologous ch/Ghana rHA or heterologous India/S4571 rHA protein in 120 µL of RPMI media and cultured at 37 °C for 3 days. The plates were then washed in water and processed to stain spots by using the mouse IFN-gamma ELISpot kit (BD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained spots were counted by use of an ImmunoSpot analyzer (CTL).Virus challenge of immunized miceFor virus challenge studies, blood was collected from the immunized animals via the submandibular vein under anesthesia with isoflurane at 2 weeks after the second immunization. At 3 weeks after the second immunization, the mice were intranasally infected with 10 mouse median lethal dose (MLD50) of A/chicken/Ghana/AVL-76321VIR7050-39/2021 (H5N1; clade 2.3.4.4b), or A/India/SARI-4571/2021 (H5N1; clade 2.3.2.1a). Body weights and survival rates were monitored daily for 14 days. Mice with more than 25% body weight loss or with neurological symptoms were euthanized by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia with isoflurane.

shares plungePublished Wed, Oct 16 202410:21 AM EDTUpdated Wed, Oct 16 202412:16 PM EDTAnnika Kim Constantino@annikakimcWATCH LIVEKey PointsNovavax said the Food and Drug Administration has put a hold on its application for a combination shot targeting Covid and influenza and a stand-alone flu vaccine, sending shares of the company down sharply. The so-called clinical hold is due to a single report of nerve damage in a patient who received the combination shot in a phase two trial that finished in July last year. it appears to be a setback for the biotech company, which is scrambling to bring new products to market as demand for its Covid vaccine plummets worldwide.In this articleNVAXFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTA health worker prepares a dose of the Novavax vaccine as the Dutch Health Service Organization starts with the Novavax vaccination program on March 21, 2022 in The Hague, Netherlands.Patrick Van Katwijk | Getty ImagesNovavax on Wednesday said the Food and Drug Administration has put a hold on its application for a combination shot targeting Covid and influenza and a stand-alone flu vaccine, sending the company's shares down sharply. The biotech company's stock fell nearly 20% on Wednesday. The so-called clinical hold is due to a single report of nerve damage in a patient who received the combination shot in a phase two trial that finished in July last year. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to a manufacturer to delay or suspend a proposed clinical investigation on a drug.It is unclear if the pause will impact Novavax's ability to start and release data on phase three trials on those vaccines. Still, it appears to be a setback for the biotech company, which is scrambling to bring new products to market as demand for its Covid vaccine plummets worldwide.Novavax said it was working with the FDA to resolve the clinical hold on its combination shot and stand-alone flu vaccine. The company said other trials of its Covid and flu shots had not shown any safety concerns related to the type of nerve damage reported in the patient. Novavax said it does not believe there's an established connection that the vaccine had caused the nerve damage in the patient, but said it is working to provide more information to the FDA.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article Data from the southern hemisphere show that this year's flu shot was 34.5% effective against hospitalization in high-risk groups during that half of the globe's winter respiratory season. It's not possible to say exactly how that will translate to the northern hemisphere's upcoming flu season, but the figure is in the ballpark of recent vaccine effectiveness for this half of the world. The CDC conducts studies each flu season to determine how well vaccines are working, and makes those data public on its website -- and it's clear that the 34.5% effectiveness rate is comparable to recent figures:2021-2022: 36%2022-2023: 30%2023-2024: 42% Overall, however, influenza vaccine effectiveness seems to be on the decline from earlier years, peaking at 60% effectiveness in 2010-2011, followed by 56% in 2009-2010 and 52% in 2013-2014. Following an abysmal 19% effectiveness rate in 2014-2015, effectiveness remained in the 40% range for another 2 years, but fell into the 30% range thereafter and never pushed out of it until last winter season. (Vaccine effectiveness for 2020-2021 was never estimated because of low viral circulation due to COVID pandemic precautions.) Kawsar Talaat, MD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, told USA Today that the 34.5% effectiveness from the southern hemisphere is "a little bit disappointing," adding that physicians would like it to be closer to 50%. Indeed, if the trend tracks last year, the U.S. could be looking at a far less successful vaccine effectiveness this winter season. For winter 2023 in the southern hemisphere, vaccine effectiveness was about 52% against hospitalization, according to CDC data. However, last year's U.S. winter respiratory season saw an influenza vaccine effectiveness that was 10 percentage points lower. This year's southern hemisphere data came from more than 2,500 hospitals in five countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- and was reported earlier this month in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Most of those countries used trivalent vaccines, but Paraguay used the quadrivalent shot that also targeted the B/Yamagata lineage. When analyzed by influenza subtype, effectiveness against the predominant circulating strain A(H3N2) was 36.5%, while against A(H1N1)pdm09 it was 37.1%. The paper also found that vaccine effectiveness was 58.7% among people with comorbidities, 39% among young children, and 31.2% among older adults. The authors concluded that the findings suggest "influenza vaccines are effective in preventing approximately one third of influenza-related hospitalizations among groups prioritized for vaccination" and that they "support CDC and [World Health Organization's] recommendation that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months should receive influenza vaccination."

Oct 16, 2024, 08:14 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX GAITHERSBURG, Md., Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX), a global company advancing protein-based vaccines with its Matrix-M™ adjuvant, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has placed a clinical hold on Novavax's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for its COVID-19-Influenza Combination (CIC) and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates. The clinical hold is due to a spontaneous report of a serious adverse event (SAE) of motor neuropathy in a single CIC Phase 2 trial participant outside of the U.S. who received the vaccine in January 2023. The trial completed in July 2023 and the participant reported the SAE in September 2024. "We are working closely with the FDA to provide the necessary information that will allow them to better understand this observation and resolve the clinical hold," said Robert Walker, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Novavax. "It is important to note that safety is our top priority, and while we do not believe causality has been established for this serious adverse event, we are committed to working expeditiously to fulfill requests for more information from the FDA. Our goal is to successfully resolve this matter and to start our Phase 3 trial as soon as possible." Data from Novavax's previous COVID-19 and influenza trials have shown no signals for motor neuropathy. Investigators have been informed of this action. The COVID-19 IND for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine is not impacted by the clinical hold. About Novavax Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) promotes improved health by discovering, developing and commercializing innovative vaccines to help protect against serious infectious diseases. Novavax, a global company based in Gaithersburg, Md., U.S., offers a differentiated vaccine platform that combines a recombinant protein approach, innovative nanoparticle technology and Novavax's patented Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance the immune response.

It causes high mortality in wild and domestic bird populations, leading to significant social and economic costs and threatening rare and important wild bird species.Since 2020, a new clade of HPAI virus has spread worldwide, reaching North America in late 2021 and South America in October 2022. Non-avian species have also been affected, including wild and domestic mammals such as sea lions and cows.To address the challenge arising from the spread of the virus, a robust One Health approach is essential. Veterinarians and other animal health professionals play a critical role in preventing, detecting, controlling, and eradicating the disease. When the risk of avian influenza is high and outbreaks occur, the demand for skilled professionals rapidly increases. These experts must be well trained to detect the disease, collect samples for laboratory confirmation, and protect themselves from infection.Virtual learning: a game-changer in disease controlVirtual learning allows for simultaneous, cost-effective training of large numbers of people in multiple languages. It reaches individuals in remote areas who may lack to traditional training due to travel or connectivity issues, as courses are designed for offline when needed and on mobile device.In early 2021, the FAO Virtual Learning Centers (VLCs), in collaboration with the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (FLI), launched a course on avian influenza preparedness. This tutored-led course facilitates rich interactions with experts, covering both theorical and practical aspects of outbreak investigation, birds handling, personal protective equipment use, and other important tasks that animal health workers must perform in the field. So far, eleven editions of this course have been delivered in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian, with more than 1000 professionals completing them.In parallel, the VLCs developed a shorter open-access course to raise awareness and provide basic knowledge on avian influenza for professionals working with birds, including veterinarians, veterinary paraprofessionals, and farmers. Available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, this course has already been completed by nearly 1600 individuals.The latest addition is the on-vaccine stewardship in prevention and control of high pathogenic avian influenza. The course, designed for animal health services fighting to control the disease, has been piloted in the Asia and the Pacific region. Around100 people have completed this essential training, with plans to adapt it for other regions.Next steps: building capacity for the futureVLCs will continue developing courses to address gaps in the fight against avian influenza and other transboundary animal diseases (TADs). Beyond training, VLCs foster communities of practice (CoPs), where experts can share and develop knowledge on One Health issues. Avian influenza is one such focus, allowing professionals to collaborate on more effective control measures. VLCs serve as virtual classroom where ideas turn into, bringing knowledge from the screen to the field!

Medscape Medical NewsInternational ApprovalsNew Flu and Updated COVID Vaccines Greenlighted by EuropeAnnie Lennon October 18, 2024 00Europe's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended granting marketing authorization for two vaccines: Fluad (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) and Flucelvax (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures) for active immunization against influenza. Together, the vaccines can immunize children from 2 years and older, adults, and those with comorbidities — including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity — against influenza.The CHMP also recommended a revised composition for Nuvaxovid, an already approved vaccine that targets the JN.1 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The news follows recommendations by the European Medicines Agency Emergency Task Force to update COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024/2025 vaccination campaign.The committee further recommended updating the composition of Bimervax, a similarly approved vaccine that targets the Omicron XBB.1.16 SARS-CoV-2 subvariant. All four recommendations are now pending approval from the European Commission. Both Fluad and Flucelvax are administered by injection from pre-filled syringes and contain hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface antigens that have been purified from 3 inactivated strains: two A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B type (Victoria lineage). They induce the production of neutralizing antibodies against viral hemagglutinin to protect against influenza viruses. Unlike Flucelvax, however, Fluad also contains the adjuvant MF59C.1, which enhances the immune response and, accordingly, the vaccine's efficacy. Fluad The CHMP's decision on Fluad follows a phase 3 randomized, controlled trial that compared the immunogenicity and safety of Fluad, an adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, with a non-adjuvanted standard dose of Fluarix Tetra. A total of 2044 adults aged 50-64 years old were recruited for the trial and given either one of the vaccines. Ultimately, Fluad produced a stronger immune response in participants with medical comorbidities and those who had not recently been vaccinated against influenza. Safety data matched that from previous studies of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. The findings supported the use of Fluad for people aged between 50-64 years old, and particularly those with comorbidities. The most frequent side effects of Fluad included pain and tenderness at the injection site, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and arthralgia. FlucelvaxUnlike Fluad, multiple randomized controlled trials show that Flucelvax can protect adults and children from 2 years of age against seasonal influenza. Results from multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrate that Flucelvax reduces influenza risk by 54.6% and 69.5% among any circulating strains for those aged between 2-17 years old and 18 years and older, respectively.It was more effective for vaccine-matched strains, reducing risk by 63.6% in those aged between 2-17 years, and 83.8% among those aged 18 and older. Rates of adverse effects varied among different age groups. However, common reactions included tenderness, erythema, pain, and headache. Detailed recommendations for both Fluad and Flucelvax will be described in the summary of product characteristics, which will be published in the European public assessment report in all official European Union languages. NuvaxovidThe recommendation of an updated formula for Nuvaxovid comes after non-clinical datathat showed the updated vaccine provides cross-reactivity against JN.1 and numerous JN.1 lineage viruses such as KP.2.3, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and LB.1. Data from clinical trials show that the vaccine's most common side effects include vomiting, muscle pain, joint pain, injection site pain and tenderness, fatigue, and malaise. The adjuvanted 2024-2025 formula has been authorized for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration for individuals aged 12 years and older. BimervaxBimervax is a COVID-19 vaccine for use among people aged 16 years and older. The vaccine contains a lab-produced protein that carries parts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived from the alpha and beta variants. It also contains an adjuvant. It can be used as a booster among people who have previously received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is currently not recommended for people younger than 16 years old. The vaccine has also not yet been studied in immunocompromised people or in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Common side effects to the currently approved version of the vaccine include pain at the injection site, headache, tiredness, and muscle pain. Annie Lennon is a medical journalist.

News By Marilyn Perkins published 17 October 2024 Many factors affect the infectious period of seasonal influenza, commonly called "the flu," but there are some good rules of thumb for when it's safe to return to work or school. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It can be hard to know exactly how long a person will be contagious with the flu, but researchers have identified some important factors. (Image credit: izusek via Getty Images) For the average healthy adult, the flu can be disruptive — long days of sore throat, fever and coughing cause people to miss school and work, and also just feel miserable. But for very young children, older adults and people with certain health conditions, seasonal flu can lead to serious complications, a hospital stay or even death — tens of thousands of people die of seasonal flu each year in the U.S.To cut down on flu hospitalizations and deaths, people who catch the flu should do their best not to pass the infection to others. But how long is someone with the flu contagious?A good rule of thumb is to wait at least 24 hours after your flu symptoms have subsided to interact with other people, said Dr. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health."If you're a day without symptoms after the flu, you should be pretty safe at that point," Milton told Live Science. But there's some nuance to how long someone might be contagious, and there's ongoing debate about exactly how the flu spreads.Related: Flu shot lowers hospitalization risk by 35% in vulnerable groups, data hintRespiratory viruses such as influenza spread through three main pathways: viruses left on surfaces that people accidentally touch, larger droplets expelled onto a person through coughing or sneezing, or in tiny airborne particles released through breathing. Experts think people spread the flu primarily through the latter two routes — large and small droplets — but contaminated surfaces can still be a source of transmission.The specifics and relative importance of each transmission pathway remain big topics of research in the field, Milton said. Virus transmission is tricky to study in a controlled environment — the research that yields the most useful information requires finding volunteers willing to catch the flu for science.

The chances of spreading the illness fall after this peak, but adults can still remain contagious five to seven days after their symptoms appear.The picture is more complicated for adults with certain health conditions, such as those that compromise immune function. People with weakened immune systems can take longer to fight off an influenza infection, so they may remain contagious longer than is typical. Conditions such as diabetes, which also affects immune function, may also influence how long someone sheds the virus, Milton said.For children, the picture is also complicated — kids are prolific flu spreaders for a reason. Like adults, they're most likely to pass on the flu during the first few days of illness, but children can remain contagious for about one or two weeks after their symptoms start. Milton said this is likely because children's immune systems don't have as much experience overcoming the virus as adults' do, because on average, they've been exposed to flu viruses and flu vaccines fewer times.Notably, the varieties of flu that spread change year to year, and this can lead the disease to be more or less transmissible in a given season, Milton noted. Circulating flu viruses mutate slightly every year, which is why the annual flu shot must be updated routinely. Some years, the predominant viruses do a better job of bypassing the immune system's learned defenses, so infected people may remain contagious longer, he said.Related: At-home flu vaccine approved by FDA — what to knowThe flu vaccine is a great way to lower your chances of getting severely ill if you get the flu. But it likely won't do much to change how contagious you are."It's not clear that the current vaccines do very much for that," Milton said. "They mainly keep you from dying of it and keep you out of the hospital, but it doesn't appear that they do a very good job of preventing you from spreading it." However, he added this is still a big question that influenza researchers are striving to answer.The most difficult aspect of preventing flu transmission is stopping the spread that happens before a person develops symptoms. Similar to what happens in COVID-19 infections, people start shedding enough flu virus to infect others about one day before symptoms start.That's why respiratory viruses like the flu and coronaviruses are so hard to control, Milton said — you're dealing with discreet spread that happens when virus levels are still pretty low and people's symptoms are mild or nonexistent. But new research could one day counter that spread.RELATED STORIES—Scientists find secret 'back door' flu viruses use to enter cells—Flu shots have changed this year — here's why—Scientists find secret 'back door' flu viruses use to enter cellsScientists are investigating how a protein on the surface of flu viruses, called neuraminidase (NA), contributes to transmission. The body makes some antibodies against NA after a flu infection, and evidence suggests people with higher levels of NA antibodies may be less likely to pass the virus on.Flu vaccines have traditionally focused on a different flu virus protein, called hemagglutinin (HA), rather than NA. If future research confirms the importance of NA, finding a way to boost people's NA antibody levels could be one way to slow the chain of flu transmission, Milton said.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Avian influenza has spread to 100 dairies in California and 300 nationwide, according to the US Department of Agriculture. There have been 19 confirmed human cases this year among farm workers exposed to sick poultry or dairy, including the six confirmed cases in California this month. The risk to the general public from bird flu remains low and pasteurized dairy products are safe to consume, federal officials have said. Specimens from the five possible cases are being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation and are expected to arrive early this week, said the California Department of Public Health. The possible and confirmed cases originated on nine different dairy farms and the individuals had mild symptoms and were not hospitalised, the state said.

The FDA has placed a hold on the investigational new drug (IND) application for Novavax’s COVID-19 and influenza combination vaccine candidate, as well as a standalone influenza vaccine candidate. The hold does not affect the standalone COVID-19 vaccine.The FDA’s decision follows a report of a serious adverse event from a patient outside the US who took part in a phase 2 trial with the combination vaccine that had been completed in July 2023.The participant, who received the vaccine in January 2023, reported developing a case of motor neuropathy in September this year. This report led the FDA to halt the development of the vaccine to investigate whether the adverse event could be related to the vaccine candidate.Robert Walker, Chief Scientific Officer of Novavax, stated that the company has no reason to believe this adverse event was caused by the vaccine. No other cases of motor neuropathy have been reported in previous clinical trials evaluating the combination COVID-19 and influenza vaccine."We are working closely with the FDA to provide the necessary information that will allow them to better understand this observation and resolve the clinical hold," said Walker. "It is important to note that safety is our top priority, and while we do not believe causality has been established for this serious adverse event, we are committed to working expeditiously to fulfill requests for more information from the FDA. Our goal is to successfully resolve this matter and to start our phase 3 trial as soon as possible."The results of the completed phase 2 trial with both the combination and standalone influenza vaccine were positive. For the influenza vaccine candidate, the response was significantly higher than that of Novartis’ Fluad and Sanofi’s Fluzone, two commercially available influenza vaccinesNovavax had plans to launch a phase 3 trial of both the combination and standalone influenza vaccine later this year, which may be affected by the clinical hold placed by the FDA.The news comes as the company executes a strategy to reduce annual expenses and R&D costs by more than 50% — including two layoffs that reduced its workforce by approximately 30%​ at the beginning of this year.

That also involved a commercial layer operation in Franklin County, with that case involving 1,015,500 birds.More information on Utah infectionThe Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) earlier reported that HPAI had been confirmed in a commercial egg laying operation in Cache County, Utah. A spokesperson for UDAF said that about 1.8 million hens were involved. APHIS has since included information about the Utah situation on its website, revealing that 1,852,900 hens were involved.Prior to the Washington and Utah flock infections, the last instance of HPAI in a U.S. commercial poultry flock was confirmed on September 18, in a commercial meat turkey flock in Merced County, California.

An adult in the Charlotte metropolitan area died due to complications of influenza during the second week of October. To protect the privacy of the family, additional information will not be released.“This is a sad reminder that influenza can be a very serious illness,” said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D., MPH. “Taking preventative measures against flu and other respiratory illnesses like getting vaccinated, regularly washing hands, covering your cough and staying home when sick are important to help protect you and your family.”Influenza, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are expected to increase over the coming months. Vaccinations are the best way to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death from these infections. Vaccinations are especially important for those at higher risk of severe viral respiratory disease, including people 65 years and older, children younger than 5, pregnant women, those with a weakened immune system and those with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease and obesity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all people aged 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. RSV vaccinations are also recommended to protect older adults 75 years and older, adults 60-74 years who are at increased risk of severe RSV, and pregnant women during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy to protect infants. Parents should talk with their health care provider about other options to protect infants from severe RSV disease. Flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccinations are available at pharmacies, private medical offices, some federally qualified health care centers and local health departments. These vaccines can be administered at the same visit. To find a vaccine near you, visit www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines.Early testing and treatment with an antiviral drug can help prevent respiratory infections from becoming more serious. Treatments work best if started soon after symptoms begin. If you begin to feel sick, contact your doctor right away to see if you need treatment with a prescription antiviral drug. Treatment is especially important for those who are hospitalized, people with severe illness, and those who at high risk of serious complications based on their age or medical conditions.In addition to vaccines and treatment, the following precautions should be taken to protect against the spread of respiratory viruses:Regularly wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based cleaner or sanitizer to prevent the spread of viruses to othersAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouthClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects that may be contaminatedCover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then discard the tissue promptlyStay home when sick, except to seek medical care or testing, and take steps to avoid spreading infection to others in your home, including:Staying in a separate room from other household members, if possibleUsing a separate bathroom, if possibleAvoiding contact with other members of the household and petsNot sharing personal household items, like cups, towels and utensilsWearing a mask when around other peopleFor more information on respiratory viruses, including how to access vaccines, testing and treatment in your community, visit www.vaccines.gov/en/, flu.ncdhhs.gov or covid19.ncdhhs.gov.

CONTRIBUTED PHOTO > < By MARA MELLITS For the Recorder Published: 10-13-2024 9:59 AM Modified: 10-13-2024 4:44 PM Agriculture animals FARMING Massachusetts facebook Earlier this year, a nationwide outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in cows caused panic for dairy farmers everywhere. Now, Massachusetts has become the only state to test all of its dairy herds, from 95 farms, and achieve 100% negative results for the virus. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, also known as bird or avian flu, often results in death for poultry. According to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, cows that contract the virus exhibit lethargy and show reduced milk production for a few weeks. There have also been several cases of dairy farm workers who have contracted the virus and experienced flu-like symptoms from coming into contact with unpasteurized milk. The virus was first detected back in March in dairy cows in Texas. According to MDAR, it spread to herds in at least 14 states after that. “It’s so new this year that they’re still figuring out what the ideal host is and how it’s spreading,” said MDAR Commissioner Ashley Randle. “It’s hard to say how common it is.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state Department of Public Health consider the public health risk to be low, but are preparing in case that changes. MDAR collaborated with DPH, the Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and the Broad Institute to fight the outbreak. “We as an organization really want to make sure that we’re all in this together. And there’s a certain risk to everybody,” said Mark Duffy, who serves on the board of Massachusetts Association of Dairy Farmers and operates Great Brook Farm in Carlisle. “In the scheme of things, we are all family dairy farms in Massachusetts.” Massachusetts is the only state in the country to yield a 100% negative result, however, despite the result, testing is ongoing, Randle said. MDAR is still testing herds and will continue to test this month, at no cost to the farmers. “We must remain vigilant and continue monitoring farms across the state to protect animal and public health,” DPH Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said in a statement. “This is a great example of how collaboration across government and with communities can result in better health and maintain the integrity of the local dairy industry.” Article continues after... Yesterday's Most Read Articles Your Daily Puzzles Cross|Word Flipart Typeshift SpellTower Really Bad Chess Randle said MDAR is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have a national model that states can follow. “It does take quite a bit of staff time and capacity to travel to all the herds and do testing,” Randle said. “We’re hoping that the processors will be able to assist when they’re picking up milk from the farms, to be able to take the samples as well.” Duffy said state milk inspectors come in and pull samples out of the tank where the milk is stored. “We really stress that the milk supply is safe,” Duffy said. “This is to prevent it from spreading in the dairy herd, which, if it was to occur, and it has not occurred, would have an impact on our cows.” Andrea O’Brien of O’Brien Farm in Orange said because her farm produces raw milk, she’s already used to the milk getting tested every month, so it didn’t have an impact on her farm. Yet, O’Brien said because of the size of her farm, she knows right away when something isn’t normal. “If we have a sick cow, we know right away, whereas if you’re milking 10,000, you don’t have the same sort of management,” O’Brien said. Peter Laznicka and Kat Chang operate Reed Farm in Sunderland, a small-scale poultry farm and processor. They have to take strict biosecurity measures to ensure their 10,000 chickens don’t get sick. Chang said the two are always thinking about preventing illness. They take measures to make sure they are not cross-contaminating and keeping the area clean. “We’re just very careful. We make sure any birds that show up are healthy,” Laznicka said. Randle said the virus in cattle spreads when moving in between herds. She said the size of the herds doesn’t matter but the movement of the cattle and the hygiene of the equipment is what counts. She said the virus was first detected in cows in Texas due to animals that had moved from one farm to another. “All it takes is one animal to move that has the presence of the virus, or workers that may be working on different dairy farms, or going from a poultry operation to a dairy and back again,” Randle said. Randle said because Massachusetts was the first state to yield a 100% negative result, it set a model for other states to follow. She attributed success to starting a partnership with farmers and public health officials early and keeping all lines of communication open.

Shenoy, MD, PhD; Katherine Rose, MD Oct 18, 2024 5 minute read Patient Care Infectious Diseases Health & Wellness share on facebook share on linkedIn share on X, formerly known as Twitter share by email print article The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu vaccine for anyone aged 6 months or older, with very few exceptions. The flu can cause serious illness, hospitalization, and even death. The flu vaccine reduces the risk of those outcomes. Not only does the flu shot protect you from getting sick, it also helps protect the people in your community. “Patients who are older, pregnant, immunocompromised, and very young children are especially at risk of serious outcomes from the flu. By getting the flu vaccines, individuals can reduce their risk of severe illness should they get the flu, and protect those around them,” says Erica S. Shenoy, MD, PhD, chief of Infection Control at Mass General Brigham and an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Annual flu shot efficacy Annual flu shots are very effective and each year are reformulated to provide protection against the most likely circulating strains of the virus. Some people who get the flu vaccine, but still come down with the flu, might think that the vaccine doesn’t work well. “That’s actually not true,” says Dr. Shenoy. “Study after study has shown that people who get the vaccine and become infected with influenza have less severe disease. In fact, last year, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was 54% for preventing illness requiring a visit to the emergency department or other outpatient setting, and 71% for preventing symptomatic illness among children and adolescents. This year, the CDC has been describing how the vaccine converts flu from ‘wild to mild,’ and that’s a great description.” Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Division What is the best time to get a flu shot? Flu season typically runs from October to May, and in previous years has peaked in the early part of the year. However, in 2022-2023, it came early. “The CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine in September or October to give you protection for the entirety of the flu season,” says Dr. Shenoy. “Last year the flu season started earlier than usual, and that happened again in the Southern Hemisphere this past summer, so there’s a chance it will come early again this year.” Once you get the vaccine, it takes your body about 2 weeks to build a complete immune response.” For kids, aged 6 months to 8 years, you need to plan ahead. That’s because kids in this age group may need 2 doses, 4 weeks apart, depending upon prior influenza vaccination. “It can get a little complicated, so even though I’m an infectious diseases doctor, when I’m being ‘mom,’ I look up the latest recommendations each year.” To learn more about dosing for this age group, you can view the CDC's recommendations. By getting the flu vaccines, individuals can reduce their risk of severe illness should they get the flu, and protect those around them. Erica S. Shenoy, MD, PhD Chief of Infection Control Mass General Brigham How long is the annual flu shot effective? The immunity from your flu shot should last for the full duration of the flu season. “You are protected for the current flu season, but each year, you’ll need to get your shot to stay protected,” explains Dr. Shenoy. Is the annual flu shot safe? The flu shot has been extensively studied and is safe. It’s been used for over 50 years and hundreds of millions of Americans have received it. Like many vaccines, you can have some side effects, such as soreness from the shot, a headache, fever, nausea, and muscle aches. These are generally mild and go away in a few days. Despite these symptoms, you can’t get the virus from the vaccine. Learn about where to get a flu shot Contributor Erica S.

F.D. Richards/Flickr cc The state’s latest outbreak occurred at a farm in Clinton County, which is near Lansing. Michigan has now reported 30 outbreaks in dairy cattle.Testing at the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory initially identified the virus, and samples will be sent for confirmation testing to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory.If confirmed as H5N1, the detection would push the number of US outbreaks in dairy cattle to 306 from 14 states.USDA confirms more detections in Florida dolphinsIn other avian flu developments, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed three more H5N1 detections in bottlenose dolphins, which were sampled last December and January. All involved animals are from Brevard County.The H5N1 detections in US dolphins are the first since 2022, when the virus was found in a bottlenose from Florida’s Dixie County. The clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus is known to infect sea mammals, including seals and sea lions, among several other mammal species. CDC issues interim recommendations to prevent sexual Oropouche virus spread News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Oropouche Virus The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday said it has received reports of 90 imported Oropouche virus from 5 states, mostly from Florida, and it also issued recommendations for male travelers to prevent possible sexual spread. Tiffany Claiborne/Flickr cc The group has warned about the risk of infected pregnant women passing the virus to their fetuses and the possibility of poor fetal outcomes. In its latest update, the CDC also acknowledged the risk of sexual transmission, raised in a recent scientific report, but said no sexual transmission cases have been reported. In new interim recommendations to prevent sexual spread for travelers to affected areas, the CDC recommends that men diagnosed with Oropouche infections use condoms or abstain from sex for 6 weeks from the start of symptoms.For those with Oropouche symptoms during travel or within 2 weeks of travel, the CDC recommends talking to a healthcare provider about testing or consider using condoms or abstaining from sex for 6 weeks since the start of symptoms.For those planning to donate semen, the CDC said that until more is known, men who have Oropouche symptoms should wait 6 weeks before donating. Those who were potentially exposed during travel should consider waiting 6 weeks after returning from travel to donate.Ecuador and Guyana report first Oropouche virus casesTwo new countries in the Americas region—Ecuador and Guyana—have reported their first locally acquired Oropouche virus cases, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said in its monthly update. Since the group’s last update in September, 423 new cases have been reported from 7 countries. The majority were from Brazil, followed by Cuba, which has also reported three cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome linked to the disease. The United States reported 69 imported cases. Since the first of the year, 10,275 cases of Oropouche virus, spread by some midge and mosquito species, have been reported from 9 countries. Severe fetal outcomes, including fetal death and congenital malformation, have been reported from Brazil and Cuba. Saudi study underscores risks of colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Stephanie Rossow / CDC A study in Saudi Arabia indicates that being colonized with a multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) is associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent MDRO infection, researchers reported this week in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.The study, conducted at a tertiary care facility in Riyadh, included patients in active surveillance testing (AST) for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Researchers at the hospital compared the risk of developing a relevant invasive infection within 365 days of the AST result between colonized and non-colonized groups. While previous studies have documented the link between MDRO colonization and increased risk of subsequent infection, the authors of the study note that little is known about the extent of MDRO colonization in Saudi Arabia's hospitals.VRE-colonized patients 22% more likely to develop VRE infectionA total of 19,134 ASTs conducted in 2021 were included in the analysis—4,919 for CRE, 8,303 for MRSA, and 5,912 for VRE. Nine percent of patients screened for CRE were colonized, compared with 10% for MRSA and 14% for VRE. Patient demographics were similar between colonized and non-colonized groups.Compared with the non-colonized group, patients colonized with CRE were 4.6 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 6.4) more likely to develop a CRE infection, with 88% of CRE-colonized patients developing an infection with the same carbapenemase gene. MRSA-colonized patients were 8.2 times (95% CI, 4.7 to 14.3) more likely to develop a MRSA infection than non-colonized patients, and VRE-colonized patients were 22 times (95% CI, 10.1 to 48.1) more likely to develop a VRE infection. The median time from AST to clinical infection was reduced for patients colonized with CRE and VRE, while MRSA-colonized patients took longer to develop a clinical MRSA infection compared with non-colonized patients.The authors say the findings highlight the need to implement AST for MDRO colonization and rigorous infection control measures to effectively mitigate transmission of these dangerous pathogens. California’s Baldwin Park dengue cluster grows by 2 News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Dengue iStock Los Angeles County, California, yesterday reported two more locally acquired dengue infections that are part of a cluster of cases from Baldwin Park, for a total of five since September 9.A case in Panorama City, located about 40 miles west of Baldwin Park, reported on September 25 and two cases in El Monte earlier in October aren't considered related to the Baldwin cluster. None of the affected patients had a history of travel to tropical regions endemic for the mosquito-borne virus."This small local outbreak raises concerns about the ongoing spread of dengue and the potential for spread to other areas of LA County," LA Public Health said on X. "Everyone in LA County should take action to prevent mosquito bites and mosquito breeding."On October 6, San Diego County announced the detection of locally acquired dengue in an Escondido resident. Pasadena and Long Beach, California, each reported one such case in fall 2023.Mosquito avoidance urgedIn the press release, Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County health officer, said mosquito-bite prevention "can be as simple as using insect repellent to prevent mosquito bites, eliminating any standing water around your home where mosquitoes can breed, and keeping your home mosquito-free by using or fixing screens on your doors and windows."This small local outbreak raises concerns about the ongoing spread of dengue and the potential for spread to other areas of LA County.Dengue fever typically causes no symptoms but may lead to high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and slight bleeding. In about 1 in 20 infections, it results in shock, severe bleeding, and organ damage. While no antiviral drug is available to treat dengue, there is a vaccine, but it is not approved for use in US travelers visiting but not living in an endemic area. Marburg treatment trials launch in Rwanda News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Marburg Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Rwandan scientists and partners from the World Health Organization (WHO) have launched the world’s first clinical trials for Marburg virus disease treatment. Currently, there are no approved treatments or vaccines against Marburg virus, though a clinical trial of an investigational Marburg virus vaccine from the Sabin Vaccine Institute recently launched in the country. XiXinXing / iStock Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, head of the WHO Africa regional office, said on X today that the clinical trial will test the efficacy and safety of remdesivir as well as MBP091, a monoclonal antibody that targets Marburg virus. The drug was developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical with support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR).Health ministry reports no new cases or deathsFor the third day in a row, Rwanda’s health ministry reported no new Marburg cases or deaths, keeping the outbreak total at 62 infections, 15 of them fatal. Since the outbreak was first announced, all new cases have been related to a hospital cluster and their contacts in Kigali. Officials said there is no evidence of community spread.Eight more people recovered from their illnesses. Health workers have also vaccinated 856 people as part of the clinical trial of the Sabin Vaccine Institute’s investigational Marburg virus vaccine.

Save this to read later. Send to email 6 Min Read • Published October 18, 2024 Diseases & Conditions • Story By Amanda Torres Recent outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry and dairy cows have drawn attention to the disease commonly known as bird flu. Bird flu typically spreads among wild birds and other animals like dairy cows and domestic poultry, but this year, more than two dozen people across the United States have been infected. Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 11 human cases in California and one in Missouri. The person in Missouri was the first to be diagnosed with the bird flu without having had known exposure to sick animals. But cases in humans remain rare — the people in California, Colorado, Texas, and Michigan who contracted the virus this year were all U.S. farm workers who were in close contact with infected animals, says the CDC. Dr. Magdalena Sobieszczyk “While the public health risk remains low at this time, the CDC is following the situation very closely,” says Dr. Magdalena Sobieszczyk, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The CDC is utilizing its flu surveillance system to track cases in humans and are working with states across the U.S. to help monitor people most at risk at this time, such as those who have been exposed to infected birds, or other animals, or environments with animals infected with the bird flu. Health Matters spoke with Dr. Sobieszczyk on what to know about the bird flu, such as the strains that are infecting humans, signs and symptoms, and whether it is safe to consume commercial milk. 1. The bird flu has not yet spread from human to human, but there was one case in a person without known exposure to infected animals. There are many types of bird flu, but the most common are H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses, which are found in wild birds. People become infected with the bird flu from close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or animals. So far, the virus has not spread from human-to-human. The person who was infected in Missouri had no immediate exposure to animals, but is recovered now and there was no ongoing transmission among close contacts, according to the CDC. 2. In humans, bird flu symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms include: Eye redness consistent with what we call conjunctivitis Fever Cough Sore throat Muscle aches Fatigue In more severe cases, the bird flu can cause respiratory infection, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, where the lungs get so inflamed that it is impossible for them to process oxygen. People may experience the same range of symptoms in traditional influenza A and influenza B, which is why we encourage people to get the flu vaccine to help prevent serious complications. Preventing seasonal influenza, especially in people who are exposed to the bird flu like farm workers, may reduce the risk of new strains of influenza emerging. 3. Commercial milk supply is safe to consume, says the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In April this year, concerns about bird flu in milk surged after strains were detected in samples of unpasteurized milk. But because the milk in grocery stores go through a pasteurization process, the FDA said it is safe to consume. The pasteurization process, which has been around for 100 years, removes harmful bacteria and viruses by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time to make milk safer, according to the FDA. Even if virus is detected in raw milk, pasteurization is generally expected to eliminate pathogens to a level that does not pose a risk to consumer health. Recently, the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture announced results of a study – published in the Journal of Food Protection in August 2024 – which further confirmed the effectiveness of the pasteurization process at removing the H5N1 virus in milk and other dairy products. 4. Detecting and treating the bird flu is similar to the regular flu. If you feel sick, speak with your doctor, and get tested. Chances are it could be other respiratory viruses like the regular flu, COVID-19, or RSV. Testing would be with a swab to look for viral particles that are present in the nasal secretions. Flu medication (antivirals) can treat bird flu in people and treatment works best when started as soon as possible after symptoms begin. 5. There are no vaccines for the bird flu but getting vaccinated with the regular influenza shot is recommended. There is work and research being done to develop an mRNA vaccine that could be used for the bird flu. There is a vaccine for influenza A and B — the viruses most commonly found in humans — but it is not protective against the H5N1 bird flu. We still do not have all the data yet on exactly how this bird flu differs genetically from human influenza A and B. While getting a seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against the H5N1 bird flu, we still recommend getting the shots. They protect us against the circulating forms of the regular virus. And flu vaccines are updated every year so that if there are new strains circulating, it will be incorporated into future vaccines. Although it is a rare and theoretical risk, it can also reduce the risk of getting sick with seasonal flu and the H5N1 bird flu simultaneously. Recently, the CDC announced that it would invest $10 million into buying and promoting seasonal flu shots and will work with state and local officials to get livestock workers vaccinated this fall. Other protective measures include choosing pasteurized milk and making sure poultry is properly handled and cooked. If you are a farm worker, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with dairy cows and other animals, and raw milk. Always wash your hands with soap. If you have symptoms, get tested and start treatment after talking to a clinician.

When it comes to infant hospitalizations, two out of three babies get RSV by age one.By Special to the Rio Grande Guardian ● South Texas Health System Press Release ● October 13, 2024 A sick child breathes in a nebulizer. (Photo credit: STHS) SOUTH TEXAS HEALTH SYSTEM IS HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF THE FLU VACCINE AS THE INFLUENZA SEASON RAMPS UP With a billion influenza cases reported globally each year, health experts are reminding the public that getting the flu shot is the best way to prevent influenza from spreading The fall and winter seasons are an exciting time of year as Rio Grande Valley residents prepare to celebrate the holidays, spend quality time with loved ones and enjoy a slight break from the scorching temperatures. But October through January is considered the peak season for the flu, a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs. Flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets when people with the illness cough, sneeze, talk or even sing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza can also be contracted by a person touching an infected surface then putting that same hand up to their eyes, nose or mouth. The onset of flu symptoms usually happens suddenly and can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches and fatigue. Influenza can cause mild to severe illness, even death. Complications from influenza can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions like congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes. Globally, one billion cases of influenza are reported each year, according to the World Health Organization, with three to five million of those cases being severe. Anyone can get the flu and serious problems related to the flu can happen at any age, per the CDC, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and children under the age of five. There are several ways to prevent the flu, like proper handwashing, staying home when sick and wearing a mask, but the most important step in prevention is to get the annual flu vaccine, which been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious complications that can result in hospitalization or death. A 2021 study conducted shows among adults hospitalized with the flu, vaccinated patients had a 26% lower risk of being admitted into the ICU and a 31% less risk of death from the flu. Safe and effective vaccines have been used for more than 60 years. Immunity from vaccination goes away over time, so getting the flu shot annually is recommended, especially since vaccines are updated routinely with new one developed that contain viruses matching those circulating. Everyone six months and older, with rare exceptions, should get a flu shot every year. South Texas Health System recommends that everyone get a flu shot that’s appropriate for their age and health status. STHS Clinics offers the flu shot at its family medicine clinics throughout the Rio Grande Valley. To find a location near you, visit STHSClinics.com/locations.

These studies will be presented this week at the IDWeek 2024 conference taking place in Los Angeles, California from October 16-19, 2024. This document provides more information about the CSL Seqirus data being presented at IDWeek 2024. For several flu seasons, influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. have been in decline.5,6 A dynamic model assessed eleven possible influenza vaccination rates, ranging from 20% to 70%, using data from two U.S. flu seasons (2011-2012 for low incidence and 2017-2018 for high incidence). An average vaccine effectiveness rate (VE) of 42% was used in the analysis, based on seasonal reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).1 Findings indicated that lower vaccination rates, such as the 2023-24 season rate of ≈35%, would put considerable pressure on the U.S. hospital system.1,7 In contrast, increasing the overall vaccination rate to at least 45% is needed to avoid the saturation of hospital resources, especially intensive care unit (ICU) hospital beds.1 "Evidence shows that higher influenza vaccination rates significantly reduce serious health consequences, including severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. These data underscore an urgent call to action to increase vaccination rates to at least 45% to avoid overburdening our health systems and ensure that our hospital resources, especially ICU beds, are not overwhelmed," said Joaquin Mould-Quevedo, Global Health Economic and Value Strategy Senior Director at CSL Seqirus. "At CSL Seqirus, we are committed to partnering with the healthcare community to reverse the decline in influenza vaccination rates and improve public health. We are proud to use the interactive dynamic model from this study to inform and support healthcare providers in their vaccination efforts." Story Continues Other studies being presented by CSL Seqirus at IDWeek include: Results from a retrospective test-negative design study of the 2022/23 season in the U.S. showed that cell-based quadrivalent (QIVc) vaccines prevented more outpatient test-confirmed influenza for those aged six months to 64 years compared with the egg-based quadrivalent (QIVe) vaccines.2 Results from a systematic literature review of reported effectiveness during the 2017 to 2020 influenza seasons revealed a higher relative effectiveness of QIVc over QIVe/egg-based trivalent (TIVe) vaccines for those aged 4 to 64 years across the three influenza seasons for both test-confirmed influenza and clinically diagnosed influenza.3 Results from a model study of the 2022/23 season in the U.S. estimated that a cell-based inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) would have averted a significant burden of influenza-related illnesses for those aged 0 to 64 years compared to an egg-based inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4).4 Results from a dynamic model study of the 2018 to 2020 influenza seasons in the U.S., calibrated with data from the CDC and published U.S. observational studies, indicated that QIVc was cost saving compared to the recombinant influenza vaccine (QIVr) for those aged 18 to 64 years and achieved comparable health outcomes results at a significant reduction in cost.8 These studies add to the growing body of evidence showcasing the benefits of cell-based influenza vaccines compared to standard-dose egg-based influenza vaccines, including the prevention of influenza infections and related complications.2,3,4,8 Moreover, the use of cell-based vaccines was estimated to be associated with substantial economic savings due to lower healthcare utilization and reduced direct medical costs.8 "The results from these studies, collected and analyzed over several recent influenza seasons, have shown that cell-based influenza vaccines are effective in preventing both test-confirmed and clinically diagnosed influenza," stated Mendel Haag, Senior Director, Center of Outcomes Research & Epidemiology at CSL Seqirus. "Data presented at this year's IDWeek further reinforce the importance of protecting people against influenza, particularly in our more vulnerable populations, including children as young as six months. This real-world evidence underscores the critical role of cell-based influenza vaccines in improving public health outcomes and easing the burden on healthcare systems during flu seasons." For more information about the data being presented at IDWeek 2024, refer to the related document. Study LimitationsThe above studies featuring RWE were subject to the typical limitations associated with retrospective cohort analyses. Unmeasured and residual confounding remain a potential source of bias as in all observational research. Additionally, vaccination in these observational studies was not randomly assigned. As with all simulations, analyses based on models have several limitations based on a model's parameters and available data, as well as annually varying vaccine effectiveness. Modeling may underestimate the true number of cases averted for several reasons and studies may not account for the indirect benefits of vaccination or capture potential variability between sub-groups. About Seasonal InfluenzaInfluenza is a common, contagious seasonal respiratory disease that may cause severe illness and life-threatening complications in some people.9 Influenza can lead to clinical symptoms varying from mild to moderate respiratory illness to severe complications, hospitalization and in some cases, death.9 Because transmission of influenza viruses to others may occur one day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick, the disease can be easily transmitted to others.9 Preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that during the 2023/24 influenza season, there were an estimated 390,000-830,000 influenza-related hospitalizations in the U.S.10 The CDC recommends annual vaccination for people aged six months and older, who do not have any contraindications.11 Since it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body that help protect against influenza virus infection, it is recommended that people get vaccinated before influenza begins spreading in their community.11 The CDC recommends that for most people who need only 1 dose of flu vaccine, vaccination should ideally happen in September or October.11 About CSL SeqirusCSL Seqirus is part of CSL (ASX: CSL).

News By Bryan Rocha, Nicoletta Lanese published 18 October 2024 Severe flu infections can lead to a range of deadly complications, especially in people whose immune systems are compromised by age or disease. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Seasonal flu infections can lead to dangerous knock-on complications, including overblown immune reactions, lung damage and heart inflammation. (Image credit: Kobus Louw via Getty Images) Each flu season, about 8% of people in the United States get sick with influenza. Most recover from the sickness, but thousands die annually of seasonal flu. In the last decade, there have been between 21,000 and 51,000 deaths from flu each season, with the exception of 2020-2021 when flu activity was unusually low.Certain groups are most likely to develop severe flu infections that could lead to death: children under 5, adults 65 and older, people with chronic health conditions and pregnant people.But how do people actually die of the flu?There are many ways people can die of the flu. Influenza viruses can inflict serious damage on a range of organs and systems throughout the body, including the lungs, heart, brain and overall immune system, said Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular, and developmental biology at Yale University and investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.Related: How long is the flu contagious?These life-threatening complications include pneumonia, which inflames the air sacs of the lungs and can cause them to fill with pus. Flu viruses can directly invade the lungs, causing what's called viral pneumonia. In addition, by damaging cells that line the respiratory tract, the viruses can open the door for bacteria in the body to overgrow, driving inflammation and possibly bacterial pneumonia."These are the bacteria that commonly colonize the upper respiratory tract of people without causing any disease," Iwasaki said. After someone gets the flu, these bacteria can gain a foothold in the lungs and multiply.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.That's partly because flu viruses make the cells lining the respiratory tract more vulnerable to bacterial penetration and infection, and then "bacteria can proliferate and cause damage more easily," Dr. Octavio Ramilo, chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told Live Science.Severe pneumonia can also cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which the lungs accumulate fluid, become stiff and can't expand well.Flu complications don't only affect the lungs, but also the heart. Myocarditis and acute pericarditis respectively inflame the heart's muscles and the sac that surrounds the organ. These conditions can affect the heart's ability to pump blood and disrupt its rhythm, sometimes with deadly consequences.Flu infections can spark myocarditis because flu viruses inflame and damage the cells that line blood vessels, Ramilo said. The exact cause for pericarditis is unclear, but the tissue typically becomes inflamed following a viral infection like the flu.Related: Could we ever eradicate the flu?In rare cases, the flu can also lead to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. This condition, which is estimated to occur in about 4 in 100,000 children in the U.S. each year, can lead to serious complications including convulsions, coma and death.Scientists don't know exactly how the flu leads to encephalitis, but a leading hypothesis suggests the infection causes the body to release a flood of cytokines, which are molecules that cause inflammation. These molecules can then enter the brain because the organ's protective barrier has been compromised, potentially by the cytokines themselves. However, more studies are needed to confirm that theory.Influenza can also lead to sepsis, a life-threatening, body-wide immune response. Flu viruses can trigger this immune reaction on their own, but they can also enable bacteria to enter the bloodstream by breaking down tissues in the body, Ramilo noted. Those bloodborne bacteria can then trigger sepsis. Some studies suggest influenza-associated pneumonia may raise the risk of sepsis up to sixfold, compared to a flu infection without pneumonia; that said, this complication is relatively uncommon overall.Young children are at higher risk of serious flu infections than your average healthy adult. Health officials recommend that everyone over the age of 6 months be vaccinated for flu each year. (Image credit: Europa Press News via Getty Images)Who is at highest risk of dying from the flu?A major reason why older adults, young children, people with chronic medical conditions and pregnant people are vulnerable to deadly flu complications is the state of their immune systems.Older adults experience senescence — essentially biological aging that leads to a decline in cell function that hinders the immune system, Ramilo said. In pregnant people, the immune system lowers its defenses so as not to attack the growing fetus. Thus, people become more vulnerable to flu-related complications during pregnancy, he explained.Young children's immune systems haven't encountered many germs before. "The immune responses to the [flu] virus have to be developed from scratch," Iwasaki said. Because a child's immune system has no memory of flu viruses, "the virus has the chance to multiply before the immune responses can catch up," she said.RELATED STORIES—At-home flu vaccine approved by FDA — what to know—The worst epidemics and pandemics in history—Why is the flu shot less effective than other vaccines?Chronic conditions — such as asthma, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS and cancer — raise the risk of flu complications by compromising either the immune or respiratory system, or both. The flu can also worsen chronic conditions, increasing the risk of death from other causes.Thankfully, flu vaccines can help prevent severe flu infections and their potentially deadly knock-on effects. For people who do develop severe flu infections, treatments like Tamiflu can dramatically lower the risk of death if provided quickly.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

CVS Health is offering the flu shots by appointment or walking in as health experts encourage people to get their flu shots in hopes of preventing a bad flu season. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services on Tuesday sent its annual warning to Montanans to prepare for the respiratory virus season, as the first influenza cases and the first hospitalization of the year have been reported during the past two weeks. The department said lab-confirmed cases of the flu have already been reported in recent weeks. The DPPHS respiratory illness dashboard showed there were 12 reported cases of the flu the first week of October and one reported hospitalization, along with 486 cases of Covid-19 – primarily in Blaine, Sheridan, Chouteau and Daniels counties. The dashboard shows health care workers performed 315 tests on people for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that same week, but none came back positive. The state’s dashboards contain information about Covid-19, the flu, RSV, outbreaks and emergency room data. This screenshot from the DPHHS respiratory illness dashboard shows influenza cases, hospitalizations and deaths over the past few years. (Screenshot via DPHHS) During the last respiratory illness season, which runs October through May, 900 people were hospitalized with the flu in Montana and 44 people died. More than 900 people were hospitalized for Covid-19, and 98 deaths were reported, and those figures do not include people who only tested positive for the viruses at home, according to DPHHS. There were a combined 35,000 cases of the two illnesses reported during the 2023-24 season. DPHHS says vaccination is “the best form of protection” against having more serious outcomes from the diseases, especially among people with weakened immune systems. Vaccines are available for most people for the three illnesses – RSV vaccines are available primarily for older Montanans and pregnant people – as well as pneumococcal pneumonia, and vaccination locations can be found on the government’s website. Montanans who do contract a respiratory illness are advised to stay home and away from others while sick, and to only return to daily activities at least 24 hours after they are fever-free and symptoms have subsided, according to DPHHS. People are also encouraged to wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when sneezing and coughing, and to use a face mask when indoors and around others more at risk of contracting a severe illness. As of late September, households can once again order four free Covid-19 tests from the federal government at covidtests.gov. At that website, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has information on older tests whose expiration dates have passed but which may still be usable.

The event provided a platform for in-depth presentations and discussions on the current global situation and latest developments to support control strategies and global interventions for these serious diseases. It was organized by Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), which is an FAO Reference Centre for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease.During the avian influenza (AI) focused sessions, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) outlined global efforts to prevent and control avian influenza outbreaks, particularly in regions most vulnerable to the disease. FAO emphasized its work in strengthening global surveillance and early detection systems, sharing insights into its collaboration with national governments. FAO’s Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) and Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) were recognized for their critical role in enabling early outbreak detection and response, reducing the economic and public health impacts of AI and supporting livelihoods.FAO also highlighted its capacity-building initiatives, helping countries enhance diagnostic capabilities and implement sustainable biosecurity measures. The One Health approach was showcased as essential to addressing the complex challenges posed by AI, and the new GF-TADs global strategy was presented as a way to advance efforts in controlling the disease.Highlights from the first day included an overview of the impacts of HPAI on wildlife and the catastrophic impact the disease has had on some populations of wild birds and mammals. Work was also presented on the current situation in the United States of America in both poultry and dairy cattle as well as the results of recent experimental work undertaken at Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI).On the second day, EFSA provided an overview of work they have conducted on surveillance strategies in vaccinated populations which was followed by the experience from France of vaccinating ducks against HPAI. There was also an update on a call from EFSA for an active surveillance network for wild birds in Europe and from IVSVe on their work on wastewater and environmental sampling. Discussions also addressed ND outbreaks in Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and Italy, emphasizing the need for coordinated international efforts.During the meeting, the important role of OFFLU, the joint FAO-WOAH network of expertise on animal influenza, was highlighted. In July 2024, FAO organized a face-to-face meeting of the network in Rome in July 2024, and recently supported OFFLU's contribution to the recent WHO Vaccine Composition Meeting in Melbourne, Australia. FAO has also collaborated with IZSVe since 2008 to support FAO in building diagnostic capacity through the organization of training and laboratory proficiency tests, particularly in Africa, and providing support to countries there encountering HPAI outbreaks through confirming the diagnosis and undertaking genetic sequencing to inform our understanding of the disease.The event showcased the importance of regional laboratory networks and international organizations in fostering international cooperation to protect both animal and public health across the European Union.

Questions & feedback See full transcript Chris Dall: Hello and welcome to the Osterholm Update, a podcast on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases with Doctor Michael Osterholm. Doctor Osterholm is an internationally recognized medical detective and director of the center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP, at the University of Minnesota. In this podcast, Doctor Osterholm draws on nearly 50 years of experience investigating infectious disease outbreaks to provide straight talk on the latest infectious disease and public health threats. I'm Chris Dahl, reporter for CIDRAP news, and I'm your host for these conversations. Welcome back, everyone, to another episode of The Osterholm Update podcast. Over the past year on this podcast, you may have noticed that we've been expanding the range of infectious disease topics we cover, both by choice and in response to world events. We live in a world where an infectious disease outbreak thousands of miles away can quickly become a threat in our own backyard. And we don't have to look too far back to be reminded of that. While we still spend a large amount of time on COVID-19 and will continue to do so. Outbreaks of infectious diseases around the world from H5n1 avian flu and US dairy cattle to Marburg virus in Rwanda have required us to broaden the scope of this podcast. To provide you with the information and context you need to understand what's going on and why it matters. So in this October 17th episode of The Osterholm Update, as we always do, we're going to start off with an update on COVID-19, but we'll also bring you the latest on H5n1 and the Marburg outbreak in Rwanda. Discuss a recent CDC report on flu vaccine efficacy. Take a look at the latest long COVID research, answer ID queries on COVID vaccines in Marburg, and examine the explosion of dengue cases in South America. And as always, we'll bring you the latest installment of This Week in Public Health history. But before we get started, we'll begin with Doctor Osterholm's opening comments and dedication. Dr. Osterholm: Thanks, Chris, and welcome back to all the podcast family, to another edition of trying to figure out what's important in public health infectious diseases for you. And I also want to welcome anyone who may be coming to the podcast for the first time. I hope we're able to provide you with the kind of information that you're looking for. As you noted in the introduction, Chris, one of the challenges we have putting together this podcast is actually determining what do we try to squeeze into an hour, what is helpful to our listeners in terms of what it means to their everyday lives? What is it? That's the curiosity that's happening somewhere halfway around the world, but nonetheless is a real interest. And so we're continuing to explore that. And we always welcome your feedback, always welcome your feedback of what topics we could or should cover, what it is that you've heard enough about and we can do less of. And so think about that. And again, this is a podcast family. We've come to understand the importance of sharing of information. And so we do look forward to hearing back from you about this. But before we get into all the topics that you highlighted, Chris, I want to take this dedication segment to acknowledge and extend our deepest sympathies to those across the country who are suffering from the aftermath of extreme weather events. It's been sobering to see how much destruction Hurricanes Helene and Milton brought to the southeastern part of our country. It will take a long time to fully realize the scope of the damage inflicted by these storms, but it's already been reported that over 230 people were killed in the six states hit by Hurricane Helene, and that more than 3 million Floridians lost power in the wake of Hurricane Milton. Dr. Osterholm: Between the news coverage of lost damage and recovery, there's been another threat of report catching my eye. Climate experts have been weighing in to describe just how much climate change and warming ocean temperatures contributed to the intensity of these storms. The hot water temperature in the Gulf of Mexico helped Helene and Milton intensify to high category storms very quickly. Warming air temperatures brought higher rainfall totals, and modeling showed that climate change drove maximum wind speeds to about 11% more intense in the case of Hurricane Helene. The World Weather Attribution report on climate change effects on Helene concluded that worsening climate conditions will lead to more and more frequent, devastating, larger hurricanes than we've ever seen in the past. This group came to similar conclusions when assessing the impact of storm bores that ravaged Central Europe in September. The extreme drought in agricultural regions of Italy, and this summer's super typhoon Carina that hit the Philippines. Climate change is increasing the frequency, scale and devastation of extreme weather events around the globe. The alarm bells of climate change could not be ringing more loudly. First of all, we recognize in many parts of the world, due to precipitation related issues and warming temperatures, mosquito vectors are now in population levels not previously seen, at least any time in modern history in many parts of the world, and climate change is contributing to that. Dr. Osterholm: We also can see the issue as related to water quality, and the fact that flooding events like this end up not only causing great physical damage, but also putting people at risk for unsafe water supplies or lack of sewer. And of course, we can't neglect to think about heat related injuries and deaths, which we're seeing mount every year in terms of the increasing temperatures and humidity. And finally, it's mental health concerns related to property damage, displacement or stress. Climate change is clearly a public health issue, and in public health, we know the importance of addressing upstream factors to drive downstream impacts. So as the federal government assesses the cost of the damage, states allocate resources to areas in need and individuals try to put their lives back together. We must also change course. It's crucial that we not only support immediate relief efforts for those affected by these disasters, but also take a hard look at the upstream issues that contribute to these crises. Climate change is not just a distant threat. It's here. It's now. It's impacting vulnerable populations the hardest. Our response needs to go beyond short term aid. We must advocate for systemic change, invest in sustainable practices, and push for clean energy policies that address the root cause of climate change. To do anything other than that guarantees that our future will look even bleaker than it does today with regard to these very, very tragic events. Dr. Osterholm: We keep tackling these difficult, consequential topics on this podcast and in the rest of the work we do at CIDRAP. Our hearts and minds go out to all the victims of the recent tragic storms, and to all those who are affected by the threats that climate change brings. One issue that we can talk about that is not impacted by climate change, other than allowing a certain amount of it's heat to radiate to the Earth, and that's our sunlight. Yep. We depend on that sun. And today, here in Minneapolis Saint Paul, sunrise will be at 7:32 a.m., sunset at 6:23 p.m.. We're now down to 10 hours, 51 minutes and 31 seconds of sunlight. Today we'll lose about three minutes of sunlight. And between now and the winter solstice, we will end up seeing those days get shorter and shorter. The good news is, the rate at which they get shorter also begins to get lower. And while we're seeing reduced sunlight, our dear friends and colleagues in Auckland, New Zealand, particularly those at the Occidental Belgian Beer House on Vulcan Lane, are seeing brighter and brighter days. Today the sun rises at 6:34. Sunset at 7:39. They're now up to 13 hours, five minutes and six seconds of sunlight, gaining almost two minutes and 17 seconds of sunlight a day. Yep. Wish I was in Auckland for a couple of hours today. But you know what? It's great to be home. Chris Dall: Mike. The CDC's COVID indicators, including early indicators like test positivity and severity indicators like hospitalizations and deaths continue to trend downward. But the XEC variant, which isn't covered by the updated COVID vaccine, is on the rise. Is that a concern for the coming months? Dr. Osterholm: Well, Chris, let me just hit to the bottom line immediately. Right now in the United States. We are experiencing really the lowest level of serious respiratory disease in our communities than we have probably at any time in the last 5 or 6 years. Fortunately, we're seeing COVID numbers come down, and I'll talk more about that in a moment. But we're also seeing very little evidence of flu activity and respiratory syncytial virus. Rsv is also at a relatively low level. And so for those who can tell, I have a little bit of laryngitis today because I picked up some bug, not COVID, and I'm doing just fine, thank you. The point of this being, however, is that right now we should remember these days as what it was like before the pandemic, because that's what we're experiencing right now. They will change. Surely we will see more stressful days ahead. But from this perspective, with the respiratory illnesses that we worry about, the ones that can hurt us and kill us, we're in pretty good shape. Now, having said that, Every death is a critical death when it's one of your loved ones, when it's one of those you care about someone you work with. So as I share the information on COVID today, I don't want it to come across as if somehow it doesn't matter anymore. It does matter. But fortunately again, we're seeing some of the best days in our communities since our last episode. Dr. Osterholm: Chris. COVID activities continue to decrease across the board. Wastewater concentrations are decreasing in every region of the country, and the national wastewater concentration is considered low for the first time since June. All the severity indicators, including hospitalizations, emergency department visits and deaths are also down this week, which is great news. There are about 3500 Americans hospitalized with COVID-19, in the 32% of hospitals that reported their data last week, and around 12% of those hospitalized are in ICUs still a concern. We're nearing November 1st, First, which is when health care organizations in this country will require to report hospitalization numbers again like they did during the pandemic. However, using a rather crude assumption that these 32% of hospitals that are currently reporting are representative of all hospitals, we can approximate that about 9000 to 11,000 Americans are currently hospitalized across the country for COVID-19. Still big numbers if you're one of those hospitalized. Last deaths are also down, but not below the 1000 mark. Yet this past week, there were 1189 deaths, and that marks the ninth straight week with more than a thousand deaths. It's the 14th straight week in the US deaths above 500. Now, I think the good news here is with each successive podcast, you're going to hear, at least for the next month or two, these numbers continuing to drop and drop precipitously. So again, for any of you who know someone in those 189 deaths this past week, someone you love or care about, it's really significant. Dr. Osterholm: But when you think about where we were and how we've changed, this is remarkable. If you look back into the pandemic in July of August of 2020, 8000 deaths at a low point, when just a few months later, in January 2021, we were back up at 25,000 deaths in a week, and we actually saw numbers 21,000in January of 2022. So at this point we are much lower, but that too is still not acceptable. And why do I say that? Because when I look at the deaths that we see, to date, 97% of those deaths are in those 55 years of age and older. And unfortunately, many of them have not recently been vaccinated. Now, again, vaccines, as we've talked over and over again for COVID, are not going to keep you from ultimately getting infected. They will protect you for a limited period of time, but in fact, you can greatly reduce your risk of serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths even in the older age population by getting your dose of vaccine. I'm very happy to report that this past week I got my next COVID dose, and I'm feeling really good about that. It's been almost four months since I had my last dose, I got it. Also, just to let you know that the ACIp in their upcoming meeting are going to actually take up the recommendation for an additional dose this winter. Dr. Osterholm: In particular, for those of us who may have risk factors for more serious illness. So I realize for many people, they will not continue to get vaccinated every few months. But for me, it's a small price to pay to keep me out of the hospital and being seriously ill. Now, you mentioned the XEC variant and this is a concern and I don't know where this is going to take us, but in fact, this is a new variant unlike any we've seen before based on where the mutations are. It's not just on the spike protein. This is actually a recombinant mixture of two different subvariants. CS.1.1 And CP3.3, which are both JN.1 Subvariants. I'm sure for many of you that doesn't mean a lot, but what it really is talking about here is that it still is in that same lineage of viruses for which we've been vaccinating against. And so I do expect the vaccine to actually be still as effective here as it was with some of the other variants. What's very different here, though, however, is what you might say is the speed at which it likely can spread through the population. It will get around the immune protection that we may have enjoyed in the past with our vaccines or previous infection. So at this point, I will say the take home messages. Number one, the XEC variant is going to potentially mean more transmission in the community. Dr. Osterholm: Again, with what we have for background immunity from those who were infected during the August September time period, and we saw lots of Americans infected. And with those getting vaccines right now, there will be some good protection for some time against this. It's those who haven't been vaccinated recently who haven't been infected recently. Boy, I sure urge you to go and get your, uh, booster as soon as you can. I want to add one more comment here, and I'm sure not everyone will appreciate this, but I have become aware of a number of major outbreaks of COVID in the last 4 to 6 weeks among individuals taking cruises in different parts of the world, both here in North America as well as in Europe, and the cruise ships by themselves create a very unique world where you're all living closely together. The ventilation inside many of the ships means you end up swapping air more frequently than you realize. And so I just would urge anyone who is going on a cruise in the upcoming days to weeks, make sure you're up to date on your vaccines, both influenza, and I'll comment on more of that later. And your COVID vaccine. Uh, too many people have gone on cruises, had a horrible experience, only to find out that, you know, they should have and could have done more to protect themselves before they left by getting vaccinated. Chris Dall: Mike, as you know from both the data and your own personal experience, any SARS-CoV-2 infection comes with the risk of long COVID. So is there any recent long COVID research that you think is worth noting for our listeners? Dr. Osterholm: Well, in general, I would say, yeah, we have a lot of work to do, but when you look at what kind of information has come forward in recent studies showing the critical importance of inflammation, we really are starting to hone in on, I think, on possible mechanisms for which long COVID can occur. And let me be really clear about this. There isn't a one long COVID. We're finding that there are multiple different sequelae or long term impacts that occur, and they can be very different. And some of us have one, some of us have another. When you look at where we're at today in the research, what we're really looking at is what does this inflammation do, this, this immune response to the host that gets turned on because of its interaction with the COVID virus. What does this mean? And I think this is where we have the real opportunity in the days ahead, not only to make a big impact on the long term impact of long COVID with COVID cases, but also for a number of other infectious diseases from those who are suffering from other viral infections CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, those who have been infected with Brugia burgdorferi, and Lyme disease. Dr. Osterholm: Again, the inflammation piece has played a huge role. The body gets turned on, it doesn't shut off or shut down. And then as a result, we see these other health conditions. So there is one study that actually this past week addresses this. And I'd like to share that with you today. It was conducted by researchers in the UK who used MRI scans to assess brain inflammation following severe COVID-19. The researchers compared brain images of 30 participants that had been hospitalized with severe COVID-19, 3 to 18 months prior to the study, to 51 age matched controls who did not have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researchers found that those who were hospitalized with severe COVID had inflammation in their brainstem, which is often referred to as the control center of the brain. Those who had longer hospital stays, more severe acute infections, and worse functional outcomes were more likely to have greater inflammation. This study adds to the growing body of evidence. I just talked about, suggesting that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathology of long COVID. Though this doesn't give us any immediate answers for those suffering. Understanding the role of inflammation and how we might modulate it is a really important step to eventually developing therapies that can help patients right now. Dr. Osterholm: For those interested in learning more about this study, we will link a CIDRAP news article that covers it a bit more in detail in our episode description. And finally, as always, I want to remind our listeners who are suffering from long COVID. We are here for you. We are listening to your stories, and we will continue to advocate for the research needed to find answers for you. I can tell you, after my six months of long COVID, I absolutely understand what it means to have that condition. When you wake up in the morning and when you go to bed at night. And so we will continue to push this topic, and I urge you to continue to follow our CIDRAP news, because oftentimes in the hour that I have with you now, I can't get all of these articles summarized and into the podcast, but you can read them on our website free of charge. Nothing of CIDRAP should ever cost you a penny except your time, which we know is valuable. But in fact, I hope that you're able to go and check out these stories. Chris Dall: Mike, as you noted, we're still not seeing much seasonal flu activity yet in the United States, but a recent analysis by investigators in five South American countries found that the 2024 seasonal flu vaccine's efficacy during the Southern hemisphere's flu season was only 35%. How concerned are you about that? Dr. Osterholm: Well, Chris, it's not actually a surprise. This is a challenge that our group has been very aware of for more than 12 years. When we published our seminal article back in 2011 on this very topic. We have for a long time thought of influenza vaccine as like a measles vaccine. Once vaccinated, long term protection that would cover you through not only the season, but against a variety of different potential influenza strains. It's not the case, but let me remind you what I've said over and over again. Influenza vaccines are good vaccines. They're not great, but they're good. And what do I mean by that? They're good in the sense that if you look at what's happening with vaccination and illness, any given season, you may see somewhere between 25-35% up to 40-45% protection against what we call medically attended illness, i.e. a doctor or a nurse seeing you or even hospitalization and death in this case, this vaccine study, which was conducted by researchers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, actually found a 35% reduction in hospitalization against influenza, which I'll take any day of the week. That's worth a shot to me if I can get that kind of protection. Now, we've talked about the situation with regard to when you get your vaccination, because in fact, we see anywhere from 2 to 12% reduction in that protection from the month. Dr. Osterholm: You get it by month. So in the first month, I may lose 2 to 12%, the second month another 2 to 12%, the third month, another 2 to 12%. And that's why you heard me say over and over again, don't get your flu shot in August and September, even early October. Well, as I just shared with you first, the fact is that we're not seeing flu activity right now. That remains a very low level concern in the community. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported levels of seasonal influenza activity deemed minimal by CDC. This is good news, but it's not going to continue. We will see flu and the fact that the vaccine we're using in our country now is the same one that was used in the Southern hemisphere for their winter, i.e. last summer. For us, that means we're surely not going to see any better protection against hospitalization than they saw. So the point being here is, is that when do I get my flu shot? As I noted at the early part of the podcast, I got mine this week. Why? Because first of all, it's a challenge to get into some places right now to get a dose of vaccine and so you can count on up to a week to ten days before you can get in and be scheduled for it. Dr. Osterholm: Number two, it will take you, you know, 7 to 14 days to really begin to mount that immune response. So that's about three weeks out. I think that is the safe place to be right now. I don't think we're going to see this big burst of flu activity, but I can see it picking up by mid to late November. So to anyone who had a question about when is Mike going to get his flu shot. He got it this week and I'm happy to have gotten it. So I got both it and my COVID booster. So at this point, let me just reaffirm that we're in good shape with flu activity right now. Lowest level in conjunction with the other respiratory viruses we've seen in many, many months. But now is the time to get ready for what surely is going to be a flu virus that will return. And we now have some time to get better prepared for it without also, in a sense, wasting our immune protection by not being in that flu season for months and months. Chris Dall: Let's turn to H5n1 avian flu. California has now reported 11 H5n1 cases, all linked to contact with infected dairy cattle. Mike, are there any differences that we know of between these cases and the human cases that have been reported in Missouri? Dr. Osterholm: Boy, Chris, I could spend the next hour on this topic. Um, it's one that I have to upfront say I'm probably in a contrarian position on, and I'm not necessarily in sync with some of my colleagues and surely not a number of people in the media. Let me just remind everyone that where we're at right now, we're continuing to see evidence of H5n1 virus activity in milking cows throughout the country, but specifically in California. There are now 305 herds in 14 states that have been documented to be infected. That includes 105 in California. 34% of all the herds. If you look at California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan and Texas, those five states, they account for 258 of the 305 herds that are infected, or about 85%. And these numbers are going to keep changing by the time this podcast is published and you're listening to it. We could already see another increase in herd document. So this is a challenge inside the dairy industry. And it's a challenge now that we're learning, particularly in California, is of great consequence to the dairy industry at this point. We're seeing increased mortality in the cattle. We're also beginning to realize that they have a challenge in coming back to milking production levels that they had before. And when you look at what's happening in California and in specific, you know, the state that is basically responsible for 20% of all the milk produced in the country. You can see the affected farms run from north to Sacramento, all the way through the Central Valley and all the way to LA. Dr. Osterholm: That's a remarkable level of infection occurring, and I expect you're going to see more. Also, we're now at a very critical time of what is beginning to be the next season, you might say, of milking cow activity. Well, what do I mean? Well, most people don't realize that there is a timing to a cow being milked. And when they're able to produce milk, it's typically a situation where a dairy cow milks for about nine months. The milk production is initially stimulated by the birth of a calf. It then ramps up in the weeks after birth, peaking at about week 6 to 10, and slowly tapers off for the next several months. And then at that point it goes into a new cycle. The cow is then impregnated again roughly two months before she is to give birth. Again, she's taken out of the milking barn and as they say, she is dried out. After that, the birth is given. They put her back into the mix. So when we are looking at this issue, we're not sure what's going to happen in these periods of transition from being impregnated, delivering a calf, stimulating milk production, then being milked continuously until the next cycle starts. And there is some real concern as to what that milk production level might look like. So they have to get this down. Now, from a human standpoint, this is where it gets more interesting. Dr. Osterholm: You might say, in terms of our immediate concern, if you're not a dairy farmer, is the fact that what risk does this play for humans? You know, I have shared with this audience on multiple occasions my long and tortuous career with H5n1 dating back to the 2003 2005 time period in Southeast Asia, and I have been very involved in a number of areas with H5N1 since that time. Between January of 2003 and July 19 to 2024. So the data are about two months old. There have been 896 cases of human infection with H5N1. 463 or 52% were fatal. Now that's a big number. But if you look at how that was distributed over time, it tells us a lot. For example, if you look at at case numbers in the early days, we saw, for example, after the return of the virus from its original impact on Hong Kong in 1997 and then starting to spread in Southeast Asia in 2004 or 5 and six, we got up to 98, 88. 115 cases a year of what is truly classic severe influenza A pneumonia like illness, not just an eye infection. I'll come to that in a minute. And then we watch those numbers decrease each year over time, primarily in Southeast Asia and Asia in general, such that by the time we got to 20 1213, we were talking about less than 40 cases a year in humans, isolated cases. And then you may recall, as I shared with you before, 2012 was kind of a wake up call moment when two of the really respected researchers in flu work in the world presented data to the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity, of which I was a member, saying we were only 1 or 2 mutations away from H5N1 causing the next pandemic. Dr. Osterholm: You know, you could just feel the hands gripped tightly on the chairs as they saw those data. Well, nothing happened until along comes 2015, and 145 cases suddenly appear in the Nile River valley, of which half died. They were largely among duck farmers. And then, just as quickly as that happened, it went away. And if you look at the period of time from 2017 to 2020, for a seven year period, there have only been 33 cases and 11 deaths documented of human H5n1 infection. Now the US numbers will be added to that where today we have more cases I'll talk about in a moment, but they're not the classic influenza like illness. What am I talking about? Well, as I've also shared with you, over time, the avian flu viruses have a type of sialic acid binding preference, meaning where the virus can bind to a cell and infect that cell, i.e. infecting whoever owns that cell. And in this case, the sialic acid two three binding, which is the avian binding, has surely been a challenge, particularly with the new clade of virus out there. Truly dramatic impact on mammals as well as avian species. Ironically, virtually no impact on swine, which is a very key animal for us because they have the two six sialic receptor sites. Dr. Osterholm: So when they look at this infection, we're not seeing two six binding site infections. Those are the ones that you'd expect to see from infection in the lungs, where there's two six receptor sites are at and where we would expect to see people developing the severe, life threatening infection. And so as we've watched the summer unfold, we're now up to 25 cases in humans, all who have contact with either the infected dairy cattle or birds, with the exception of one And all are largely conjunctivitis in the eyes. The human eye has two three receptors in it, as well as two six receptors in our respiratory tract. But we're not seeing respiratory tract illness. And so I'm not convinced that H5n1 is ever going to get over the bar to cause a human related pandemic. Yes, we'll have these one off or two off kinds of cases, meaning that we'll get transmission from an animal to a human and then possibly one more generation. But I don't think it's going to go. Now, I could be wrong and it could happen tomorrow. We could see a reassortment event occur where now we know that the bovine udder has receptor sites for two six and two three, and that in fact, we could see a situation where a individual working in the barn is infected with, uh, influenza and somehow contaminates that udder, causes udder infection, as does the H5N1 that's already there. Dr. Osterholm: We could have that happen, but for some reason, since 2003, 21 years, we have not seen that happen in humans, even though H5 has gone through a number of changes. So at this point I will just say one, there's going to be more influenza pandemics and they could be a hell of a lot worse than anything we've seen to date. So please know I'm bullish on pandemic preparedness. Number two, there is something about H5N1 in humans that I don't understand. And when I talk to many of my colleagues who are real flu experts, they also will tell you they don't know what's happening or what the likelihood is of H5N1 causing serious illness in humans. And we can't confuse when we call a bird flu case one that has conjunctivitis only as really true bird flu. From my perspective, that is an eye infection. The virus lands in the eye. It has the receptor sites. And if we look at even the data on, can we pick up the evidence of their infection in one's blood? I mean, serology or antibody response, it's mixed. And that was based on data from an H7 outbreak where people with conjunctivitis didn't always even have an immune response that could be picked up in the blood. It was all isolated in the eye. So a long, long winded answer here to say one I am concerned about what's happening with the cows. I think that yes, we want to get rid of that as soon as possible, and the dairy industry should be in the lead in that. Dr. Osterholm: For all the implications of what it means to their industry. Number two, we have to continue to look closely at what H5N1 is doing to people. We likely in the next two weeks, we'll get information from the CDC studies looking at the individuals with respiratory illness in Missouri, where we had one case of H5n1 infection documented. I've stated before, I think in the end, none of those additional contacts that had some respiratory illness actually had H5n1. But we need to keep looking at that. So at this point, I think we need to back off a bit. I've watched too many journalists, some colleagues who have been out there, you know, not quite screaming, the theater's on fire, but darn near we don't need to have this happen to motivate us to get better prepared for a pandemic. But I will tell you, if we keep saying this is going to happen and going to happen and it doesn't happen, just like I watched in 2012, we are then going to be held holding the message that, oh, you just scared us needlessly again. So we've got to find the right message level. Pandemic influenza is critical to be prepared for. Our vaccines need a heck of a lot of work to get better prepared. But in fact, whether this one will do it or not, we just don't know. Chris Dall: In Rwanda, the Marburg virus outbreak is now at 62 cases with 15 deaths. Rwandan officials say the outbreak is under control. But last week, the CDC issued a travel advisory that urged Americans to reconsider nonessential travel to the country. The CDC said it will also begin screening travelers from Rwanda. So, Mike, two questions. Do you think this outbreak is under control? And secondly, do you think that travel warning was warranted? Dr. Osterholm: Well, I don't know if the outbreak is yet really under control, but I would say that we were very fortunate. If that is a word you can use here, that it actually happened in Rwanda, because they likely have the very best health care and public health systems in all of Africa. They're extremely good at what they do. And they were on top of this right away. And again, from a community risk standpoint, the majority of the cases of severe illness and of concern were actually in healthcare workers who were exposed to the individuals who presented with illness and being admitted to the hospital. So I think from that standpoint, um, you know, we're in good shape relative to the ability to control it. We're now watching vaccine roll in. There are over 700 doses of an experimental vaccine that's been administered in Rwanda so far. Using that classic strategy that we talked about so many times before use for smallpox eradication, ring vaccination, vaccinate around those who are at highest risk of having been exposed to a case. We saw that same success work with Ebola. So let me just come back and say, yeah, I think we're going to have this one under control soon. But I do have a challenge with the issue of what the US did with its warning and how it put that out. Dr. Osterholm: Why do I say that? Well, because first of all, we have watched this happen time and time again. It happened with Omicron in South Africa. It's happened with Ebola. It's happened here where when you put any kind of travel restrictions or even just a warning out, as such, it causes that country that announced its challenge or its outbreak to suffer economically from trade and travel in general. And in this case, there was no immediate danger to citizens traveling to Rwanda who were not in the same kinds of population centers where this virus was located. And so, from my perspective, and I come back to this time and time again, we should save those kinds of recommendations for border closings or travel restrictions, if, in fact, that's going to make a difference. And we don't have any evidence these make any difference anyway. We just don't. And so what it does is it penalizes the country. Now if I'm country A in low income country category and in fact I have a disease outbreak, why am I going to be speedy to report that if I think I'm only going to be punished for it? So we have to look at what is really happening. And I look at the inconsistency. And I picked this up because I think it also points out that we have to be careful not to respond to what we call media related need for doing something. Dr. Osterholm: Lassa fever is an also another major challenging disease in Africa. It's one where it's located in Western Africa, in a series of seven countries where the primary reservoir is a mouse, the Mastomys mouse. And it's one that actually likes to live in in domesticated locations, i.e. it wants to like rats and do in our country, live in the household area where garbage, scraps, Etc.. The mastermind carries this zoonotic virus that if it's in the urine and you either come in contact with that, you're in a physical environment where you're cleaning up, you inhale it. You basically have a situation where now you're at risk for Lassa fever. And when we look at Lassa, it's a disease for which it's estimated that there are 100,000 to 300,000 Lassa fever cases a year across West Africa, including 5 to 10,000 deaths. Now, these numbers may be slightly higher or lower than some challenge to that, but this is a bad disease and I haven't heard anyone talk about, well, we need to put a warning out not to go to these countries because of Lassa. And this actually dwarfs the entire risk of Marburg, which is not insignificant. But when you're concerned about Lassa. So, you know, my first logical question as a scientist is if you're going to put a travel warning out for Marburg. Dr. Osterholm: Why are you not putting it out for Lhasa? And in fact, people will say, well, that's different. That occurs all the time. Well then why do you put a warning out? Is it only if it occurs? Sometimes you warn. And so I think at this point we do need to go back to the drawing board and look at what it is that we make recommendations for or about with regard to border closings, travel, follow up for people overseas, surely provide information, make sure everyone knows what the potential issues are. Knows what if you are infected, what the early signs and symptoms are, what to do to protect others if you are infected. But don't just put a warning out. I think that doesn't help and we'll see in the future. I know if this were to happen here in the United States, somebody could say, right now, you know, we better put a warning out in California, don't go there because they have all that H5N1 infection in cows. And we'd say, oh, that's crazy. You don't need to do that. Well, you know, what goes around, comes around. And I think that's what we want to do. We want to do this on good science, not on politics or public relations. Chris Dall: It's time now for our ID query, which this week I'm going to call ID clarification since we have two of them. And they both regard things that listeners have heard in previous podcasts and have questions about. So first we're going to hear from Yolanda, who wrote on episode 167 of the Osterholm update. You gave a timeline of 2 to 3 months after a COVID infection before getting the new vaccine. The CDC and some other sources suggest three months or even at least three months. Can you say more about your choice of 2 to 3 months after infection? Dr. Osterholm: Well, thank you for that question. And and for me to have the opportunity to further elaborate on getting the vaccine. The comment I made in the last episode about getting a new vaccine dose, 2 to 3 months after the previous illness, came in the context of discussing the low vaccine uptake we're seeing in the US, particularly among those 65 years of age and older. The demographic that actually represents, as I pointed out earlier today, well over 90% of all the COVID deaths in September. So you want to focus on that and the fact that we have this new vaccine dose, as I stressed in the last episode, we're trying to keep up with this changing coronavirus. Cdc encourages waiting three months between the last infection and receiving a new dose to capitalize on the immune response you get after a natural infection, and extend that immunity by delaying a booster by a few months. That's a great plan. I endorse the timeline the CDC also encourages, and I agree with considering your personal risk of severe disease, which means that waiting three months may not be ideal. So if you're one of those in a higher risk categories and maybe have plans on your calendar that could increase your risk of becoming infected, it's reasonable to consider timing your dose to align with your circumstances. These decisions are nuanced, and while the three month benchmark is accurate and helpful, not everyone will be able to time their booster shots at precisely 90 days out from their recovery. But ultimately, what's most important here is keeping up with the new vaccine to protect yourself and those around you. And again, if you're just getting an older dose of vaccine, not the newer dose, then I would say timing isn't as important, but getting that newer dose sooner surely is. So I hope this helps answer the question. It's a good one. And you know, at this point I waited four months between my doses just because at this point I saw the COVID activity reduced here at this time. And I'm anticipating that sometime by mid winter we're going to see another spike again in COVID cases. Chris Dall: And then, Mike, you received an email from a listener who questioned your explanation of how Marburg virus is transmitted. So can you say more about that? Dr. Osterholm: Absolutely. And this is actually a issue near and dear to my heart. Last week I drew similarities between Marburg and other hemorrhagic filoviruses like Ebola in terms of symptoms and how they spread. Marburg virus disease is a zoonotic, meaning that it can spill over from animals to humans through contact with infected animals like the Egyptian fruit bats and non-human primates. Marburg virus can also spread from human to human through direct contact with body fluids, from someone who is sick with, or has recently died of the disease. It's also possible to contract Marburg through contact with contaminated objects and needle sticks. Health care workers and caretaking family members are at especially high risk of contracting Marburg, primarily when members of these groups do not follow the proper infection prevention practices. More importantly, though, Marburg virus has not been clearly demonstrated to spread efficiently through an airborne transmission route or more brief casual contact. This is another reason the travel restrictions are really misguided here. So the real challenge here is trying to understand does this virus ever transmit via the respiratory route? Well, it so happens that I waded into this very deeply with Ebola virus, which I think is very similar to Marburg. And therefore whatever you discuss on Ebola surely applies to Marburg. And back in 2015, in the middle of the very large outbreak in Western Africa, that many of you may recall over 11,000 deaths, we published a paper in the journal mBio. I was the first author, and it included 20 of the leading Ebola experts in the world, and the title of the paper was Transmission of Ebola Viruses What We Know and What We Do Not know. Dr. Osterholm: And in short, we found a number of situations where there was surely some evidence of respiratory transmission of Ebola in laboratory situations with animals, i.e. primates. And from this we concluded as a group. And this was all of these experts. In this review, we addressed what we know and what we do not know about Ebola virus transmission. We also hypothesize that Ebola viruses have the potential to be respiratory pathogens with primary respiratory spread. You might have thought that I was upsetting the entire world. Many of my colleagues were not happy with that statement. They felt that it was a scare tactic that this wasn't true. Well, if you read this paper, first of all, take a look at the authors and you'll get a sense of the world's experts here on on the issue of Ebola virus infection. And then you look at the information contained and this article will be linked on the website for the podcast. And it does, I think, support the fact that there has been respiratory transmission of Ebola. How common it is is not clear yet. Surely it's not at all a primary means for transmission, but if it can happen, what does it mean over time? How often would it happen? And could you see a sudden change in in increasing ability to be transmitted via the respiratory route? Now again, I want to point out, you know, we're not saying at this time that Marburg or Ebola viruses are being transmitted primarily through the respiratory route. But, you know, I had people criticize me at the time that this paper was published. Dr. Osterholm: One of them I thought was fascinating said, look, it once a virus has been established, the way it's transmitted, it never changes. This is ridiculous. It was at the same time that we saw the Zika activity occurring in South America, from which a mosquito borne virus or vector borne virus was now being transmitted sexually. That's kind of a change. And yet and that was right in front and center with us. So to address the issue of Marburg, let me be clear. In this outbreak we don't have any evidence of respiratory transmission. But then I can't say we don't have any evidence that didn't happen, meaning what really took place in the hospitals in terms of personal protective equipment, etc.. How did that happen? Was there individuals that had no body fluid contact, no blood contact that may have become infected? We just don't know. But should we be surprised if we see evidence of respiratory transmission with either Marburg or Ebola? I don't think so. And again, I refer you back to this paper that's linked here. Take a look at it. And I think you'd agree with me that if this can happen with Ebola, there's no reason it can't happen with Marburg. So just to clarify for last podcast. Comments. We have no evidence at this point that Marburg has been spread via the respiratory route in this outbreak. But could it happen much like the evidence we've seen with Ebola? I think the answer is absolutely yes, and we need to be aware of that. Chris Dall: Now for some other infectious disease news, last week, the Pan American Health Organization said that more than 11.7 million dengue cases had been reported in the Americas region this year, which is more than twice the number reported in all of 2023, which itself was a record year for dengue cases. So, Mike, what is behind the surge in dengue cases in South America, and what does it mean for both the people who live in that region and those who might travel there? Dr. Osterholm: Well, Chris, this is a complicated issue with this particular mosquito borne disease, and I'll come to that in a moment. But the world and specifically the Americas is in a really tough situation with dengue right now. 2024 has been the worst year on record for this disease. We've seen over a 30 fold increase in the last 50 years. One important consideration for dengue surveillance is that in most otherwise healthy people, first infections with the disease are often very mild, typically causing fatigue and a low grade fever. Most people may be entirely asymptomatic. This means that many, if not most, dengue virus infections go unreported. Severe disease is more likely upon subsequent infections or what we call reinfections. And that might be what we're seeing here. And this is all related to a condition known as immune enhancement. We know that if I'm someone who has previously had dinghy and have high antibody levels against the dengue virus, or I have a vaccine related antibody level, I'll be protected against getting a new infection. If I've never had dengue before, I'll have no antibody. And so in that case, I get infected. But if I have a certain low level amount of antibody, and particularly with certain strains of the dengue virus, that causes a thing called immune enhancement, another one of those immune response issues, like I talked about with long COVID in a sense, but in this case, this can be deadly. The immune enhancement, it causes shock. And that's where you get the dengue hemorrhagic fever picture, where basically people become severely ill. Dr. Osterholm: And so this is what we're concerned about is we have so much dengue now we're seeing multiple infections over time resulting in many more very severely ill people. The US regularly identifies dengue and travelers, typically those in Latin America, where activity is highest. However, the US and Puerto Rico have identified increased local transmission in the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida and California. So we're beginning to see more and more of that. And this also ties back to the initial discussion we had on climate change. Now the Aedes mosquito, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, these are mosquitoes that are basically the household mosquitoes. They're day biters. They're very quiet. They bite you behind the neck, behind your knee, places like that. You don't even feel them. They live close to you in discarded plastic garbage that has a little bit of water that particularly if it's hidden in a shade like environment, garbage, is the perfect breeding location for Aids. And so part of the challenge we have right now is that we've seen this major increase in urbanization of many of these areas, and even where there has not been urbanization, there still is lots of garbage, lots of of discarded plastic, which now provides for the breeding site, now with increased precipitation that just keeps these locations. That may be a watering can. They may be any number of things loaded with these mosquitoes living right next to us. The tire temperatures mean that the mosquito virus cycle goes faster. In other words, the mosquito actually becomes infectious after it takes a blood meal on someone who is infected. Dr. Osterholm: Before then, it gets infected as a mosquito and then feeds on someone else. You can increase the speed of that by having higher temperatures. Now this is different though, than some of the climate change issues where the Culex tarsalis mosquito, a number of other mosquito populations will be influenced a lot by climate change, where bodies of water that now before didn't exist, but with heavy precipitation. Dew creates amazing breeding sites for these types of mosquitoes. So let me just say dengue right now is a huge challenge. If we could clean up the garbage of many areas in the world, we could see a great reduction in dinghy. But where we have that, climate change also can still play an important role in increasing the likelihood of that happening. And I think that this is going to be a huge challenge in the future. And this is one where, again, I would not put a travel warning out to say, don't go, but leave it to your own decision. But I'd want to know if I'm going to an area that has dengue infection in any meaningful level and what I mean by meaningful level 1 or 2 cases in a community. Surely not good, but it doesn't mean you have widespread dengue transmission. But if I'm going to on a vacation or I'm going for work reasons, family visits to a dinghy infected area, I'd want to know that just so I make sure I protect myself. Chris Dall: Now it's time for this week in public health history. Mike, who are we celebrating this week? Dr. Osterholm: We actually have a really fascinating person to talk about this week Harvey Washington wiley. He was born October 18th, 1844, in a log cabin in southern Indiana. His family, made up of farmers and preachers, were also conductors of the Underground Railroad, helping to transport people across the border from slave owning Kentucky. Wiley himself fought in the Union Army, finishing the war as a corporal in the Indiana Infantry Regiment. Wiley then completed a degree in Humanities, followed by an MD. He became a chemistry professor at Purdue University and was appointed as the State Chemist of Indiana. Wiley was constantly learning and seeking out new information. He traveled to Germany to study some of the latest in food chemistry, particularly the impact of different food additives on human health. He began to publish papers on the adulteration of foods from milk to canned green beans to sugar. Wiley he was offered the position of chief chemist for the US Department of Agriculture, where he flourished. Using his strong public relations skills and background in agriculture and food industry. At the outset of his government career, Wiley sought to improve food labeling practices so that consumers had more transparency in what they were eating. But Wiley soon introduced the idea that some food additives should not just be listed on the label, but banned from the food supply entirely. Additives like formaldehyde were readily used in the food industry at the time without testing to determine their safety. Dr. Osterholm: Wiley developed safety trials to learn more about the health impact of substances from borax to salicylic acid. His 12 test subjects, known colloquially as the Poison Squad, brought national attention to the threat of toxic additives. However, his initially proposed food Bill of 1902 did not even make it to a vote before being defeated by lobbyists from major food companies. This did not deter Wiley's pursuit. Wiley began to engage with the population who actually purchased groceries in the US. Women. His campaign took hold with notable cookbook author Fannie Farmer, who championed the importance of, quote, pure food. The tipping point came in 1905 with the publishing of Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle, which revealed the repulsive conditions of the meat industry in Chicago. Wiley, local female activists and some more progressive food companies, including Heinz Ketchup, met with President Theodore Roosevelt soon after the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act were passed. Popular press at the time even referred to this legislation as Doctor Wiley's Law. The resulting years of research, enforcement battles, and lawsuits over the safety of various attitudes to food and medicine can fill volumes. Wiley built the foundation for the nation's Bureau of Chemistry, which later took on the name the Food and Drug Administration or the FDA. We owe him a debt of gratitude for putting science first and ensuring that the public safety is above any corporate profit. Thank you, Doctor Wiley. Chris Dall: Mike, what are your take home messages for today? Dr. Osterholm: Well, first of all, we're living in a what I would call a better time with respiratory viruses than we have in a long, long time. Rsv, COVID and influenza are at low and dropping levels, but please don't forget that won't continue like that. And for some people, it's even still a risk. Now get those vaccines. Number two get that flu shot. So just to emphasize point one now's your time I got mine. I told you I'd get it when I thought it was about the time to maximize on being able to get in and get it and develop some immunity. And then the flu season come. Uh, the third one is, you know, the Marburg virus will be controlled, I think, soon. Uh, and it's one, though, that we have to keep our eye on all the time because it could take off again any of the filoviruses, Ebola, Marburg, much like we saw back in 2015 to 2016. This is a huge issue. And let me give you a second, third priority. H5n1 virus is going to continue to be a story to be told. I don't understand what's going on. No one really does. And I don't know what risk it poses to humans in the big picture. I surely think it's possible we'll never see a pandemic associated with H5n1, but we could. Now that's a hard line to listen to and say, well, tell us what? What is the answer? And the answer is, we don't know. But what that answer means is that's why we have to be much better prepared for any flu virus to cause the next pandemic, any coronavirus to cause the next pandemic. We will never waste an investment in getting better vaccines and better opportunities for manufacturing quickly when we need them. Chris Dall: And what closing song have you chosen for us today, Mike? Dr. Osterholm: Well, this song kind of came to me fortuitously this week. We all recognize it's been a challenge being alive today, just with all the bad news around us. It's almost like we have this terrible, terrible miasma that has settled in in so many parts of the world, and specifically even right here in this country. And so, you know what? I'm one of those people that would much rather smile than feel sad, feel angry, feel scared. And I was actually walking back to my condo that I live in here in Minneapolis earlier this week, and in the distance with rain clouds that I knew were going to miss me, so I had the luxury of watching them. But all of a sudden, in those rain clouds, a big rainbow appeared and it just made me feel so special, so wonderful that, you know what? There's still a lot of good in this world. There's a lot of beauty in this world, even if everything around us seems to be a challenge. And so I had to go back to my old standard here. For those of you who've been long term listeners of the podcast, you already know what I'm going to talk about today here. This particular song has been used three previous times. You'd think I like it, don't you? On December 10th, 2020, in episode 35, The Last Mile to the Last Inch on November 18th, 2021. Remember way back then on episode 78 Breakthroughs and Boosters. Dr. Osterholm: And then in a very special episode December 29th, 2022, in episode 121. Thank you, Doctor Jena. Part two. And so today, I've picked that same particular song to play a fourth time. And of course, you probably have guessed it by now. Rainbow connection is a song from the 1979 film The Muppet Movie, with music and lyrics written by Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher. The song was first performed by Jim Henson as Kermit the Frog in the film Rainbow Connection. It actually reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1979, with the song remaining in the top 40 for seven weeks in total. Williams and Ascher received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song in the 52nd Academy Awards. For me, it tells a very important story of someone who is continuing to search for that rainbow connection and what that means, and let you never stop searching. So here it is. Rainbow connection. Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions and rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told. And some chose to believe it. I know they're wrong. Wait and see. Someday we'll find it. The rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers and me. Who said that every wish would be heard and answered when wished on the morning star. Somebody thought of that and someone believed it. Dr. Osterholm: And look what it's done so far. What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing? And what do you think we might see? Someday we'll find it. The rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers and me. All of us under its spell. We know it's probably magic. Have you been half asleep? Have you heard voices? I heard them calling my name. Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same. I've heard it said too many times to ignore it. It's something that I'm supposed to be. Someday we'll find it. The rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers and me. Rainbow connection Kermit the frog. Well, thank you again for joining us for another podcast. We've covered a lot of material today. I hope that it's helpful. Again, we welcome your feedback. We appreciate your support. And in following up on this song, I hope this is the emotion you take away from this podcast. Surely consider all the other information presented. But when you go to sleep tonight, think about the rainbow connection. That's the important thing. And when you have an opportunity, please, please be kind. Boy, the world needs it right now. The bugs are out there and a lot of other things that make us feel sad. And now's our chance to respond. So be safe and be kind. Thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate you. Thank you.

No Vote View Results Back “That will be part of the discussion if we don’t feel like we can get some agreement among all the parties,” Graybeal said.After several months of promoting a voluntary bulk tank testing program, the state has managed to recruit just eight dairy farms and one western Pennsylvania processor covering 80 farms.Those participants represent less than 2% of the dairy farms in the state. Pennsylvania has the second most dairy farms in the country.The state needs data from about 460 farms for the information to be statistically robust, Graybeal said.State Veterinarian Dr. Alex Hamberg is also involved in a study that is starting up to test milk silos across the Mid-Atlantic, she said. Dairy Farms a Weak Link in Controlling Avian Influenza One of the biggest hindrances to stopping the outbreak has been the farms themselves. Dairy farms have limited the information available to scientists and have had obvious lapses in biosecurity, according to a USDA researcher. Avian influenza has not been detected in dairy cows in the Northeast, but it has been found in 97 U.S. herds in the past 30 days, mostly in California.Some experts are concerned that dairy farms are ignoring best practices to reduce disease spread and skipping the testing required to move cows across state lines.Chris Pierce, the president of Heritage Poultry Management Services Inc., said in the call that infections on dairy farms pose a risk to nearby poultry farms, and broader testing could help determine whether any Pennsylvania dairies are positive for avian influenza.“Everything’s negative, but if you don’t test, of course it’s negative,” Pierce said.

Oseltamivir and a similar agent called zanamivir (marketed as Relenza) were approved in 1999 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and represented the first members in a new class of antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors. Oseltamivir is marketed as Tamiflu by the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company Hoffman–La Roche, Inc. Oseltamivir can be given orally. Through the inhibition of neuraminidase, a glycoprotein on the surface of influenza viruses, the drug decreases the release of virus from infected cells, increases the formation of viral aggregates, and decreases the spread of the virus through the body. Oseltamivir is effective when administered within two days of symptom onset. The drug can also be used to prevent flu in adults and children who take the medication once daily for a period of at least 10 days. There is evidence that the most common subtype of influenza type A virus, known as H1N1, has developed resistance to oseltamivir.

Novavax’s shares jumped in pre-market trading on the news but settled once markets opened. Less than a month after putting Novavax’s investigational combo COVID-19/influenza and standalone influenza vaccine candidates on a clinical hold, the FDA has lifted it, greenlighting enrollment in the company’s planned Phase III trial.At the time the hold was announced, the FDA had requested additional information on a serious adverse event in the Phase II trial for the combo vaccine, initially reported as motor neuropathy. According to Seeking Alpha, the additional data clarified that the trial participant developed amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an event deemed unrelated to vaccination. Novavax’s shares jumped in premarket trading by as much as 24% on Monday morning, but settled back to around $9 once the markets opened.Original story published Oct. 16: Novavax Shares Slide as FDA Pauses COVID/Flu Vaccine Candidates Shares of Novavax fell 16% on Wednesday as the FDA placed a clinical hold on its investigational combo COVID-19/influenza and standalone influenza vaccines after a report of a serious adverse event in a trial participant.The standalone COVID-19 vaccine—the company’s only product currently on the U.S. market, in competition with big hitters Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna—is not impacted by the FDA’s hold, Novavax said.In a brief press release, Novavax said that the decision stems from a report of a serious adverse event of motor neuropathy that occurred in a Phase II trial participant outside of the U.S. The company stressed that the adverse event has not been linked to the vaccine candidates under study. The Phase II trial wrapped up in June 2023 and the company had filed with the FDA to launch a Phase III study when the adverse event was reported last month. There were no cases of motor neuropathy observed during the Phase II trial, Novavax said. “We are working closely with the FDA to provide the necessary information that will allow them to better understand this observation and resolve the clinical hold,” said Robert Walker, Novavax’s chief medical officer, in a statement. “Our goal is to successfully resolve this matter and to start our Phase III trial as soon as possible.”Motor neuropathy is a rare, acquired immune-mediated disorder that causes muscle weakness of the arms and legs. Cases of the adverse event were previously reported by some people who received other COVID-19 vaccines, such as Pfizer/BioNTech’s product, but the complication has not been linked to vaccination.Novavax had a bumpy ride getting its COVID-19 vaccine to the market, earning an emergency use authorization well after market leaders Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. But Novavax’s shot offered an alternative to mRNA technology, gaining almost a cult-like following of people who wanted a third option in the heady days of the pandemic.

Two doses of the vaccine were more effective for preventing influenza B, particularly in outpatient settings. The study involved 1832 children across 19 hospitals in Japan, assessing vaccine effectiveness post-COVID-19 measures relaxation. Limitations included lack of data on influenza A subtypes and co-infections, but the vaccines' effectiveness was still significant.SHOW MOREInvestigators state that health care providers should consider the potential use of 2 doses to increase the effectiveness against influenza B.The current inactivated vaccines for preventing influenza A and B in children remain effective after the relaxation of strict COVID-19 measures during the 2023-2024 season. Investigators state that health care providers should consider the use of 2 doses to increase the effectiveness against influenza B.Image Credit: N Lawrenson/peopleimages.com- stock.dobe.comAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, investigators reported intermittent suppression of the circulation of seasonal influenza virus. However, they also reported that the virus circulation has returned to normal levels, demonstrating the need for annual vaccination against influenza. In other studies, the effectiveness has been evaluated with test-negative case-controls due to varying levels of effectiveness each year. In the current study, investigators aimed to study the vaccine efficacy of inactive influenza vaccines for preventing infection in the 2023–2024 season.Children aged 6 months to 15 years were enrolled if they had a fever of 38ºC or higher and underwent testing prior to hospitalization at one of the study hospitals in Japan. Investigators included data from November 2023 to March 2024, according to the study authors.There were a total of 17 hospitals that included inpatient children and 2 hospitals for outpatient children, which included a total of 1832 children. Investigators included 1005 children in the influenza A cohort, with 153 testing positive and 852 testing negative. In the outpatient setting, investigators included 591 children, with 172 testing positive and 419 testing negative. For influenza B, there were a total of 918 children in the hospital setting, including 66 who were positive and 852 who were negative; and 579 in the outpatient setting, with 160 positive and 419 negative.Among those in the hospital and influenza A cohort, the vaccine coverage was 22% for those with the virus and 40% for the controls. The adjusted vaccine efficacy for preventing influenza A hospitalization was approximately 51%, according to the study results. Further, investigators found no difference between 1 and 2 doses for hospitalized children aged 6 months to 12 years, which is what is recommended for the patient population. For outpatients, vaccine coverage was 23% and 37%, respectively, with efficacy of preventing influenza A in the outpatient setting at approximately 54%. There was also no difference for 1 and 2 doses.For influenza B, vaccine coverage was approximately 21% in the influenza B group and 40% for the control group. The adjusted vaccine efficacy for preventing influenza B hospitalization was 60%, according to the results. The vaccine efficacy for 2 doses compared with no dose was significant, but 1 dose compared with no dose was not. For the outpatient setting, vaccine coverage was 21% and 37%, respectively, with vaccine efficacy for preventing influenza B being 56%. The 2-dose regimen was found to be superior for children with influenza B in the outpatient setting, according to the investigators.The authors noted limitations of the study, which included the lack of data to differentiate between the 2 subtypes of influenza A: A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). Additionally, the effects of any co-infections with other viruses or bacteria were not analyzed as well as the date of vaccine administration and the intervals between the first and second doses.However, the results were still significant in showing the effectiveness of inactive influenza vaccinations among children in both inpatient and outpatient settings.REFERENCEShinjoh M, Yaginuma M, Yamaguchi Y, et al.

Positive FDA updated FLUBLOK label with new safety data for pregnant individuals Large-scale study involving 48,781 pregnant individuals supports FLUBLOK's safety profile FLUBLOK demonstrated no increased risk of adverse pregnancy, birth, or neonatal outcomes compared to standard-dose flu vaccine Study results align with CDC, ACIP, and ACOG recommendations for flu vaccination during pregnancy Negative None. Insights Medical Research Analyst positive This study on FLUBLOK's safety in pregnant individuals is significant for Sanofi's vaccine portfolio. The large sample size of over 48,000 participants adds robustness to the findings. Key points:No increased risk of adverse pregnancy, birth, or neonatal outcomes compared to standard flu vaccinesConsistent safety profile with general population outcomesData now included in FDA-approved label, enhancing credibilityThis strengthens FLUBLOK's position in the $4 billion U.S. flu vaccine market. It addresses a important gap in vaccine safety data for pregnant women, a high-risk group for flu complications. The timing aligns well with CDC recommendations for vaccination before flu season peaks.While positive, the impact on Sanofi's $136.8 billion market cap may be , as flu vaccines are just one segment of their diverse portfolio. However, it reinforces Sanofi's leadership in vaccines and commitment to evidence-based medicine. Financial Analyst neutral This label update for FLUBLOK is a modest positive for Sanofi's vaccine business. Key financial implications:Potential for increased market share in the pregnant women segmentEnhanced competitive positioning against other flu vaccine manufacturersPossible boost to FLUBLOK sales, though likely incremental rather than transformativeSanofi's vaccine division accounted for about 16% of 2022 sales. While flu vaccines are important, they're not the primary growth driver. The company's focus on expanding real-world evidence could lead to similar updates for other vaccines, gradually strengthening its overall portfolio.Investors should view this as a quality improvement rather than a major catalyst. It aligns with Sanofi's strategy of leveraging its extensive vaccine expertise, but is unlikely to significantly move the needle on the stock in the short term. 10/16/2024 - 12:26 PM US FLUBLOK label1 updated to incorporate new safety study in pregnant individualsNew safety data involving more than 48,000 pregnant individuals published in American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (AJOG) Global ReportsRecombinant or inactivated flu vaccines are recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for individuals who are or will become pregnant during flu season2,3,4Sanofi is committed to the ongoing rigorous scientific study of flu vaccines in at-risk populations, including older patients, patients with comorbidities and pregnant individualsBRIDGEWATER, N.J., Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has updated the label for FLUBLOK (Influenza Vaccine) to include data from a new safety study involving pregnant individuals 18 years and older, in time to inform those hoping to comply with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to receive their annual flu vaccine ideally before the end of October.4,5 The results from the study of more than 48,000 pregnant individuals across multiple flu seasons were recently published in American Journal of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AJOG) Global Reports and demonstrate FLUBLOK safety is consistent with a standard-dose flu vaccine and pregnancy-related outcomes in the general population.1,5 Thomas GrenierHead of Vaccines, North America, Sanofi"Today, we're proud to announce an important update to our label for FLUBLOK, from one of Sanofi's largest flu vaccine safety studies ever done in pregnant individuals, an important at-risk population group for influenza. Here at Sanofi, we strive to bring immunizations to populations at various stages of life. This update is an example of our ambition to continue expanding the body of real-world evidence for our flu vaccines portfolio, grounded in robust efficacy data. We do this so that patients and healthcare providers can have the confidence to use our vaccines as an important preventative tool ahead of the influenza season." This study was a post-licensure, observational, retrospective safety surveillance study of 48,781 pregnant individuals, including those with chronic conditions.1 In the study, patients were immunized with either FLUBLOK Quadrivalent (30.7%; n=14,981) or with a comparator standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (67.3%; n=33,800) during the Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.1 Immunization occurred within 28 days prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy.1 The efficacy of FLUBLOK (quadrivalent) is relevant to FLUBLOK (trivalent) because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.5 Results showed: FLUBLOK demonstrated no increased risk of pregnancy, birth or neonatal/infant outcomes when compared to a standard-dose flu vaccine and estimated pregnancy outcomes for the general population.1The most frequently reported pregnancy outcomes in the FLUBLOK Quadrivalent and SD-IIV4 groups respectively were eclampsia/preeclampsia (8.4% in both cohorts), preterm labor (3.6% and 3.5%), spontaneous abortion (3.1% and 3.0%), congenital/fetal anomalies detected during pregnancy (2.4% in both cohorts), placental abruption (0.8% and 0.7%) and stillbirth/fetal death (0.4% and 0.5%).1The most frequently reported birth and neonatal/infant outcomes in the FLUBLOK Quadrivalent and SD-IIV4 groups were small for gestational age (SGA) (8.8% and 8.7%), major congenital anomalies (7.7% in both cohorts), preterm birth (7.3% and 7.5%), low birth weight (LBW) (5.9% and 5.8%) and failure to thrive (1.0% and 1.1%), respectively.1Per the CDC, pregnant and postpartum (up to two weeks after the end of pregnancy) individuals are at higher risk for severe illness and complications from flu, particularly during the second and third trimesters.4 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends full vaccination during pregnancy, as this is when the risk of severe illness is highest.3,4 The CDC, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and ACOG recommend that individuals who are or will become pregnant during flu season receive an inactivated or recombinant vaccine as soon as it is available, as pregnant persons with influenza may be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm labor and delivery.2,3,4 With over 125 years of heritage in helping protect global public health, Sanofi is one of the world leaders in vaccines, helping to vaccinate more than 500 million people annually. As one of the largest providers of influenza vaccines to the United States with a wide range of options, Sanofi meets immunization needs across the lifespan, from children as young as six months of age through adults 65 years of age and older. Indication and Important Safety Information for FLUBLOK (Influenza Vaccine) What is FLUBLOK (Influenza Vaccine)? FLUBLOK is a vaccine indicated for immunization for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A and B strains represented by antigens contained in the vaccine. FLUBLOK is given to people 18 years of age and older. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR FLUBLOK® (INFLUENZA VACCINE) FLUBLOK should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine. Tell your health care provider if you have ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe muscle weakness) after a previous influenza vaccination. If FLUBLOK is given to people with a compromised immune system, including those receiving therapies that suppress the immune system, the immune response may be lower than expected. Vaccination with FLUBLOK may not protect all people who receive the vaccine. Fainting has occurred following vaccination with FLUBLOK. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. In adults 18 through 64 years of age, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, headache, tiredness, and muscle pain. In adults 65 years of age and older, the most common side effects were pain where you got the shot, tiredness and headache. Other side effects may occur.

"The high likelihood that they will spread further should be a wake-up call for the global community."The report outlines 15 key drivers of pandemic risk, categorized as social, technological, environmental, economic, and political. Despite an interconnectedness among the scientific community, the report says distrust in governments at home and abroad threatens global health.Renewing trust in public health and science is of the utmost importance before a future pandemic, the report said. Also emphasized is that the next pandemic will likely not be similar to COVIV-19.There is a risk that focusing solely on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in preparing for the last battle rather than the next one."There is a risk that focusing solely on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in preparing for the last battle rather than the next one," the report says. Threat of tropical diseasesOverall, the report said countries will need to adopt a One Health approach as the animal-to-human interface will be the likely source of the next pandemic. “Places that have a dense human-animal-environment interface and are undergoing rapid change are ripe to become new hotspots of emergence of novel diseases with epidemic potential," the authors wrote. "Soon temperate countries may see outbreaks of diseases that are usually seen in tropical areas, such as epidemics transmitted by mosquitoes, including dengue or yellow fever."The report also noted the ongoing outbreak of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the polio detection in Gaza to highlight how political instability can have major public health consequences. Zimbabwe reports first mpox cases News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Mpox Zimbabwe reported its first mpox cases yesterday, a child and an adult from two separate towns who had traveled recently, according to an African media report. NIAID/Flickr cc At a briefing yesterday, the country’s health minister, Douglas Mombeshora, MD, said the cases were detected in Harare and Mberengwa, according to NewZimbabwe, an online newspaper. The patients include an 11-year-old child and a man who had traveled to South Africa and Tanzania, respectively.The cases push the number of African countries that have reported mpox cases to 17. The report didn’t say what mpox clade or clades were involved. Africa is battling a complex mpox outbreak involving different clades. The patients are isolating at home and are in stable condition. On August 14, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to a surge in mpox activity in Africa, with some of the circulation involving a novel clade of the virus. The region continues to report about 3,000 cases a week, along with a slow but steady stream of newly affected countries. More Marburg vaccine arrives in Rwanda as outbreak numbers slow News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Marburg Viral Hemorrhagic Fever The Sabin Vaccine Institute has delivered 1,000 more doses of its investigational Marburg virus vaccine to Rwanda, following an initial shipment of 700 doses. In an update yesterday, Rwanda’s health ministry said 669 vaccine doses have already been administered. Photo: Courtesy of Sabin Vaccine Institute The immunization campaign is part of a phase 2 open-label trial sponsored by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre. The single-dose vaccine is being given according to a clinical trial that been reviewed by Rwandan ethics and regulatory authorities, Sabin said in a statement.Amy Finan, Sabin’s chief executive officer, said every moment counts in an outbreak and that seamless collaboration with the Rwandan government was key to accelerating the process. “On our side, we moved quickly by leveraging our experience with other outbreaks and having vaccine doses and supporting documents ready, thanks to a strong partnership with ReiThera,” she said. ReiThera is a vaccine manufacturer based in Italy.Recoveries outpace cases and deathsIn updates over the past 3 days, Rwanda’s health ministry reported one new case and another death, raising the outbreak total to 62 infections, 15 of them fatal. Twenty six people have now recovered from their illnesses.Rwanda declared the Marburg outbreak, the country’s first, on September 27. Most cases are linked to two hospital clusters in Kigali. Study: Natural killer cells determine RSV severity News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) GOLFX/iStock Researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital published new research in Science Translational Medicine showing that natural killer (NK) cells in some children may make them more prone to severe cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The findings come from the results of airway swabs and blood samples taken from 47 critically ill children hospitalized with RSV and bronchiolitis and compared them to samples from healthy controls. The authors found airway NK cells were increased in intubated children, those with severe hypoxemia, and those with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation. Blood NK cells, however, were lower in sick kids compared to controls. Similar pattern seen in COVID patients An NK cell is one of the "first responders" to viral infection, the authors explained, but too many NK cells in the airway can trigger lung inflammation. Conversely, too few NK cells in . peripheral blood samples suggest ill children had altered activating receptor expression, and their NK cells did not perform their immunological function of killing diseased cells.The research group also found similar patterns in literature on NK cells and COVID-19 patients. Our findings fit with data from some studies in COVID-19, which reported that patients with the most severe symptoms also had increased NK cells in their airways."Our findings fit with data from some studies in COVID-19, which reported that patients with the most severe symptoms also had increased NK cells in their airways, " said study author Melody G. Duvall, MD, PhD, in a press release from Brigham and Women’s Hospital. "Together with previous studies, our data link NK cells with serious viral illness, suggesting that these cellular pathways merit additional investigation. " HHS funds project to mine microbiome for infection-fighting bacteria News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Misc Emerging Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Nathan Reading / Flickr cc The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is funding a new project that seeks to harness the power of the microbiome to fight bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).The Pro/Prebiotic Regulation for Optimized Treatment and Eradication of Clinical Threats (PROTECT) project, funded through the Advanced Research Project Agency for Health (ARPAH), aims to develop a platform to identify and develop treatments based on beneficial bacteria and nutrients that can outcompete and suppress harmful bacteria and prevent infections before they take hold, spread, or become resistant. If we can keep people from becoming patients in the first place, we can reduce antibiotic usage and support the global work against AMR. Renee Wegrzyn, PhD “Imagine if we could unlock the microbiome’s potential to proactively fight infections,” ARPA-H Director Renee Wegrzyn, PhD, said in a press release. "If we can keep people from becoming patients in the first place, we can reduce antibiotic usage and support the global work against AMR."The PROTECT project will begin with research, led by investigators at the University of California, Berkeley, into an at-home, inhalable treatment containing probiotics and prebiotics that can combat lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a highly resistant bacterium that causes severe infections in people with cystic fibrosis or pneumonia. The hope is that findings from this research can be used to develop a generalizable platform for producing treatments for other types of infections.The project has a budget of up to $22.7 million. Quick takes: Second polio vaccination round in Gaza, Ebola countermeasure contract, H5N1 strikes Vietnamese zoo cats News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Polio Ebola Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) A second round of polio vaccination began today in Gaza, with a plan to reach 591,700 children younger than 10 years old, according to a statement from the World Health Organization (WHO). At least two doses of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) are needed to interrupt transmission. As in the first round in early September, the second round involves three phases over a 3-day period, with one catch-up day. The first round reached 95% of eligible kids at the governorate level. Hanan Balkhy, MD, who leads the WHO Eastern Mediterranean regional office, on X today said a second area-specific humanitarian pause is needed to safely deliver the vaccines and ensure all children are protected. “We call on all parties to allow unimpeded access for health workers to complete this vital campaign. Every child must have the chance to receive their vaccine, no matter where they live.” The outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 was detected on July 16.RedHill Biopharma today announced that it has received a cost-sharing contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to advance the development of opaganib, a small-molecule treatment for Ebola virus. The drug has shown mutation-resistant antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity, likely to counteract the vascular impacts of Ebola infection. The company is pursuing an animal-rule pathway for potential approval for Ebola treatment. The host-directed, broad-acting drug is orally administered and is the first in its class. Other US agencies are evaluating opaganib as a countermeasure for mustard gas and acute radiation exposure. BARDA is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR).Vietnamese officials have reported the H5N1 avian flu deaths of captive tigers, lions, and other cats at two zoos, one in Dong Nai province and the other in Long An province, both located in the southern part of the country. According to the notification from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), the outbreak at the My Quynh zoo in Long An province began in early August, killing 27 tigers and 3 lions. The outbreak in the Vuon Xoai Eco-tourism area began on September 8, killing 1 leopard and 20 tigers. The source of the virus isn’t noted, and officials included vaccination data for poultry in the two areas.

Published Oct. 16, 2024 Delilah Alvarado Staff Reporter post share post print email license Syringes of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine lay on a tray at a vaccination center in Berlin on Feb. 28, 2022. The company is developing a combination shot for both COVID and influenza. Carsten Koall via Getty Images Dive Brief: Shares in Novavax fell by as much as one-fifth Wednesday morning after the company disclosed the Food and Drug Administration halted clinical testing of its combination vaccine for COVID-19 and influenza as well as of its standalone flu shots, according to a securities filing. The FDA’s hold, which Novavax was informed of Friday, responds to a report last month of a serious adverse event of motor neuropathy in a participant in the company’s Phase 2 trial of the combination vaccine. The participant, who enrolled in the trial outside of the U.S., received the shot in January 2023. Novavax expects an official letter from the FDA within 30 days. In the filing, the company said the hold could impact the timing of when it starts a planned Phase 3 trial of the combination and standalone flu vaccines. Dive Insight: Novavax was late to enter the COVID market, gaining emergency clearance in 2022 as the fourth coronavirus vaccine on the U.S. market. The company claimed differentiation from Pfizer’s and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines as its shot was built on more traditional protein technology. Novavax also pitched its shot’s safety and ease of distribution. But the vaccine never really caught on and slow sales forced Novavax to adjust its business plans. It laid off staff and cut spending, but still was targeted by an activist investor. Since then, the company has banked its future on the development of combination vaccines and, earlier this year, a deal with Sanofi. The French pharmaceutical company paid $500 million upfront for rights to co-market Novavax’s COVID vaccine, and to develop combination vaccines that incorporated Sanofi’s influenza shots. Novavax retained rights to develop its own combo vaccine, but those plans have now hit a roadblock. Previously, the company had anticipated starting a Phase 3 immunogenicity trial this quarter, which it expected would lead to data by mid-2025. Both timelines are in question if the hold continues for long. With the stock drop Wednesday, Novavax is now worth less than $2 billion.

(Nasdaq: NVAX) announced that the U.S. FDA has placed a clinical hold on its Investigational New Drug (IND) application for COVID-19-Influenza Combination (CIC) and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates. The hold is due to a spontaneous report of a serious adverse event (SAE) of motor neuropathy in a single CIC Phase 2 trial participant outside the U.S. who received the vaccine in January 2023.The participant reported the SAE in September 2024, after the trial completed in July 2023. Novavax is working with the FDA to provide necessary information and resolve the clinical hold. The company's Chief Medical Officer, Robert Walker, MD, emphasized that safety is their top priority and that causality has not been established for this event. Previous COVID-19 and influenza trials by Novavax have shown no signals for motor neuropathy. The COVID-19 IND for Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine is not affected by this clinical hold. Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) ha annunciato che la FDA degli Stati Uniti ha imposto un fermo clinico sulla sua domanda di Nuovo Farmaco Sperimentale (IND) per i candidati vaccinali COVID-19-Influenza Combinati (CIC) e per il vaccino antinfluenzale autonomo. Il fermo è dovuto a una segnalazione spontanea di un grave evento avverso (SAE) di neuropatia motoria in un singolo partecipante alla fase 2 dello studio CIC al di fuori degli Stati Uniti, che ha ricevuto il vaccino a gennaio 2023.Il partecipante ha segnalato il SAE nel settembre 2024, dopo che lo studio si è concluso a luglio 2023. Novavax sta collaborando con la FDA per fornire le informazioni necessarie e risolvere il fermo clinico. Il Chief Medical Officer della compagnia, Robert Walker, MD, ha sottolineato che la sicurezza è la loro massima priorità e che non è stata stabilita una causalità per questo evento. I precedenti studi di Novavax su COVID-19 e influenza non hanno mostrato segnali di neuropatia motoria. L'IND per il vaccino COVID-19 di Novavax non è influenzato da questo fermo clinico.

(Nasdaq: NVAX) a annoncé que la FDA américaine a imposé un arrêt clinique sur sa demande de nouveau médicament expérimental (IND) pour les candidats vaccins COVID-19-Influenza Combiné (CIC) et vaccin contre l'influenza autonome. Cet arrêt est dû à un rapport spontané d'un événement indésirable grave (SAE) de neuropathie motrice chez un participant unique à l'essai de phase 2 CIC en dehors des États-Unis, qui a reçu le vaccin en janvier 2023.Le participant a signalé le SAE en septembre 2024, après que l'essai se soit terminé en juillet 2023. Novavax collabore avec la FDA pour fournir les informations nécessaires et résoudre l'arrêt clinique. Le médecin-chef de l'entreprise, Robert Walker, MD, a souligné que la sécurité est leur priorité absolue et qu'aucune causalité n'a été établie pour cet événement. Les études antérieures de Novavax sur COVID-19 et la grippe n'ont montré aucun signe de neuropathie motrice. La demande IND pour le vaccin COVID-19 de Novavax n'est pas affectée par cet arrêt clinique. Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: NVAX) gab bekannt, dass die US-FDA eine klinische Aussetzung für den Antrag auf ein Neues Arzneimittel (IND) für die COVID-19-Influenza-Kombination (CIC) und eigenständige Influenza-Impfstoffkandidaten verhängt hat. Die Aussetzung erfolgt aufgrund eines spontanen Berichts über ein schwerwiegendes unerwünschtes Ereignis (SAE) einer motorischen Neuropathie bei einem einzelnen CIC-Teilnehmer der Phase 2 außerhalb der USA, der den Impfstoff im Januar 2023 erhalten hat.Der Teilnehmer berichtete von dem SAE im September 2024, nachdem die Studie im Juli 2023 abgeschlossen wurde. Novavax arbeitet mit der FDA zusammen, um die erforderlichen Informationen bereitzustellen und die klinische Aussetzung zu beheben. Der Chief Medical Officer des Unternehmens, Robert Walker, MD, betonte, dass Sicherheit ihre oberste Priorität sei und dass eine Ursächlichkeit für dieses Ereignis nicht festgestellt wurde. Frühere COVID-19- und Influenza-Studien von Novavax zeigten keine Hinweise auf motorische Neuropathie. Der IND-Antrag für den COVID-19-Impfstoff von Novavax ist von dieser klinischen Aussetzung nicht betroffen. Positive Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine IND is not impacted by the clinical hold Previous COVID-19 and influenza trials showed no signals for motor neuropathy Negative FDA placed a clinical hold on Novavax's CIC and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates Serious adverse event of motor neuropathy reported in a Phase 2 trial participant Potential delay in starting Phase 3 trial for CIC and influenza vaccines Insights Medical Research Analyst negative The FDA's clinical hold on Novavax's COVID-19-Influenza Combination (CIC) and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates is a significant setback for the company's pipeline development. This delay in the Phase 3 trial could impact Novavax's competitive position in the evolving vaccine market.Key points to consider:The hold is due to a single case of motor neuropathy reported 9 months after trial completion, which may not establish causality.Previous trials showed no signals for motor neuropathy, suggesting this could be an isolated incident.The company's existing COVID-19 vaccine IND is not affected, which is important for ongoing operations.For investors, this news introduces uncertainty regarding the timeline for Novavax's combination vaccine development. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the duration of the clinical hold is unknown, potentially delaying market entry and affecting future revenue projections. Financial Analyst negative This clinical hold presents a material risk to Novavax's near-term growth prospects. The company's market cap of $2.01 billion reflects investor expectations for pipeline progression, which is now under pressure.Financial implications to consider:Potential delays in revenue diversification from the combination vaccine programIncreased R&D expenses to address FDA concernsPossible impact on partnership negotiations and future funding opportunitiesWhile the standalone COVID-19 vaccine remains unaffected, the combination vaccine was seen as a key differentiator in a crowded market. Investors should monitor the company's cash position and burn rate, as prolonged delays could necessitate additional capital raising. The stock price may experience volatility as the market reassesses the risk profile and timeline for Novavax's pipeline development. 10/16/2024 - 08:14 AM GAITHERSBURG, Md., Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc.

Photo by Courtney Love Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link With avian influenza, also known as influenza A, making the jump from poultry to dairy cattle earlier this year, concerns increased for other risk to other mammals.Assistant State Veterinarian Dr. Erin Luley answered some questions about the swine industry and avian influenza, if there is a risk and if there is a plan:Has the swine industry had discussions about an influenza A risk? Avian influenza is a subtype of influenza A. Swine are susceptible to influenza A viruses, particular H1, H2 and H3 subtypes.There are some influenza strains of these H types that are endemic in the swine population. These are not considered dangerous transmissible diseases or foreign animal diseases and are not considered regulatory diseases, so Pennsylvania veterinarians are not required to report them to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.Vaccinations are available and are used in swine. Since the emergence of a new B3.13 strain of H5N1 influenza A in cattle, there have been discussion in the swine industry about the risks that this may pose to swine.Since avian influenza has spread to mammals (cattle), is it likely to spread to swine?At this point there is no evidence that the strain circulating in cattle can infect swine.However, the jump from avian species into mammals raises concerns that this virus may be more likely to infect swine.Is disease mutation necessary before swine would be impacted?Additional mutations would have to occur for swine to be infected. The virus circulating in cattle in other states has not been found to infect swine.A hallmark of influenza viruses is their ability to mutate and produce new strains. Additionally, there is concern that if swine were exposed to the B3.13 cattle strain while also infected with the endemic influenza subtypes, these viruses could potentially share genetic material and result in a new influenza strain adapted to pigs.Would infected swine be likely to have reactions more similar to cattle infections (illness but recovery) or poultry (depopulation)?It is difficult to predict how a novel virus would manifest in a different species. Should this strain of influenza H5N1 infect swine, Pennsylvania would consider additional actions based on best available scientific knowledge.The approach taken in poultry has been largely driven by the World Organization for Animal Health guidelines and international trade implications, and the level of financial devastation that a trade embargo would mean to our $7.1 billion poultry industry. There are currently no such requirements for influenza viruses in swine.Would additional biosecurity measures need to be implemented on top of the swine industry’s usual practices?The department recommends that swine operations minimize contact with poultry and cattle operations. This includes minimizing swine workers’ contact with poultry and cattle, eliminating shared equipment between swine and poultry or cattle farms, and keeping these species separate on small farms that may have both swine and poultry or swine and cattle.Are there types of operations that are currently at a higher risk?If the current circulating strain in cattle becomes endemic in wild birds (which it currently is not), this could potentially put pigs raised outdoors at higher risk, like what we have seen in poultry.Otherwise, there would be no specific type of operation that would likely be at higher risk.However, effective biosecurity measures would be essential to prevent virus introduction.

FluMist has gained approval from the FDA for self-administration by patients aged 18-49. The Latest FluMist is the first influenza vaccine that patients will be able to administer to themselves at home. It was first approved in 2003 but could only be administered by healthcare providers in healthcare settings. A phase 4 randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and acceptance of self-administered FluMist compared to healthcare worker administration. Safety and efficacy did not differ when administered by self or a healthcare provider. 64% of participants surveyed reported self-administration as their preferred method. FluMist has now received FDA approval for self-administration in adults ages 18-49, and caregiver administration in children ages 2-17. However, immunocompromised and pregnant patients should not receive FluMist. FluMist is anticipated to launch for the 2024-2025 flu season. Physician’s Perspective Influenza is a viral illness of the respiratory system. There are four known types of influenza viruses. Influenzas A and B are the types most commonly associated with seasonal epidemics. Over a billion influenza cases are reported a year with a death toll between 290000-650000. The symptoms of influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, and generalized body aches. Presently, treatment of influenza is usually conservative with focus on rest, hydration, and management of cough and cold-like symptoms. Those with rather severe symptoms may be treated with pharmacotherapy. The priority with influenza management, however, remains prophylactic vaccinations. One factor in non-adherence to annual vaccinations tends to be convenience as patients are often not able to get to a healthcare provider for vaccinations. With the approval of FluMist for self-administration by the FDA, there is potential for a significant rise in annual vaccination rates which will hopefully reduce the epidemic burden of influenza. Molecular Targets FluMist is an intranasal live attenuated vaccine against influenza A and B. It provides protection against the influenza virus by priming the immune system. FluMist introduces weakened viral particles to the respiratory tract, which stimulates the production of specific antibodies that bind to proteins on the surface of viruses and marks them for destruction. The body learns to mount an immune response against the influenza virus and creates memory immune cells that will be able to quickly attack the virus upon subsequent exposure.

(KOTA) - Every week, we bring you a different medical professional to talk about ways for you to stay healthy.This week, we visit with Katie Lesselyoung, a pharmacy resident with Monument Health.“You may be eligible for three vaccinations this fall, influenza, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV,” Lessel Young said, “Yearly influenza vaccinations are the best way to reduce the risk of catching seasonal flu or developing potentially serious complications from catching it. After receiving the vaccine, people typically need two weeks to develop a protective response to the influenza virus. Monument Health recommends getting your annual shot in early October, if possible, ahead of the typical flu season from December through March. Those six months of age and older are also eligible to receive a single dose of an updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at least two months after the last dose of any other COVID-19 vaccines,” said Lesselyoung.“And finally, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a highly contagious virus that causes mild cold-like symptoms in most people,” Lessel Young said, “Some people, particularly infants and older adults, are more likely to develop severe RSV disease and require hospitalization. RSV is seasonal, typically starting in the U.S. during the fall and peaking in the winter. There is an FDA-approved vaccine for pregnant individuals to prevent RSV in infants from birth through six months of age. Additionally, there are two FDA-approved vaccines to prevent RSV in adults aged 75 and older, and those 60 to 74 years of age who are at an increased risk of complications from RSV. Talk to a healthcare provider to see if an RSV vaccine is right for you. It is safe and effective to receive all three of these vaccines in a single visit, should an individual choose to get all of them at once. Vaccines are very safe and effective in preventing disease. It is common to experience soreness at the injection site after vaccinations. Severe side effects after receiving a vaccine are rare, but if any, if you have any concerns after receiving a vaccine, contact your healthcare provider,” added Lesselyoung.See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Wastewater surveillance could have revealed the spread of H5 influenza before official confirmation in birds, cows and humans.Monitoring wastewater may help public health officials respond to outbreaks quicker.LOS ANGELES — Public health officials could have detected H5 influenza in wastewater days before highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed in cattle earlier this year, according to a study presented at IDWeek.“One of the most important parts to public health responses is having the time to implement them and being prepared,” Alessandro Zulli, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said during a media briefing ahead of the conference. Wastewater surveillance could have revealed the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds, cattle and people before any cases were confirmed. Image: Adobe Stock “That’s really where wastewater monitoring can help with these things,” Zulli said. “All of our detections in the wastewater were often days ahead of when it was actually detected in cattle, because cows don’t really go to the doctor.”This year, H5N1 influenza has affected more than 103 million wild birds, poultry and backyard flocks and 323 dairy herds in the United States, according to the CDC. There have been 25 reported cases in humans in five states — 11 in California since Oct. 3. Most cases have had a reported contact with cattle or poultry, but one person in Missouri had no known exposures.Although wastewater surveillance is not new, it attracted more interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC, which monitors wastewater for influenza A viruses as part of its regular year-round surveillance, added an online dashboard in May to help track the potential spread of H5N1.For their study, Zulli and colleagues developed an assay that enabled them to differentiate H5 viruses from other influenza A viruses in wastewater. According to the researchers, it demonstrated 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity in detecting H5 viruses based on testing against clinical specimens, including other influenza A viruses.The assay identified 59 wastewater treatment plants with increases in the H5 this year that coincided with the bird flu outbreak in cattle. In three Texas plants, retrospective testing using the assay showed that H5 was present before the official confirmation of H5N1 in cattle or the first human case in Texas, according to Zulli and colleagues. The source of the H5 viruses was likely animal processing facilities, they found.Detecting viruses in wastewater offers public health officials time to build a response and understand how a disease is spreading, Zulli said. Because a system for collection and analysis of water samples already exists, the time to response could be significantly sped up, he said.“To me, wastewater monitoring remains the fastest, most unbiased method to actually measure the prevalence [of viruses] among the population, and leveraging this could have enormous implications for understanding the spread of illnesses and implementing interventions,” Zulli said.References:Zulli A, et al.

By Kristina Herndon, RN Updated on October 17, 2024 Medically reviewed by Soma Mandal, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents What Is the Risk? Flu-Like Side Effects Can I Still Get Flu? Infecting Others Close You cannot get the flu from a flu shot because the vaccines are made with killed or weak viruses that cannot cause an infection. With that said, you can experience mild flu-like symptoms a day or two after the injection due to the activation of your immune system. Getting the flu shot doesn't mean you won't get the flu. This is because the annual vaccine only protects against the influenza strains predicted for that season. Even so, flu vaccination may lessen the severity and duration of the flu compared to going unvaccinated. Illustration by Joshua Seong. © Verywell, 2018. Why You Can't Get the Flu From a Flu Shot The flu is caused by the influenza virus of which there are two main types (types A and B) and a multitude of viral strains. Flu vaccines work by introducing a form of the virus into the body to trigger an immune response—in the form of antibodies—without causing the flu itself. There are three categories of flu vaccines used for this: inactivated vaccines, recombinant vaccines, and live, attenuated vaccines. Inactivated Flu Vaccines Inactivated vaccines, also known as whole-killed vaccines, are those made from viruses that have been killed. Although the dead viruses cannot replicate or cause infection, the immune system still regards them as a threat and starts producing defensive antibodies in response. For most inactivated flu vaccines, the virus is first incubated (grown) in chicken eggs and then harvested, inactivated (either with formaldehyde or beta-propiolactone), and purified for use in vaccines. The only exception is the Flucelax vaccine which is grown in mammal cells. There are currently eight inactivated influenza vaccines approved for use in the United States, each of which is delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection: Afluria Quadrivalent Aflura Trivalent Fluad Fluarix Trivalent Flucelvax Flulaval Trivalent Fluzone Fluzone High-Dose Recombinant Flu Vaccine The recombinant flu vaccine cannot cause flu because it is synthetic and does not contain the influenza virus in any form. Recombinant vaccines involve a technology in which a small piece of genetic material (DNA) of a virus is inserted into a "host" virus that does not cause disease in humans. The "recombinant" virus then starts churning out harmless proteins that the body regards as a threat when injected into to the body, spurring the production of antibodies. For the recombinant flu vaccine, the "host" virus is the baculovirus which affects only insects. Chicken eggs are not involved in the manufacturing of the vaccine. There is one recombinant influenza virus approved for use in the United States which is also delivered by IM injection: Flublok Trivalent Live-Attenuated Flu Vaccine Live-attenuated vaccines contain whole bacteria or viruses that have been weakened (attenuated) so that they trigger an immune response but do not cause disease in healthy people. The version used for flu is called a live-attenuated influenza vaccine, or LAIV. LAIV is also grown in chicken eggs, but rather than killing the virus after harvesting, the virus is repeatedly passed through a series of chicken eggs (referred to as "passaging"). With each passage, the virus starts to mutate and weaken until it effectively loses its virulence (ability to infect). There is one LAIV approved for use in the United States, which is delivered not by injection by rather by a nasal spray: FluMist intranasal Why FluMist Cannot Cause the Flu Even though live-attenuated vaccines contain weakened viruses, the viruses are still living and, with some vaccines, can potentially cause infection in people with severely weakened immune systems. This is not the case with FluMist.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FluMist will not cause flu, in part because the viruses are cold-adapted, meaning that they only multiply at cooler temperatures within the nose. Once exposed to normal body temperature, the viruses cannot replicate and, without replication, an infection cannot occur. Flu-Like Symptoms After a Flu Shot Although the flu vaccine cannot give you the flu, it can have side effects that mimic influenza. This stems from the sudden activation of your immune system. When exposed to the vaccine, the immune system will respond as if the actual virus were there. As part of the body's natural defense, it will release chemicals that spur inflammation. Under normal circumstances, inflammation helps the body fight disease by raising the body temperature (to help neutralize the invader) and widening blood vessels (allowing defensive white blood cells closer access to the site of the invasion). These effects are experienced as aches, pain, and other signs and symptoms of inflammation. With flu vaccination, the same can occur, leading to the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms such as: FatigueHeadacheLow-grade feverMuscle achesJoint painNausea But, because there is no virus to cause an actual infection, these symptoms are relatively mild and short-lived, with the immune system ramping down its defense within one to two days. In addition to flu-like symptoms, the FluMist nasal spray can sometimes cause mild, cold-like symptoms, including runny nose, sore throat, and cough. Getting the Flu After a Flu Shot The annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself from the flu, but it doesn't mean you still can't catch the flu. This may be because you caught the flu before the vaccine was able to afford you immune protection (generally up to two weeks). At the same time, the flu vaccine is not perfect. In the end, there are many strains of influenza A and B, and the annual vaccine only protects against those most likely to cause illnesses during the next flu season. In late February or early March of each year, experts from the CDC, World Health Organization (WHO), and others review data from around the world to decide which four vaccine viruses to use in the next quadrivalent vaccines and which three vaccine viruses to use in the next trivalent vaccines. Because these vaccines only target the major strains predicted for that season, it is possible to get other strains not covered by the vaccines. This can affect the vaccine's effectiveness. According to data published by the CDC, vaccine effectiveness for the 2023-2024 flu season ranged from 59% to 67% for children and from 33% to 49% for adults. Vaccinated people who get the flu will sometimes claim that the shot "gave them the flu" when, in fact, the vaccine only affords partial protection. Even with vaccination, other standard preventive measures (such as routine handwashing and avoiding others who are sick) should be adhered to. Are Trivalent or Quadrivalent Vaccines Better? Trivalent and quadrivalent flu vaccines are equally effective. The United States is currently transitioning from quadrivalent to trivalent vaccines as one virus type, called influenza B/Yamagata viruses, is no longer actively circulating. Remember, too, that the flu shot only protects you from influenza—not other infections like the common cold, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other viruses that may cause flu-like symptoms. Adults typically catch two to four colds per year, and young children will get six to eight. Giving Someone the Flu After Vaccination FluMist is not recommended for immunocompromised people, but not because the weakened virus might suddenly reactivate and cause disease. Instead, immunocompromised people are less likely to develop enough antibodies to protect against infection. In short, flu vaccines delivered by injection trigger a stronger immune response in immunocompromised people than those delivered by nasal spray. Another potential risk of FluMist involves people living with a severely immunocompromised person (such as someone going through a stem cell transplant). With FluMist, a vaccinated person will commonly experience viral shedding during which live viruses are released from nasal passages for one to two weeks. These viruses, while unlikely to cause infection in a healthy person, can potentially cause infection in an immunocompromised person. For this reason, FluMist is contraindicated for use in households with a severely immunocompromised individual. Flu shots should be given instead. Summary You cannot get the flu from a flu shot or FluMist (the nasal spray flu vaccine). With that said, it is possible to experience flu-like symptoms a day or two after vaccination due to the activation of the immune system. You can also get the flu after a flu shot as the vaccine is only partially effective in preventing infection. Even so, annual flu vaccination remains the single best way to avoid getting the flu and potentially serious complications of infection. 14 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

The ministry said the change in status was linked to a rise in the number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in several neighbouring countries, raising the possibility of migratory birds passing on the virus while passing through France. A growing number of European countries have reported cases of the virus that has killed millions of poultry in previous outbreaks, including Germany. France has reported four bird flu outbreaks on farms since the summer and launched a second vaccination campaign among farm ducks of more than 250birds at the start of the month after a successful inaugural programme last year.

The risk of influenza transmission follows the pattern of disease activity in the community, which is currently low. Influenza activity typically increases over the fall months and peaks towards the holiday season. The southern hemisphere, particularly Australia, had a moderately high influenza season, with more cases this year than last year. Rates were highest in 5- to 9-year-olds, followed by 0- to 4-year-olds. This means that the northern hemisphere could potentially experience similar case rates this respiratory season. “I strongly recommended that all residents in the KFL&A region, regardless of age or health status, prioritize getting their flu shot this fall. Influenza can result in severe outcomes and pose serious health risks to anyone, especially to those who have underlying medical conditions, those over 65 years of age, and young children,” said Dr. Piotr Oglaza, medical officer of health for KFL&A Public Health. Influenza vaccine is currently available for those who are at highest risk at participating pharmacies, through primary care, and public health clinics for individuals under the age of 5 without access to primary care. The general public will be eligible for influenza vaccine on Oct. 28. Alongside immunization, individuals should practice hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing into their elbow, and regular disinfection of high-touch surfaces to help prevent transmission. Symptomatic individuals should stay home when they feel unwell. Influenza symptoms include: fever (greater than 38⁰C/100.4⁰F) cough or chills headache or muscle aches loss of appetite nausea or vomiting (mainly exhibited in young children) sore throat runny nose Individuals with influenza may remain infectious for several days after symptom onset. When recovering from any respiratory illness, consider wearing a mask when around others, and avoid visiting anyone immunocompromised or living in a high-risk setting (e.g., long-term care home) for 10 days from symptom onset. This fall the KFL&A region will have several options to get a flu shot. Flu shots will be available through: Health-care providers (for patients aged six months and older). Local pharmacies (for patients aged two years and older). KFL&A Public Health clinics (for residents with children under two years of age and those over 65 years).

File photo Posted Monday, October 14, 2024 4:01 pm Flu symptoms Influenza typically worsens underlying illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website also notes that those with influenza may suffer from some or all of the symptoms below: - Feverish symptoms - Cough - Sore throat - Runny or stuffy nose - Headaches - Fatigue - Vomiting and diarrhea, more common for children than adults. To learn more about the signs and symptoms of influenza, visit cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html. Norman Helgason / norman@thereflector.com As flu season approaches, Clark County Public Health Director Alan Melnick urges all eligible individuals to get their flu vaccine now, especially people 65 and older. As Clark County residents have stopped social distancing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, annual influenza-related deaths are rising in the area. Before the pandemic, the county saw 15 flu-related deaths in the 2017-18 season. The numbers stayed at five or fewer from 2019 to 2022 but rose back to 14 deaths during the 2022-23 flu season. “As long as our people are out and about and not social distancing and masking like they were before, we’re likely to [see more] influenza. It’s a respiratory illness. That’s how it’s spread,” Melnick said. Given the unpredictability of flu season, Melnick stressed the importance of early vaccination. The flu season technically begins when 10% or more of influenza tests are positive. “The reason this is important is it’s not that predictable, and that’s why people should get their flu vaccine now because it can take up to two weeks to build immunity from the flu shot,” Melnick said. Melnick particularly emphasized the heightened risk flu poses to seniors, citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data indicating 70% to 85% of flu-related deaths occur among individuals ages 65 or older. Underlying illnesses, including heart or lung disease, are made severely worse by influenza. Melnick emphasized that virtually any underlying illness, from diabetes to asthma, can be made worse by influenza. “Your immunity is not as great as it was when you were a young, healthy adult. … Even if you haven’t had a history of lung disease, you’re still more at risk for pneumonia,” Melnick said. While seniors are more vulnerable, Melnick emphasized the importance of everyone getting the vaccine, noting how contagious the flu is. The flu vaccine remains one of the best methods to prevent its spread. Even if flu season peaks in January, Melnick said getting the shot now will last through the upcoming flu season. Additional preventative measures, such as staying home when sick, hand-washing and mask-wearing are also encouraged. “We certainly see flu outbreaks in long-term care facilities … where you have congregate settings where you have seniors there. So it’s important to get vaccinated, not only to protect yourself but people around you, and that goes for young people, also. We want young people to get vaccinated because we don’t want them to spread the disease to grandma and grandpa. So, there’s a reason for all of us to get vaccinated,” Melnick said. “... Don’t just get the flu shot for yourself. Get it for everybody around you. We need to put a cocoon around our senior population to help protect them.” Everyone 6 months or older is eligible for the vaccine. Those unsure of their risk should contact their physician or health care provider. Additionally, the Washington State Department of Health recommends those 65 or older receive a higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines from their health care providers. Residents can get vaccinated by contacting their health care provider or local pharmacy, and they can find nearby locations at vaccinefinder.org. Clark County residents may also be eligible for low-cost options through Sea Mar Community Health, with more information available at seamar.org/services-clark.html. Free clinics at various locations, including Free Clinics of Southwest Washington and Battle Ground HealthCare, are also available for residents. People can find out if they qualify at freeclinics.org and bghealthcare.org/see-if-you-qualify. Residents can find more resources at clark.wa.gov/public-health/immunization.

View all partners Languages Français English Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As the fall months settle in, Canadians are being urged to take precautions against the upcoming flu season. Flu season in Canada typically peaks between December and February, but the virus can circulate much earlier. Public health officials are advocating for early vaccination, emphasizing that the annual flu vaccine is the most effective way to protect against infection and reduce the severity of illness. Clinics across Canada offer flu shots free of charge. Influenza Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that spread easily from person to person. These viruses mainly affect the nose, throat and lungs. Flu symptoms typically include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches and fatigue. Unlike the common cold, which often develops slowly, the flu tends to hit suddenly and can lead to severe complications like pneumonia, bronchitis and even death, particularly in high-risk groups such as young children, seniors over 65, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart disease. Influenza spreads mainly through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby, or they can linger on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to 48 hours. Preventive measures such as handwashing, mask-wearing and staying home when symptomatic help reduce the spread of the virus. How the flu vaccine works Each year, flu vaccines are updated to protect against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. The flu shot contains inactivated or weakened influenza viruses, which cannot cause the flu but help the immune system develop antibodies. These antibodies protect against infection when exposed to live flu viruses. The vaccine typically takes about two weeks after administration for immunity to build up, which is why public health officials recommend getting vaccinated in the fall, before flu rates start to rise. This gives individuals enough time to develop immunity before influenza becomes more widespread. Can you get flu and COVID-19 vaccines together? Each year, flu vaccines are updated to protect against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. (Shutterstock) Public health experts have confirmed that it is safe to receive the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. Doing so can provide protection against both illnesses and reduce the chances of severe complications from either virus. Administering both vaccines during the same visit is a convenient way to ensure you’re protected for the season, especially as COVID-19 continues to circulate alongside influenza. Benefits of the flu shot One of the key benefits of flu vaccination is that it significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death from the flu. While flu vaccines aren’t 100 per cent effective at preventing infection, they greatly lessen the severity of the illness and reduce the spread of the virus in the community. This is especially important for protecting high-risk groups like seniors, children, pregnant people and individuals with chronic health conditions. Additionally, widespread flu vaccination helps prevent the health-care system from becoming overwhelmed, especially in a year when other respiratory viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 are still circulating. By reducing the overall number of flu-related hospitalizations, vaccines also free up health-care resources for other urgent needs. Why get vaccinated every year? One of the unique challenges of influenza is that the virus mutates constantly. Because of these frequent changes, immunity from last year’s vaccine won’t provide full protection this season. This is why the flu vaccine is updated annually to match the most prevalent strains of the virus. Even if a person received a flu shot the previous year, it’s important to get vaccinated again to stay protected against new viral strains circulating in the population. Flu vaccines are reformulated each year based on global surveillance data collected by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Misconceptions about the flu vaccine Despite clear benefits, misconceptions about the flu shot continue to contribute to low vaccination rates. Some people believe that the flu vaccine can cause the flu, but this is a myth. The inactivated viruses in the flu vaccine cannot cause illness. After receiving the vaccine, some people may experience mild side-effects like soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but these symptoms are short-lived and far less severe than a full-blown flu infection. Another misconception is that the flu shot is not necessary for healthy adults. While healthy people may have a lower risk of severe flu complications, they can still spread the virus to more vulnerable individuals, such as young children, seniors or immunocompromised family members. Getting vaccinated helps protect both the individual and the community through herd immunity.

Dairy farmers should remain alert about the disease. When a herd is affected, producers should partner with their veterinarian and the state department of agriculture to increase knowledge about the disease. Milking time is a potential risk for infection with HPAI of cows and employees. Photo by Phil Durst, MSU Extension. In Michigan, a number of cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly referred to as “bird flu” affected dairy herds during the spring of 2024. Since then, new cases reported during the summer months have decreased to a total of six over five months in four counties (Clinton, Gratiot, Van Buren and Shiawassee). While these may not be all the positive farms, certainly it appears that the number of confirmed cases have been more sporadic. National spread of HPAI However, USDA reported 43 confirmed cases nationally during the month of September, many of which were in California where reports showed herd infections occurring at a fast rate (reportedly 16 dairy herds between September 18 and 23). The bottom line is that the risk is not over, the disease has not passed, and farmers should be diligent. There is much we have learned since HPAI was first identified as the cause of the symptoms seen in cattle herds in Texas and Kansas in late March 2024. What we know at this point is that when a herd becomes affected, it can spread rapidly with the incidence peaking 4-6 days after the first animals are affected, and that it is most likely to affect older cows (> 1 lactation) in the mid to late stages of lactation, according to “Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in domestic dairy cattle and cats,” by Burrough, E. R. et al. From the experience of farms that have had HPAI, we know that feed intake drops, rumination decreases and milk production, therefore, drops rapidly. Most cows recover, and herds recover within weeks. Farms have reported some abortions (likely due to high fever), some increased culling and certainly higher labor and veterinary costs. While it may come and go, the disease leaves behind a bill for services of approximately $200,000 in a 1,000 cow herd from lost milk, greater labor and increased costs. While we have learned much about the action of HPAI that helps us to react, it is what we don’t know that doesn’t help us, and there is much we don’t know. The unknowns of HPAI We know that the milk of an affected cow often has a high level of active virus. Though it has not yet been shown, it is believed that milk is a primary way the virus is spread on dairy farms during the milking process. In fact, the virus may spread for a week or more before symptoms are observed on farms. There may be brief respiratory disease at the start of infection, but that remains to be proven and whether it is a significant factor in spread of the virus on farms is not clear. While the virus has not been found in cow manure, manure from a farm pit often contains waste milk or milking equipment washings that may have the virus, thus providing another means of potential transfer of the virus. The virus is apparently resilient and able to survive in the environment for days at the least. We know that animals can be asymptomatic carriers and shedders of the virus in their milk, but whether there are a significant number of these or if it is a significant factor in disease spread, we don’t know. We don’t know if animals develop a robust immune response to the disease and if so, how long it will protect them from reinfection? We don’t know why older cows and cows in later lactation are the ones most likely affected. And we don’t know the risk of a herd reinfection. The answer to these questions really will only be known through herds reporting disease and being willing to undergo testing. Farmers hold the key to more knowledge about the disease so that more herds can be protected. First responses Reacting quickly to suspected disease is critical. If a farmer thinks that their herd may be affected, it is best to voluntarily contact their veterinarian who will report it to the state department of agriculture. Isolate animals showing any signs of the disease (fever, reduced milk), provide supportive therapy with approved NSAIDS to reduce fever and help the animal be more comfortable. Practice good biosecurity as discussed in MSU Extension’s Biosecurity for dairy and beef cattle farms. This is a disease that can move between farms, even without moving cattle. We don’t fully understand how it moves, but the evidence is there. It can also move to poultry operations, whether backyard or commercial and will be quite lethal in those flocks. Quarantine incoming cattle for 21-30 days to monitor for disease break. Fewer and clean vehicles and people coming onto the farm and clean vehicles and people leaving the farm are keys to biosecurity. Biosecurity always depends on people, people who are trained and consistently practice the risk-reducing steps of the plan. Farm owners need to monitor biosecurity to make sure that it is being implemented and frequently train or talk about biosecurity. Testing programs, such as USDA’s program of bulk tank testing for three consecutive weeks are valuable to determine a negative herd status and enable moving lactating cows across state lines. For herds which depend on moving lactating cattle, weekly bulk tank samples after the initial diagnosis of a negative herd, are necessary to allow movement without individual animal testing. Be alert As time goes on, it is easy to become insensitive to the information about HPAI and the risks to one’s herd because of information overload. But there are some things that should cause one to take notice. On the farm, the presence of dead cats often goes hand-in-hand with a herd infection where cats have access to raw milk. On a national level, be alert to these potential developments: Commercialization of a vaccine for H5N1genotype of HPAI. In early September 2024, USDA approved one company to conduct field trials for a vaccine to prevent infection with this strain of the virus. A vaccine would be a tool by which to reduce risks to a herd. Availability of an ELISA test for HPAI. ELISA tests are commonly performed on milk or blood serum samples to detect antibodies against a pathogen. Currently, the problem is that milk samples would potentially contain the virus that could infect those who either take the samples or those who work on them in the lab. For the test to become available, the problem of virus pathogenicity must be solved. Report of HPAI infection in a swine herd. While this has not occurred, the H5N1 virus is prone to mutate in cattle. Mutations are a natural response that enables the virus to survive. If a mutation occurred that enabled the virus to infect swine, the risk to humans would become much greater than it is currently. HPAI is still a threat to dairy herds. It has a cost and carries a burden for farms. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere when the diagnosis of this disease was attached to the problems experienced by herds in Texas and Kansas. The reality is this will not likely be the last herd infection to threaten dairy cattle. Daily practice of good biosecurity is important. For those who believe it is burdensome to practice biosecurity, the burden of the disease is greater. Reducing risks should be a conversation that every farmer has with their veterinarian, Extension educator and with their employees. This article was published by Michigan State University Extension.

The outbreaks elicited immediate and widespread concern, he explains, because they “represent the first time dairy cows in the United States have served as hosts for H5N1” and therefore increase the risk of the virus mutating and becoming easily transmissible to other mammals, including livestock, pets and humans. Continued outbreaks throughout the last six months — to date, 319 herds in 14 states have been infected — have further fanned fears, DeLeo says, that H5N1 could be “fueling a possible pandemic.”DeLeo is no stranger to public health threats, having spent the last four years leading teams in a series of federally funded research projects investigating and informing America’s response to COVID-19. Now, he brings his expertise to bear on H5N1: Supported by a $200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), DeLeo and colleagues from Mississippi State University and Montana State University recently embarked on a study to explore and assess risk mitigation and messaging strategies employed by federal, local and state governments and health care professionals as the H5N1 outbreaks unfold. RELATED: Prof. explores COVID risk communication and behavior with NSF grant Read more Right now, officials say the threat to human health is minimal, as there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human H5N1 transmission. But DeLeo notes that caution is warranted because of the disease’s high mortality rate: Of the 896 human cases of H5N1 resulting from contact with infected birds and documented between 2003 and 2004, 52% proved fatal. (By contrast, the estimated case fatality rate for COVID-19 is 10%.)Beyond the risk to people and pets, sustained outbreaks could wreak havoc on America’s $753 billion dairy industry, which accounts for roughly 3.5% of the GDP. “Depending on their risk perceptions of H5N1,” he says, “people may change their dairy consumption behaviors.” Should the virus spread from dairy cattle to beef cattle, the financial impact could be even greater, given that the U.S. is the world’s top producer of beef as well as its largest consumer.According to DeLeo, the most effective way to mitigate health and economic risks is through clear, concise and coordinated communication among stakeholders. That’s why his new study is specifically designed to assess the alignment (or lack thereof) between risk messaging and behavior within and among three key groups: the federal government, health care providers and the American public. Over the next eight months, DeLeo and his co-researchers will conduct three rounds of interviews with officials from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the federal agency responsible for establishing regulations to monitor and mitigate animal and plant diseases. They will also conduct a three-wave panel survey with veterinarians — who are charged with treating sickened animals and implementing APHIS regulations — and U.S. residents. The H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle represents a potential watershed moment for novel influenza mitigation in the U.S. Rob DeLeo Associate Professor, Public Policy DeLeo emphasizes the unique value of the study in that it allows researchers to analyze, in near-real time, how risk communication, perception and behavior evolve in a pre-pandemic context. “Research on human preparation and mitigation response to disasters is typically captured only when there is an immediate threat to human health and well-being,” he explains. “Our study, by contrast, represents a rare opportunity to collect data during the nascent stage of a disease outbreak, when the virus is aggressively circulating among animal populations but prior to human spillover.” As the researchers will be interviewing and surveying the same group of respondents during all three phases of the study, they’ll also gain critical insights into how individual risk perception and behavior changes over time. “This approach will enable us to develop a more robust and nuanced perspective on risk communication and response efforts,” DeLeo says, noting that that results from each stage of the project will be shared directly with APHIS, veterinary trade organizations and other public health officials via summaries and technical reports. The team also plans to inform the public of their findings through op-eds in national and regional news outlets.“The H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle represents a potential watershed moment for novel influenza mitigation in the U.S.,” DeLeo says. “The individuals managing this crisis — APHIS, state public health officials and veterinarians working on the front lines — need rapid and actionable information about how stakeholders are responding.” By providing just that, he and his co-researchers are hopeful they can help public health officials avoid the pitfalls experienced during COVID: “Our team is uniquely positioned to inform operational strategies promptly and effectively,” DeLeo explains, while “helping to mitigate the potential proliferation of false and misleading information that may emerge as this crisis rolls on.” RELATED: Is public health suffering from a crisis of confidence?

Partners University of Melbourne provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Australian government has committed A$95 million to fight a virulent strain of bird flu wreaking havoc globally. With the arrival of millions of migratory birds this spring, there is an increased risk of a deadly strain arriving in Australia, known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Australia is the only continent free of this rapidly spreading strain. Overseas, HPAI H5N1 has been detected in poultry, wild birds and a wide range of mammals, including humans. But our reprieve will likely not last forever. As Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek warned on Monday, “the awful reality of this disease is that – like the rest of the world – we will not be able to prevent its arrival”. HPAI H5N1 is like nothing we’ve seen in Australia. The extra funding, which is in addition to Australia’s current biosecurity budget, will help us prepare and respond. A trail of destruction Avian influenza is a virus that infects birds, but can infect other animals. In Australia we have various strains of avian influenza that don’t cause disease, referred to as low pathogenic avian influenza. While these viruses occur naturally Australian wild birds, it is the disease-causing strains, such as HPAI H5N1 and HPAI H7 we are worried about. These HPAI strains have enormous consequences for wild birds, domestic animals, and animal producers and workers. HPAI H5N1 first emerged in Asia in 1996, and has been circulating in Asian poultry for decades. Following genetic changes in the virus, it repeatedly jumped into wild birds in 2014, 2016 and again in 2020, after which it caused an animal pandemic, or panzootic. Starting in 2021, the virus rapidly spread. First, from Europe to North America in 2021. Then into South America in 2022. There, in South America, the virus caused the death of more than 500,000 wild birds and 30,000 marine mammals. While we had seen large outbreaks in wild birds globally, the huge outbreaks in seals and sea lions in South America was unprecedented. With this came substantial concern that the virus was spreading from mammal to mammal, rather than just bird to bird or bird to mammal, as was happening elsewhere. About a year after arriving in South America, the virus was detected in the sub-Antarctic, and a few months later, on the Antarctic Peninsula. Australia and New Zealand are still free of the virus, for now. The rising death toll Beyond wildlife, HPAI H5N1 is having a huge impact on poultry. In 2022 alone, it caused 131 million poultry across 67 countries to die of the illness or be euthanased because they were infected. In contrast, earlier this year Australia’s biggest avian influenza outbreak to date – caused by a different strain, HPAI H7 – caused the death or destruction of 1.5 million chickens. That’s a drop in the bucket compared to what is occurring globally. Concerningly, in the United States, the virus has jumped into dairy cattle and so far has affected more than 200 dairy herds in 14 states. It has also jumping into humans: in the past ten days alone, six human cases have occurred – all in dairy workers in California. Given HPAI H5N1 has spread around the globe, the risk of the virus entering Australia has increased. In a recent risk assessment, my colleague and I identified two main pathways for H5N1 into Australia. The most likely route is that H5N1 is brought in from Asia by long-distance migratory birds. Birds such as shorebirds and seabirds arrive in the millions each spring from Asia (and in some cases as far away as Alaska). A second route is with ducks. If the virus spreads across the Wallace Line (a biogeographical boundary that runs through Indonesia), it will come into contact with endemic Australian duck species. Unlike shorebirds and seabirds, ducks are not long-distance migrants, and don’t migrate between Asia and Australia. That endemic Australian ducks are not exposed to this virus because they don’t migrate to Asia may be one of the reasons why H5N1 has not yet arrived in Australia. Unlike shorebirds and seabirds, ducks are not long-distance migrants so they haven’t been exposed to H5N1. Wille & Klaassen (2023), Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, Author provided (no reuse) So, what’s the plan? The Australian government’s new $95 million funding commitment is a crucial response to the heightened level of risk, and the dire consequences if H5N1 entered the country. The funding is divided between environment, agriculture and human health – the three pillars of the “One Health” approach. Broadly, the money will be spent on: enhancing surveillance to ensure timely detection and response if the disease enters and spreads in animals within Australia strengthening preparedness and response capability to reduce harm to the production sector and native wildlife supporting a nationally coordinated approach to response and communications taking proactive measures to protect threatened iconic species from extinction investing in more pre-pandemic vaccines to protect human health. Importantly, the funding covers preparedness, surveillance and response. Preparedness includes proactive measures to protect threatened birds – for example, vaccination or reducing other threats to these species and improving biosecurity. Surveillance is essential to catch the virus as soon as it arrives and track its spread. Australia already has a wild bird surveillance program which, among other things, investigates sick and dead wildlife as well as sampling “healthy” wild birds. The additional commitment will bolster these activities. Response will include things like better and faster tests. It will also include funding for practical on-ground actions to limit the spread and impacts of HPAI H5N1 for susceptible wildlife. This might include a vaccination program for vulnerable threatened species, as an example. Work has already begun This funding is a long-term investment, and mostly allocated to future activities. In the short term, my colleagues and I have already begun our spring surveillance program. We aim to test about 1,000 long-distance migratory birds arriving in Australia for avian influenza. Based on our risk assessments, we are focusing on long-distance migratory seabirds such as the short-tailed shearwater, and various shorebirds including red-necked stints, arriving from breeding areas in Siberia. This surveillance program is supported by, and contributes to, the national surveillance program managed by Wildlife Health Australia In addition to our active surveillance, we need your help! If you see sick or dead wild birds or marine mammals, call the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888. In addition, the Wildlife Health Australia website offers current advice for: people who encounter sick or dead wild birds vets and other animal health professionals bird banders, wildlife rangers and researchers wildlife managers and wildlife care providers, who can access risk mitigation toolboxes.

It’s the first detection in Washington this year of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial poultry operation and is one of about four dozen known commercial and domestic flocks in the state to be infected with the disease since 2022, the department said. “It was a pretty long break we got,” said Amber Betts, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Agriculture. She explained that the fall migration season for wild birds raises the risks of the disease spreading at poultry facilities. As of Thursday, there were no signs the H5N1 virus had spread to humans or other types of livestock in the area where the infected flock was detected, Betts said. “Right now, it’s a poultry outbreak,” she said. In response to outbreaks like this, flocks are quickly euthanized and disposed of either through composting or cremation. Left unchecked, the disease spreads quickly among birds at poultry farms and causes severe illness or death for the animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a program to compensate poultry operations for losses tied to bird flu. Here in Washington, state and federal officials will monitor other commercial bird flocks within about six miles of the Franklin County site where the latest outbreak has occurred. Commercial poultry operations in that zone are required to monitor their flocks’ health closely, with regular surveillance testing, and must request permits from the state to move products deemed safe in or out of the area, according to the state Department of Agriculture. The last outbreak at a commercial poultry facility in Washington involved about 1 million birds, while domestic flocks that have been infected have ranged widely in size, Betts said. Bird flu circulates among wild birds and can spread to agricultural flocks. The first detections in the U.S. of the current H5N1 outbreak of the disease were in January 2022. Since then, the sickness has affected at least 103 million poultry in the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The strain of the virus now active in the U.S. has also infected dairy cows and other mammals, including harbor seals in northwest Washington. There’ve also been at least 25 reported human cases of bird flu across the country in 2024, none of them in Washington state, CDC figures show. Bird flu infections tend to be rare in people and typically occur when people are around animals with the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the general public from the virus remains low. Symptoms in people, according to the CDC, may include eye redness, flu-like respiratory illness, fever, cough, sore throat and in more serious cases, pneumonia. Between 2003 and April of this year, the World Health Organization recorded 889 cases and 463 deaths in 23 countries caused by the H5N1 bird flu virus. A concern is that the virus could mutate in ways that allow it to spread more easily among people.

The positive detection was reported by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) on October 12.An estimated 1.8 million hens were involved, a spokesperson for UDAF said.“Our State Veterinarian’s office was notified of symptomatic birds in Cache County and our team was immediately dispatched to assess the situation,” State Veterinarian Dr. Daniel Christensen stated in a press release. “Proper steps are being taken to prevent further spread of the disease.”UDAF officials are working closely with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) on the incident response. The area in which the birds were located has been quarantined and the infected birds will be depopulated to prevent further spread of the disease.This marks the first time in more than a year that a commercial poultry flock in Utah has been affected by HPAI. The state had two commercial meat turkey flocks struck by the virus on October 6, 2023, according to APHIS. Both of those cases were in Sanpete County, and they collectively included 141,800 turkeys.Prior to that, Utah had not had any positive HPAI cases in commercial flocks since October 2022. In 2022, the state had 19 commercial poultry flocks affected by HPAI, involving 2.1 million birds. Of those 19 flocks, one of them was in Cache County – a commercial table egg laying flock including 1,501,200 hens.

The Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory detected the case, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and samples were sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for more testing. Bird flu has been detected in dairy herds in several other Michigan counties this year and most recently was confirmed in a dairy herd in Shiawassee County. Bird flu has also impacted people this year. Five human cases of bird flu have been reported in Colorado poultry workers. In September, a person in Missouri contracted bird flu without having any known contact with dairy cows or other animals that could be infected with the virus.Guidelines issued for Michigan dairy farms to reduce bird flu spreadAs health officials announce the bird flu detection in Clinton County, they are reminding producers of the guidelines released by MDARD Director Tim Boring to reduce the spread of bird flu. Designate a biosecurity managerDesignate a line of separation to represent the perimeter of a secure area, limiting access pointsEstablish cleaning and disinfection practices and procedures at those access points for both vehicles and individuals, including deliveries of feed and other supplies and training for employeesEstablish a logbook maintaining a record of all vehicles and of individuals who have gotten out of vehicles and crossed those access points, to be retained and made available for examination upon request by MDARD. Critical steps for protecting dairy herds during bird flu outbreakDelay or stop incoming or returning animals from herds with unknown or suspect health status. Isolate all animals that are new or returning to your farm. Monitor the health of your animals daily. Contact your veterinarian if there are ever any animal health-related concerns or if you would like to develop a secure food supply plan. Sick animals should have dedicated equipment and be cared for after tending to healthy animals first. Clothing, footwear, and equipment worn/used around sick animals should not be worn/used around other animals until they are cleaned and disinfected. Use an EPA-registered disinfectant effective against avian influenza. Do not share tools, equipment, trailers, etc. with other farms. Clean and disinfect the interiors of trailers used to haul animals from other operations. Limit non-essential visitors to your farm. If individuals have recently been on a poultry farm, they should not visit a dairy operation, and vice versa. Require or provide clean clothing and footwear to those entering your farm. Use hand-washing stations and provide gloves to those working on your farm.

Not Now Turn OnFDA Approved Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine for Self- or Caregiver-Administration Facebook Twitter Home Briefs Central Florida State National Featured Columnists Archives Orlando | Orange County Election Integrity Crisis: Supervisor Bill Cowles Politics Tourism & Entertainment Contact Us About WON Donate Support WON Search for:Search Button Search West Orlando NewsCentral Florida\'s Independent Voice Tuesday, November 12, 2024 72.4 F Orlando West Orlando NewsCentral Florida\'s Independent Voice Home Briefs Central Florida State National Featured Columnists Archives Orlando | Orange County Election Integrity Crisis: Supervisor Bill Cowles Politics Tourism & Entertainment Contact Us About WON Donate Support WON Search Business / TechNational FDA Approved Nasal Spray Influenza Vaccine for Self- or Caregiver-Administration By Staff October 14, 2024 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray influenza vaccine, FluMist, for self- or caregiver-administration. FluMist is approved for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B in individuals 2 through 49 years of age. FluMist is sprayed into the nose and has been used safely and effectively for many years. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 for use in individuals 5 through 49 years of age, and in 2007, the FDA approved the use of FluMist to include children 2 through 5 years of age. It is the first vaccine to prevent influenza, more commonly known as the flu, that does not need to be administered by a health care provider. “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death. This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA’s commitment to advancing public health.” The flu is a common and contagious respiratory disease that is caused by influenza viruses that typically circulate during the fall and winter in the U.S. It can cause mild to severe illness with a range of symptoms that usually appear suddenly, such as body aches, fever, coughing, sore throat, tiredness and a stuffy or runny nose. Flu can be life-threatening and cause serious complications that can lead to hospitalization or death, particularly in high-risk groups such as the elderly, young children and people with certain chronic medical conditions. Each flu season is different and the health impacts can be substantial and vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu has resulted in about 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Numerous FDA-approved vaccines are available each flu season to prevent influenza. The nasal spray influenza vaccine FluMist contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains and is sprayed in the nose. A prescription is still required to receive FluMist. There are now two approved options for receiving FluMist. The vaccine may be administered by a health care provider in a health care setting (including a pharmacy) or it may be administered by the vaccine recipient or a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older. The most commonly reported side effects of FluMist are fever over 100°F in children 2 through 6 years of age, runny nose and nasal congestion in individuals 2 through 49 years of age and a sore throat in adults 18 through 49 years of age. For those interested in self- or caregiver-administration, the vaccine manufacturer plans to make the vaccine available through a third-party online pharmacy. Those who choose this option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order FluMist. The third-party pharmacy determines eligibility based on the completed screening and, if it is determined that the intended vaccine recipient is eligible, the pharmacy writes the prescription and ships the vaccine to the address provided by the individual who placed the order. The vaccine can then be administered to the prescribed household member(s) at their convenience. A caregiver should administer FluMist to individuals 2 through 17 years of age, as individuals in this age group should not self-administer the vaccine. A study was conducted with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that recipients and caregivers could safely and effectively use the vaccine. Vaccine recipients and caregivers who administer FluMist will be sent the vaccine, the Prescribing Information, Information for Patients and their Caregivers and Instructions for Use. The Instructions for Use provides detailed instructions for storage, administration and disposal of FluMist. The FDA granted this approval of FluMist (Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) to MedImmune LLC.

In France, roughly 210,000 single doses were administered last year.To understand the real-life potential for viral escape, the authors looked at 260 RSV full-length viral genome sequences from nirsevimab-treated infants with breakthrough infections and compared the RSV RNA to that from 285 untreated RSV-infected infants.In the breakthrough infections, 236 cases (91%) were RSV-A, and 24 (9%) were RSV-B.Resistance only seen in RSV-B casesThere were no known nirsevimab resistance–associated mutations in infections caused by RSV-A, and only 2 of the 24 RSV-B infections showed a mutation that conferred resistance to nirsevimab.Overall, breakthrough infections in France were rare, the authors said, and the antibody should be used again in the upcoming RSV seasons. As nirsevimab use becomes more widespread, collaboration between research and public health agencies becomes essential to assess the emergence of resistance.In a commentary on the study, the authors write, "This finding underscores the need for subgroup-specific surveillance strategies to help better explain the different prevalences of monoclonal antibody-escape mutants between RSV-A and RSV-B. As nirsevimab use becomes more widespread, collaboration between research and public health agencies becomes essential to assess the emergence of resistance." Avian flu strikes more California dairy herds, Utah poultry flock News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed five more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in California’s dairy herds, bringing the state’s total to 105. sarahluv/Flickr cc Centered in the state’s Central Valley, the dairy herd outbreaks began at the end August. The surge in outbreaks at dairy farms has come with a steadily rising number of infections in dairy workers, who have reported mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed six infections, and follow-up testing is under way on five others identified during state testing.Utah reports outbreak at Cache County poultry farmElsewhere, the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) reported the confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a commercial poultry flock in Cache County. In a statement, UDAF said the state veterinarian’s office was notified about symptomatic birds and immediately dispatched a team to assess the situation.Utah reported its last avian flu outbreak in poultry nearly a year ago. Cache County is in northern Utah on the border with Idaho. PAHO issues alert about wastewater polio positives from French Guiana News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Polio The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) yesterday posted an epidemiologic alert about recent detections of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) in wastewater samples in French Guiana and urged countries in the region to keep polio vaccination levels above 95% to minimize the risk of outbreaks. varius-studios/ iStock The detection was first reported to PAHO in early August, based on a positive wastewater sample from Cayenne collected on June 26. The sample was one of five from five different sites collected as part of a research project by scientists at the French Research Agency for Emerging Infectious Diseases. Genetic sequencing found that it wasn’t related to any previously identified cVDPV3 strains. Additional positives genetically relatedAdditional wastewater testing at the Pasteur Institute in French Guiana found a positive in a sample collected on August 6 from a site in Remire-Montjoly, and a retrospective wastewater sample collected on May 15 from Saint Georges de l’Oyapock was also positive. More results are pending.The positive samples from the different sites are genetically related and confirm the presence of cVDPV3 in French Guiana, though no suspected cases have been reported, PAHO said.Health officials in French Guiana have stepped up surveillance and have asked healthcare workers to review patients’ polio vaccination status. For undervaccinated or hard-to-reach communities, PAHO said polio vaccination operations should include all antigens used in national immunization programs for children younger than 5 years old. The group also said the efforts should include active searches for suspected cases in health facilities and the community. WHO approves Jynneos for use in teens as study shows undiagnosed mpox common News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Mpox Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the approval of Bavarian Nordic's mpox vaccine, Jynneos, for adolescents aged 12 to 17. The move comes as the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is still raging, and infecting children at high rates. Seroprevalence study suggests many unreported casesIn other mpox news, a new seroprevalence study from German researchers publishing in BMC Infectious Diseases shows a high proportion of clinically undiagnosed mpox among Berlin’s population of men who have sex with men (MSM.)The study was conducted between April 11 and July 1, 2023, and included blood samples from 728 participants, who were recruited from eight private practices and two community-based checkpoints in Berlin.Only 70 (7.4%) participants reported a previous diagnosis of mpox. However serological testing revealed an additional 91 individuals with suspected undiagnosed mpox infection.Men who reported condomless sex with multiple partners were most likely to have mpox, and a substantial proportion of mpox infections were clinically undiagnosed, the authors said. The authors said the findings were cautionary and suggest many more undiagnosed cases in MSM communities. Many infections remain unrecognised and undiagnosed"Mpox control measures based on clinical diagnosis of mpox are likely to have limited effectiveness in preventing mpox transmission in outbreak situations because many infections remain unrecognised and undiagnosed,” they concluded. Kentucky reports state's first captive-deer CWD case, in Breckinridge County News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Richard Roche / Flickr cc The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources yesterday announced the detection of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a deer that died at a captive deer farm in Breckinridge County.The Kentucky Department of Agriculture (KDA) confirmed the case, the state's first in a captive cervid facility, and has issued a quarantine restricting the movement of live deer or deer products to or from the farm."Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials are in close communication with national, state and local partners and will reference the agency's CWD Response Plan in response to this new detection," the news release said. "Since 2002, Kentucky Fish and Wildlife has CWD-tested more than 40,000 deer and elk from across the state.​​​​"The state's first CWD case was identified in December 2023 in Ballard County.Hunters asked to participate in monitoringOfficials urge hunters to help with CWD monitoring by dropping off the heads of legally harvested and telechecked deer for free testing at self-service sample drop-off sites located throughout the state. Kentucky Fish and Wildlife officials are in close communication with national, state and local partners and will reference the agency's CWD Response Plan in response to this new detection.CWD, a neurologic disease caused by misfolded infectious proteins called prions, affects cervids such as deer, elk, moose, and reindeer. Prions are extremely resilient and can persist in the environment for years. CWD poses an ongoing threat to cervids, because it can spread from animal to animal and through environmental contamination. The disease isn't known to infect humans, but officials recommend not eating meat from a sick animal and using precautions when field-dressing or butchering cervids.

According to the agriculture ministry, the change is justified by the evolution of cases in both wild birds and poultry. The French authorities identify migratory wildlife as the most likely vector for the introduction of the virus onto poultry farms. So far this fall/autumn, five HPAI outbreaks in the nation’s poultry have been confirmed (as of October 17), with the most recent cases identified just two days previously.Reassessment of the situation in France followed less than a week after the avian flu risk level for poultry, captive birds, and wild waterfowl was raise in Germany.The national veterinary reference laboratory, Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, explains that the change was driven by the approaching autumn. At this time, potentially infected migratory birds arrive in the country, and the cooler temperatures tend to favor the survival of HPAI viruses.HPAI cases in wild birds have been gradually spreading out across the United Kingdom (U.K.) in recent weeks.Furthermore, Eurasian migratory birds — particularly waterfowl — continue to arrive in Great Britain after passing through areas where HPAI cases have been reported, reports the government’s agriculture department, Defra.The government agency now assesses the incursion risk of HPAI viruses of the H5 family into wild birds as moderate, meaning that is it likely to occur regularly in the coming months. Incursion into poultry ranges from very low (for poultry farms with stringent biosecurity) to low (for premises with suboptimal hygiene). New farm outbreaks in 7 European statesOver the past three weeks, the country registering the most outbreaks of HPAI on poultry farms has been Hungary. The nation’s animal health agency has officially logged 10 outbreaks with the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Cases have been detected — mainly in commercial duck flocks of unspecified size — in five different counties. These are located in the south and southeast of the country, with recent cases also in a central county.Italy’s first HPAI cases of the season in poultry was confirmed on October 1, according to the nation’s reference lab for avian influenza, IZSVe.As of October 14, presence of the H5N1 HPAI virus had been detected at seven poultry farms in three regions (Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Lombardy). Six outbreaks affected meat turkeys, and one was in laying hens.In Poland, three outbreaks linked to the same virus variant have been confirmed by the chief veterinary office since the start of this month (as of October 16). These have affected a total of almost 161,000 commercial ducks (breeding and meat birds) in Lower Silesia in the southwest of the country.First HPAI outbreak of the season in France already occurred in early August, and two more were confirmed later in that month.Since then, two further farms have been affected. Based on WOAH notifications, these comprised flocks of 29,500 and 6,600 poultry in the same department in the most northwestern region of Brittany. These bring the total outbreaks since the start of the HPAI “season” in France to five. Meanwhile, the second phase of the national HPAI vaccination campaign for commercial ducks — largely funded by the state — is scheduled to resume this month.At the end of September, first HPAI cases of the autumn in Bulgarian poultry were recorded by the food safety agency.Directly impacted was a mixed flock of almost 11,000 birds including pheasants, partridges, and American turkeys in the central region of Plovdiv. Earlier this week, the source reported a second outbreak. Affected were around 700 poultry at a research and educational institute in the city of Plovdiv. In recent weeks, the veterinary authorities of Austria and Germany have each notified WOAH about one HPAI outbreak in their respective commercial poultry flocks involving the H5N1 virus serotype.The German outbreak was in the eastern state of Saxony. It affected a small flock of ducks and geese during the last week of September.Meanwhile, Austria’s first cases since February of this year involved around 120 poultry at a farm in the state of Upper Austria in the north of the country. 3 countries report cases in captive birdsSince the end of September, the national veterinary authority of Moldova has registered a total of 27 HPAI outbreaks in captive birds to WOAH (as of October 16). Presence of the H5N1 virus variant has been confirmed.Affected have been birds described as belonging to “village” flocks, including a number of captive wild geese as well as “non-poultry birds” of unspecified type. Outbreaks appear to have occurred in two clusters — 23 in the west of the country, and the other four together in the north.The “captive bird” category also covers backyard poultry and zoos.In mid-September, the French authorities confirmed to WOAH that birds from a backyard flock of 47 poultry had tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The outbreak was in the northern region of Hauts-de-France.Earlier this month, one bird out of a group of 11 pelicans was infected with the same virus variant at a zoo in the northwest German state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, according to a WOAH notification. Wild bird cases widely reported across EuropeFor the first time since the summer, wild birds have tested positive for the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Slovakia, and the German states of Schleswig-Holstein and Thuringia, according to official WOAH reports.The H5N5 virus variant has been detected — also for the first time this autumn — in these populations in the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, and Lower Saxony in Germany. In Norway, a wild bird found dead has tested positive for HPAI, but the virus type could not be identified. Several countries have registered with WOAH further wild bird cases. Hungary, Poland, Spain and three German states have reported additional cases involving the H5N1 virus. More than 50 wild birds in Great Britain have tested positive for the H5N5 virus variant, according to WOAH reports submitted over the past three weeks. EFSA: Human infection risk remains lowThe risk of infection with currently circulating avian influenza A(H5) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b in Europe remains low for the general population, according to the latest risk assessment by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).For those occupationally or otherwise exposed to infected animals or contaminated environments, the agency has not changed its assessment of the infection risk at low-moderate.Covering the period June 21 to September 20, EFSA reports that 19 human cases with influenza virus of avian origin were reported globally. None of these occurred in Europe.

The location was quarantined to contain the illness and the Washington Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory tested samples and reported ‘non-negative’ results on Friday, Oct. 11.According to the WSDA, 'non-negative' results are “presumptive positive” until results are confirmed.The National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the results on Oct. 15.Birds at the facility where the outbreak occurred will be humanely euthanized to contain the outbreak and poultry from the outbreak will not enter the food chain, according to the WSDA.Sudden illnesses or deaths of flocks can be reported online through the WSDA or by calling the sick bird hotline at 1-800-606-3056.The disease is extremely contagious and almost always deadly for birds, said Amber Betts, Washington State Department of Agriculture public information officer. Now that migration season is in session, it is more likely for birds to catch it.One of the symptoms of the disease is sudden death, but other symptoms include random shaking and the inability to walk, Betts said. Some birds could even lose their fear of humans and allow someone to pet them.Physical symptoms include nasal congestion, discoloration and loss of feathers, she said.“Right now, what we're doing is we're…asking people to be vigilant because it is migration season. It's something that we do need to be on the lookout for,” she said. “The best way to control the spread is to make sure that we're dealing with it as quickly as possible.”Betts said people can help prevent the disease by keeping an eye on backyard birds, especially if they start to show symptoms.In a written statement, the Benton-Franklin County Health Department advises people to not wash poultry and to regularly wash their hands, especially when handling raw and cooked meat.The disease is low-risk to the general public and chicken, eggs and other poultry products are still safe to eat if they are cooked properly, the statement said.

Credit: Mater Misericordiae. Mater Research in Brisbane, Australia, has commenced a clinical trial for a new combined Covid-19 and flu vaccine from Novavax aimed at providing protection for individuals who are unable to receive mRNA vaccines. This non-mRNA vaccine is protein-based and includes a segment of the coronavirus spike protein.Related Company ProfilesNovavax IncView all It is designed to trigger an immune response by introducing a harmless piece of the coronavirus spike protein to the immune system. As the immune cells recognise the spike protein as a foreign invader, they start to build a defence against it. Eligible volunteers will include healthy individuals over the age of 65 years who have not received an influenza vaccine in the past two months.

The trial is seeking 150 participants, as confirmed by a representative from Mater Research’s Respiratory, Infectious Disease and Thoracic Oncology (RIO) Unit. The RIO clinical trial unit at Mater Research is currently managing more than 20 clinical trials focused on respiratory health. Mater Infectious Diseases Director professor Paul Griffin is the principal investigator of the trial. In the past year, only 559,000 out of 5.56 million Queenslanders have received a Covid vaccination, while influenza vaccinations have seen a decrease compared with the previous year’s free flu vaccination campaign, with 1.7m vaccinations administered this year, the institute noted. Professor Griffin said: “We know that the majority of people are currently under-vaccinated against both influenza and Covid-19. We hope that providing people with the option of an approved combination vaccine will help with vaccine uptake as there will be no need for two jabs. “We know there are many people who cannot have or do not want to have an mRNA vaccine. Participating in this trial gives people access to a non mRNA option as part of the trial and will provide the data upon which a decision can potentially be made to approve them in the future.” Sign up for our daily news round-up!

(WTVD) -- The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said one person has died from flu-related illness.It is the first reported flu-related death of the 2024-25 flu season in the state.Officials said an adult in the Charlotte metropolitan area died from the flu during the second week of October."This is a sad reminder that influenza can be a very serious illness," said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D., MPH. "Taking preventative measures against flu and other respiratory illnesses like getting vaccinated, regularly washing hands, covering your cough, and staying home when sick are important to help protect you and your family."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all people aged 6 months and older receive a seasonal flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. RSV vaccinations are also available to protect older adults 75 years and older, adults 60-74 years who are at increased risk of severe RSV, and pregnant women during weeks 32 through 36 of pregnancy to protect infants.Parents should talk with their healthcare provider about other options to protect infants from severe RSV disease.For more information about how to access testing and treatments visit the NCDHHS website.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 WTVD-TV.

(KFSN) -- As of Friday afternoon, there are 13 confirmed human cases of the Bird flu in the state and hundreds of infected cows.In the South Valley, a disturbing site of infected and diseased cows on the side of the road sparked biosecurity concerns for local activists.The video, which Crystal Heath captured on the outskirts of Tulare County on October 8th, shows the aftermath of a bird flu outbreak.Several dead cows infected with Bird flu were found lying on the side of the road for a couple of days."I was pretty shocked to see these cows just lying there uncovered out in the open," says Crystal.She continues, "There were no signs warning anybody of the biosecurity risks or warning that there was even an avian influenza outbreak."Crystal, a veterinarian and the Executive Director of "Our Honor," an advocacy non-profit, says she's worried about the spread."I was really worried about the flies. I don't think it's been studied enough how flies may be transmitting the virus. Or if wildlife can contract the virus by touching the mucus membranes of those dead animals," Crystal says.Western United Dairies represents the Tulare County Farm where the cows were found."It's very unfortunate, in this case the farmers have very few options, you have to separate the sick cows from healthy cows, and when they pass, in order to facilitate a process called rendering," says Anja Raudabaugh, CEO of Western United Dairies.She says their protocol is: "They have to be placed near a public road so that the rendering truck does not come onto the dairy and potentially infect the healthy calves."Anja also mentions, "The virus has been known at this point to be transmitted on something called fomite transmission, so boots, shoes, tires, and foreign cars in or around there."Anja says the flu has killed 10 to 15 percent of the state's 1.7 million cows.That's an uptick from the normal 1% annual death rate, and the recent heat has worsened matters.Another added concern is protecting employees."We are in the process of training workers how to identify signs and symptoms," says Anja.Those signs include mild flu-like symptoms and conjunctivitis.Employees also have access to personal protective equipment.But, activists say more needs to be done."There are 17,500 dairy workers in California, and we really should be doing more to make sure they are protected and they are compensated when they have to take time off work so that they aren't scared to be tested for this virus," says Crystal.Plus, "We're advocating for a redirection of public funds away from animal-based protein and towards supporting animal-free methods of food production to enhance our food security and public health," Crystal expresses. Our reliance and dependence on animal-based protein really puts us at risk for pandemic viruses like avian influenza."Dairy products and milk are a multibillion-dollar industry in California.For more details on the Bird Flu virus, visit here.For South Valley news updates, follow Kassandra Gutierrez on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KFSN-TV.

Using protective gear during milking is important to reduce the chance of transmitting pathogens from cows to humans, maintaining worker safety and the quality of dairy products.Image credits: UnsplashUpdated News:October 11: The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has reported two confirmed cases of H5 avian flu, bringing the total to seven probable cases in the state. These cases are linked to outbreaks on dairy farms in the Central Valley, where most infections have occurred among farm workers. Notably, two workers from the same farm were infected, but they worked in different areas and were not close contacts. All six known patients have shown mild symptoms and were treated without hospitalization.1Since the last update, 11 more livestock herds have been affected by the virus in California, bringing the total to 90.2Original News:A third possible human case of bird flu has been identified in California, with the individual having had contact with infected dairy cattle in the Central Valley. Specimens are currently being sent to the CDC for confirmatory testing. Despite this new case, health officials maintain that the risk to the public remains low. Importantly, none of the individuals have required hospitalization.3In the last 30 days, 79 livestock herds have been affected by the virus in California, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.2 All three reported human cases involved individuals who interacted with animals at different farms. The latest case mirrors the previous two, with the individual experiencing mild symptoms such as conjunctivitis, eye redness or discharge. In late March 2024, a dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for the H5N1 virus after experiencing symptoms like eye discomfort.4The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) emphasizes that while the public is not at significant risk, those in direct contact with infected animals—particularly farm workers—are at an elevated risk for contracting the virus. To mitigate this risk, CDPH recommends the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, eye protection, and gloves for anyone working with potentially infected animals or materials.3 Key TakeawaysA seventh possible human case of bird flu has been reported in California, but health officials confirm that the public risk remains low, with no hospitalizations among those affected.The California Department of Public Health emphasizes the need for PPE for farm workers and reinforces biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the virus.CDPH assures consumers that pasteurized milk and dairy products are safe, urging avoidance of unpasteurized dairy due to potential health risks from pathogens like Salmonella and avian influenza.The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reassures the public that pasteurized milk and dairy products are safe for consumption, as the pasteurization process effectively inactivates the bird flu virus. Additionally, milk from sick cows is prohibited from entering the public milk supply. Salmonella and avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, known to persist on milking equipment and in raw milk. Health officials stress the importance of pasteurization to ensure safety, as there are no proven health benefits to consuming raw milk. Given the potential health risks, especially for vulnerable populations, consumers are advised to avoid unpasteurized dairy products and remain aware of biosecurity measures in dairy farming to prevent contamination.5In response to the outbreak, CDPH has coordinated outreach to dairy producers and farm workers regarding preventive measures. Over the past four months, the department has distributed more than 340,000 respirators, 1.3 million gloves, 160,000 goggles and face shields, and 168,000 bouffant caps to protect farm workers. The agency is also working with local health departments to ensure health checks for exposed individuals and to facilitate testing and treatment as necessary.3CDPH is collaborating with the California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA) to safeguard human and animal health, employing surveillance tools to monitor the bird flu situation. Additionally, California has received 5,000 extra doses of seasonal flu vaccine from the CDC for farm workers, which CDPH plans to distribute to local health departments in dairy-heavy regions.3For those exposed to infected animals, CDPH advises monitoring for symptoms such as cough, sore throat, fever, and conjunctivitis for 10 days following exposure. If symptoms develop, individuals should isolate and contact their local public health department for guidance.3While the seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against bird flu, CDPH encourages all Californians, especially those at risk, to get vaccinated to reduce the chances of co-infection and severe illness.References1.

Michele Crosera / AFP / Getty Images Key Takeaways While human cases of bird flu remain rare, the virus’s spread among birds and now cattle increase the risk of exposure and infection. A recent study discovered mutations in the bird flu genome that could give the virus the ability to better exploit certain mammalian proteins. Understanding potential paths for human transmission can offer crucial insights into monitoring the virus’s evolution and developing anti-influenza therapies.

A highly contagious bird flu epidemic has spread from continent to continent since 2020. It has killed hundreds of millions of wild birds and caused sporadic outbreaks among poultry. In recent months, the avian influenza strain that causes the disease (H5N1) has jumped to dairy cows, domestic cats, and even humans.In one case this year, a Missouri patient contracted the disease seemingly without exposure to an infected animal. It’s currently unknown how the patient contracted the virus. Some experts have suggested it may have been from consuming raw milk, but while traces of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk samples, the limited information available makes it challenging to determine if raw milk is a potential source (though, it should be noted, pasteurized milk is perfectly safe to drink).While bird flu in humans is a cause for concern, transmission remains fortunately rare. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), only 896 cases have been reported worldwide between January 2003 and July 2024. That said, if cases of bird flu in humans continue to rise, it could mean the virus is getting better at infecting people. In a recent study published in Nature Communications, researchers at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) discovered mutations in the bird flu genome that could give the virus this ability by allowing it to better exploit mammalian ANP32 proteins.Viruses of a feather (don’t always stick together)Viruses are incapable of reproducing outside a host. To make more of themselves, they must first invade a host cell and take over its cellular machinery. In the case of the bird flu virus, its polymerases — enzymes that make new copies of the virus genome — interact with ANP32 proteins to form a structure called the replication complex. As the name suggests, this complex is necessary for the virus to replicate. (In fact, in a different study, scientists used CRISPR gene-editing technology to engineer chickens resistant to bird flu. They did so by targeting the genes coding for ANP32 proteins.)However, differences in avian and mammalian versions of this protein explain why avian influenza doesn’t typically infect mammals. Specifically, the avian ANP32 has an amino acid tail that is missing in human ANP32. Researchers have previously observed that virus particles could hold on to the avian ANP32 as they move from birds to mammals, possibly explaining some of the cases of avian flu in mammals. Even so, for the virus to be more successful in mammals, it must be able to use the mammalian ANP32 as effectively as the avian version.In the recent study, the EMBL researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), an advanced imaging technique with near-atomic resolution, to look at the structures of the viral polymerases of human-adapted bird flu strains as they interacted with human ANP32.They found that the ANP32’s amino acid tail steadies the viral polymerases. Besides replicating the viral genome, the polymerases encapsulate the genome into virus particles that subsequently infect other cells. When carrying out the two functions, the polymerases take on two conformations, termed replicases and encapsidases. The study revealed that ANP32 creates a bridge between the two conformations, and this bridge facilitates the assembly of the replication complex.The extremely detailed cryo-EM structures of the replication complex revealed which individual amino acids participated in the assembly of the replication complex. In other words, the researchers could figure out which amino acids in the replication complex were essential to the replication of the virus. Mutations in these regions of the viral polymerase could make it bind more tightly to human ANP32, potentially improving the virus’s ability to replicate inside human cells.Keeping better tabs on avian influenzaTo monitor the spread of avian influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sequences viruses from samples obtained from infected animals in addition to tracking reports of illnesses and deaths. This is to trace mutations in the virus populations. The EMBL study establishes a link between the structure of the replication complex and adaptive mutations in the viral polymerases. Researchers could use this insight to determine if a particular bird flu virus strain is close to gaining the ability to infect people.As bird flu continues to spread among birds and cattle, there will be more opportunities for the virus to jump to the humans who contact them. This is why experts suggest that more animals, and people around them, be checked for bird flu even in the absence of symptoms. Bird flu becoming the next pandemic is still an unlikely scenario as there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus. But while human cases of bird flu may not be widespread, they are highly deadly. Of those 896 cases reported between 2003-2024, 463 were fatal. The high lethality could arguably be attributed, in part, to the fact that many human cases lack obvious symptoms and go under-diagnosed. Regardless, there is a pressing need for therapies to treat human cases of avian influenza as well as stem the spread of avian influenza outbreaks among poultry and cattle.While there are many influenza virus strains, and new ones keep emerging, the replication complex is central to how they infect and replicate in host cells. Future studies will need to investigate the dynamics of replication in more detail to make the replication complex a key target for anti-influenza drugs.

In addition, pregnant people and those with certain chronic medical conditions are also most at risk of complications.”The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that during the 2023-2024 U.S. flu season, there were:35 million to 65 million flu illnesses16 million to 30 million flu-related medical visits390,000 to 830,000 flu-related hospitalizations25,000 to 72,000 flu-related deathsThe CDC also estimates that thanks to the flu vaccine, Americans avoided:6 million influenza-related illnesses2.9 million influenza-associated medical visits65,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations3,700 influenza-associated deathsAlthough now is the best time to get a flu shot, people can still benefit from it as fall turns to winter, the FDA said.“If you have already been sick with the flu this season without getting vaccinated, getting a flu vaccine is still important because it helps prevent disease caused by three different strains of flu viruses,” the FDA added.“You likely were infected with one type of flu virus strain, so the vaccine would offer protection against the strains that you haven’t already had,” the statement continued.More informationThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about the flu vaccine.SOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, news release, Oct. 15, 2024What This Means For YouFolks should talk to their doctor or pharmacy about getting the flu vaccine.VaccinesNewsFluinfection controlRelated StoriesNo stories found. © healthday-en 2024Powered by Quintype www.healthday.com INSTALL APP$95 million injection to fight the threat of avian influenza LOG IN SIGN UP SEARCH View More Results SEARCH LOG IN Space Tech Nature Earth History People Health Core Sciences Newsletters Subscribe Now Animals Australian Mammal of the Year Birds Evolution Marine life Plants Animals Australian Mammal of the Year Birds Evolution Marine life Plants Cosmos » Birds $95 million injection to fight the threat of avian influenza October 15, 2024 Imma Perfetto Cosmos science journalist By Imma Perfetto The Australian government has announced an additional $95 million package to prepare for the arrival of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza, which is causing the deaths of poultry, wild birds and mammal species worldwide. The funding includes extra vaccines for humans. Australia is currently the only continent free from the H5N1 strain, known as clade 2.3.4.4 b. The disease poses significant risks for wildlife, the agricultural industry, and the national economy, and could arrive on Australia’s shores any day. The H5N1 strain is not the same as the H7 strains which caused outbreaks in several poultry farms in Victoria, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) earlier this year. “While Australia remains free from HPAI H5N1, the awful reality of this disease is that – like the rest of the world – we will not be able to prevent its arrival,” says Minister for Environment and Water, Tanya Plibersek MP. “I am particularly concerned about the potential impact on species already at risk of extinction and not well placed to cope with significant mortalities. This includes marine mammals such as the endangered Australian sea lion, and sea birds like the Christmas Island frigatebird which has only one breeding site.” Great Frigatebird (Fregata minor listeri) adult female in flight, Christmas Island, Australia.

The funding, which is in addition to the $6.9 million announced in July, also includes: $15 million to increase national biosecurity response capability and improve surveillance. $5 million to boost biosecurity and scientific capability, including vaccines for use in some captive threatened bird species. $7 million to enhance wild bird surveillance activities through Wildlife Health Australia Director of the Biodiversity Council, James Trezise, says the investment is a “massive boost” for preparing for the impacts of bird flu on our wildlife populations. “Minister Collins and Minister Plibersek need to be commended for listening to the scientific experts and ramping up resourcing to tackle this major biosecurity risk. “We also need to accept this is only a downpayment on a full-scale response should H5N1 make it to our shores.” The funding also includes up to $10 million for nationally coordinated communications to inform and prepare the Australian community and $22.1 million to strengthen public health preparedness. Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler MP, says that although human infections with avian influenza viruses are rare, and the current risk to the Australian population remains very low, there is no room for complacency. “The Australian Government’s $22.1 million investment will increase the number of pandemic flu vaccines we have in storage,” he says. “The interim Australian Centre for Disease Control is leading this work – and is very focused on ensuring we are as prepared as possible for any potential case of H5N1 avian influenza.” Read More Biology Explainer: what is going on with bird flu?
