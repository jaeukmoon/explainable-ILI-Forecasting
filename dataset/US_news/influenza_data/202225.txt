Here, we utilize a computational design strategy to produce epitope-optimized, broadly cross-reactive H3 hemagglutinins in order to create a universal H3N2 influenza vaccine. The Epigraph immunogens are designed to maximize the viral population frequency of epitopes incorporated into the immunogen. We compared our Epigraph H3 vaccine to the traditional egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine from 2018–19, FluZone. Epigraph vaccination-induced stronger cross-reactive antibody responses than FluZone against 18 H3N2 viruses isolated from 1968 to 2019 in both mice and ferrets, with protective hemagglutination inhibition titers against 93–100% of the contemporary H3N2 strains compared to only 27% protection measured from FluZone. In addition, Epigraph vaccination-induced strong cross-reactive T-cell immunity which significantly contributes to protection against lethal influenza virus infection. Finally, Epigraph vaccination protected ferrets from influenza disease after challenge with two H3N2 viruses. The superior cross-reactive immunity induced by these Epigraph immunogens supports their development as a universal H3N2 influenza vaccine.

Symptoms typically include fever, headache, myalgia, and respiratory distress and last between 5 and 15 days3. Importantly, morbidity and mortality from influenza infections are increased in at-risk patients, such as the elderly and immunocompromised4,5. While seasonal influenza epidemics cause a high global disease burden and are important public health concerns, the threat is significantly increased during influenza pandemics. The most recent example is the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic which infected an estimated 24% of the global population6. Another past influenza pandemic occurred in 1968, when the H3 influenza subtype jumped from birds into humans7,8. This subtype has continued to circulate in humans, causing seasonal epidemics each year.The substantial diversity of influenza viruses presents a significant challenge in the development of an effective vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) use influenza virus surveillance to predict the future virus strains of the upcoming influenza season and recommend the annual quadrivalent vaccine formulation that contains a H1N1, H3N2, and an influenza B strain from both the Victoria-like and Yamagata-like lineages. Yearly vaccine effectiveness (VE) is highly variable (10–60%)9 and provides limited cross-protective immunity against mismatched strains10. Importantly, a meta-analysis examining the seasonal influenza VE from 2004 to 2015 found that vaccine efficacy against the H3N2 subtype was low, even in the case of an antigenic match. Although influenza vaccination provided substantial protection against H1N1 and type B viruses, with pooled VE ranging from 54 to 67%, the pooled VE against H3N2 was only 33% for antigenically matched viruses and 23% for mismatched viruses11. Additionally, H3N2-dominated influenza seasons are associated with higher morbidity and mortality as compared to H1N1 or influenza B seasons12,13. The poor vaccine efficacy against H3N2 viruses and increased disease burden highlight a crucial need for improved vaccine technologies which generate more cross-reactive immunity against divergent H3N2 influenza viruses.The Epigraph vaccine antigen designer uses a graph-based algorithm to create a cocktail of vaccine antigens that are designed to maximize the potential epitope coverage of a highly diverse population14. The Epigraph algorithm has been used to predict therapeutic HIV vaccine candidates15 and was evaluated in vivo as a Pan-Filovirus vaccine16. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of the Epigraph vaccine immunogen design strategy as a universal swine H3 (swH3) influenza vaccine17. Vaccination of mice and swine with the Epigraph swH3 vaccine induced superior levels of cross-reactive antibodies and T-cell responses as compared to the commercial whole-inactivated quadrivalent swine influenza vaccine, FluSure. Here, we explore Epigraph immunogen design for the development of a universal human H3 influenza vaccine. A cocktail of three H3 hemagglutinins (HA), a surface glycoprotein of influenza, were computationally designed using the Epigraph vaccine designer and expressed in a replication-defective Adenovirus type 5 vector (HAdV-5). We evaluated Epigraph vaccine-induced immunity and protection in both mice and ferret animal models and demonstrate increased cross-reactivity and protection against diverse human H3N2 viruses isolated between 1968 and 2019 compared to a traditional egg-based, inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine, FluZone.ResultsDevelopment and characterization of the H3 epigraph HA vaccineThe human H3 Epigraph immunogens were designed with the Epigraph vaccine designer tool using all 5709 unique H3 HA amino-acid sequences available on the Influenza Research Database as of 15 November 2017. The isolation years of these sequences range from 1968 to 2017. The Epigraph tool is a graph-based algorithm that creates a cocktail of immunogens designed to maximize potential epitope coverage from a population of viral sequences14,15. The Epigraph algorithm calculates the frequency of each 9-mer sequence in the target population and uses a graph-based algorithm to trace a path across the HA protein that contains the most common potential 9-mer epitopes in the target virus population17. This results in a full-length HA protein with the most common epitopes in the population which, by design, is centrally located on the phylogenetic tree (Epigraph 1). The epitopes identified in Epigraph 1 are excluded and the algorithm traces a path containing the second most common 9-mer epitopes, resulting in Epigraph 2. Similarly, Epigraph 3 consists of the third most common epitopes in the population. The resulting Epigraph immunogens represent a trivalent cocktail that is computationally designed to maximize the coverage of potential epitopes in the viral population along with minimizing rare epitopes which might result in strain-specific immunity.The resulting three Epigraph immunogens localize across a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed using the entire population of unique H3 HA protein sequences (Fig. 1a). A BLAST search found that the most similar wild-type sequences are as follows: Epigraph 1- A/Ishikawa/90-205v/2013 (99.65% sequence homology), Epigraph 2- A/Japan/4426/2015 (92.58% sequence homology), Epigraph 3- A/Denmark/143/2005 (91.34% sequence homology). In the interest of improving current vaccine strategies, we compared our Epigraph vaccine to the commercial inactivated vaccine, FluZone 2018–19 formulation, which is a quadrivalent formulation containing the H3N2 strain A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016. In order to evaluate the cross-reactivity of our vaccine, we selected a panel of 18 representative H3 viruses that represent 15 modern contemporary strains (2005–2019) and three historical strains (1968–1985). A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed to evaluate the relationship of the three Epigraph immunogens to this panel of representative viruses (Fig. 1b; Supp. Table 1). Importantly, this panel represents much of the diversity of the H3 population and contains both contemporary and historical strains. This panel also contains all but one of the H3N2 strains recommended for use in the seasonal influenza vaccines for the past 15 years (Fig. 1c), thereby representing much of the diversity of recent strains circulating in the human population. In addition, this panel contains two viruses isolated after our Epigraph immunogens were designed in order to evaluate if any potential protection against future emergent strains can be detected.Fig. 1: Characterization of the H3 Epigraph vaccine constructs.a The Epigraph vaccine designer tool was used to create a cocktail of three H3 Epigraph immunogens (Epigraph 1, 2, and 3), which are computationally designed to maximize potential epitope coverage in the total H3 population. These Epigraph H3 immunogens were aligned back to the 5709 unique H3 HA sequences using ClustalW and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was created to visualize the relationship between the vaccine immunogens and the H3 population. b A panel of 18 H3 strains was selected to examine the cross-reactivity immunity after vaccination. The selected strains span the H3 phylogenic tree and include both contemporary (2005–2019) and historical (1968–1985) strains. A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using PhyML to visualize the relationship between the assay strains, the Epigraph vaccine immunogens (blue), and the FluZone strain (gray; A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016). c A table of H3 strains recommended for the FluZone vaccine each year since 2006. An asterisk indicates inclusion in this study. d The three H3 Epigraph immunogens were cloned into replication-defective Adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) vectors and the HA protein expression was confirmed by western blot. Reducing conditions were used to observe HA monomers while native conditions were to obverse HA trimers. GAPDH is used as a cellular protein loading control.Full size imageThe three H3 Epigraph immunogens were cloned into the replication-defective viral-vector HAdV-5 individually and HA protein detection was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1d). HA expression was confirmed in both reducing and native conditions to examine HA monomers and potential trimer formation, respectively. The development of trimers after expression of the Epigraph HA immunogens would indicate that, although these immunogens are synthetic in nature, each Epigraph immunogen has the potential to structurally resemble natural HA proteins. Proper HA trimerization could enable the induction of both conformational antibody responses in addition to linear antibody and T-cell responses.Epigraph vaccination induces highly cross-reactive antibody responses in miceTo evaluate the cross-reactive antibody response, 10 BALB/c mice per group were vaccinated with 1010 virus particles (vp) of the HAdV-5-Epigraph vaccine, which consisted of equal ratios of the three HAdV-5-Epigraphs (3.33 × 109 vp each) delivered as a cocktail. The Epigraph vaccine was compared to mice vaccinated with either FluZone, the commercial inactivated vaccine, or a PBS sham vaccine. Antibody responses were evaluated three weeks after a single immunization (Fig. 2a) or two weeks after boosting (Fig. 2b) using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against the panel of 18 representative H3 viruses. In humans, HI titers of at least 1:40 are generally accepted as corresponding to a 50% reduction in the risk of influenza infection and are used as a “threshold“ titer for predicted protection18,19,20. Vaccination with the Epigraph immunogens resulted in strong cross-reactive antibody response, with HI titers ≥40 to 12 of the 18 (67%) H3 strains after a single immunization, while a single immunization of FluZone did not result in significant development of antibodies against any strains. After boosting, Epigraph-vaccinated mice showed HI titers ≥40 to 15 of the 18 (83%) H3 strains. In contrast, FluZone boosted mice showed a more strain-specific response, with HI titers ≥40 to only 4 of the 18 (22%) H3 strains. FluZone showed protective antibody titers to the matched FluZone strain and other similarly related strains, with only limited cross-reactivity with mismatched viruses. Importantly, Epigraph vaccination-induced protective HI titers to 100% of the contemporary H3 strains after boosting, with the absence of HI antibody titers to only the three highly divergent historical H3 strains. The substantial differences in HI titers between the Epigraph and FluZone vaccines are clearly demonstrated by the heat maps (Fig. 2). Most notably, Epigraph vaccination resulted in protective antibody titers to Hong Kong/2019 and Wisconsin/2018, which were isolated after the computational design of the Epigraph immunogens, indicating a significant breadth of protection.Fig. 2: Epigraph immunization induces cross-reactive antibody responses in mice against a panel of 18 representative H3 viruses.BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph and compared to FluZone-vaccinated mice. Antibody responses were measured using a HI assay against the 18 H3 representative strains for both a single immunization (a) or after boosting (b). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (single immunization n = 5; prime boost n = 10; unpaired T test).Full size imageEpigraph vaccination induces cross-reactive T-cell responses against both contemporary and historical H3 strainsNext, we evaluated the ability of these Epigraph immunogens to induce cross-reactive T-cell responses, since T cells have been shown to play an important role in viral clearance during influenza virus infection21,22. We evaluated T-cell responses using an IFN-γ ELISPOT and peptide libraries representing three contemporary and three historical strains. Epigraph vaccination-induced highly significant cross-reactive T-cell responses against all six strains after only a single immunization and this response increased (~two-fold) upon boosting (Fig. 3). In contrast, the inactivated virus vaccine FluZone did not induce significant T-cell responses against any of the strains. Importantly, Epigraph vaccination-induced significant and robust T-cell responses to the three historical H3 strains despite not inducing detectable antibody responses as measured by HI titers.Fig. 3: Epigraph immunization induces cross-reactive T-cell responses in mice against 6 diverse H3 viruses.a The total T-cell response after vaccination of BALB/c mice (n = 5) was determined using an interferon IFN-γ ELISpot with peptide libraries for six H3 strains. T-cell responses are reported as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons). Cytokine profiles were determined using ICS and flow cytometry on splenocytes from vaccinated BALB/c mice (n = 5) harvested 2 weeks after boosting and stimulated ex vivo with pooled Perth/2009 peptides (b–e). Splenocytes were gated on CD3+, CD44high, and then CD8+ (b, c) or CD4+ (d, e) to determine HA-specific TEM cells. Representative FACS plots for cytokine production for CD8+ (b) and CD4+ (d). Levels of cytokine-producing CD8+ (c) and CD4+ (e) (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons). Data are expressed as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageTo evaluate the cytokine profile and development of T effector memory (TEM) cells, we performed intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and flow cytometry on splenocytes from boosted mice stimulated ex vivo with pooled peptides from the Perth/2009 HA protein. In order to determine which subsets of T cells were contributing to the overall vaccine-induced immunity, we examined ICS for Th1-associated cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the Th2-associate cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). Representative scatter plots of the CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells induced by the vaccines are shown (Fig. 3b, d, respectively). The sum total responses induced by the vaccines in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are shown (Fig. 3c, e, respectively). Clearly, the Epigraph vaccine induced a strong Th1-associated immune response while the FluZone group did not induce any significant cellular immunity as compared to the PBS control vaccinated animals. In all cases, the Th1-associated intracellular cytokine expression was significantly greater in the Epigraph group than in the Fluzone group. The Th2-associated IL-4 ICS did not reveal any significant differences between the vaccinated groups and were statistically insignificant as compared to the negative control PBS group. The gating strategy is described (Supp. Figure 1).Epigraph vaccination protects mice from contemporary and historical influenza virus challengesTo determine if the cross-reactive immunity induced by Epigraph vaccination protected mice from influenza infection, we challenged vaccinated mice with both contemporary and historical H3 influenza strains three weeks after a single immunization. Unfortunately, contemporary H3 strains, unlike historical strains, are not very pathogenic in mice and pathogenicity did not increase after our attempt to mouse-adapt four H3 strains by 13 serial passages in mice lungs. Therefore, to examine protection against contemporary strains in a mouse model, we examined lung viral titers three days after challenge using quantitative Polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Fig. 4a–c). Epigraph vaccination significantly reduced lung viral titers as compared to FluZone-vaccinated animals after challenge with Alaska/2015, Ohio/2012, and Brisbane/2007 contemporary strains, supporting the efficacy of the Epigraph vaccine in protection against contemporary strains.Fig. 4: Protection against challenge with contemporary and historical H3 viruses in mice.BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph, the FluZone vaccine, or a mock PBS vaccine. Mice were challenged intranasally three weeks after immunization with 103.6–3.8 TCID50 of contemporary strains Alaska/2015 (a), Ohio/2012 (b), or Brisbane/2007 (c) and sacrificed 3 days post challenge to examine lung viral titers (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons). For lethal challenge with historical H3 strains, BALB/c mice (n = 10) were challenged intranasally 3 weeks post immunization with 10 MLD50 of Texas/1977 (d–f) or Aichi/1968 (g–i). Mice were monitored for weight loss over 14 days and animals that showed 25% weight loss were humanely euthanized (n = 5; Kaplan–Meier log-rank test compared to the sham vaccinated group). Weight loss data are censored after the first animal death in a group to prevent survival bias. Three days post infection, five mice per group were sacrificed to examine lung viral titers by TCID50 (e, h) and qPCR (f, i) (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageWe then evaluated the ability of Epigraph vaccination to protect against lethal challenge with 10 mouse-lethal dose 50% (MLD50) of two historical H3 strains (Fig. 4d–i). Mice were monitored for weight loss and humanely sacrificed if they reached 25% weight loss. In addition, groups of mice were sacrificed on day 3 post challenge in order to examine lung viral titers by both tissue-culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50) and qPCR to evaluate infectious virus and viral RNA copies, respectively (Fig. 4e, f, h, i). A single Epigraph immunization completely protected mice from weight loss and death after challenge with Texas/1977 (Fig. 4d). In contrast, FluZone and PBS sham vaccinated animals all succumbed to challenge by day 8. In addition, Epigraph vaccination significantly reduced lung viral titers as compared to both FluZone and PBS-vaccinated animals (Fig. 4e, f). Similarly, a challenge with another historical strain, Aichi/1968, resulted in all FluZone and PBS-vaccinated animals succumbing to disease by day 8 while Epigraph-vaccinated animals were completely protected from death and only experienced moderate weight loss (~8% weight loss) before recovering (Fig. 4g). Again, Epigraph immunization significantly reduced day 3 lung viral titers after challenge as compared to FluZone and PBS sham vaccinated animals (Fig. 4h, i). This demonstrates that Epigraph vaccination still results in complete protection from death after challenge with historical H3 strains, despite inducing only cross-reactive T-cell responses against the historical H3 strains and not inducing cross-reactive antibodies as measured by HI assay.Cross-reactive T cells contribute towards protection after challenge with historical strainsTo further examine the contribution of cross-reactive T cells in the protection observed after challenge with historical H3 strains, we performed a T-cell depletion study. Mice were vaccinated and challenged with Texas/1977 as described above but were administered 200 μg of anti-CD8, anti-CD4, both anti-CD8 and anti-CD4, or isotype control antibody on day −3, −1, and 1 of the challenge to deplete the respective T-cell population. All mice were bled on day 1 and confirmed to have greater than 98% T-cell depletion using flow cytometry (Fig. 5a). Epigraph-vaccinated mice treated with an isotype control were completely protected from weight loss and death whereas the PBS-vaccinated mice quickly succumbed to lethal challenge (Fig. 5b). Epigraph-vaccinated mice which were single depleted for either CD4 or CD8 showed increased weight loss (~10% loss), however, these mice began to recover after day 8 post challenge. In contrast, the double-depleted mice continued to lose weight and three of the five animals succumbed to lethal infection. In addition, Epigraph-vaccinated mice with either single or double T-cell depletion showed a significant increase in lung viral titers as compared to non-depleted Epigraph-vaccinated animals (Fig. 5c, d). Epigraph-vaccinated animals with intact T-cell immunity showed the largest reduction in lung viral titers. Lastly, an ELISA showed that Epigraph vaccination does induce non-neutralizing anti-Texas/1977 binding antibodies which are not detected by HI assay (Fig. 5e). These results demonstrate that cross-reactive T cells induced by the Epigraph vaccine significantly contribute to protection from challenges with a lethal historical H3 strain.Fig. 5: T-cell depletion during lethal Texas/1977 virus challenge reduces Epigraph vaccine efficacy.BALB/c mice were vaccinated (n = 9) with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph and depleted for T cells through administration of 200 μg of anti-mouse CD8, anti-mouse CD4, both anti-CD4 and CD8, or isotype control on day −3, −1, and 1 of challenge. a All mice were bled on day 1 post challenge via submandibular vein to confirm >98% T-cell depletion by flow cytometry. b Mice were challenged intranasally with 10 MLD50 of Texas/1977 and monitored for weight loss over 18 days. Animals that showed 25% weight loss were humanely euthanized (n = 5; Kaplan–Meier log-rank test). Weight loss data are censored after the first animal death in a group to prevent survival bias. Three days post infection, four mice per group were sacrificed to examine lung viral titers by TCID50 (c) and qPCR (d) (n = 4; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison). e An ELISA was performed to examine the presence of binding, non-neutralizing antibodies against Texas/1977 after a single immunization (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageIndividual Epigraph immunogens contribute differently to cross-reactive antibodies and T-cell responses in miceAlthough the H3 Epigraph immunogens were designed to be delivered as a trivalent cocktail, we wanted to determine the contribution of each individual Epigraph immunogen. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with individual Epigraph immunogens of either Epigraph 1, 2, or 3, and cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses were evaluated. After a single immunization, only the Epigraph 1 immunogen vaccine-induced cross-reactive HI antibody responses (Fig. 6a). After boosting, the Epigraph 1 immunogen vaccine induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses, as compared to the Epigraph 2 and 3 immunogen vaccines. However, after boosting, the Epigraph 2 immunogen vaccine now showed cross-reactive antibodies with some H3 virus strains in the panel (Fig. 6b). We next examined T-cell responses after vaccination and found that immunization with the Epigraph 3 immunogen vaccine induced the strongest cross-reactive T cells against all six H3 strains in our T-cell panel (Fig. 6c). Therefore, in this mouse model, Epigraphs 1 and 2 induced cross-reactive antibodies, while Epigraph 3 induced the most cross-reactive T cells, indicating that a mixture of the trivalent cocktail is optimal for the best broad cross-reactive immunity.Fig. 6: Contribution of each individual Epigraph immunogen towards the cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses.To examine the contribution of each individual Epigraph immunogen, BALB/c mice (n = 5) were immunized with 3.3 × 109 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph 1, 2, or 3 individually. Antibody responses were measured using a HI assay against the 18 H3 representative strains for both a single immunization (a) or after boosting (b). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine. c The total T-cell response after boosting was determined using an interferon IFN-γ ELISpot with peptide libraries for six H3 strains. T-cell responses are reported as spot-forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageEpigraph vaccination-induced highly cross-reactive antibody responses in ferretsOur final in vivo analyses were performed using the ferret influenza model. Ferrets are considered the ideal small animal model for human influenza virus infections since they are susceptible to infection, display more human-like influenza symptoms, and the pathology more closely resembles that of a human infection. After a single immunization, the sera from Epigraph immunized ferrets had significantly higher HI titers against 15 out of 18 virus strains as compared to the control commercial vaccine, FluZone (Fig. 7a). In contrast, the FluZone did not induce significant HI titers against any of the virus strains after a single immunization. Upon boosting with a second dose of vaccine, the Epigraph vaccine-induced HI titers ≥40 against 14 out of 15 contemporary virus strains, however, the FluZone vaccine did not induce HI titers ≥40 against any of the virus strains (Fig. 7b). As seen in the mice studies, the ferrets also failed to induce significant HI titers against the historical virus strains.Fig. 7: Epigraph immunization induces cross-reactive antibody responses in ferrets against a panel of 18 representative H3 viruses.Ferrets (n = 10) were immunized with 5 × 1010 vp of the HAdV-5-Epigraph vaccine, a full human dose of FluZone, or a mock PBS vaccine. Antibody responses were measured using a HI assay against the 18 H3 representative strains for both a single immunization (a) or after boosting (b). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 10; unpaired T test).Full size imageEpigraph vaccination reduces influenza disease in ferrets after challenge with two contemporary H3 virusesAt lastly, we challenged the immunized ferrets with two human influenza virus strains. One virus strain was included in the design of the Epigraph vaccine (Brisbane/2007) and a second strain represents a strain that was isolated after the Epigraph design (Hong Kong/2019). While weight loss after virus challenge was modest (<10% initial weight lost), overall the Epigraph immunized ferrets showed the least weight loss as compared to the FluZone and PBS control groups (Fig. 8a, d). More noticeably, the Epigraph immunized ferrets showed no significant fever after the challenge while the FluZone and PBS control groups did have significantly higher temperatures, especially on day 2 post challenge (Fig. 8b, e). Importantly, the Epigraph immunized ferrets had significantly lower nasal virus titers as compared to the FluZone and PBS control groups after both viral challenges (Fig. 8c, f). In fact, the nasal titers were nearly undetectable by day 3 and completely undetectable by day 5. However, the FluZone and PBS immunized ferrets had significant viral titers at days 3 and 5 post challenge.Fig. 8: Epigraph immunization protects ferrets against challenge with two contemporary H3 viruses.Ferrets were immunized twice with 5 × 1010 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph, the FluZone vaccine, or a mock PBS vaccine. Two weeks after boosting, ferrets (n = 5) were challenged intranasally with 105 TCID50 of contemporary strains Brisbane/2007 (a–c) or Hong Kong/2019 (d–f). Ferret’s weight (a, d) and body temperature (b, e) were monitored over 14 days (day 1–7 n = 5; day 8–14 n = 3). Peak body temperature at day 2 post infection (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison). On day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 post infection, nasal washes were taken to evaluate viral titer kinetics by TCID50 (day 1, 3, 4, 7 n = 5; day 9 n = 3; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison). At day 7 post infection, two animals per group were sacrificed to perform immunohistochemistry staining. The influenza pathology for the nasal respiratory mucosa H&E, airway exudates H&E, and airway exudates influenza virus immunohistochemistry are shown (g–i, respectively. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageEpigraph vaccination reduced visible inflammatory response in ferret lung histopathologyAlthough the Brisbane and Hong Kong virus strains produced similar lesions in the nasal mucosa of each vaccination group, the type, and severity of lesions differed markedly between PBS-, FluZone-, and Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets (Fig. 8g). In PBS-vaccinated ferrets, the submucosa and mucosal epithelium were diffusely infiltrated by inflammatory cells, which consisted primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages, accompanied by lesser numbers of granulocytes. The surface epithelium was disrupted and thinned due to loss of respiratory epithelial cells and inflammatory cell infiltrates. The remaining epithelial cells were round to cuboidal in shape, and lacked cilia. In the FluZone-vaccinated ferrets, inflammatory cell infiltrates were also mixed, but included abundant eosinophils, which were the predominant cell type within the surface epithelial layer and airway exudates. Disruption of the surface epithelium was less severe than in PBS-vaccinated ferrets, but respiratory epithelia cells were also round to cuboidal and lacked cilia. In marked contrast, inflammatory cells in the Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets were milder and mostly restricted to the submucosa. Respiratory cells were generally columnar and ciliated. The composition of airway exudates also differed markedly between PBS-, FluZone-, and Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets (Fig. 8h). In PBS-vaccinated ferrets, these exudates consisted primarily of sloughed epithelial cells, along with some granulocytes. In comparison, the exudates in FluZone-vaccinated ferrets were more densely cellular and consisted mostly of eosinophils. Cellular exudates were not present in the Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets. Immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen (Fig. 8i) showed intense labeling of numerous sloughed epithelial cells in PBS-vaccinated ferrets. The labeling was less intense in the FluZone-vaccinated ferrets and was most concentrated within the smaller granulocytes (eosinophils). Virus antigen was not detected by immunohistochemistry in the Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets.DiscussionThe low VE against the H3 subtype11 and increased morbidity and mortality associated with H3N2-dominated influenza seasons12,13 highlight the crucial need for improved H3N2 influenza vaccines. Therefore, we utilized the Epigraph vaccine design algorithm to design broadly cross-reactive H3 HA. Our goal was to maximize the potential of inducing strong cross-reactive immune responses to assess the platform’s potential to create a universal H3 vaccine. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of Epigraph HA immunogens in the creation of a universal swine H3 vaccine17 and here we show similar improved cross-reactive efficacy when applied to a human H3 influenza virus vaccine. Mice immunized with the Epigraph vaccine developed highly cross-reactive HI titers and T-cell responses against a large panel of diverse H3 strains and better-protected mice from challenges with both contemporary and historical H3 strains as compared to the commercial inactivated vaccine FluZone.HI titers are the current benchmark for evaluating the efficacy of influenza vaccines, with an HI titer of at least 1:40 generally accepted as corresponding to a 50% reduction in the risk of influenza infection in humans and is often used as a ‘threshold’ protective titer18,19,20. In our study, mice immunized with our Epigraph vaccine-induced protective HI titers (≥40) to 83% of the highly diverse H3 viruses in our panel after boosting, whereas two FluZone immunizations induced a more strain-specific response, with protective HI titers (≥40) to only 22% of the viruses. Most importantly, two immunizations with the Epigraph vaccine results in protective HI titers to 100% of contemporary strains, two of which were isolated after the Epigraph immunogens were designed. This indicates that HAdV-5-vectored Epigraph vaccination induces highly cross-reactive immunity that can continue to provide serological protection against divergent H3 strains. It should be noted that the viruses used for our HI titers were grown in embryonated eggs, which may not fully translate to a response that would be seen against circulating H3N2 strains. Furthermore, Epigraph vaccination-induced protective HI titers against all H3N2 strains recommended for use in seasonal influenza vaccines for the past 15 years, with the exception of one strain that was not available in our panel. These promising results support that the Epigraph vaccine is capable of protecting against 15 years of viral H3 diversity circulating in humans and can continue to protect against emerging H3 (2018 and 2019) strains that were not included in Epigraph immunogen design.The results that were observed in mice were corroborated with our ferret studies. Ferrets are considered the ideal small animal model for influenza vaccine studies23 using human influenza viruses for several reasons. They are more susceptible to human influenza viruses than mice, exhibit a disease pathology and symptoms that are very similar to human infections, and are outbred. This is especially important because this eliminates potential MHC-class biases that may occur in an inbred mouse model. Again, after boosting with the Epigraph vaccine the ferrets had HI titers ≥40 against 14 of 15 (93%) of contemporary virus strains tested, including two strains that did not exist when the Epigraph immunogens were designed. What was especially noteworthy was two doses of FluZone in ferrets failed to induce any HI titers ≥40, even against the matched strain. This signifies an alarming need for improvement on current influenza vaccines employed. The results were further confirmed in the ferret influenza virus challenge studies. Vaccination with our Epigraph vaccine resulted in the least overall weight loss, protection from fever and significantly reduced nasal viral titers against both Brisbane/2007 (genetic group a) and Hong Kong/2019 (genetic group 3 C.2a1b + T135K-B) influenza virus strains. Pathology results also confirmed that the Epigraph-vaccinated ferrets exhibited advanced levels of protection as compared to the PBS and FluZone-vaccinated groups. Again, these data confirm that the Epigraph vaccine was capable of inducing protection against past and future influenza virus strains.Epigraph vaccination not only induces a broadly cross-reactive antibody response, but the induced antibody titers are much stronger when compared to the commercial influenza vaccine, FluZone. While an HI titer of 1:40 is accepted as the threshold antibody titer that results in a 50% reduction in the risk of influenza infection, the stronger the HI titer, the greater the level of protection. In addition, higher titers are often required to protect at-risk populations, such as pediatric or elderly populations19,24. Studies have estimated that HI titers ≥160 correlate with approximately 90% reduction in the risk of influenza infection18,25,26. Epigraph vaccination showed a robust antibody response, with HI titers ≥160 to 12 of the 15 contemporary H3 strains after boosting and significantly higher antibody responses as compared to FluZone for all contemporary H3 viruses in mice with similar results observed in ferrets. Interestingly, the Epigraph vaccine induced more than a 5-fold stronger antibody response against Singapore/2016 (genetic group 3 C.2a1), the H3 strain incorporated in FluZone. It is generally considered that a matched vaccine would be best suited against a homologous challenge. Here our data indicate otherwise and this has been observed in our previous studies where, even the cellular immunity was greater in the Epigraph-vaccinated animal as compared to the homologous vaccine17. These data indicate that HAdV-5-Epigraph vaccination not only induces highly cross-reactive antibodies, but these antibodies are observed at high titers. Moreover, the increased levels of immunity induced by the Epigraph vaccine may correlate with durability where the higher levels of immunity are maintained for a much longer period of time, as compared to the FluZone induced vaccine responses that very rarely reach beyond a 1:160 HI titer and are known to wane relatively quickly post-vaccination27. While our application of the Epigraph design algorithm attempted to enrich for T-cell epitopes for inclusion in our vaccine, this would not preclude B-cell epitopes from being included as well. This is especially true when considering how the algorithm works to construct the immunogen. There is a limited number of residues in the protein, meaning T-cell and B-cell epitopes are likely to overlap. Further mapping of B-cell epitopes would need to be done to identify the important regions for antibody production. Additionally, it is possible the stronger T-cell response to the HAdV-5-Epigraph vaccine may lead to additional interaction between T- and B-cells which could lead to increased production of antibody to prevent viral infection. Further work to explore this phenomenon is planned.T cells have been shown to play an important role in protection from influenza virus infection in humans, both in facilitating viral clearance21,22 and contributing to long-lasting immunity28,29,30,31. Immunization of mice with the Epigraph vaccine-induced highly cross-reactive T-cell responses, with robust responses against both contemporary and historical strains. Importantly, although Epigraph vaccination did not induce significant HI antibody responses to historical H3 strains, vaccination-induced highly cross-reactive T-cell responses against all three historical virus strains contained in our panel and afforded complete protection against mortality after challenge with two lethal historical viruses. While non-HI antibodies may also play a role in this protection, the absence of T cells significantly altered the protection of mice from lethal challenge. In our study, cross-reactive T-cell responses induced after Epigraph vaccination were found to significantly contribute to protection against lethal historical H3 challenge, with depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cells resulting in extreme weight loss, increased death, and higher lung viral titers as compared to non-depleted Epigraph-vaccinated mice. Future T-cell analysis using more contemporary H3 HA peptide libraries, such as that of Hong Kong/2019 or Singapore/2016, would further strengthen our data to show that the cellular immune response is more broadly cross-reactive than is already shown. It is also known that several mutations were gained in the circulating H3N2 influenza viruses after 2002. These mutations occurred throughout the viral genome and included changes in the major antigenic sites of the HA. These changes may delineate between historic and contemporary influenza strains and could account for the differences in Epigraph-induced humoral immunity32.The H3N2 subtype first jumped from birds into humans in 1968 and has continued to evolve in humans, resulting in altered receptor binding preferences33,34,35 and mutations in glycosylation sites36,37. As a result, low pathogenicity is observed in mice after infection with contemporary H3N2 virus. Therefore, we used lung viral titers to determine the protection against contemporary strains and found that Epigraph vaccination resulted in significantly reduced lung viral titers as compared to FluZone for three different contemporary H3N2 strains. These data support the efficacy of Epigraph in protecting against H3N2 challenge, both with contemporary and historical H3N2 strains.The strong immune responses observed against contemporary strains do serve as support the Epigraph algorithm design. Since many more sequences are available from recent years, it is more likely that recent epitopes are incorporated into the design. This may add to the promise of the vaccine design in that the response to vaccination would likely last longer due to more response to circulating strains. It is possible that in the future, antigenic drift or an antigenic shift of the H3 protein in circulating strains could accumulate mutations which may prevent antibody binding of Epigraph-vaccinated sera. If this were to happen, we could design an additional immunogen to incorporate these new sequences into a new vaccine formulation to maintain strong antibody and T-cell responses.Interestingly, although Epigraph 1 and 2 contributed primarily to cross-reactive antibody responses, Epigraph 3 induced the strongest cross-reactive total T-cell responses in mice. This indicates that each human H3 Epigraph immunogen contributes differently towards the cross-reactive immunity induced by the trivalent cocktail. It is possible that the Epigraph 3 immunogen contains an immunodominant T-cell epitope that is not contained in either of the other two immunogens. If this epitope is not included in Epigraph 1 or 2, this could explain the much stronger T-cell induction measured in our assay from Epigraph 3. It should be noted that Epigraph 1 still induced a strong total T-cell response but was overshadowed by the strong response to Epigraph 3. Future work can utilize T-cell epitope mapping to identify individual epitopes which may vary between each individual immunogen and lead to the different strengths of responses seen in our study. Additionally, challenge studies conducted by delivery of only individual immunogens into mice prior to infection could highlight the important mechanisms of protection from challenge. These studies would further delineate the robust activation we have reported. Ultimately, our data strongly support that a trivalent cocktail of the Epigraph immunogens is likely optimal for induction of broad cross-reactive immunity.An important note for this study is that a direct comparison of our Epigraph vaccine and FluZone is not entirely equivalent due to the different types of formulations. Delivering a vaccine using a viral-vector is likely to induce some form of immune response to the vector as well, which may skew some of the data towards a stronger immune response than would be seen with a recombinant protein. However, for the purpose of our study, these preliminary results characterize the usefulness of further research into the H3 Epigraph vaccine. There is little consensus for ways to control for viral-vectored immunogen dosing in an animal model, which makes direct viral-vector to recombinant protein comparisons more challenging. Further, all immune correlate data reported in this study is influenza HA specific, so the immune responses reported are against the immunogen cocktail itself. Future studies will address whether vaccinating with a trivalent cocktail of wild-type HAs would produce similar results to Epigraph vaccination, and whether recombinant protein forms of the H3 Epigraph vaccine would be able to recapitulate the immune responses seen in our study. We believe that we would still see improved cross-reactive immunity compared to viral-vectored wild-type HA vaccines or stronger immune responses than FluZone using a recombinant protein delivery of the H3 Epigraph vaccine due to the nature of the immunogen design. By considering the variation seen in the HA in circulating strains and incorporating that variation into the immunogen, Epigraph should be able to enhance the cross-reactive immune potential independent of the HAdV-5 vector.Here, we designed a universal human H3 Epigraph vaccine and demonstrated that Epigraph vaccination induced highly cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses that protected against in vivo influenza virus challenges with contemporary and historical H3 virus strains in mice and against two contemporary virus strains in ferrets. With the Epigraph vaccine inducing protective HI titers to 93–100% of contemporary H3 strains and inducing strong cross-reactive T-cell responses, the Epigraph vaccine should be further explored as a more cross-reactive influenza vaccine. Application of this Epigraph vaccine designer strategy to the H1N1 and influenza B subtypes could lead to a universal multivalent influenza vaccine against all subtypes currently circulating in humans. These data support the continued development of Epigraph immunogens as a universal human H3 influenza vaccine that induces significant cross-reactive immunity.Methods and materialsEthics statementFemale BALB/c mice ages 6-8 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Mice were housed in the Life Sciences Annex building on the University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL) campus under the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) guidelines. The protocols were approved by the UNL Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Project ID 1717) and the St. Jude Children’s Hospital IACUC (Project ID 428). All animal experiments were carried out according to the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Animal Welfare Policy, the principles of the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the policies and procedures of UNL and St. Jude Children’s Hospital.Influenza VirusesThe following influenza viruses were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Repository: A/Texas/1/1977 (Texas/1977) [NR-3604], A/Mississippi/1/1985 (Mississippi/1985) [NR-3502], A/Aichi/2/1968 (Aichi/1968) [NR-3483], and A/Brisbane/10/2007 (Brisbane/2007) [NR-12283]. The following influenza viruses were obtained from the International Reagent Resource: A/Wisconsin/04/2018 (Wisconsin/2018) [FR-1653], A/Kansas/14/2017 (Kansas/2017) [FR-1686], A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (Singapore/2016) [FR-1590], A/Alaska/232/2015 (Alaska/2015) [FR-1540], A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (Hong Kong/2014) [FR-1452], A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (Switzerland/2013) [FR-1366], A/Ohio/02/2012 (Ohio/2012) [FR-1143], A/Victoria/361/2011 (Victoria/2011) [FR-1027], A/Rhode Island/01/2010 (Rhode Island/2010) [FR-662], A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth/2009) [FR-370], A/Victoria/210/2009 (Victoria/2009) [FR-643], A/Uruguay/716/2007 (Uruguay/2007) [FR-10], A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (Wisconsin/2005) [FR-397], and A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (Hong Kong/2019) [FR-1744]. The Texas/1977 and Aichi/1968 influenza viruses were mouse-adapted through serial lung passaging in mice five and nine times, respectively. All influenza viruses were grown in specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs and the chorioallantoic fluid was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Virus stocks were quantified based on hemagglutination units (HAU) using 50 µL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells and TCID50.Design and characterization of the epigraph immunogensThe Epigraph Vaccine Designer from the Los Alamos National Laboratories14,15 was used to design the three H3 vaccine immunogens. First, all unique human H3 HA sequences, excluding duplicates, were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database, as of 15 November 2017. This included sequences isolated from 1968 to 2017, and the 5709 unique H3 HA sequences were uploaded to the Epigraph Vaccine Designer and run with the following parameters: epitope length: 9, cocktail size: 3. The resulting three HA Epigraph genes (Epigraph 1, 2, and 3) were added back to the H3 sequence population and aligned using ClustalW. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was created using the RAxML-HPC BlackBox tool with a Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution model using CIPRES Science Gateway V3.3 on the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). The tree was visualized using the Geneious 11.1.5 software. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree to compare the assay strains to the vaccine strains was created using PhyML 3.3 with a Dayhoff substitution model on the Geneious 11.1.5 software38.Construction of the replication-defective adenovirus vectorsThe three Epigraph HA genes (immunogens) were codon-optimized for human gene expression and synthesized by GenScript. These Epigraph genes were then cloned into a replication-defective E1/E3 deleted Adenovirus type 5 vector using the Ad-Easy Adenoviral Vector System (Agilent). The Epigraph HA genes were individually cloned into the pShuttle-CMV plasmid and cotransformed with pAd-Easy-1 (HAdV-5 genome) into BJ5183 cells for homologous recombination into the E1 region of the HAdV-5 genome17,39. The linearized recombinant pAd-Epigraph plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 cells using the PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Virus was amplified by sequential passages in 293 cells until a final amplification using a Corning 10-cell stack (~6300 cm2). The virus was purified by 2 sequential CsCl ultracentrifuge gradients, desalted using Econo-Pac 10DG Desalting Columns (Bio-Rad), and stored at −80 °C in 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol (pH 8.0). Virus particles (vp) were quantitated by OD260. The infectious units per mL were determined using the AdenoX Rapid Titer kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech Laboratories).Western blotWestern blot was used to confirm HA protein expression from the recombinant HAdV-5 vectors. A six-well of confluent 293 cells were infected with 500 virus particles (vp) per cell, incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and cells were harvested 48 h after infection. For reduced conditions, cells were denatured using Laemmli buffer plus 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 °C for 10 min, while native conditions did not receive 2-mercaptoethanol and were not heated. Samples were then passed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen) before running on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 30 min with 5% milk in TBST. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA Tag HRP conjugated antibody (NB600-391; Novus Biologicals) at 1:1000 and anti-GAPDH (sc-47724) at 1:1000 in TBST 1% milk. The membrane was washed 3× with TBST and probed with secondary goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (Millipore Sigma #AP308P) at 1:2000 for 30 min at room temperature (RT). The membrane was washed 3× with TBST and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific).Mouse vaccination and tissue collectionFemale BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-Epigraph (a cocktail of the three Epigraph immunogens (3.3 × 109 vp each) at equal ratios to total 1010 vp) or 50 μl (600 ng/mouse of total protein) of Fluzone® Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine, 2018–2019 Formula (NR-51702) which is ~30× the equivalent human dose. The 2018/19 FluZone formula contains the H3 strain A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 IVR-186 (H3N2) which is a fourth of the vaccine’s total protein. All vaccines were compared to a PBS sham vaccinated control group. Immunizations were diluted in PBS and were injected intramuscularly with a 27-gauge needle into both quadriceps in two 25 µl injections. All mice immunizations and bleeds were performed under isoflurane or ketamine and xylazine-induced anesthesia. To examine the immune correlates after a single immunization, mice were sacrificed 3 weeks post-vaccination for collection of sera and splenocytes. To examine immune correlates after two immunizations, another group of mice was boosted with the homologous vaccine and dose 3 weeks after priming and sacrificed two weeks after boosting. Blood was harvested via cardiac puncture and sera was isolated from whole blood using a BD Microtainer Blood Collection Tube (Becton Dickinson). Splenocytes were isolated by passing the spleen through a 40 μm Nylon cell strainer (BD Labware) and red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer. Splenocytes were resuspended in cRPMI with 10% FBS and used for ELISpot assays.Influenza challenges in miceBALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated intramuscularly with 1010 vp of the HAdV-5-Epigraph, 600 ng of Fluzone® Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine, 2018–2019 Formula (NR-51702), or with a PBS sham vaccine. Three weeks later, mice were challenged intranasally with 103.6 TCID50 of Brisbane/2007, 103.6 TCID50 of Alaska/2015, or 103.8 TCID50 of Ohio/2012 and sacrificed 3 days post challenge to examine lung viral titers. For lethal challenge with historical strains, mice were challenged with 10 MLD50 of Texas/1977 or Aichi/1968. On day 3 post challenge, five mice from each group were sacrificed to examine lung viral titers by TCID50 and qPCR. Lungs were homogenized in PBS, centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min, and the lung supernatant collected. The remaining five mice were monitored for weight loss and were euthanized when they lost 25% of their starting weight. For T-cell depletion, mice we challenged as described above but were administered 200 μg of anti-mouse CD8α (Clone 2.43 Cat# BE0061), anti-mouse CD4 (Clone GK1.5 Cat# BE0003-1), both anti-CD4 and CD8, or isotype control (clone LTF-2 Cat# BE0090) on day −3, −1, and 1 of challenge. All mice were bled on day 1 post challenge via submandibular vein to confirm T-cell depletion by flow cytometry.Ferret vaccination and tissue collectionMale ferrets, 4 to 6 months old, were purchased from Triple F Farms (Gillett, PA) and determined to be seronegative to circulating seasonal influenza strains, by HI assay, and SARS-CoV-2, by ELISA. All animal experiments were approved and performed in accordance with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s Animal Care and Use Committee protocol number 428. Ferrets were vaccinated intramuscularly, hind leg, with 0.1 mL volume of PBS, HAdV-5-Epigraph (5 × 1010 vp), or 0.5 mL FluZone® Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (2018–2019 Formula). All treatments were given in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart. Sera were collected 20 days post-vaccination (20 dpv) and 13 days post boost (B + 13) and assessed for antibody response by HI assay.Influenza virus challenges in ferretsTo evaluate protection, 2 weeks post boost, ferrets were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 1 mL of 105 TCID50 of either H3N2 virus, A/Brisbane/10/07 or A/Hong Kong/2671/2019. Clinical signs of infection, weight loss, and temperature were monitored daily up to 14 days post challenge. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 after virus inoculation, ferrets were anesthetized with ketamine, and nasal washes were collected in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two ferrets per group were euthanized on day 7 with lung and nasal turbinate specimens collected for histology. Nasal wash samples were titrated on MDCK cells and viral titer was determined.Pathology methodsThe lungs and nasal mucosa were fixed via intratracheal/intranasal infusion and then continued immersion in 10% buffered formalin solution. Tissues were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, with serial sections subjected to antigen retrieval for 30 min at 98 °C before undergoing immunohistochemical labeling of viral antigen using a primary goat polyclonal antibody (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) against influenza A, USSR (H1N1) at 1:1000 and a secondary biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (catalog number sc-2042; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:200 on tissue sections.Hemagglutination inhibition assaySera from mice and ferrets were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE; (370013; Denka Seiken) at a 1:3 ratio (sera: RDE) overnight at 37 °C. The RDE was inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Sera were diluted to a starting ratio of 1:10 in DPBS and serially diluted two-fold in a 96-well V-bottom plate. An equal volume (25 μL) of 4 HAU of the virus was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temp for 1 hr before the addition of 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells to each well. The hemagglutination patterns were read after 30 min.ELISpot assayAn IFNγ ELISpot assay was used to analyze the T-cell response after vaccination. Total T cells were examined using pooled peptides from peptide arrays of the HA protein of A/Uruguay/716/2007 (NR-18968), A/New York/384/2005 (NR-2603), and A/Perth/16/2009 (NR-19266). In addition, peptide arrays of the HA protein of influenza virus strains Texas/1977, Mississippi/1985, and Aichi/1968 were synthesized by GenScript and were 17-mers with 12 amino acid overlap. Polyvinylidene 96-well difluoride-backed plates (MultiScreen-IP, Millipore) were coated with 50 μl of anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb AN18 (5 µg/mL; Mabtech) overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed and blocked with cRPMI 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37 °C. A single-cell suspension of mouse splenocytes was added to each well. Splenocytes were re-stimulated with an equal volume (50 μL) of peptide (5 μg/mL/peptide) and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow for IFNγ production. The next day, plates were washed 6× with PBS and incubated with 50 μL of biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ R4-6A2 mAb (1:1000 dilution; Mabtech) diluted in PBS with 1% FBS for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed 6× with PBS and incubated with 50 µl of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 dilution; Mabtech) diluted in PBS 1% FBS. After 1 h at RT, the plates were washed 6× with PBS and developed by adding 100 µl of BCIP/NBT (Plus) alkaline phosphatase substrate (Thermo Fisher). Development was stopped by washing several times in dH2O. The plates were air-dried and spots were counted using an automated ELISpot plate reader (AID iSpot Reader Spectrum). Results are expressed as spot-forming cells per 106 splenocytes.Tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID50)Lung supernatant from day 3 post challenge was diluted 1:10 in a 96-well U bottom tissue-culture dish and serially diluted 10-fold. MDCK cells (100 μL of 2 × 105 cells/mL) were added to each well and plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, plates were washed one time with sterile DPBS before adding DMEM with 0.0002% trypsin to each well. The plates were then incubated for another 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before adding 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells to each well and reading the hemagglutination patterns after 30 min.qPCR lung viral load quantificationRNA was extracted from day 3 post challenge lung supernatant using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Real-time qPCR was performed using the Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) run on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: 55 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Results were compared to a standard curve created using a plasmid expressing the influenza matrix protein or RNA extracted from a known quantity of infectious Texas/1977 virus. The universal primer-probe set for Influenza A (BEI Resources, NR-15593, NR-15594, NR-15595) was used.Flow cytometryTo evaluate cytokine profiles, splenocytes from mice were harvested two weeks after boosting and stimulated for 10 h at 37 °C 5% CO2 with pooled A/Perth/16/2009 (NR-19266) peptides at 2 ug/mL with the addition of BD GolgiPlug (BD #555029). Cells were then stained with ZombieAqua Fixable cell viability dye (Biolegend #423101) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before Fc block with TruStain FcX™ (anti-mouse CD16/32) antibody (Biolegend #101319). Surface cell staining was performed with anti-CD8a-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (Biolegend #100733), anti-CD4-PE/Cyanine7 (Biolegend #100421), anti-CD44-APC/Cyanine7 (Biolegend #103027), and CD3-PE (Biolegend #100205) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kit (BD #555028) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before intracellular cytokine staining with anti-IL-2-Brilliant Violet 421 (Biolegend # 503825), anti-IFN-γ-Alexa Fluor 488 (Biolegend #505815), anti-TNF-α-APC (Biolegend #506307), anti-IL-4-Brilliant Violet 605 (Biolegend # 504125) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cell events were acquired on a 4-laser/16-color Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX LX machine in the UNL Flow Cytometry Service Center Core and analyzed with FlowJo software. Cells were gated in the following order: lymphocytes > singlets > live > CD3+ > CD44high > CD4+ or CD8+ followed by cytokine-producing cells (IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-α). AbC™ Total Antibody Compensation Bead Kit was used to compensate the fluorophores.To confirm T-cell depletion, whole blood was collected and red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer for 10 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and then stained with CD4-FITC (#100509), CD3-PE (#100205), and CD8α-APC (#100711) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell events were acquired on a 4-laser/16-color Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX LX machine in the UNL Flow Cytometry Service Center Core and analyzed with FlowJo software. All mice were confirmed to have greater than 98% depletion as compared to the isotype-treated mice.ELISAImmunolon 4 HBX microtiter 96-well strips were coated with 150 ng per well of influenza A/Texas/1/1977 HA1 protein (Cat #: Cat: 40477-V08H1; SinoBiological) in bicarbonate/carbonate coating buffer overnight at 4 °C before blocking with 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at RT. Serially diluted sera in 1% BSA in PBS was added to the plate and incubated for 2 h at RT before washing with PBST and incubation with secondary goat anti-mouse-HRP antibody (1:5000; Thermo Fisher) in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed with PBS and developed with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Fisher). The reaction was stopped with 2 M sulfuric acid and the OD450 was detected using a SpectraMax i3x Multi-Mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The endpoint titer was determined as a signal that was four times background values.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 9 software was used to analyze all data. Data are expressed as the mean with standard error (SEM). T-cell data and lung viral titers were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparisons. HI titers were analyzed using unpaired T-tests. The significance of survival outcomes was analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier log-rank test.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) ACIP Flu Meeting Update: Flu Vaccines Worked Better than Reported & ACIP Recommends Specific Vaccines For Seniors EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages June 23, 2022—New CDC data presented at the June 22, 2022 meeting of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) show flu vaccines worked better this past season than initially reported, reducing the risk of flu illness by about one-third among people who were vaccinated. Additionally, ACIP voted to preferentially recommend the use of specific flu vaccines for adults 65 years and older, including higher dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines. This recommendation must be approved by CDC’s Director to become policy. Updated Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Estimates Show Benefit CDC data from October 4, 2021, through April 30, 2022, showed that flu vaccines reduced people’s risk of mild to moderate flu illness caused by H3N2 flu viruses—the most common flu viruses this season—by 35 percent overall. CDC’s early season vaccine effectiveness estimates released in March were not statistically significant, suggesting vaccination did not offer benefit in reducing the risk of mild to moderate flu illness. The early data underestimated how well flu vaccines worked during the 2021-2022 flu season because of a small sample size and biases due to COVID-19. More flu data have since become available, and CDC has corrected for COVID-19 bias by excluding patients with COVID-19 illness from the comparison group.* These updated estimates are similar to what has been seen during past H3N2-predominant seasons and are in line with initial agency expectations based on laboratory data. Estimates of how well flu vaccine protected against serious outcomes like hospitalization and ICU admission are pending. Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick, reducing the risk of serious outcomes like hospitalization and death. ACIP Recommends Specific Flu Vaccines for People 65 Years and Older Also at the meeting, ACIP voted in favor of a preferential recommendation for certain flu vaccines over others for adults 65 years and older in the United States. ACIP voted to preferentially recommend the use of higher dose flu vaccines (Fluzone High-Dose vaccine and Flublok recombinant vaccine) or adjuvanted flu vaccine (Fluad vaccine) over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. If one of these vaccines is not available at the time of administration, people in this age group should get a standard-dose flu vaccine instead. This recommendation was based on a review of available studies which suggests that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines. This recommendation must be approved by CDC’s Director to become policy. In recent years, CDC has not recommended any one flu vaccine over another for any age group, and there is still no preferential recommendation for people younger than 65. CDC and ACIP will continue to review data on the comparative effectiveness of flu vaccines in different age groups as more information becomes available. More information on the U.S. vaccines with a preferential recommendation for older adults: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is an inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in people 65 years and older. It contains four times the antigen, the part of the vaccine that helps the body build up protection against flu viruses, compared to standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines. The higher dose of antigen is intended to give people 65 years and older a better immune response to vaccination, and therefore, better protection against flu. Fluad Quadrivalent is an adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine approved for use in people 65 years and older. It contains the same amount of antigen as other standard dose inactivated flu vaccines plus MF59 adjuvant. The adjuvant is intended to give people 65 years and older a better immune response to vaccination, and therefore, better protection against flu. Flublok Quadrivalent is a recombinant protein influenza vaccine approved for use in people 18 years and older. It is made using different production technology than the inactivated influenza vaccines and contains three times the antigen dose compared with standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines. The higher dose of antigen is intended to give people 65 years and older a better immune response to vaccination, and therefore, better protection against flu. People 65 years and older have an increased risk of severe flu illness, hospitalization, and death compared with younger populations. Use of potentially more effective vaccines for older people can avert serious outcomes. Additionally, data has shown that racial and ethnic health disparities exist in populations that receive a high-dose flu vaccine compared with standard-dose flu vaccines. Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine to best protect against flu and its potentially serious complications. This is especially true for people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, including people 65 years and older, pregnant people, young children and people with certain chronic medical conditions. If you have questions about which vaccine is best for you, talk to your doctor or other health care professional. # # # *COVID-19 bias has also been described in studies from Clinical Infectious Diseases and the New England Journal of Medicine.

Because the influenza A virus is constantly changing, or mutating, it can be difficult to detect, treat, and inoculate against. To solve this problem, researchers are looking for parts of the influenza virus that do not change when the virus mutates. A panhandle structure on the virus known as the promoter region or promoter has emerged as a potential target. In order to quickly detect the presence of the influenza A virus, researchers developed a fluorogenic probe that could bind to the promoter region of the influenza A virus RNA. A fluorogenic probe is based on small molecules called fluorophores that emit light when a specific target is present. In this study, the fluorogenic probe researchers created binds to part of the promoter region that consists of double-strand RNA structure carrying the internal loop, creating a significant light-up response that can identify the presence of influenza A. The technique was presented in a paper published on May 23 in Analytical Chemistry. “The promoter region of influenza A virus RNA has emerged as a new target for biochemical and therapeutic application because the sequences are not involved in the gene variations related to pathogenesis (how the flu virus develops) and antiviral resistance,” said Yusuke Sato, an associate professor at Tohoku University. “These results represent the development of new molecular probes for influenza A research, with a view toward the diagnosis of influenza A infection, as well as the design of new antivirus drugs targeting the influenza A virus RNA promoter region.” In order to create the fluorogenic probe, researchers used a type of synthetic DNA called peptide nucleic acid (PNA). The triplex-forming PNA can be specifically developed to target the double-stranded RNA in the panhandle structure of the influenza A virus RNA in the sequence-selective manner. Researchers then combined the triplex forming PNA having a type of dye called thiazole orange with a small molecule that would bind with the internal loop structure of the RNA. This combination is called a conjugate. To determine how effective the conjugate was, researchers first analyzed how brightly the conjugate glowed when it was bound to the target panhandle structure of the promoter region. It was more than 130-fold brighter than when it was not bound to anything. Compared to the small molecules alone, the combination of the PNA and the small molecules had a stronger binding affinity by two orders of magnitude. This result shows how promising this technique could be for the diagnosis of influenza A, since the promoter region remains stable no matter the strain of influenza. “The research group demonstrated the selective fluorescence response of the conjugate for total RNA from influenza A virus H1N1-infected cells over that from mock-infected ones,” said Sato. “This technique would serve as a promising candidate for the analysis of influenza A virus RNA based on the direct sensing of the influenza A virus RNA promoter region, in sharp contrast to the gold standard PCR method.” As the world keeps an eye on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are eager to find solutions now for future outbreaks of influenza A. By finding new ways to target specific parts of the influenza A virus that do not change when the virus mutates, this research could be used to create more sensitive tests that can detect the influenza A virus more easily. In the future, this could even be a promising target for antiviral drugs that could treat infections of influenza A.

We investigated the breadth and durability of influenza A/H3N2-specific hemagglutinin-inhibition antibodies after live-attenuated influenza vaccine in children (aged 3-17 years, n = 42), and after inactivated influenza vaccine or infection in adults (aged 22-61 years, n = 42) using 14 antigenically distinct A/H3N2 viruses circulating from 1968 to 2018. We found that vaccination and infection elicited cross-reactive antibody responses, predominantly directed against newer or future strains. Childhood H3-priming increased the breadth and magnitude of back-boosted A/H3N2-specific antibodies in adults. Broader and more durable A/H3N2-specific antibodies were observed in repeatedly vaccinated adults than in children and previously unvaccinated adults. Our findings suggest that early A/H3N2 exposure and frequent seasonal vaccination could increase the breadth and seropositivity of antibody responses, which may improve vaccine protection against future viruses.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have reinforced strict public-health measures, which also limit the spread of influenza viruses3. However, co-infection with influenza viruses in COVID-19 patients has been reported and is associated with increased disease severity and deaths4,5. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent disease and annual influenza vaccination is recommended for high-risk groups6. Currently, there are two main types of seasonal influenza vaccines, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)7. Both vaccines aim to induce immunity against the major viral surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA)8. Antibodies directed against the globular head of HA can be measured in the hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HI), where a level of HI ≥40 is an established correlate of protection9,10. Influenza A/H3N2 undergoes more rapid viral drift than influenza A/H1N1 and B, facilitating a continual need for seasonal vaccine updates. Since the A/H3N2 virus appeared in 1968, 29 vaccine updates have taken place11, versus 15 times for influenza A/H1N1 and 20 times for B12,13. Despite frequent vaccine updates, vaccine mismatches due to drifted A/H3N2 viruses during influenza seasons causes low vaccine effectiveness (VE)14. Therefore, the correct selection of A/H3N2 strains in seasonal vaccines is critical to improve vaccine-induced protection. However, the vaccine strain selection process has largely ignored the role of human factors, such as pre-existing immunity and repeated annual vaccination, influenced by a lifetime of viral encounters15.There are multiple theories of how pre-existing immunity may impact immune responses. Focus has largely been on how early-life influenza infections and repeated vaccination is shaping the immunity. In 1953 Francis launched his theory of the “original antigenic sin” describing an immunological dominance of the first infecting virus over successive influenza infections16,17, where later infecting viruses elicit antibodies against the priming virus. Similarly, Lesser et al. found evidence of “antigenic seniority”, where repeated exposure elicited the highest antibodies to “senior” strains from childhood18. Antibody cross-reactivity has been modelled to explain an individuals’ complex influenza infection history19. Other studies focus on how priming or imprinting with influenza A subtypes in different birth cohorts can preferentially impact the antibody response and potentially reduce influenza mortality20,21,22,23,24. A recent theory, termed “back-boosting”, does not restrict cross-reactive antibody responses after recent infection or vaccination to the primary infecting virus, but rather against all previously encountered viruses of the same influenza A subtype25,26,27,28.Studies of antibody landscapes against historical and recently circulating viruses are needed to understand how pre-existing immunity and historical exposure affects antibody responses. Furthermore, whether back-boosting responses vary in adults primed with different HAs compared to more naïve children and the effect of repeated vaccination on antibody cross-reactivity are unknown. Our study aimed to provide detailed characteristics of cross-reactive antibody responses in healthy adults and children, using 14 antigenically distinct A/H3N2 viruses which circulated over five decades, from 1968 to 2018. We studied A/H3N2-specific antibodies after recent infection, and single or repeated seasonal vaccination, conducting long-term follow-up29,30. We further investigated the extent and maintenance of A/H3N2 HI-antibody “back-boosting”, the impact of “original antigenic sin” and childhood priming. Our findings provide insight to cross-reactive antibody responses by increasing age and repeated vaccination. We show that vaccination elicited cross-reactive antibody responses similarly to infection-induced responses, highlighting the value of annual vaccination.ResultsWe investigated the breadth and durability of influenza A/H3N2-specific antibodies using 14 antigenically distinct A/H3N2 viruses circulating from 1968 to 2018 in groups of adults (vaccinated or infected) and vaccinated children (Fig. 1, Table 1). Vaccinated adults (aged 22-61 years, n = 30) received IIV either in 2010, 2013 or both years. Children (aged 3-17 years, n = 42) were vaccinated with LAIV in 2012 or 2013. Blood samples were collected in all vaccinated individuals at day 0 and postvaccination day 21/28, day 56 (only children), 6 and 12 months. The unvaccinated adults provided blood samples in September/October each year in 2010-2014, and natural infection was confirmed by seroconversion in twelve adults. The majority of all adults (32/42) and half of children (20/42) were female. No significant differences in age or sex between the infected or vaccinated adult groups or between groups of children receiving LAIV were found (Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1: Study design.During the influenza seasons 2010-14, the A/H3N2 component in the seasonal vaccine changed from A/Perth/16/2009 in 2010-12 seasons to A/Victoria/361/2011 in 2012-14 seasons. a A group of unvaccinated adults were infected with circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses, defined as a fourfold seroconversion in HI titres between pre- and post-season blood samples (infection, n = 12). Thirty adults were vaccinated with IIV during the study period, generating three different vaccination groups (n = 10 each): single 2010 IIV, single 2013 IIV and double 2010 and 2013 IIV. Five individuals from the single 2010 IIV group provided long-term follow-up blood samples 36 and 48 months after vaccination (equivalent to day 0 and 12 months in the 2013-14 season). The children’s cohort were vaccinated with either one (≥9 years old) or two doses (<9 years old) of a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in two different influenza seasons (2012 LAIV (n = 20) and 2013 LAIV (n = 22)). Blood samples were collected in all vaccinated individuals at day 0 (D0) and post-vaccination day 21/28 (D21/D28), day 56 (D56, only in children), 6 and 12 months (6 M, 12 M). (b) Timeline of A/H3N2 viruses circulated from 1968 to 2018 and the different groups’ perspective of past, present and future viruses according to the timeline. Adults vaccinated or infected in 2010-12 with the A/Perth/16/2009 (PE09) had not yet been exposed to A/Texas/50/2012 (TX12) or A/HongKong/4801/2014 (HK14), defined as future strains for these subjects. Vaccinated or infected adults, and vaccinated children, in 2012-14 had not been exposed to the future strain HK14 which circulated from 2015-18.Full size imageTable 1 The 14 genetically and antigenically distinct influenza A/H3N2 viruses used in the study.Full size tableInfection and vaccination boosted homologous antibodiesWe first tested the homologous HI antibody response after infection or vaccination in adults and children. Twelve unvaccinated adults, with no or low pre-existing antibody titres, seroconverted against influenza A/H3N2 viruses during the 4-year period, probably due to infection. These adults had increases in HI titres after infection, 7 individuals against the A/Perth/16/2009 (PE09) virus (p < 0.001) between 2010-12, and 5 adults against the A/Texas/50/2012 (TX12) (p = 0.062) in 2012-14 (Fig. 2a, d). Antibody titres then waned overtime in the infected individuals.Fig. 2: Homologous hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres after influenza A/H3N2 infection and vaccination in adults and children.Adults were either infected or vaccinated with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) and children were vaccinated with seasonal live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). Serum samples were collected once a year before the start of influenza season in infected adults (September/October) and time post-infection was calculated from the season seroconversion occurred. HI titres against homologous A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) or A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) are shown in adults pre- and post-infection (n = 7 or 5, respectively) (a, b) and in adults pre- (day 0 (DO)) and post-IIV (day 21 (D21), 6 (6 M) and 12 months (12 M)) (n = 10 each) (c–f). LAIV was not licensed in Europe and Norway until 2012, therefore we do not have vaccination responses against A/Perth/16/2009 in children. HI responses to the homologous A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) vaccine strain pre- (day 0) and post-LAIV (day 21, 56, 6, and 12 months) in 2012 (n = 20) (g) and 2013 (n = 22) (h). Each symbol represents an individual HI titre. The horizontal lines show geometric mean HI titres with 95% confidence interval. The dotted line indicates an HI titre of 40. Pre- and post-vaccination HI titres were compared using nonparametric repeated measure Friedman test with Dunn’s multiple comparison correction for each vaccination group, except the TX12 infected group due to missing sample for long-term follow-up, which was analysed using non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for pre- and 6 M post-infection time points. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P = < 0.001.Full size imageWe found significant increases in HI titres against the homologous vaccine strains after vaccination in all groups (Fig. 2b, c, e–h). Post-vaccination responses were surprisingly comparable to post-infection responses against PE09 and TX12. A higher number of children had pre-vaccination HI titres ≥40 in the LAIV group vaccinated in 2013 than in 2012, however, post-vaccination titres were similar between the two groups (Fig. 2g, h). The double IIV group had higher pre-vaccination titres (p = 0.0637) but comparable post-vaccination titres to the single 2013 IIV group (Fig. 2e, f). This double IIV group also had higher titres than both groups of children pre-vaccination (2012 p = 0.039, 2013 p = 0.085) and 21/28 days post-vaccination (2012 p = 0.067, 2013 p = 0.0164) (Fig. 2f, g, h). Notably, only the double IIV group had durable HI titres ≥40 at 12 months post-vaccination while neither the single IIV nor the LAIV children achieved this.Vaccination and infection increased heterologous antibodiesTo investigate the breadth of antibody responses after infection and vaccination, we evaluated HI antibodies against 14 antigenically distinct A/H3N2 viruses spanning from 1968 to 2018 (Fig. 1b, Table 1). Antibody landscapes were generated from the HI titres pre- and post-exposure for each individual (Supplementary figure 2,3) and from the geometric mean titres (GMTs) for each group (Figs. 3–5).Fig. 3: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody landscapes after A/H3N2 infection in adults.Antibody landscapes were generated with geometric mean HI titres (GMTs) against 14 historical and future influenza A/H3N2 viruses (see Table 1 for the strains used). Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the GMTs. In Norway, the influenza season usually starts at the end of October and peaks between December and March. Blood samples were collected annually in September/October from 2010 to 2014 from unvaccinated adults. Seroconversion (four-fold increase in HI titres) between two time points against the predominantly circulating A/H3N2 viruses were defined as infection. The time post-infection was calculated from the season seroconversion occurred. All individual landscapes are shown in Supplementary Figure 2a. HI antibody landscapes are shown pre-infection (grey) and at 6-9 months (6 M) (a), 18–21 months (18 M) (b) and 30-33 months (30 M) (c) post-infection with PE09, n = 7, and at 6-9 months post-infection with TX12, n = 5 (d). No landscape was generated at 18-21 months post-TX12 infection because only 2 individuals provided serum samples. The viral exposure period is shown in blue based on the group’s median age, and in light blue indicating the oldest individual in the group. Pre- and post-infection HI titres were compared using non-parametric repeated measure Friedman test with Dunn’s multiple comparison correction for each infected group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P = < 0.001.Full size imageFig. 4: The A/H3N2-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody landscapes after vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in adults.Antibody landscapes were generated using the groups’ geometric mean HI titre (GMT) against 14 antigenically distinct influenza A/H3N2 viruses (see Table 1 for the strains used).

Pre- and post-LAIV titres were compared using non-parametric repeated measure Friedman test with Dunn’s multiple comparison correction for each vaccination group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P = < 0.001.Full size imageWe observed that infected adults had detectable pre-existing antibodies (>10) against a number of past A/H3N2 viruses, but not against the infecting or future viruses circulating in subsequent years (Fig. 3a, d). Following PE09 infection (n = 7), HI antibodies increased significantly (p < 0.01) against the infecting (PE09) and future (TX12, HK14) viruses and back-boosted against the closest virus, WI05, while antibodies against the distant historical viruses were maintained above the pre-infection levels (Fig. 3a). HI titres waned over the next two years post-PE09 infection, but remained elevated above pre-infection levels (Fig. 3b, c). A similar trend of antibody responses was observed after infection with TX12, although not statistically significant probably due to a lower number of subjects in this subgroup (n = 5) (Fig. 3d).The IIV adults also had pre-existing antibodies against historical viruses dating back to HK68 (Fig. 4). Unlike the infection group, all IIV groups had pre-vaccination titres against PE09 and TX12. Vaccination elicited significant increases in HI titres ≥40 at day 21 to the vaccine viruses, the previously circulating (back to SY97 or CA04) and the future strain(s) (TX12 and/or HK14) (Fig. 4a–d). In all IIV groups, the GMTs remained above baseline at 12 months post-vaccination against the four strains WI05, PE09, TX12 and HK14.The LAIV children had pre-vaccination antibodies against recent (SY97-TX12) and future (HK14) viruses, but no antibodies against historical viruses (HK68-WU95) that circulated before they were born (Fig. 5a, b). A significant increase in HI titres at 28 days post-LAIV was observed against the four strains WI05, PE09, TX12 and HK14 in the 2012 LAIV group (p < 0.001) and against TX12 and HK14 in the 2013 LAIV group (p < 0.01). These vaccine-induced antibodies waned throughout the 12 months post-LAIV, but remained above pre-vaccination levels. The antibody landscape in children was lower in magnitude and breadth after LAIV compared to after IIV in adults, with HI titres ≥40 post-LAIV only elicited against the TX12 vaccine virus in both groups and additionally WI05 in the 2012 LAIV group.Repeated vaccination in adults maintained cross-reactive antibody responsesWe followed vaccinees in the single 2010 IIV group (n = 5) up to 48 months and observed a decrease in antibody titres to below baseline against most viruses at 36-48 months after vaccination (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, the double 2010 and 2013 IIV group (n = 10) maintained antibodies at or above baseline levels against all 14 viruses at 36 months after 2010 vaccination (first IIV) (Fig. 4c). HI antibodies against these 4 strains WI05-HK14 were boosted following the second IIV in 2013 (p < 0.01, except HK14), and remained elevated above the pre-2010 IIV baseline at the end of the 2013 season (Fig. 4a, d). This suggests an advantage of repeated vaccination in inducing durable cross-reactive antibody responses.Priming influenced antibody landscapesTo better understand the effect of priming and age on antibody cross-reactivity after infection and vaccination, we divided children into two birth cohorts based on the recommendation of one or two doses of LAIV; 2003-2009 (3-9 years old, n = 31) and 1995-2002 (10-17 years old, n = 11). Adults were divided into three birth cohorts according to the likelihood of priming with different influenza A subtypes that circulated when they were born22: 1948-1966 (H1/H2 primed, n = 14), 1967-1976 (H3 primed, n = 14) and 1977-1987 (H1/H3 primed, n = 14) (Fig. 6). As expected, the antibody landscapes reflect the lifetime experience of A/H3N2 virus encounters. The children had pre-existing antibodies against recent viruses that circulated in the years since they were born (Fig. 6a, b). Following vaccination, antibodies were significantly “back-boosted” against these viruses and induced to future virus HK14 (p < 0.05). Interestingly, LAIV induced antibodies against the PE09 virus (p = 0.027) in the older children born 1995-2002, despite no pre-existing antibodies towards this strain. Adults had higher and broader cross-reactive antibody responses compared to children. There were significant differences between adults and children against viruses that circulated before children were born (HK68-FU02) (Supplementary Table 6). Only the 1967-1976 birth cohort had significantly higher titres than children cohorts post-exposure against all viruses, including the newer strains (CA04-HK14).Fig. 6: The A/H3N2-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody landscapes by birth-year in adults and children.Antibody landscapes were generated using the groups’ geometric mean HI titre (GMT) against 14 antigenically distinct influenza A/H3N2 viruses (see Table 1 for the strains used). Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the GMTs. Children and adults were grouped by their birth year regardless of the year they were vaccinated or infected. The pre-existing HI titres are displayed in grey. Peak titres after vaccination or infection were used (21/28 days post-vaccination or 6 months post-infection). Antibody landscapes post-vaccination of children born between 2003 and 2009 (n = 31) in light green (a) and children born between 1995 and 2002 (n = 11) in dark green (b). Antibody landscapes post-vaccination or infection of adults born 1977-1987 (n = 14) in ocean green (c), adults born 1967-1976 (n = 14) in blue (d), and adults born 1948-1966 (n = 14) in lavender (e). The dotted line indicates the HI titre of 40 and the period of viral exposure is highlighted by a light blue background. Pre- and post-vaccination or infection HI titres were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test with individual ranks computed for each comparison, and Holm-Šídák method for multiple comparisons. #P < 0.1, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P = < 0.001.Full size imagePre-existing titres were similar against recently circulating strains from SY97 to HK14 between the different adult birth cohorts, but differed against historical strains (Fig. 6c–e, Supplementary Table 6). The two older birth cohorts (1948-1966 and 1967-1976) had higher pre-existing titres to HK68 and VI75 than the youngest adults, which circulated before this cohort was born. The 1967-1977 birth cohort had broader antibody responses post-exposure, against 10 of 14 viruses (9 viruses p < 0.05 and 1 virus p = 0.055), including the oldest HK68 (p = 0.046). In contrast, the antibodies in the youngest and oldest adults were boosted primarily against the newer viruses (Fig. 6c–e), back to SY97 or CA04, respectively. The 1967-1976 birth cohort had higher titers post-exposure against HK14, BE92, BE89 and BK79 (p < 0.1) compared to the 1948-1966 birth cohort, who did not have the advantage of early childhood H3-priming.HI-antibody responses were broadened by age and vaccinationTo further explore the lifetime impact of influenza A/H3N2-exposure, we calculated the seroprotection rates (percentages of individuals with HI titres ≥40) against the 14 A/H3N2 strains in the five birth cohorts (Supplementary figure 5a–f). We then plotted the cumulative seroprotection rates against the number of viruses pre- and post-exposure (Fig. 7a–c). These seroprotection curves aided in illustrating the breadth of antibody responses against the range of 1-14 A/H3N2-viruses, regardless of when they circulated. We found that the adults had significantly higher seropositivity pre-exposure compared to children, particularly the 1967-1976 birth cohort (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Table 7). The greatest differences pre-exposure between the birth cohorts were observed to 5 viruses, to which ≥43% of adults had protective antibodies, compared to only 6-9% of children. The seroprotection curves were expanded in all birth cohorts after exposure, although the adults had significantly higher percentages of seroprotection than children (Fig. 7b, c, Supplementary Table 7). The 1995-2002 birth cohort had a peak post-exposure seroprotection curve similar to adults up to 7 viruses (Fig. 7b), but did not maintain the seropositivity long-term (Fig. 7c). Importantly, the 1967-1976 birth cohort had broader seroprotection curves after exposure than the 1948-1966 birth cohort (peak p = 0.049, long-term p = 0.078), and only this H3-primed cohort had protective antibodies to ≥12 viruses (Fig. 7b, c).Fig. 7: The impact of priming and previous vaccination on the breadth of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) A/H3N2-specific antibody responses.The cumulative seroprotection rates (cumulative percentages of individuals with HI titres ≥40) against a range of influenza A/H3N2 viruses (total 14 viruses) regardless of the viruses’ circulation time pre-exposure (pre-vaccination or infection) (n = 84) (a), peak responses post-exposure (day 21/28 post-vaccination or 6 months post-infection) (n = 84) (b), and long-term post-exposure (6 months post-vaccination or 18 months post-infection) (n = 79) (c). Subjects were stratified by their birth year based on the likelihood of priming with different influenza A subtypes (a–c). Children were divided into two birth cohorts: 2003-2009 and 1995-2002 (both H1/H3 primed) and adults were divided into 3 birth cohorts: 1977-1987 (H1/H3 primed), 1967-1976 (H3 primed) and 1948-1966 (H1/H2 primed). The cumulative seroprotection rates against the numbers of influenza A/H3N2 viruses in adults pre-exposure (n = 42) (d), peak post-exposure (n = 42) (e), and long-term post-exposure (n = 37) (f) were stratified by previous vaccination history and compared to the infection group.Full size imageSimilarly, we investigated the impact of previous vaccination on the breadth of antibody responses by comparing cumulative seroprotection rates against the range of 1-14 A/H3N2 viruses between adults with different previous vaccination status (Fig. 7d–f) (see Supplementary figure 5g–I for seroprotection rates against each A/H3N2 virus). The children were not included since healthy children are not recommended for annual influenza vaccination in Norway (only 2/42 of children had previously been vaccinated). We found that adults with prior influenza vaccination had a significantly broader seroprotection curve than the previously unvaccinated or infected adults before exposure (Supplementary Table 7, Fig. 7d). The biggest difference pre-exposure was found against 8 viruses, where 50% of the previously vaccinated adults were seropositive compared to only 8% of the previously unvaccinated or infected adults. No significant differences between the groups were found after exposure (Fig. 7e, f). However, we observed a trend of higher percentages of previously vaccinated adults having protective antibodies long-term post-exposure compared to the previously unvaccinated (p = 0.068) or infected (p = 0.135) adults (Fig. 7f), suggesting a better maintenance of protective antibodies after repeated vaccination.DiscussionSince its appearance in 1968, the influenza A/H3N2 has undergone frequent antigenic drift, outpacing vaccine strain selection and reducing seasonal VE. Therefore, studies of antibody landscapes against historical and recent circulating A/H3N2 viruses are important to understand the effect of pre-existing immunity and priming-related differences of antibody responses to current virus exposure. To the best of our knowledge, our study is unique in describing the breadth, magnitude, and durability of antibody responses to 14 historical, recent, and future A/H3N2 viruses after LAIV in children, compared to after IIV or infection in adults. We found that antibody landscapes after vaccination or infection are affected by pre-existing immunity, shaped by priming, prior vaccination status and age. Pre-existing antibodies were found against viruses dating back to the individual’s birth year, in line with earlier studies16,27. The pattern of antibody responses post-vaccination or infection followed the pre-existing antibodies. However, the greatest antibody increase post-exposure was observed against viruses that circulated within the last 5-8 years, regardless of priming pattern, vaccination or infection status, or pre-existing immunity. Importantly, antibodies were induced to future strains which the individuals had not yet encountered, potentially providing partial immunity toward future A/H3N2 strains. Remarkably, the exclusively H3-primed adult group had increases in antibodies to most viruses post-exposure, indicating that childhood priming increases the breadth and magnitude of antibody cross-reactivity. Overall, the durability of antibody responses was positively impacted by childhood H3-priming and repeated vaccination, as reflected by broader antibody responses. Our study has implications for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines, and ultimately universal influenza vaccines that can provide antibody-based protection against past and future viruses.Our findings of narrower antibody responses to A/H3N2 viruses in children agreed with previous findings31,32 since age is associated with greater influenza exposure33. Vaccination broadened the antibody responses in children, however, adults had maintained broader antibody responses. Importantly, we showed that higher proportions of adults who were previously vaccinated had protective antibodies pre- and post-exposure against higher numbers of A/H3N2 viruses, compared to adults who had not been vaccinated previously or were infected. This suggests that annual influenza vaccination expanded and maintained the breadth of antibody responses as vaccinated individuals had pre-existing protective antibodies and durable post-vaccination antibodies. Unvaccinated individuals with no or low pre-existing antibodies remain more susceptible to influenza infection in the coming seasons as shown in our infection group.We found that the reactivity to the oldest viruses increased after vaccination or infection, although non-significantly, and did not change the overall antibody landscape. In contrast to the theories of “original antigenic sin” and “antigenic seniority” we found that the more recently circulating viruses (SY97-HK14) dominated the cross-reactive HI-antibody responses in all birth cohorts with higher titres post-exposure. These viruses are more genetically and antigenically similar to the vaccine or infecting viruses than the oldest viruses (Supplementary Figure 1). Our observations best fit a cross-reactive hypothesis, boosting a homologous response, as well as antibodies directed against conserved HA-head epitopes on other strains26. Despite the constant evolution of the A/H3N2-viruses, some conserved epitopes remain in the head region, allowing for cross-reactive antibody responses34. Whilst we would expect cross-reactivity against TX12 to be induced by the closely related PE09, antibodies were also elicited against the future drifted HK14 virus that dominated from 2015 to 2018. However future studies are needed to confirm cross-reactive antibody responses to circulating viruses35,36. On the other hand, the H3-primed adults back-boosted antibodies against most viruses, even the oldest HK68, thus the cross-reactive hypothesis alone does not fully explain our results. Long-term memory responses are probably influenced by multiple mechanisms, including the order of influenza infections37. Our findings agree with previous reports of back-boosting25,27,28, and further extend the theory by detecting antibodies to an advanced, future strain. More studies of antibody landscapes are needed to better understand the impact of pre-existing immunity on antibody responses. It remains to be seen if our findings extend to different populations and with larger sample sizes.With occasional antigenic shift and continuous drift, adults and children will have different priming patterns to influenza A subtypes, according to their birth cohorts. The children’s landscapes reflect their infection history, since healthy Norwegian children are rarely recommended for influenza vaccination (only 0.05% in our cohort). The younger children had pre-existing antibodies against the newer strains PE09-HK14, whereas the older children had pre-existing titres to the older strains SY97-WI05, which circulated in their early childhood. This suggests that older children might not be susceptible to influenza infection with the same subtype for a number of years after their first childhood infection21. It is unclear how the children’s landscapes will evolve in the future, especially since LAIV-induced immunity is multifaceted and different to antibody-mediated immunity after IIV. We propose that there may be an advantage of childhood A/H3N2 vaccination upon antibody responses in the future. Interestingly, the PE09-unprimed older children clearly demonstrated induction of a cross-reactive antibody response to this strain after LAIV with TX12. This finding supports the vaccine strategy of pre-emptive vaccine updates with an advanced A/H3N2 strain to potentially provide the dual benefit of cross-reactive antibody responses directed to both advanced and previous viruses25.The A/H3N2 viruses have been associated with the lowest VE of all vaccine strains14,38, and reduced VE after repeated vaccination39,40. However, we found that vaccination-elicited A/H3N2-specific antibody responses were equivalent to infection, suggesting a robust vaccine response. We further observed that repeated seasonal vaccination induced more durable cross-reactive antibody responses than in singly vaccinated individuals or those without previous influenza vaccination, suggesting a potential advantage of repeated vaccination. This discrepancy could be due to the way VE is measured by the test-negative study design, which is largely biased to symptomatic patients requiring medical attention41,42. Whereas our findings suggest that repeatedly vaccinated individuals may be partially protected against severe disease and therefore experience asymptomatic or mild infection not seeking medical care. Our healthy adult cohort was <65 years old, a group with higher vaccine performance than the elderly who often experience the greatest burden of A/H3N2 infections. Our results are in line with previous studies, demonstrating that repeated vaccination did not reduce influenza vaccine protection43,44,45 and beneficially induced antibody responses to drifted strains46. However, we did not directly evaluate the vaccine protection, but rather measured seroprotection. We suggest that previous vaccination history and priming effects should be accounted for in future VE studies.Caveats to our study are limited numbers of individuals, although we have included both adults and children, but not the elderly. Furthermore, we used the dominant circulating strains and defined infection by seroconversion at 6-9 months post-infection, since we did not have clinical or laboratory confirmation, limiting the number of subjects in the infection group. We used the HI assay to measure protective antibodies against the head region of HA against 14 A/H3N2 viruses, since only this assay has established correlates of protection. However, IIV-induced antibodies are known to be strain- and HA head-specific, whereas infection and LAIV immunisation elicit a multifaceted response directed against different viral antigens, which are not measured by the HI assay. We cannot exclude all evidence of “original antigenic sin” in our population, as we did not measure HA stalk-targeting antibodies. In addition, detection of traditional HI antibodies is becoming an increasing problem with the most recent A/H3N2 strains47, although we found no differences in HI titres against the newest virus (HK14) using an egg-grown virus and different species’ red blood cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Since egg-adapted changes in HK14 vaccine viruses have been reported to alter antigenicity impacting vaccine-induced antibody responses in different age groups35,36, our results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical impact of cross-reactive antibody responses upon protection from infection.Our results show that antibody landscapes diversified with increasing age. However, not only age, but multiple factors, such as the order and variability of influenza exposure influences the antibody back-boosting responses. Individual landscapes displayed great diversity and were not simply guided by the first or successive influenza infections or vaccinations, although priming-related factors were observed in different birth cohorts. More durable HI antibodies were detected after repeated vaccination, and a history of multiple vaccinations broadened the HI antibodies and increased the pool of cross-reactive HI antibody responses. These antibodies might provide partial immunity against novel influenza viruses or the recurring problem of influenza A/H3N2 antigenic drift during an influenza season. Vaccination with A/H3N2 strains in childhood and repeated vaccination with advanced drifted strains may improve vaccine protection against this subtype.MethodsStudy designAdults (21-61 years old) and children (3-17 years old) (n = 42 per group) were included in this study which was approved by the regional ethics committee (Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, Western Norway (2009/1224 and 2012/1088) and the Norwegian Medicines Agency (National Institute for Health database Clinical trials.gov (NCT01003288 (adults) and NCT01866540 (children)). All participants provided written informed consent. The study population was retrospectively selected to compare A/H3N2-specific antibody responses after IIV, LAIV and infection (Fig. 1a). The majority of adults (32/42) and half of children (20/42) were female (Supplementary Table 1). Depending upon their seasonal vaccination history, adults were divided into three groups (n = 10/group): single vaccination in 2010 or 2013, or double vaccination in 2010 and 2013 IIV30. Unvaccinated adults who were infected with circulating A/H3N2 viruses were included for comparison (infection group, n = 12). Children were intranasally immunized with seasonal LAIV either in 2012 (2012 LAIV, n = 22) or in 2013 (2013 LAIV, n = 20)29.VaccinesThe trivalent seasonal IIV was either subunit (Influvac, Abbott Laboratories) or split-virion (Vaxigrip, Sanofi Pasteur) containing 15 μg HA per strain. The trivalent LAIV contained 107 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of each strain (FLUENZ, AstraZeneca). The A/H3N2 viruses changed between seasons from A/Perth/16/2009 in 2010-11 and 2011-12 to A/Victoria/361/2011 in 2012-13 and 2013-14.Blood samplesSerum samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination (21 days, 6 and 12 months) in the three IIV adult groups and once a year before the start of influenza season (September/October) in the infected adults. Five adults in the single 2010 IIV group provided long-term follow-up blood samples at 36 and 48 months after vaccination. Plasma samples were collected pre- and post-vaccination (28 and 56 days, 6 and 12 months) in the children (Fig. 1a). Blood samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until used in the HI assay.VirusesFourteen genetically and antigenically different A/H3N2 viruses were included in the study, spanning from 1968 to 2018 (Fig. 1b, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1). The wild-type A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK68) virus was propagated in embryonated hen eggs and used in the HI assay. The twelve previously circulating viruses and one future strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK14) were inactivated egg-grown viruses, derived from either reassortant vaccine strains or reference wild-type viruses (obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), UK or the International Reagent Resource (IRR), USA).Hemagglutination inhibition assayThe HI assay was conducted as previously described30. Briefly, blood samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Seiken, Japan) and pre-adsorbed with packed turkey red blood cells (TRBC) before serial dilution from 1/10 in duplicate and incubation with 4 hemagglutinating units of each virus and 0.5% (volume/volume) TRBC. The HI titre was read as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that inhibited 100% hemagglutination. Negative values were assigned a titre of 5 for calculation purposes. GMTs were calculated from duplicates and reported as final titre for each sample. Fourfold or higher increases in HI titres were considered seroconversion.Statistical analysisHI data was analysed and visualized in Prism version-9 (GraphPad Software, USA). Missing data at 6 months were interpolated for subjects that had day-21 and 12-month data using linear regression models (n = 6). Other missing data at random were interpolated using the group’s GMT (n = 6). Non-parametric ANOVA Friedman, Wilcoxon test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used as appropriate to compare within or between groups, with multiple comparison correction. Log-rank Mantel-Cox test was used to compare the cumulative seroprotection curves between groups. Exact p-values and other statistical values are reported in Supplementary Tables 2-7. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

But recently hundreds of them ... [+] washed up on shore dead. (Photo by John Greim/LightRocket via Getty Images)LightRocket via Getty Images It’s typically not a good sign when you see hundreds of dead birds washing up on the shore. But that’s been what’s happening in Martha’s Vineyard, an island in Massachusetts. And the cause of this fowl occurrence may be highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Most of the dead birds have been aquatic birds called cormorants, as can be seen in the following WCVB Channel 5 Boston news segment: Even though such a site can be quite disconcerting, there’s no need to panic, assuming that you don’t have wings, feathers, and a beak. In general. the risk of humans getting infected with the currently spreading HPAI strain still seems rather low as long as you maintain reasonable precautions. That means cancelling any bird raves that you may have scheduled. It also means that if you are in the habit of touching dead birds, it would be a good idea to find another habit. This is one situation where a bird in hand is not worth two in the bush. Remember dead birds can carry different pathogens, including but not limited to HPAI. That’s why the following Facebook post from the Tisbury Animal Control warned people to keep themselves and their dogs away from any dead cormorants: FacebookFacebook And if you want to re-create the rising out of the water scene from the movie Apocalypse Now in a bed of seaweed, don’t. Dead birds could be floating among the seaweed. So swimming amongst the seaweed could end up giving you the bird. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor The Martha’s Vineyard scenes are a continuation of what’s been a bad year for those who have been winging it. As I covered for Forbes in February, a H5N1 HPAI virus has been spreading among more than just a poultry amount of bird flocks in North America. In addition to chickens, turkeys, and other poultry, the HPAI has infected a range of wild birds. And the words “highly pathogenic” typically do not have a favorable connotation and mean “highly capable of causing disease.” So, if you someone called you those words at the end of a date, don’t expect a second date. The HPAI has already left many, many birds sick and dead. Now, just because humans in general have not been getting infected during this continuing HPAI outbreak doesn’t mean that humans will not be affected. Egg, chicken, and other poultry product prices have already risen as a result, as I reported for Forbes in April. This isn’t just a chicken or an egg problem, though. Changing bird populations in such a dramatic manner could have reverberating consequences throughout the ecosystem. For example, while the early bird may catch the worm, when the bird is no longer around early or late, the populations of certain worms, insects, or other creatures may end up exploding.

ByAssociated PressMike StobbeJune 22, 2022 File photo: A syringe with an influenza vaccine inside heads to its mark during a flu vaccination at Eastfield College in Mesquite, Texas, Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020. (AP Photo/LM Otero) Americans 65 and older should get newer, souped-up flu vaccines because regular shots don’t provide them enough protection, a federal advisory panel said Wednesday. The panel unanimously recommended certain flu vaccines that might offer more or longer protection for seniors, whose weakened immune systems don’t respond as well to traditional shots. Options include: Fluzone High-Dose, Fluad with an immune booster, or Flublok which is made with insect cells instead of chicken eggs. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Related Content Health U.S. opens COVID vaccine to little kids, shots begin next week U.S. health officials have opened COVID-19 vaccines for infants, toddlers and preschoolers — the last group without the shots. 2 years ago The panel’s recommendations usually are adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and become the government’s guidance for U.S. doctors and their patients. This would be the first time the government has stated a flu vaccine preference for older adults. U.S. officials currently say that all Americans 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season. Flu shots tend to be less effective than other common vaccinations, but they have often been particularly disappointing in seniors. Health officials say there is persuasive research indicating some of the new shots work better in older adults, especially at preventing flu-related hospitalizations. Studies are limited, though, and there’s little research comparing the three new versions. “These influenza vaccines are better but are not yet the home run that we would love to have,” said panel member Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University, WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Related Content The PulseHealth How a medical student is using TikTok to bridge racial health disparities Meet the Black TikTok creator bridging health disparities.

About 80% of Medicare beneficiaries get the souped-up vaccines each year, mostly the high-dose one, officials said. The new versions can cost roughly three times more than standard flu shots, but they are covered by insurance programs. Panel members said seniors should get regular flu shots if the newer ones aren’t available. Also on Wednesday, CDC officials reported the flu vaccine didn’t work all that well this past winter, when most illness were caused by a flu strain that vaccines traditionally do a relatively poor job protecting against. The vaccine was 35% effective in preventing flu symptoms severe enough to require a doctor visit. It was about 44% effective in children, and lower in adults.

Introduction Respiratory infection trends Antimicrobial resistance and respiratory infections Using data for surveillance Influenza prevention and treatment Diagnosis of respiratory infections Current instances of diagnostic platforms How COVID-19 changed the picture References Further reading Introduction While earlier ages of the world were marked by devastating plagues of infectious disease, with millions of deaths, the new century boasted incredible advances in medical science that led to its eventually being termed ‘modern medicine.’ Along with better healthcare availability and the provision of sanitary facilities, water, and other hygiene essentials, infections became less common and their impact noticeably less. However, infections are still a major contributor to the disease burden in developing areas of the world, even today. Older infectious conditions refuse to die out, even as new ones emerge. The main architects of this shift include the anthropogenic changes in demographic, climatic, and technological profiles over the last few years. The encroachment of human activity and dwellings into the habitat of wild creatures has increased the risk of spillover of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoal infections into humans. Image Credit: Buravleva stock/Shutterstock.com The subsequent spread of these pathogens is then driven by factors such as loss of immunity to specific disease agents, increasing aging of the population, the emergence of novel strains or new virological characteristics, and the change in the habitat of the animal hosts and vectors driven both by human activity and climate change. Air pollution, linked closely to the use of fossil fuels in industry, transport, and electricity generation, among other uses, is another major contributor to the risk of respiratory viral infections. This is especially so in slums and among the marginalized and poor. Globalization promotes the faster and farther spread of pathogens and their vectors into new populations via animal and animal product trade, human movement, and changing transportation patterns. Respiratory infection trends Lower respiratory tract infections are now the third leading killer in the world today, exacerbated by the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Post-transplant viral infections with organisms other than the commonly seen cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are also being detected with higher frequency as medicine advances. Fungal respiratory infections are becoming more frequent, while uncommon fungal pathogens are being identified in people with severe immunodeficiency from any cause. Tuberculosis has been spreading more rampantly than ever before since the onset of drug resistance, with multi-drug resistance posing an intractable problem worldwide. What makes tuberculosis (TB) the world's most infectious killer? - Melvin SanicasPlay Coinfection with HIV/TB is another diagnostic conundrum that is very difficult to treat, especially as pediatric and elderly tuberculosis is on the rise. Biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α drugs, used to treat autoimmune disease, can also cause the reactivation of dormant TB. This disease causes 5,000 deaths a year, or almost a couple of million deaths a year. Another possibility is the increase in occupational lung disease due to the airborne circulation of microbes such as influenza, varicella, respiratory syncytial virus, and hantavirus. Tuberculosis remains the most significant occupational infection globally, with infection rates being 5-10-fold increased in healthcare workers and symptomatic TB being up to 5-fold higher. Protozoa and helminths continue to cause lung disease in many regions. The risk can only increase as HIV, solid organ transplants and immunosuppression predispose to reactivating dormant infestations. Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses, and RSV cause the highest proportion of hospitalizations and deaths due to respiratory infection. Influenza A has multiple subtypes characterized by different combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens. The flu viruses are likely to continue to threaten human health well into the future. The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has taken over 6 million lives in its sudden and vicious progression over the world in just over two years. Antimicrobial resistance and respiratory infections Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), coupled with genetic modifications through recombination, gene reassortment, or cascade mutations, have led to viruses crossing the species barrier, with a higher risk for the emergence of pandemic viruses. A recent study in The Lancet reported that respiratory infections were among the top three infectious syndromes most closely associated with severe outcomes due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Chest infections attributable to AMR caused over 400,000 directly-associated and 1.5 million indirectly-associated deaths. Using data for surveillance A fresh and extensive evaluation of the risk posed by infectious respiratory disease is urgently required. The utility of global surveillance was demonstrated during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Such surveillance and data collection from integrated sources, including digital surveillance, can yield interesting and fruitful results using novel bioinformatics tools. This data is crucial in predicting and preparing for overwhelming waves. Influenza prevention and treatment Antigenic drift and occasional antigenic shifts threaten human health by producing new variants that evade pre-existing immunity. This means new vaccines have to be formulated each year, targeting high-risk groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, children below the age of five, healthcare workers, and people with certain predisposing illnesses. Image Credit: Jezper/Shutterstock.com Research into the production of a universal influenza vaccine or broadly neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed, considering the suboptimal levels of immunity, its rapid waning with current vaccines, and the delay in producing a new vaccine following an antigenic shift. Oral medications Oral influenza medications such as the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir, and peramivir are used both for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis. Oral COVID-19 medications to prevent the progression of mild disease to severe have proved highly acceptable and useful. While oseltamivir resistance is on the rise, the others remain effective. Also available are baloxavir and favipiravir, the first being an endonuclease inhibitor and the latter a broad-spectrum antiviral. Anti-hemagglutinin antibodies and non-NAIs like pimodivir are also being developed. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab, created by Astra-Zeneca, is now marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) for protecting at-risk infants during high-incidence periods. Moderna, which created the second messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, developed an RSV mRNA vaccine. Diagnosis of respiratory infections Simple, rapid, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic testing is a must to identify respiratory infections early enough to prevent severe disease. Recent advances include lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technologies that use microfluidic components with biosensors to carry out a complex test with rapidity and specificity, using tiny amounts of reagent and sample, with very low costs. These platforms can be used as multiplexed assays for point-of-care testing (POCT). Along with the use of oral medications at an early stage, the POCTs may reduce the toll of respiratory infections and the risk of outbreaks and AMR. Newer POCT platforms use smart materials and approaches based on nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT); virus epitope recognition by antibodies, aptamers, or cavities combined with optical, electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, or other techniques to produce a detectable signal; and immunological tests for viral detection. The CRISPR-based systems can detect nucleic acid very efficiently, especially with Cas-systems like SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) from Sherlock Biosciences, aimed at SARS-CoV-2. Serological Testing for COVID-19 Other POCT devices use non-molecular methods, such as nanoparticles, to detect biomolecules in real-time with very high sensitivity and a short turnaround time. Immunofluorescence tests are also in use, as are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), protein arrays, and photon excitation assays. Biosensors provide rapid, portable, and sensitive miniaturized platforms for the detection of antigens or antibodies. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) uses reflectance based on biomolecule-metal surface binding to detect specific targets. Hybrid nanobiomolecules or transistor-coupled DNA probes are other approaches Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using high-throughput portable platforms, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, also provide rapid, efficient viral detection. Multiplex LOC systems will allow several pathogens to be tested with one sample, saving time and samples. Current instances of diagnostic platforms Examples of such systems include the Alere BinaxNOW® (formerly Alere i) Influenza A&B platform (Abbott, United States), the QuickVue® Influenza A + B (Quidel Corporation, United States) and the FILMARRAY Respiratory Panel (bioMérieux, France). Others include Nanosphere Verigene® RV+ test, and Hologic Gen-Probe Prodesse assays. These are based on PCR technology. Others like mariPOC® Respi test (ArcDia International Oy Ltd,Finland), BD veritor™ Influenza A + B, BD veritor™ RSV (Becton Dickinson, United States), and SD Bioline Influenza Ag (Standard Diagnostics Inc., Korea) are non-NAAT assays. Meanwhile, integrated sample preparation and testing systems like the cobas® Liat® system (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) and GeneXpert (Cepheid, United States) are now available for influenza A, influenza B, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV simultaneous testing. How COVID-19 changed the picture In less than a year, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedentedly rapid rollout of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in this period brought other respiratory infections down to a record low in most countries. Now, with relaxations rife, a rebound surge in these diseases is on the horizon. Pre-pandemic, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections themselves caused over 30,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths weekly at their peak. During the pandemic, mask-wearing in public became commonplace. So did vaccination and the use of rapid antigen tests for diagnosis following exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, all these steps could be used with great success to counteract the flu, RSV, and other contagious respiratory diseases as well. Moreover, a number of biosensors have been designed for remote SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and data collection. These gave rise to the popular lateral flow assays (LFA) and microfluidic analytic devices. Image Credit: steved_np3/Shutterstock.com LFA are cheap, sensitive, and easy to use and have already been used to diagnose the flu and other viruses. All these can be adopted for the mass diagnosis and early treatment of respiratory infections. New, more convenient sample types are being explored, including saliva and exhaled air, for both diagnosis and monitoring. The Internet of Things (IoT) can integrate data from medical devices, imaging, laboratory tests, healthcare providers, treatment plans, and telehealth data to detect changes early. When coupled with global positioning systems (GPS), outbreaks can be picked up in advance. The IoT has been co-opted to COVID-19 management through many robots and applications, like ‘RapidPlex,’ a graphene-sensor-based multiplexed telemedicine platform for COVID-19 biomarkers developed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Optimizing nano-enabled viral biosensing, IoT, and artificial intelligence (AI) could open avenues for various integrated low cost highly performant detection technology for error-free, smart controlling at a personalised level. IoT technology coupled with POCT platforms would be instrumental in offering diagnostic platforms and therapeutic approaches for future global health challenges.” Potential COVID-19 treatments include interferon-based therapies that may prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality. These agents could possibly help dampen the impact of future pandemic viruses while specific antivirals and vaccines are being developed. The outcome may be a future that is not obsessively focused on COVID-19 prevention alone but on improving the quality of inspired air to prevent multiple airborne respiratory infections together by learning from the innovations of this period.

(ABC New England North West: Kathleen Ferguson)abc.net.auews/flutracking-online-survey-now-global-in-influenza-covid-fight/101158640Link copiedShareShare articleCraig Dalton remembers a moment of doubt among his team who were developing an online flu survey back in 2005.The public health physician recalls the survey developer pushing himself back in his chair and telling his colleagues he was worried no-one would use it. It turns out, the fear was unfounded.The FluTracking survey his team created to help monitor respiratory diseases works in real time by surveying people in the community about their symptoms.It has been adopted overseas, and in some countries it is one of the main surveillance systems for influenza-like illness and, of course, COVID-like illness.Its success, in part, lies with the fact that the survey takes less than a minute.At its inception in 2006, it was being used by about 400 people in the Hunter New England region.Now, more than 60,000 people across Australia access it each week. Dr Craig Dalton is one of the physicians who worked on FluTracking. (Supplied: University of Newcastle)"We didn't know what to expect when we sent the survey out in 2006," Dr Dalton said."We didn't know whether we would get five responses, 10 responses, no responses."During the height of the pandemic, up to 150,000 people a week responded to the survey and their responses gave important insights into the coronavirus crisis. Importantly, Dr Dalton says the survey showed that standard testing, such as PCR swabs, were not reflective of the true number of active cases in Australia."FluTracking showed the actual testing rates weren't high enough to pick up that many cases," he says."Only about 60 per cent of people [survey respondents] with symptoms actually had a [COVID] test."It gave us a really good reality check on what proportion of cases we were missing."Survey captures real-time experienceFluTracking was inspired by a 2005 Swedish study of a telephone survey to track trends in the spread and severity of the flu.The use of the survey — created by physicians with help from the NSW Health Department and the University of Newcastle — has spread to New Zealand, Hong Kong and Argentina."Not all countries have high-level surveillance and rapid laboratory surveillance. Australia is lucky to have that," Dr Dalton says.Dr Nick Walsh helped get funding from DFAT to set up FluTracking in Argentina. (Supplied: Dr Nick Walsh)He says the survey creates a window into what is happening in real time in the community."FluTracking plays a special role because it goes directly to people and gets their actual experience on the ground," he says.Survey translated into SpanishThe push to get FluTracking into Argentina came from Nick Walsh, who worked with the Pan American Health Organization, an arm of the World Health Organization.Behind the world's strange flu season Photo shows A woman sitting on a couch, wrapped in a cosy white blanket, sneezes into a tissue.A range of specialists are saying the COVID-19 pandemic has set off a chain of consequences that interrupted the spread of influenza, possibly throwing out seasonal trends for years to come.Dr Walsh was the regional adviser in communicable and infectious diseases and worked directly with Argentina's health officials."When it became apparent that COVID had really escaped Asia and was going to propagate, I immediately reached out to people in ministries of health over in South America," Dr Walsh said."We did [a webinar] and we had about 300 people [attend] across Argentina in mid-2020."The webinar was uploaded online, which later attracted an additional 15,000 viewers."They [authorities] really didn't have any weapons [against COVID] in Argentina at the time. Obviously, with a severe wave that went through Argentina, they went to lockdown because they didn't have much option," Dr Walsh said."[Argentina] had 130,000 recorded deaths in that country. That's a lot of people, and that's the counted deaths."At the webinar Dr Dalton introduced FluTracking, which was seen as a high-impact, low-cost option.With seed funding from Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the team was able set the survey up in Argentina."We had to translate it in 2021 into Spanish and we did a soft-launch. We have only been up and running since Omicron, so this is part of the mix in order to track COVID and obviously now flu," he says.Survey comes at the right timeDr Walsh says the survey was ahead of its time, being developed for the internet back in the mid-2000s and now being accessible to anyone with a smartphone.How big is Australia's COVID-19 caseload?Photo shows Young people walking through a Sydney streetResearch estimating the impact of the first Omicron wave of COVID-19 indicates its cases might have been much higher than officially recorded."It fits the zeitgeist.

Tens of thousands of young chickens in a multi-level industrial farm. Thu June 23rd, 2022 Perspective • Food • Industry Words by Devatha P. Nair - Share on Facebook - Share on LinkedIn - Share on Whatsapp - Share on X - Copy URL Coppied - Republish 5 min read Over the past six months, poultry producers have culled millions of animals to contain the spread of avian flu with relative ease, but the final steps in the federally monitored biosecurity process—safely disposing of the dead birds and implementing effective safety measures to prevent the next outbreak—prove to be a significant challenge. More than 39 million birds have been exposed to the H5N1 virus since January, according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. New USDA data suggests that the majority of those birds have since been culled, often using the “most inhumane method available.” The birds can remain infectious after they are killed and must be carefully transported to disposal sites to avoid spreading the virus to other flocks. Producers utilize a variety of different methods to dispose of dead birds, some more effective than others, but the real risk comes from the lack of appropriate safeguards around where they are allowed to dump diseased carcasses and what precautions need to be taken before doing so. Public health officials fear that improper disposal of dead birds could contaminate local water supplies and make the virus even more deadly. While infections at U.S. farms have slowed, poultry producers are just beginning to feel the effects of the outbreak. Earlier this month, Jennie-O reported delays in its turkey supply chain due to the virus, forcing parent-company Hormel to narrow its earnings forecast for the year. In the wake of recent supply chain disruptions, scientists are rushing to develop an avian flu vaccine for poultry. The vaccine has long been opposed by the public health community who fear it will give rise to another more deadly virus. Other producers are signaling a return to business as usual. Each of the nation’s largest chicken producers—Tyson, Pilgrim’s, and Sanderson—report “minimal” impacts on their businesses, according to industry bullhorn WATTPoultry. But the true cost of culling 39 million birds and potentially vaccinating billions more so the nation’s poultry industry can keep its lines running remains to be seen. Potential biohazards Culling during a bird flu outbreak creates a number of potential biohazards. As bird carcasses begin to decompose, body fluids from the dead animals along with byproducts of degradation such as methane gas are released into the surrounding environment, contaminating the surface water, groundwater, and soil. Improper carcass treatment and disposal can also lead to the further spread of viruses among human and non-human animals. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends composting, incineration, and disposal in landfills as preferred methods of dealing with dead birds during a bird flu outbreak. Additionally, the agency recommends on-site burial of the carcasses or converting them to water, fat, meat, and bone meal. Incineration is also considered an effective way to dispose of diseased animal carcasses, but it comes with its own community health risks. Incinerators release thousands of tiny particles into the air, choking the air with the smoke and odor of millions of dead birds. The EPA also recommends the disposal of bird carcasses in municipal landfills that are equipped to handle degrading and leachable waste. But the transfer of culled birds from the infection site to landfills can spread the virus, so the carcasses must be placed in leak-proof trailers with absorbent linings before they can be transported to the landfill. A study from the University of Nebraska found that the bird flu virus found in landfill leachates can remain infectious for close to two years, indicating that improperly operated municipal landfills housing millions of pounds of bird carcass presents an additional risk to animal, human, and environmental health. Back to business as usual While the current avian flu outbreak has only affected 1.3 percent of the chicken supply chain in the U.S., the multi-billion-dollar industry is already taking steps to ensure that the current outbreak will only be a temporary setback. Earlier this year, Tyson Foods issued a statement reassuring its farmers and consumers that they were taking the necessary precautionary measures to slow the spread of the outbreak. “All of our U.S. poultry operations continue to operate under heightened biosecurity,” the company said. “Should any flock be diagnosed with highly pathogenic avian influenza, farms are immediately quarantined and birds from them are not processed. ”The company also stated that there is “no evidence” that “any form of avian influenza” can be transmitted to humans from properly cooked poultry. The federal government is also considering precautionary measures such as vaccines for chickens to protect the industry against future outbreaks. But stakeholders worry about the cost of additional medical procedures for birds who are only bred to live for a short amount of time. And even if large-scale poultry vaccination programs were a viable option, public health experts say they would not prevent mass culling during a global bird flu outbreak. The virus is already spreading in wild animal populations, which are much more difficult to track and nearly impossible to vaccinate. Considering the possibility that a local landfill could become a superspreader site, health officials are encouraging citizens to be on the lookout for abnormal activity in their local wildlife, especially mammals, as this may be a sign that the disease has found new opportunities to evolve. “There’s a risk of it adapting to and then transmitting between mammals, and then you have a new problem,” Dr. Jolianne Rijks, a veterinarian at the Dutch Wildlife Health Center, told The New York Times.

The group has received £1.5 million from the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to develop new strategies to tackle future bird flu outbreaks. The announcement was made by APHA, DEFRA and BBSRC today. Reliable detection of avian influenza in wild birds before outbreaks on poultry farms could offer opportunities to alert farmers to the need to enhance biosecurity practices. Dr Alastair Ward, School of Biology Dr Ward will investigate the role of wild birds in perpetuating the disease amongst poultry. He will examine whether the virus can be consistently detected in birds routinely shot by hunters at key locations throughout England, before outbreaks start on poultry farms. If successful, this will mean that early detection of seasonal re-emergence of the disease in wild birds can be used to trigger advice to poultry farmers to enhance biosecurity practices so that they reduce the risk of an outbreak. He said: “Reliable detection of avian influenza in wild birds before outbreaks on poultry farms could offer opportunities to alert farmers to the need to enhance biosecurity practices, such as temporary housing of free-range birds, in order to reduce their chances of suffering an outbreak. “With the cost to the industry likely exceeding £100 million last season, such advice could result in massive financial savings for the industry and national economy and substantial reduction in the numbers of domestic birds slaughtered to waste in order to control the disease. “Since hunters lawfully shoot several thousand ducks and geese in the UK each year, these could offer an excellent resource for testing for the disease. This is what we are seeking to evaluate during our study.” Largest UK outbreak This year’s bird flu outbreak has been the largest and longest ever experienced in the UK and in many parts of Europe. The outbreak started earlier than previous years after the virus continued to circulate in Europe over summer 2021 and led to more than 100 cases in the UK. It is hoped the consortium will be able to find new ways to contain future outbreaks. The news will be a significant boost to the UK’s poultry sector and rural economy, which has experienced significant disruption from this year’s outbreak with compulsory indoor housing measures put in place to protect poultry from the disease. The consortium will focus on building our understanding in a number of key areas, including: what it is about the current virus strains that helps them to form larger and longer outbreaks; understanding transmission and infection in different bird populations, including how the virus transmits from wild birds to farmed poultry, the gaps in biosecurity that allow the virus to penetrate premises, and how this could be addressed; mapping and modelling the spread of infection over time and across species; why some birds, such as ducks, are more resistant to bird flu strains; developing models to predict how the viruses will evolve and spread in the future; inform risk mitigation measures in birds to reduce disease burden thereby protecting against zoonotic transmission occurring from animals to humans, to prevent future spillovers of influenza with pandemic potential into humans. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: “This new consortium will allow us to combine our expertise at a national level to increase the speed and quality of our research, ensuring we can develop new strategies to aid our efforts against this insidious disease and hopefully in time reduce the impact on the poultry sector.” Professor Ian Brown, APHA’s Head of Virology and project manager, said: “This investment in a new research consortium will bring together the greatest minds from eight world-leading British institutions to address gaps in our understanding of bird flu, helping us to control the spread of the disease, while furthering UK animal health science and ensuring we maintain our world-leading reputation in the field.” Professor Melanie Welham, Executive Chair of BBSRC, said: “One of the real strengths of the UK’s scientific response to disease outbreaks is the way that we can draw on leading researchers from all over the country, who can pool their expertise to deliver results, fast. “This new national consortium will study the unprecedented avian influenza outbreak to better understand this latest strain and how to tackle it. This will feed rapidly into government decision-making and new strategies to protect the poultry industry and reduce the risk of future transmission to humans.” International collaboration UK researchers are already world-leaders in studying bird flu, with the APHA hosting an International Reference Laboratory, which conducts testing on global samples and rapidly shares the latest information internationally on outbreaks. The knowledge gathered will also be shared with international partners to aid their efforts to tackle the disease with benefits for global risk mitigation. Members of the consortium will also attend a global session this month, hosted by the US Department of Agriculture, where they will influence and coordinate future investment into animal influenzas on an international basis. Members include APHA, The Pirbright Institute, Royal Veterinary College, Roslin Institute, University of Cambridge, Imperial College London and University of Nottingham. Their researchers bring together expertise across many areas including microbiologists, epidemiologists, virologists, genomics specialists, mathematical modelers and those translating science evidence into formats that can be used by policymakers.

The tone, emphasis and ‘learning points’ from such a work would have been quite different if there had been no coronavirus pandemic, or if it were written before the advent of the emerging infectious diseases in the last 20 years. The idea of learning from history is a challenge because it raises questions about the relationship between the past and present that go to the heart of the historical discipline. But it is also an opportunity to bring epidemic disease to the study of the past, and for historians to think long and hard about how they can draw upon their work to inform social issues. History is also about context and the particular: it is about this person or that event in a specific time and place. Singapore, as a tiny developed nation-state and port city in Southeast Asia, presents similarly a limitation and a strength. Shorn of a physical hinterland, its experience appears to speak little to bigger countries with multiple urban settlements and large rural areas. Its history may also seem unhelpful for states lacking the governance, infrastructure, technology, or multicultural population that Singapore possessed. However, what the island of a mere 700-odd square kilometres does offer is an excellent case of micro-history. Pandemics are by definition international events but their histories are also a sum of local events, trajectories and actors. By tracing Singapore’s epidemiological pasts in depth, we derive a sense of the experiences, consequences and responses of an urban population’s openness to the world, including the world of microbes. This provides the context for considering how a history of pandemic disease may be useful for preparing for future threats.

Pandemics in History There are only a handful of accounts of pandemics that have tried to explain why. Most of these, save for a select few, are not widely read. The first step to remedy this is to recognise that pandemics are an integral part of human history, even though unlike infectious diseases, they are fairly rare events. Pandemic should be written into general historical narratives. We also ought to note that widely spreading disease outbreaks are becoming more frequent as the world becomes ever more inter-connected and humans have an increasing impact on the ecological system. While it is vital to write historical accounts of pandemics, it is just as important for historians to include infections and pandemics in their work where it is relevant to do. Pandemics are inherently historical. We can speak of their immediate causes (or catalysts), long-term causes or variety of causes. George Dehner notes that influenza pandemics have become more probable over the course of human history because people have been living in increasingly dense communities that are closely interconnected with other such communities. As this form of human settlement became more prevalent particularly from the 19th century, , it is not surprising that influenza pandemics have increased in frequency and virulence.[1] As Mark Honigsbaum observes in his survey of 20th century pandemics in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, it is neither possible nor desirable to predict the next pandemic. Advances in medical science have ironically locked scientists into self-limiting paradigms and theories. The last pandemic has tended to create a hypervigilance about a specific disease or group of pathogens, but this can cause misdirection and error. Honigsbaum’s point is a timely one: would the COVID-19 episode trigger a similar overemphasis on coronaviruses? He argues that it is more useful to explore the ecology of infectious diseases, which points to the effects of long-term environmental and social developments such as rising globalisation and urbanisation.[2] Pandemics are also historically significant events. They have an immediate impact on human lives, families or components of human society such as the economy or the culture. In this, the insights afforded by social history are indispensable yet they have often been ignored. In her excellent book Pandemic 1918, Catherine Arnold retraces the influenza pandemic in the West through the eyes of those who experienced it first-hand – ‘East End schoolgirls, Mayfair debutantes, Boston schoolboys and Italian immigrants’.[3] Pandemics narrated this way compel historical accounts to move away from the great men (including leaders and doctors) to the little people who bore its full brunt. The scale of infection and deprivation should help communities and societies remember and commemorate their epidemic pasts. Social memory is a key resource in preparing for the next pandemic. Moreover, pandemics have long aftermaths and epilogues; they leave an imprint in history even if this was ignored by contemporaries. The responses to prevent or control them may change the way we live, our relationship with others and the state long after the outbreak has passed. Or a modern pandemic could be important when it fails to elicit the active responses that have become synonymous with the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19 pandemics. In Britain, the 1918 influenza pandemic unravelled major failings on the part of the government and medical establishment, with both appearing to have done little in the face of the epidemic. Senior officials were defensive, insisting that they could not have anticipated, prevented or halted the spread of the illness. This can be explained by the period of transition the country was undergoing, with new emphasis on individual rights and calls for a less intrusive government. The medical experts, too, were divided over the causal agent and the ways to combat the outbreak.[4] Finally, pandemics have another connection with the past when they are recalled or commemorated. One of the questions we try to address is why certain pandemics are widely remembered while others are pushed to the fringe of social memory. According to Peter Furtado, the 1918 influenza pandemic that ravaged much of the globe was a ‘strangely private affair’; while masks were worn in certain places, there was no lockdown and relatively little media coverage.[5] While influenza has been called the ‘Blue Death’ due to its outward manifestations, this is much less known than the original version of the term, the ‘Black Death’ commonly used for plague. Figure 2: Timeline of the history of the Communicable Disease Centre at the current National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Photograph by Kah Seng Loh. Through Niall Johnson’s research, we see that the 1918 pandemic in Britain largely slipped away from national, local and family histories and memories, overshadowed by the horror of the First World War. Its wider historical effects on demographic trends, family formation, the healthcare system, and on politics, also appear limited. Notably, in only a few countries such as Brazil, Samoa and South Africa did the 1918 tragedy shake the political leadership or order.[6] With upper estimates of 50 million deaths, it is quite incredible that the event had become ‘little more than a sad footnote to the more public tragedy of the Great War’.[7] At the same time, historical research encourages us to read dominant accounts and official sources more carefully. The outbreak of disease on a massive scale often triggers social fault-lines and reveals blind spots. Pandemics are lived through and experienced very differently according to where people stand on the categories of class, ethnicity, gender, or age. When a case of mass infection, suffering and death during a pandemic is ignored and forgotten, as has been claimed about the passing COVID-19 epidemic in the US today, there is something to be said about whose lives mattered (or did not matter) and to whom.[8] Asian and Colonial Contexts The literature on pandemics is overwhelmingly Eurocentric, despite the fact that many outbreaks, including the present one, have Asian origins, trajectories, impacts, responses, and contexts. Part of the reason is due to the paucity of sources in many Asian countries, both in the colonial and post-colonial years. When many of these countries were under foreign rule, their archives comprised colonial records written from Western vantage points, while their post-colonial archives may remain fragmentary or have become difficult to access. The challenge is to unearth Asian perspectives and narratives from the available sources, while taking into account the impact of colonialism and Asian responses on the pandemic experience. Figure 3: An colonial account of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Singapore. Source: CO 275/101 Straits Settlements Medical Report 1918, p. 441. Colonial histories of medicine in Asian countries tend to be more critically oriented towards power than standard Western accounts of pandemics. This has given rise to a view of biomedicine as a ‘tool of empire’. In his classic work, Colonising the Body, David Arnold conceptualises the history of biomedicine in British India as one of the colonisation of Indian bodies in addition to territories. Biomedicine was thus an integral part of the colonial system. Arnold also uncovers Indian resistance as a key part of the history,[9] which differs markedly from the more egalitarian social history of pandemics that Catherine Arnold and others have written. The relationship between people and the state in many colonial histories is that between foreign rulers and subjugated natives. To trace the history of Western medicine in India is, David Arnold suggests, to investigate the colonial artifice itself and the mediating influence of local circumstances and medical traditions. In what has become a theme in colonial medical histories, he highlights the ordering and othering of people into immutable races during disease outbreaks. Western doctors held that Indians were more vulnerable to disease and attributed this to undesirable cultural practices.[10] Following our previous work on tuberculosis, our research records instances of racial commentary during Singapore’s pandemics on a society that was more ethnically diverse than in India.[11] Another classic example of the ‘tools of empire’ approach is Lenore Manderson’s Sickness and the State on British medical policy in Malaya. She writes, ‘Tropical medicine was a cultural construct, the scientific stepchild of colonial domination and control’.[12] As with David Arnold, she maps a medical pluralism in colonial Malaya. Biomedicine was only one of several medical systems there, contending and interacting with the healing traditions of the various Asian groups. This medical pluralism has also been uncovered in colonial Africa.[13] This dive into social and cultural history is fruitful in multiracial Singapore. At the same thing, it is important to recognise that colonialism, long-term causation and the ecological approach are not mutually exclusive: they all affect each other. More recent works on India have shown how British understanding of the risk posed by infectious diseases was shaped by international debates and perspectives as much as local situations. Colonial health interventions were not merely tools of empire but multi-faceted products of the interaction between international, imperial and colonial forces.[14] Colonial rule in some parts of Asia was brief; Nicholas Tarling has deemed it a ‘a fleeting, passing phase’ in Southeast Asia.[15] An exception is the Philippines, where a relatively short period of American colonialism was preceded by over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Thus scholars like Warwick Anderson can trace a history of racial policy and deferred citizenship during the American period, where policies became a way to mark Filipinos apart from Americans, yet also allowing some of the former to transition properly into the latter. In the perspective of many American hygienists, Filipinos were ‘half devil and half child’, possessing a contaminating body that could be put right by the efforts of American physicians and a small number of enlightened Filipino doctors.[16] Anderson’s approach differs from Ken De Bevoise’s study of the origins of the major health crisis in the Philippines in the late-19th century during the final years of Spanish colonial rule. De Bevoise is no less critical about power and domination than Anderson, but dwells instead on an ecological account of epidemic disease. It is the long-term factors that have explanatory force here: the demographic, economic, social, technological, and political changes over the longue durée that affected and reshaped the relationship between humans, pathogens and the environment.[17] Finally, there is the case of semi-colonial situations such as modern China in the 19th and 20th centuries. This is a useful extension of how colonialism was never complete or hegemonic. In Ruth Rogaski’s nuanced reading, the pursuit of hygiene was a major part of the difficult Chinese struggle for modernity. Colonial medicine in the micro-urban contexts of the treaty ports was not monolithic or all-conquering. It changed over time, involving collaboration between foreigners and locals.[18] The colonial period in China was also a relatively short interlude. Mary Augusta Brazelton’s survey of vaccination there after 1949 shows how, as a form of medical technology, it gave the Maoist state vast control not only over disease but also human bodies and lives. The outcome was not a suppressed population, as David Arnold and others have argued. There was popular support for vaccines that worked, so much so that they have come to define the meaning of Chinese citizenship.[19] Another aspect of the Chinese literature is relevant to places like Singapore. The study of Maoist China reminds us that a history of pandemics needs to traverse into the post-colonial era. Colonial rule gave historians a substantial trove of archival documents that recorded not only the work of health departments and administrators, but also their perspectives, priorities and politics as colonial developers. It is more difficult to gain access to post-colonial archives in many Asian contexts. In Singapore, most government records after the British left are still classified, including those of the ministries responsible for health and disease.[20] This is likely true for many other Asian countries. Yet, it is paramount that creative efforts are made to locate other forms of local sources so that post-colonial histories can be attempted. As much as the colonial era ought not to be seen in isolation from the longue durée and the ecology of epidemic disease, it similarly cannot be understood without reference to the period that followed it. Colonial medicine may have an impact on its successor through the international circuits of scientific collaboration and exchange that emerged with the end of colonialism. The question at hand is the balance of historical change and continuity. A post-colonial history of pandemics places colonial accounts in perspective, and vice-versa. There are pandemics that straddled both periods, such as those of influenza, cholera, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria. Of those that are contemporary, such as the coronavirus pandemics, their study may offer new insights on what happened in history. We can better understand both the past and present by venturing into the post-colonial era. In conclusion, the lessons of history are not a ‘copy and paste’ from the past. The learning points we look to draw are more modest ones. We are able to consider alternative actions or new options, based on evidence and with the benefit of hindsight. Why Singapore did not respond sufficiently to influenza pandemics in the 20th century, for instance, is something we can contemplate. This does not tell us what to do in the next pandemic – that can only be decided by the leaders, the medical experts and the people, using all the facts at their disposal, including biomedical and historical facts. Drawing lessons from history is often difficult but important. It may raise more questions than answers and is likely to require scrutinising common myths and outlandish claims. ______________________________________________ [1] George Dehner, Global Flu and You: A History of Influenza (London: Reaktion Books, 2012).

The underlying mechanisms through which immunity develops in human milk following maternal infection with mucosal pathogens are not well understood. We simulated nasal mucosal influenza infection through live attenuated influenza vaccination (LAIV) and compared immune responses in milk to inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on RNA extracted from human milk cells to evaluate differentially expressed genes and pathways on days 1 and 7 post-vaccination. Both LAIV and IIV vaccines induced influenza-specific IgA that persisted for at least 6 months. Regulation of type I interferon production, toll-like receptor, and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways were highly upregulated in milk on day 1 following LAIV but not IIV at any time point. Upregulation of innate immunity in human milk may provide timely protection against mucosal infections until antigen-specific immunity develops in the human milk-fed infant.

Epidemiological studies in low and high income countries show that breastfeeding protects against mucosal infections in infants1,2,3,4. The immunomodulatory functions of human milk are mediated by pathogen-specific secretory IgA and other immune factors5,6. Human milk contains immune cells including monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells)7. Less is known about innate and cellular defenses in human milk, but they may also play a role8. Mothers and infants are usually exposed to the same mucosal pathogens given their close proximity to each other during the infant’s early life. The underlying mechanisms through which pathogen-specific immunity develops in human milk following maternal mucosal infection are not well understood9,10.Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is inhaled and thus directly stimulates the antigen recognizing cells in the respiratory tract mucosa11, which together with the lactating mammary gland, the intestine and other mucosal sites constitute the integrated mucosal immune system12,13. Nasal secretory IgA is induced following LAIV administration in children and adults, and higher levels correlate with protection from culture-confirmed influenza14,15,16. Stimulation of one mucosal site may result in antibody production at other mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues17. Goldblum, Ahlstedt and colleagues18 showed that ingestion of a certain E. coli strain during pregnancy resulted in high levels of inoculum-specific IgA levels and IgA producing cells in human milk, but not in saliva or blood. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae during pregnancy has been demonstrated to increase the levels of IgA in human milk, which may be associated with protection in the infant19,20. Limited data is available on milk IgA induced by the mucosal LAIV21. Intramuscular vaccination of mothers, including against influenza, during pregnancy induces pathogen-specific IgA in milk22,23,24,25. Human milk immune responses after vaccination beyond IgA have not yet been studied.In this study, we simulated mucosal infection through LAIV vaccination of mothers to evaluate the subsequent immune responses. Intramuscular vaccination with IIV was used as a control. We further characterized the molecular gene signatures and pathways in human milk cells that may predict an immunogenic response.ResultsWe enrolled 78 lactating women during the months of influenza vaccine availability from 2011 to 2016. Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mothers were post-partum for a median of 7.5 days (interquartile range, 5–78 days) at the time of influenza vaccination. None had received a prenatal influenza vaccine during the influenza season of participation until study enrollment. Many (48 [61.5%]) reported never having received an influenza vaccine in a previous season in their lifetime. Figure 1a shows an overview of the enrollment and analyses performed in this study.Table 1 Participant characteristics.Full size tableFig. 1: Study design and immune responses induced by vaccination.a Study overview: Total of 78 breastfeeding mothers were recruited and received doses of either LAIV (n = 46) or IIV (n = 32). Blood and milk samples were obtained for transcriptional profiles at days 0, 1, and 7; milk IgA and blood HAI immune responses were measured on days 0, 30, 90, and 180. b Human milk influenza-specific IgA increases by day 30 and persists above baseline (day 0) through at least 180 days in response to both LAIV and IIV. c Serum HAI increases by day 30 and persists through at least 180 days in serum after IIV but not LAIV. d Circos plot summarizing the antibody response induced by vaccination. The first and second outer tracks represent the vaccination and sample type, respectively. The middle track shows a barplot with max log2[fold change] of influenza-specific HAI or IgA for each sample of blood or milk, respectively. The three inner tracks show a heat map of log2[fold change] of influenza-specific HAI or IgA at days 30, 90, and 180 days. Inner ribbons connect mothers in which both milk and serologic responses are present.Full size imageForty-six (59.0%) mothers received LAIV and 32 (41.0%) received IIV at enrollment. Milk influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-binding IgA responses were statistically similar between those stimulated by the mucosal vs. systemically-delivered vaccines at all time points post-vaccination. Both LAIV and IIV induced an influenza-specific IgA response in milk by day 30 that remained elevated as compared to pre-vaccination baseline titers through at least 180 days (Fig. 1b). Individuals with low A(H1N1)pdm09-specific IgA titers prior to vaccination had a higher increase in response to vaccination compared to those who had a high pre-existing influenza-IgA titers (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). Serum A(H1N1)pdm09 HAI titers were higher for IIV recipients at all three post-vaccination time points and persisted through at least 180 days; no elevation in mean HAI titers were observed in LAIV recipients (Fig. 1b). Figure 1d shows a summary of the paired milk and serologic responses. Human milk IgA responses did not correlate with serum HAI responses in recipients of either vaccine (p > 0.05).Human milk samples showed a significantly higher degree of molecular perturbation compared with blood samples in the same individual following either LAIV and IIV delivery (both p < 0.001, Fig. 2a). We used differential expression analysis to normalize sample variations to uncover genes consistently altered across all participants, which allows comparison of the vaccine types at different time points. Herein, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed within the vaccination groups in days 1 and 7 compared with baseline for blood and human milk samples. We found 984 upregulated and 584 downregulated genes in human milk following live mucosal vaccination compared with only 8 upregulated and 8 downregulated by systemic vaccination on day 1. The opposite findings were seen in blood where IIV induced more differential expression compared with LAIV (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2A–H). There are no statistically significant differences between timepoints within a sample type. An upregulation in genes related to inflammatory and antimicrobial responses in blood after IIV was comparable to blood transcriptional modules seen in previous studies (Supplementary Fig. 3)26. LAIV did not induce as many changes in immunological genes in blood transcriptional modules compared with IIV.Fig. 2: Vaccines perturbation on transcriptome profiles for blood and milk.a Scatter plot of sample molecular degree of perturbation scores. Scores were calculated for each sample summing the absolute log2 [fold change] >1 divided by the number of perturbed genes.

Upregulated DEGs with roles in bridging innate to early adaptive immunity included SPP1 (Secreted phosphoprotein 1), IL18, and IL12. Multiple upregulated genes were leading edge genes in the ATP synthesis pathways including Respiratory complex I (NDUFV1, NDUFA7, NDUFA2, NDUFB8, NDUFA5, NDUFA6, NDUFS3, NDUFA9, NDUFA8, NDUFA12, NDUFA10, NDUFS2, NDUFS4, NDUFA13, NDUFB5, NDUFB6, NDUFAF1, SDHAF2); complex II (SDHAF2); complex III (UQCRQ) and complex IV (COX6B1 COX8A, COX5B, COX7A2L) and a mitochondrial peptidase PMPCB, which cleaves the mitochondrial sequence off newly imported protein precursors.The number of upregulated DEGs for LAIV in human milk dropped considerably at day 7 (from 984 to 27) in contrast with IIV, which increased in number (from 8 to 52). LAIV up-regulated genes include RORA and SPP1 which plays roles in regulation of the inflammatory response27. Both LAIV and IIV shared four up-regulated genes at day 7 (CREB3L1, FOLR1, GPX3, CDR1). CREB3L1 is activated in response to viral infection to inhibit proliferation of virus-infected cells, FOLR1 codes for a folate receptor involved in cell proliferation. A detailed list of all genes uncovered by the differential expression analysis is summarized in supplementary table 1.Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed at subject (Supplementary Fig. 4) and group (Fig. 2c and Supplementary table 1) levels using the sample-wise and the differential expression analysis fold-changes respectively. Individual variation and heterogeneity within each vaccination group was observed for blood and milk at all time points (Supplementary Fig. 4). Regulation of type I interferon production, toll-like receptor, and pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways were highly upregulated in milk on day 1 following LAIV but not after IIV vaccination. Neutrophil mediated immunity; T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and Fc-receptor signaling pathway had stronger positive normalized enrichment scores (NES) in milk at day 1 compared to day 7. The T-cell receptor and Fc receptor signaling pathways were not upregulated until day 7 after IIV. Mitochondrial respiratory related pathways were highly upregulated following LAIV on day 1, and then only mildly upregulated on day 7 in milk. The same pathways showed mild to no upregulation on day 1 but showed high upregulation on day 7 following IIV (Fig. 2c).To investigate the association of enriched pathways with IgA responses, we performed correlation tests between DEGs and individual normalized enrichment score (NES) and IgA fold-change (Fig. 2d). Both innate and early adaptive immune pathways, including response to type I interferon, positive regulation of phagocytosis, and B cell activation were found to be positively correlated with IgA in response to LAIV vaccine on days 1 and 7 (Fig. 2d). The only pathway significantly upregulated with correlation to IIV was positive regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, which was seen on day 7 (Supplementary Table 1).Co-expression analysis of human milk expression profiles revealed the presence of three (M1-3) and four (M1-4) modules of co-expressed genes at day 1 and day 7, respectively (Fig. 3a). The M2 and M3 modules found at day 1 were enriched in immunological pathways including I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, and inflammatory response, while M1 was enriched with mitochondrial and protein processing pathways but include antigen processing and presentation and viral processing. On day 7, three modules enriched in immune pathways (M1, M3 and M4) were seen, while M2 (not shown) was enriched only in lipid biosynthetic processes. M1 is enriched mainly in neutrophil, mitochondrial and protein processing pathways. M3 and M4 were enriched mainly by cytokines and interferon I pathways, respectively. The complete list of genes and pathways enriched for each module is available in Supplementary Table 2.Fig. 3: Co-expressed modules in human milk.a Gene co-expression analysis of differentially expressed genes in LAIV and IIV. Functional over representation interaction plot of gene co-expression module using each module as gene list and GO biological process (2018) as gene set. b, c Network obtained from protein-protein interactions (InnateBD) for modules M2 (day 1) and M1 (day 7). Plot highlights gene nodes that act as potential hubs. Genes in bold are DEGs. Nodes were sized and colored proportionally to its degree.Full size imageThe protein-protein interaction network (Fig. 3b) revealed highly connected genes that were strongly related to innate immunity including EIF2AK2, STAT1, DDX5, TLR2, and TLR4 on M2 day 1. Of those, TLR4 was a significantly upregulated DEG following LAIV on day 1 (Supplementary Table 1). Five DEGs functioned as hubs on day 7 including TLR4, NEDD8, COPB1, USO1 and CCT2 (Fig. 3c).A deconvolution analysis into cell type proportions revealed no significant differences in cell composition in human milk or blood between the day 0, 1, and 7 timepoints or between vaccine type received. (Supplementary Table 1, FDR < 0.05). We evaluated the association between the top 100 cell type expressed genes from single cell data and DEGs. The upregulated DEGs in milk in response to LAIV on day 1 were significantly enriched with genes expressed by macrophages, monocytes and epithelial cells. In response to IIV on day 7, the upregulated DEGs were enriched with genes expressed by epithelial cells from matured secretory mammary epithelial cells (secMECs). No enrichment associated with a specific cell type was seen in response to IIV on day 1 (Supplementary Table 1).DiscussionIn this study, we combined gene expression profiling with antibody response quantification to identify key genes and pathways associated with reactogenicity and immunogenicity in human milk following mucosal or systemic influenza vaccination. Human milk is a highly immunologically dynamic, functional substance that actively adapts to antigenic stress28. We found significantly higher perturbation in human milk compared to blood following both types of vaccinations, suggesting a remarkable maternal investment in the defense of her young infant29. Both LAIV and IIV vaccines induced influenza-specific IgA that persisted for at least 6 months. Yet, the expressed genes and enriched pathways suggest that mucosal antigen introduction induces innate immunity pathways in human milk not seen after systemic vaccination.After mucosal vaccination, TLR4 was upregulated in milk and also found to be a hub for gene co-expression. Hubs have a high degree of centrality such that up or downregulation of the gene has a significant impact on downstream genes and vaccine outcome30. TLR4 plays a role in immediate innate recognition of microorganisms by modulating TNF alpha secretion through macrophage-like cells31. Viruses including RSV and SARS-CoV have been shown to activate TLR432. Influenza A has been shown to activate TLR4 through interaction with host damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)33,34. TLR4 agonists have been studied as adjuvants to be given with inactivated vaccines because of their ability to link the innate with the adaptive immune response and thereby induce robust and persistent antibody responses seen with live vaccines35. Additional upregulated DEGs in milk after LAIV on day 1 had roles in innate immunity (BST2, IFI-16)36,37, interference with viral replication (eIF2α, TRIM)38,39,40, or bridging the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system (IL-18, SPP1, NEDD8)41,42,43. Upregulation of type 1 interferon and B cell activation pathways were associated with higher IgA responses in human milk.In response to mucosal vaccination, we also found multiple upregulated genes in milk associated with the ATP synthesis pathways including the respiratory complex 1 which plays a central role in energy metabolism. Viruses have the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in host cells similar to the Warburg effect in cancer cells to generate ATP rapidly44,45. Targeting of complex I is important for maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. ATP can serve as a signaling molecule in the regulation of innate immune responses to viral infection46. Evaluation of the pathways using GSEA and co-expression analyses revealed that the host immune system appears to sense the influenza antigen as pattern recognition receptors and toll-like receptor pathways were both upregulated, likely leading to production of type 1 IFN. T cell signaling pathways are also upregulated. Mucosal vaccination triggered the mitochondrial and innate immune pathways earlier and stronger (day 1) compared to intramuscular vaccination which showed late and weak upregulation of these pathways on day 7.Strong induction of innate pathways with LAIV but not IIV likely resulted from live virus vaccination as well as mucosal introduction. LAIV mimics natural infection by replicating within the nasopharynx epithelial cells47. Furthermore, mucosal stimulation induces B cells that express mucosal homing molecules that enhance trafficking of memory immune T and B cells to various remote effectors sites48,49. Our data suggests that there is a similar communication with innate immunity between mucosal organs such that nasal viral mucosa stimulation upregulates innate pathways distally in human milk. Epithelial cells are an important source of cytokines that shape the response of recruited innate cells such as neutrophils and NK cells that coordinate local and distal responses50. Our data suggests that mammary epithelial cells contribute to the upregulated DEGs associated with innate immune responses, in addition to the macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes thought to infiltrate milk from blood. Previous studies have found that mammary epithelial cells are the first milk cells to respond during maternal infection and recruit other immune effectors51.The study has several limitations. The analyses focused on influenza-specific responses measured against the 2009 H1N1 influenza strain present in the vaccine across all study seasons; responses to other influenza strains in the vaccines are possible. Only transcriptional signatures were assessed rather than protein and cytokine measurement or cellular characterization via flow cytometry. There was a time gap in the conduct of the study and the analysis; this allowed for deeper data interrogation techniques with the advancement of bioinformatic methods. We did not assess for immune responses in the human milk-fed infant.In conclusion, mucosal vaccination results in a rapid upregulation of innate immune responses in human milk not seen with intramuscular vaccination, providing timely protection until the antigen-specific immunity develops. This may contribute to how human milk protects against mucosal infections in the human milk-fed infant. Nine intranasal vaccines are currently in clinical development to prevent infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with promising data in animal models52,53,54. LAIV is one of the few mucosally delivered vaccines; our findings likely apply to other mucosal vaccines and infections. The human milk responses are not only important for infant protection but also provide a window into mucosal responses delivered elsewhere, extending findings previously described in blood47.MethodsStudy participantsHealthy mothers were recruited at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center (HPMC), Los Angeles, California during the influenza seasons between 2011 and 2016. Mothers of healthy infants born at ≥35 weeks’ gestation and under 6 months of age at enrollment who had not received influenza vaccine during the current influenza season were eligible for enrollment and randomization to receive LAIV or IIV post-partum. The institutional review boards at CHLA and HPMC approved the study; informed consent was obtained from all mothers.At the initial study visit, study personnel interviewed mothers to collect clinical data including basic demographics, pregnancy history, and immunization history. We recorded mother and infant health and infant feeding characteristics at each visit using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap Consortium, Vanderbilt, Tennessee, USA) database. We obtained maternal blood and milk on days 0 (prior to vaccination), 1, 7, 30, 90 and 180. Samples were stored at −80 °C until further processing.Hemagglutination inhibition assayInfluenza HA-specific HAI titers were measured in serum. Reference sera and donor plasma were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken Co., Ltd., United Kingdom), and serial 2-fold dilutions of the pretreated and inactivated serum (1:40) were incubated with a standardized amount, or 4 agglutinating doses (4AD HA units), of the designated influenza virus for 1 h at room temperature to allow antigen-antibody binding. An equal volume of 0.5% chicken red blood cell suspension was then added to the mixture. HAI titers were determined after incubation for 30 min at room temperature as the reciprocal of the highest plasma dilution that completely inhibited hemagglutination. Reference sera used as controls included A/California/04/2009 (H1N1).Human milk IgA quantitationIgA was quantified in human milk at baseline and post-vaccination time points using the Human IgA ELISA development kit (MabTech 3860-1AD-6). Samples were tested in duplicate. Samples that showed more than twofold variation in final concentration within each replicate were retested. The influenza specific endpoint was determined using detergent lysed concentrated, purified whole virus preparation of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) (CA04). Normalized CA04 titers refers to the CA04-specific endpoint titer divided by the total IgA.RNA extraction and Transcriptomic analysisWe compared gene expression profiles in blood and human milk at days 1 and 7 after vaccination to baseline profiles prior to vaccination55,56. RNA was extracted from whole blood and milk samples using Maxwell® Simply RNA purification kit (Promega). RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The NuGEN Ovation system was used to amplify the RNA from all samples. The mRNA transcripts were profiled using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at the CHLA Genomics Core Laboratory. Signal intensities for the probe selection regions (PSR) were quantile normalized by robust multichip averaging. The expression signals from the 1.4 million PSRs were summarized into 17,880 transcripts that correspond to known or predicted genes. The gene symbol for each probe was obtained from the annotation Affy_huex_1_0_st_v2. Probes that matched the same gene symbol were collapsed, and the one with the lowest P value was selected. Gene expression fold-change was calculated for each time point in a subject-wise manner and a sample perturbation score was obtained summing the gene expression (absolute values) of all perturbed genes (log2 fold change >1 or <−1) and values were normalized by the number of perturbed genes per sample. Differential expression analysis for vaccine groups between day 1 and day 7 from baseline was conducted using the Limma R package v3.40.657.Publicly available data used for LAIV and IIV Blood comparisonPBMCs or whole blood microarray data from young adults were collected from GEO and processed as described by de Lima, Cardozo and colleagues58. Studies data are available to download at GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/).Gene over-representation and enrichment analysisFor the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), the log2[fold-change] gene expression was calculated for each time point in a subject-wise manner for blood and human milk samples. The fold-change for each participant was used as a pre-ranked gene list. Enrichment analysis was performed using fgsea Bioconductor package BTM59,60 and GO Biological Process 201861 were used as gene sets for blood and human milk expression respectively. Redundant GO pathways collapsed using coverage of the gene set of 50%62.Analysis of gene co-expression modules and networksTo analyze gene co-expression modules, the log2[fold-change] gene expression in human milk was calculated for each time point in a subject-wise manner and analyzed using the Co-Expression Modules identification Tool (CEMiTool) Bioconductor package63. All parameters were left as default except for apply_vst = F and force_beta = T (for day 7). Module networks were created using InnateDB curated Protein-Protein Interactions64.Correlation between gene/pathway expression and IgATo identify signatures associated with immunogenicity, individual pairwise log2-transformed gene expression data (days 1 and 7 post-vaccination) and normalized enrichment score (NES) from GO Biological Process were correlated with influenza-specific IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody titers in human milk (determined at days 30, 90 and 180 post-vaccination) using Spearman correlation. Effect sizes of gene expression and antibody titer correlation analyses obtained in single cohorts were subsequently integrated using the random-effects models for meta-analyses, as implemented in the metafor R package65. For the correlation-based analyses, sampling variances of Spearman Correlation Coefficient (SCCs) from each cohort were estimated using the escalc function. To estimate the summarized effect sizes, SCCs and variances were submitted to the rma function using Hunter and Schmidt (HS). Studies were weighted by the inverse of variance.Cell composition profilingThe deconvolution of bulk gene expression data into cell type proportions was conducted using CIBERSORTx66. Bulk whole blood microarray data was deconvoluted using the default LM22 cell type signature matrix, quantile normalization and 500 permutations for significance analysis. Human milk bulk data was deconvoluted using the reannoted single cell collected from GEO (accession number GSE153889)67, S-Mode batch normalization and 500 permutations for significance analysis. Single-cell analysis was performed using Seurat R package v4.1.068. Genes expressed in less than 3 cells and cells with less than 200 detected genes were removed. Gene expression for each cell was normalized based on total expression and log transformed. Highly variable genes were identified by variance stabilizing transformation (vst) method, and principal component analysis was performed in the Seurat R package. SingleR v1.8.169 was employed to annotate cell clusters. The package utilizes pre-annotated reference samples with known annotations to assign those annotations based on similarities in their expression profiles. We used Human Primary Cell Atlas70 as reference to annotate cell clusters.Statistical analysisData were analyzed using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp), GraphPad Prism version 7.0 and R statistical program v3.5.3 (2019).

(By Peter Somerville )abc.net.auews/pindarri-poultry-fine-for-avian-influenza-breach-lethbridge/101170478Link copiedShareShare articleA Victorian poultry company has been fined over a biosecurity breach that led to Agriculture Victoria euthanasing almost 9,000 turkeys in 2020.Key points:Victorian authorities battled a large avian influenza outbreak in 2020It spread from Lethbridge to Bairnsdale in a shipment of turkeysPindarri Poultry and an employee were fined for breaching control ordersPindarri Poultry and employee Glenn Canning appeared before Magistrate Peter Mellas in the Geelong Magistrates Court today.They pleaded guilty to breaching the Livestock Disease Control Act.The company was fined $3,500 and Mr Canning $1,000. The legislation allowed for a maximum fine of approximately $9,000.The charges stem from a load of more than 700 turkeys trucked from within a restricted area at Lethbridge during Victoria's avian influenza outbreak in July 2020.Costly clean-upThe turkeys were taken to Bairnsdale, and birds across both properties were later found to be infected with avian influenza.Mr Mellas said the company had suffered a financial loss as a result of the outbreak. However, "significant" taxpayer funds had also been expended in clean-up efforts.The court heard a total of almost 9,000 turkeys and 2,000 chickens were euthanised due to the outbreak. The birds were said to be worth $1.2 million.It heard Agriculture Victoria spent $650,000 on the clean-up, not including the cost of staff labour."The conduct here and the consequences of what occurred have been significant," he said, explaining the company's fine."They've led to the euthanasing of animals, significant public expense and potentially what could have been significant disruption to the market."(It) led not to not only the fact the disease was not able to be contained to Lethbridge, but to the spread of it."Messages did not get throughMr Mellas described the company's actions as a "moderately serious" example of the offence.The court heard Agriculture Victoria attempted to contact Pindarri Poultry to notify them of the control and restriction areas. However, Pindarri did not get the messages."I would like to think … employees have now either been trained or instructed so as to ensure messages from the ag department get through," Mr Mellas said.Mr Canning was fined because although "his lack of knowledge that the prohibition had been issued may have been honest, it was not reasonable in the circumstances".Costs totalling $211 were awarded to the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions.Get the latest rural newsVisit ABC Rural for agriculture and mining news, including weather and the marketsSign up for Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, in your inbox every Friday, or for Rural news daily.

At the beginning of June, there was a visit to the emergency room but no hospitalization. The activity of the flu is stable but at a high level, notes the ARS which thus passes the territory into the pre-epidemic phase. In Saint-Barth, there is no case. In Guadeloupe, the number of estimated cases is 1720 including 2 serious cases. 47 visits to the emergency room were recorded, including four hospitalizations.

This version of bird flu has hit the poultry industry hard, with culls and indoor housing measures enforced.While the risk to humans is low, in 2021, there was a confirmed human case, external of the strain in South West England. There have now been more than 120 outbreaks in farmed poultry and wild bird populations.This winter's outbreak of avian flu is the largest and longest ever in the UK.Scientists do not yet fully understand why these outbreaks have been worse than in previous years.H5N1 was first identified in southern China in 1996 in domestic waterfowl.The World Health Organisation says that between 2003 and March 2022 there have been 864 cases of - and 456 deaths from - H5N1 human infection in 18 countries.The new UK consortium will examine what measures are needed "to prevent future spill-overs of influenza with pandemic potential into humans." The Â£1.5m is allocated over one year.The researchers will also be tasked with finding out why the current virus strain has led to a longer outbreak and why some birds, such as ducks, are resistant to some strains. They will look at how gaps in biosecurity may have allowed the virus to transmit from wild birds to farmed poultry.Globally, vaccines against bird flu in people are being developed in case a more aggressive strain jumps from poultry into the human population.The UK consortium will not be involved in human vaccine development.But the government's top animal virologist, Professor Ian Brown, Head of Virology at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), which leads the consortium, told BBC News: "There are vaccine candidates prepared against all these emerging strains in poultry should one of them make that successful jump to humans."They are changing on an almost continuous basis. The concern is that we want to make sure they don't change into a form that is more infectious to humans. "That doesn't look plausible at the moment ... but we have to be watchful."Public spending watchdog the National Audit Office said last week that the poor state of APHA's main laboratory in Weybridge could undermine the fight against animal diseases like bird flu and that delays to its rebuild could limit the UK's response to another disease outbreak.The government said it was taking steps to secure the facility's future.Image source, Phill CrawleyImage caption, Phill Crawley believes no-one could have predicted the scale of the outbreakThe news of the research was welcomed by Leicestershire egg producer and packer Phill Crawley. His farm of 550,000 hens was hit by bird flu in November - 90% of birds in one shed died within four days; the rest had to be culled."I have never ever seen anything like it. The APHA were overwhelmed by it. I am not dissing them on that - this has been the largest outbreak the country has ever seen. I don't honestly believe anyone could have prepped themselves for an outbreak of this magnitude," he told BBC News.He added that he wanted the new consortium to answer some key questions about the outbreak."Previously it has been more broiler-oriented, i.e. meat chicken as opposed to (egg) layers, but what has made this strain more prevalent in the layer industry? How does the virus spread? This season, why has it been so persistent? Why has it been so long? Why has it been so brutal this year?" The consortium brings together microbiologists, epidemiologists, virologists and genomics specialists from APHA, The Pirbright Institute, the Royal Veterinary College, The Roslin Institute, Imperial College London and the universities of Cambridge, Leeds and Nottingham.The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, said it would increase the speed and quality of research "hopefully in time to reduce the impact on the poultry sector".More on this storyAnimal disease lab 'no longer fit for purpose'Published15 June 2022People warned not to touch dead seabirdsPublished14 June 2022Call for urgent response to bird flu outbreakPublished8 June 2022Human case of bird flu detected in the UKPublished6 January 2022Top storiesStarmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with MacronPublished3 minutes agoHouse vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsarPublished1 hour agoEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south dividePublished2 hours agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south divideâCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Energy smart meter issues creating north-south divide2House vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsar3Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron4Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'5âCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâ6âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director7Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards8Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale9Starmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with Macron10Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacksBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

Christmas cheer delivered all year! Margaret BartlettPublished: June 24, 2022 at 7:42 amEight leading UK laboratories are now joining forces to find new ways to battle bird flu, following devastating large-scale outbreaks of the H5N1 strain. Headed by the research team at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), this major new consortium brings together top scientists from eight organisations. With £1.5million of funding from the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), it has been tasked with developing strategies to manage and contain the virus, following the largest and longest outbreak ever experienced in the UK. Microbiologists, epidemiologists, virologists and genomics specialists from the Royal Veterinary College, The Pirbright Institute, The Roslin Institute and Imperial College London are among the scientists taking part. This recent outbreak of H5N1 has caused widespread death and severe illness of birds in the poultry industry, as well as wild bird populations. Brought to these shores by migrating geese in the autumn, the virus passed to flocks of hens and chickens, and from November 2021 until May this year, compulsory housing measures meant poultry farms were forced to confine birds indoors for their safety. Over 2.3 million birds were culled on UK poultry farms last winter, causing significant damage to rural economies, reported Countryfile presenter John Craven on this website in March.Eight leading laboratories are joining forces to find a solution for avian influenza/Credit:Getty Outbreaks are still being recorded, with the most recent case this week. On 21 June, DEFRA declared a 3km Controlled Zone around a premises in Guestling Green in East Sussex. All the captive birds on the site will be humanely culled. The toll on the UK’s wild bird population is high, and the virus is spreading from geese to seabirds and other wildfowl. On just one day in May this year, ecologist and wildlife photographer Peter Stronach found over 70 dead and dying birds of 17 species, including shelducks and gulls, at Loch Fleet National Nature Reserve, on the east coast of Scotland. Over half the carcasses found in the reserve later tested positive for bird flu. While the risk of transmission to humans is extremely low – with only one confirmed case in England in 2021 – the new consortium will research how containing the disease in birds can help reduce future risk to humans. This will include mapping the spread of infection across species; why some birds, such as ducks, are more resistant to the virus; and exactly how it spreads from wild birds to farmed poultry. “This will feed rapidly into government decision-making and new strategies to protect the poultry industry and reduce the risk of future transmission to humans,” says Professor Melanie Welham, executive chair of BBSRC. The British Poultry Council welcomes the new research project, saying it comes at a crucial time. Chief executive Richard Griffiths adds: “This been the toughest, most challenging avian influenza season ever. Businesses continue to feel the commercial impact of trade barriers deriving from bird flu and Brexit combined. We hope this research will put mechanisms in place to tackle future outbreaks that risk disruption to food supply chains. In the meantime, we, as ever, urge vigilance amongst all poultry keepers. Excellent biosecurity must be practised at all times.” When you are by the coast or in the countryside, remember not to touch dead or visibly sick birds. If you come across three or more dead wild waterfowl – swans, geese or ducks – gulls or birds of prey, or five or more dead birds of any species, report them to the DEFRA helpline: 03459 335577.
