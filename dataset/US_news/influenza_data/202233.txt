We sought to identify conserved and essential RNA secondary structures within IAV’s genome that are predicted to have greater constraints on mutation in response to therapeutic targeting. We identified and genetically validated an RNA structure (packaging stem–loop 2 (PSL2)) that mediates in vitro packaging and in vivo disease and is conserved across all known IAV isolates. A PSL2-targeting locked nucleic acid (LNA), administered 3 d after, or 14 d before, a lethal IAV inoculum provided 100% survival in mice, led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a tenfold lethal inoculum, evaded attempts to select for resistance and retained full potency against neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus. Use of an analogous approach to target SARS-CoV-2, prophylactic administration of LNAs specific for highly conserved RNA structures in the viral genome, protected hamsters from efficient transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 USA_WA1/2020 variant. These findings highlight the potential applicability of this approach to any virus of interest via a process we term ‘programmable antivirals’, with implications for antiviral prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy.

Current antiviral therapies target viral proteins that frequently mutate, rendering many such therapies inadequate1,2,3. Despite a breadth of knowledge about the viral lifecycle, knowledge of the RNA secondary structure of the genome is limited. Research on other RNA viruses has revealed genomic RNA to be capable of playing many important roles in viral lifecycles beyond merely encoding amino acid sequences, suggesting that viral RNA structural elements could be promising therapeutic targets4,5. To the extent that these RNA structural elements are both essential and highly conserved, these features could reduce the degree of freedom for mutations that are compatible with virus function. This, in turn, could translate into a high barrier for resistance to therapeutics designed to disrupt these RNA structures. In IAV, genome packaging is one such critical juncture in which RNA structure might serve a central function.The IAV genome consists of eight single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) segments that encode a minimum of 14 known viral proteins6. The vRNA, together with nucleoprotein (NP) and the heterotrimeric polymerase complex, comprising PB2, PB1 and PA proteins, forms the complete viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP)7. To be fully infectious, IAV virions must incorporate at least one of each segment’s vRNP8. The current paradigm supports a selective packaging method whereby the eight vRNPs are selected in a hierarchal manner mediated by unique, segment-specific packaging signals present in the terminal and central coding regions of each vRNA that allow for discrimination between the latter9,10,11. Each vRNP interacts with at least one other partner vRNP to form a supramolecular complex12 probably maintained by intersegment RNA–RNA and/or protein–RNA interactions hypothesized to guide the packaging process8,13. The mechanism mediating this selection and arrangement is, however, poorly understood. Curiously, packaging signals exist in regions of high nucleotide conservancy that strongly suppress synonymous codon usage14,15,16. Conservation of the primary sequence beyond what is required for protein coding suggests the potential for maintenance of RNA structures possessing biological functionalities. Certain synonymous mutations within the polymerase gene, PB2, affect not only its own packaging, but also the incorporation of other segments11,14,17.We hypothesized that PB2’s dominant role in the packaging process might be facilitated by nonprotein elements encoded by the PB2 vRNA, including structured RNA elements. To test this hypothesis, we first mapped the RNA secondary structure within PB2 that mediates packaging, and then genetically validated this structure’s role in the viral lifecycle in vitro and IAV pathogenesis in vivo. With this model, we demonstrate proof of concept for a new class of antiviral therapeutics that can efficiently disrupt packaging and prevent and treat otherwise lethal IAV disease in vivo, as well as enable the development of strong functional immunity in mice, with a high barrier to resistance. Moreover, we hypothesized that an analogous approach can be applied to any RNA virus of interest, and the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic provided an opportunity for us to successfully test this hypothesis by targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro and in vivo.ResultsSHAPE identifies conserved candidate PB2 packaging signalTo search for structured RNA domains in IAV segments, we first applied selective 2′-hydroxylacylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE)18 and computational modeling to IAV segment PB2 genomic vRNA. In vitro transcribed, full-length (−)-sense PB2 vRNA from strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) PR8 was folded in solution19 and interrogated using an electrophilic SHAPE reagent that preferentially reacts with nucleotides existing in flexible, single-stranded states18 (Fig. 1). This analysis revealed that much of the 2,341-nucleotide (nt) vRNA is largely unstructured (Supplementary Fig. 1a), as described in previous genome analyses15,20. However, these previous studies did not analyze the last 80 nucleotides of PB2’s terminal coding regions. SHAPE-guided modeling suggested several areas in this terminal region that contain stable RNA secondary structures, most notably a stem–loop motif, named herein as PSL2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b; nucleotides 34–87). This region includes a set of nucleotides that were previously implicated in segment PB2 packaging through mutational analysis via an unidentified mechanism (Fig. 1a,b, see circled nucleotides, and Supplementary Table 1)11,14,16. Supporting the hypothesis that these prior mutations act through disruption of PSL2 structure, SHAPE analysis of the mutants yielded different conformations that all abrogated the wild-type (WT) PSL2 structure (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2). The 60-nt region encompassing PSL2 displays almost 100% sequence conservation at the single-nucleotide level between representative seasonal and pandemic IAV strains of different subtypes and species origins (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Further analysis revealed that this high degree of conservation extends to all known IAV isolates available in public databases (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggesting the existence of a strict biological requirement to maintain an intact PSL2 structure. Indeed, the PSL2 stem–loop structure was recovered in SHAPE-guided modeling of full-length PB2 RNA across diverse species and subtypes, including the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and pandemic 1918 H1N1 strains (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1: SHAPE-determined RNA secondary structures of WT PB2 and packaging mutant vRNAs.SHAPE-chemical mapping was performed on full-length (−)-sense PB2 vRNAs.

Mutate-and-map (M2) analysis couples systematic mutagenesis with high-throughput chemical mapping to produce accurate basepair inferences and interactions of RNA domains21. By sequentially mutating RNA one nucleotide at a time with its Watson–Crick complement and measuring the impact that this mutagenesis has on chemical reactivity, pair-wise correlations between close and distant residues can be established. First, M2 measurements confirmed disruption of the chemical reactivity pattern on systematic mutation of each PSL2 stem residue, including changes at nucleotides previously identified to be relevant for PB2 packaging (Fig. 2; see noted fields)11,14. Automated computational analysis based on these M2 data recovered the SHAPE-guided PSL2 structure with high confidence (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3), further validating our structural model. Second, as predictive tests, we designed compensatory mutations to restore basepairings—albeit not the native sequence—in the WT structure that were disrupted by the initial packaging-defective mutations (Supplementary Fig. 4). These mutation–rescue variants restored the PSL2 SHAPE pattern, providing in vitro validation of the modeled structure at basepair resolution and suggesting sequence variants to test the role of PSL2 structure in vivo.Fig. 2: Two-dimensional M2 analysis and empirical validation of the PSL2 motif.a, Systematic single-nucleotide mutation and mapping of resulting chemical accessibility reveals interactions in the three-dimensional structure of the RNA.

Values are given as percentage of PB2 vRNA packaging relative to WT PR8 virus. The results are from three independent experiments (n = 3), with assays performed in triplicate. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.0005; NS, not significant. e, Virus titer determined by plaque assay. Results are expressed in p.f.u. ml−1, with plaque assays in triplicate (n = 3). ****P < 0.0001, ***P = 0.0009, **P = 0.0149. All error bars represent mean ± s.d. All statistical analyses were performed by ordinary one-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test against WT computed in GraphPad Prism 9 software.Full size imageTo test whether the PSL2 stem–loop structure observed in solution was relevant to virus packaging in the cellular milieu, the same nine synonymous mutations reported by Gog et al. and Marsh et al. (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1), as well as four new synonymous mutations characterized by M2 analysis (Fig. 2a,b), were cloned into plasmids containing the PR8 PB2 gene11,14,16. The packaging efficiencies of the nine previously known mutants, now in the PR8 background, were comparable to those originally described in the WSN33 virus11 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Of these, mutants m55c, m757, m745 and m744b were predicted to show the most notable impairment based on their location within PSL2’s stem regions (Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, published mutations that have no effect on PB2 packaging (for example, m731) mapped to the unstructured apical loop or fell outside of PSL2 and did not alter its structural integrity (Supplementary Fig. 5a), whereas mutations with minor effects on virus packaging showed only minor alterations to the structure (Supplementary Fig. 5b)11. The three new synonymous mutants (m74-1, m74-2 and m68) identified by M2 analysis as having a substantial effect on in vitro PSL2 structure (Fig. 2a, see green-marked nucleotides) showed significant loss in PB2 WT-like packaging efficiency levels (Fig. 2b). The strong correlation of structure disruption with in cellulo packaging efficiency observed across these mutants supports a role of PSL2 structure in virus packaging.Compensatory mutations restore PSL2 structure and functionTo investigate the functional role of PSL2 in IAV genome packaging, compensatory mutations designed to restore the WT stem–loop structure destroyed by the packaging-defective mutations (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4) were cloned into PR8 expression plasmids to generate mutant rescue viruses. The compensatory mutations rescued not only the virus packaging for segment PB2 (Fig. 2d), but also other segments previously reported to be affected by the deleterious mutations, consistent with the proposed hierarchal role of PB2 in IAV packaging (Supplementary Fig. 6a)10,11,17. In addition to recovering PB2 packaging, the compensatory mutations gave complete or near-complete rescue of the virus titer loss caused by the defective mutations (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Some nonsynonymous compensatory mutations were able to restore PB2 packaging better than others (for example, m745-comp compared with m757-comp). This possibly reflects incomplete restoration of PB2 protein function through exogenous addition (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 6) because, for nonsynonymous mutations, we also expressed WT PB2 protein to mitigate the possibility of any impairment in PB2 protein function.We performed computational enumeration and multidimensional mutation–rescue22 (M2R) experiments to identify additional successful PSL2-defective and compensatory mutant pairs (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Successful M2R was defined when each single mutation alone disrupted the SHAPE-mapped WT PSL2 structure, while the double compensatory mutations recovered its structure (Fig. 3a,b, see boxed electropherograms). Although most successful partners required nonsynonymous changes, we discovered a single M2R pair of synonymous substitutions that obviated WT PB2 protein addition (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Fig. 7). Making each mutation alone (m52 and m65) resulted in severe packaging defects and, in the case of the m52 mutation, virus titer loss exceeding 4log10—an extreme impairment beyond the 1–2log10 that had been previously reported11,14 for packaging-defective viruses (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 8). When introduced together into a doubly mutated m52/65-compensatory virus that restored PSL2 structure, albeit with an altered sequence, the compensatory mutations restored both packaging efficiency and virus titer to WT levels.Fig. 3: Mutate–map–rescue analysis reveals new PB2 packaging-defective and compensatory mutant partners.a, Electropherograms from systematic single-nucleotide mutation SHAPE chemical mapping with rescue (mutate–map–rescue)21 analysis of individual and compensatory double mutations to test basepairings from 1D data-guided models and to identify predicted successful synonymous PSL2-defective and compensatory mutant pairs. Chemical accessibilities are plotted in gray scale (black = highest SHAPE reactivity), across 59 single mutations at single-nucleotide resolutions of the PSL2 element from the PR8 strain segment PB2. Reactivity peaks (left to right) correspond to nucleotides from the 5′- to the 3′-end of the PB2 RNA (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for a complete set of M2R pairs). b, Electropherogram of successful double synonymous mutant pair determined by the mutate–map–rescue analysis. c, Mutational design of single mutants m52 (G52U) and m65 (C65A), and the double m52/65-comp rescue pair on the PSL2 structure. d, Packaging efficiency of the synonymous single and double-mutant M2R pair.

Results represent two independent experiments with biological duplicates performed in technical triplicate (n = 4), except for m65 performed in biological triplicate (n = 6).

All error bars represent mean ± s.d. Statistics and graphs for all figures were generated in GraphPad Prism 9 software.Full size imageTo ensure that any loss or subsequent rescue of virus production caused by these mutations was not due to defects in replication or translation, each M2R pair was tested in transfection-based replicon assays. All mutant PB2 proteins and vRNAs were produced at comparable WT levels (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). As an orthogonal means of testing packaging efficiency, we also assessed the effect of select mutations on vRNA packaging by denaturing RNA gel, which recapitulated our earlier packaging findings (Supplementary Fig. 11c, Figs. 2d and 3d, and Supplementary Fig. 6).To test the relevance of the PSL2 structure in an in vivo model, BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with either WT or mutant PR8 viruses harboring point mutations predicted to disrupt or restore PSL2 structure. Mice infected with the PSL2-disrupting mutations—m745 mutant strain (20% packaging efficiency) or the severely defective mutant virus, m52 (<4% packaging efficiency)—showed reduced or no clinical signs of illness, respectively, either in weight loss or in survival compared with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control (Fig. 3f,g). In contrast, inclusion of compensatory mutations that restore the PSL2 structure rescued virus pathogenicity: animals infected with m52/65-comp and m745-comp displayed comparable mortality profiles to mice infected with WT PR8 (Fig. 3f,g). To the best of our knowledge, these are probably among the first data to indicate that packaging-defective viruses are attenuated in vivo and a genomic IAV RNA secondary structure mediates influenza disease progression.Designing anti-IAV LNA therapeutics targeting the PSL2 structureGiven the strong evolutionary conservation of the PSL2 structure (Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Fig. 1c,d), we postulated that PSL2-targeted therapeutics could possess broad-spectrum activity across IAV subtypes and strains. Nine antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) with modified LNA bases23 were designed against PSL2 to disrupt various regions of the overall RNA secondary structure (Fig. 4a). Two LNAs, LNA8 and LNA9, are identical in sequence to LNA6 and LNA7, respectively, but possess six or seven unmodified (nonlocked) DNA nucleotide ‘gapmers’ optimized for RNase-H activation that can degrade RNA in RNA–DNA hybrids24. First, to assess the impact that LNA binding has on PSL2 RNA secondary structure, toeprinting and SHAPE chemical mapping were performed on PB2 vRNA in the presence of the LNAs. Sequences encoded in LNA6–LNA9, corresponding to binding sites on the right 3′-side of the stem–loop structure (Fig. 4a), exhibited the greatest ability to bind and disrupt the WT PSL2 structure (Supplementary Fig. 12).Fig. 4: LNAs targeting PSL2 RNA structure display potent antiviral activity in vitro.a, Regions of PSL2 targeted by indicated LNAs. b, Antiviral screen of LNAs transfected into MDCK cells and infected 4 h later with PR8 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) virus (0.01 MOI) and viral titers determined 48 h post-infection (n = 3).

The EC50 values were computed using a nonlinear regression model with variable slope. Statistics for all graphs performed in GraphPad Prism 9 software. All error bars represent mean ± s.d. *Statistical P value is indicated in each panel.Full size imageTo test LNA-mediated targeting of PSL2 across different viral subtypes, Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were treated with LNA before infection with either PR8 (H1N1) virus or the tissue-culture-adapted A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (HK68) (H3N2) virus, and virus inhibition was assessed by plaque assay (Fig. 4b). As predicted by the mutational and LNA chemical-mapping experiments (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 12), LNAs directed against only the top loop of PSL2 (LNA1, LNA4), and LNAs solely targeting the 3′-base of PSL2 (for example, LNA3 and LNA5) had minimal effect on viral titer. In contrast, nucleotide coverage of both the top loop and the middle bulge by LNA6 resulted in >2log10 titer deficits for PR8 (Fig. 4a,b). LNA8, the RNase-H-activated copy of LNA6, produced even greater antiviral activity against both viruses of up to 3log10. Notably, LNA9, the RNase-H-activated copy of LNA7, possessed the strongest antiviral capacity, inhibiting virus production by over 4log10 and 3log10 against PR8 and HK68, respectively. Although a labeled version of LNA9 could be clearly visualized in cells harboring vRNPs (Supplementary Fig. 13), no off-target effect of LNA9 on steady-state levels of viral protein, vRNA, complementary RNA or cellular toxicity after 24 h was observed (Supplementary Fig. 14).Having identified a potent candidate LNA, we next investigated the treatment time-course and concentration parameters of LNA9’s antiviral activity when administered prophylactically at 2 and 4 h pre-infection, and therapeutically at 2 and 4 h post-infection. Cells pretreated with the LNA had the most potent antiviral response (<4log10) and displayed strong virus inhibition even at the lowest concentration tested (1 nM) (Fig. 4c). There was a trend toward decreasing antiviral activity as the time of administration post-infection increased, but, even at the latest tested time point of addition, >2log10 suppression of viral titer was achieved. Similar efficacy was seen in the presence of a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, LNA9 treatment resulted in a dramatic loss of PB2 packaging compared with controls (Fig. 4d), an effect that resembled the mutational studies and extended to the 2009 pandemic virus (pH1N1) and 2012 H3N2 virus, indicating the potential for broad-spectrum antiviral activity.Selection of IAV variants with escalating drug pressureTo test the hypothesis that the high conservation of PSL2 reflects a biological constraint against mutation of this structure, and that this could translate into a high barrier to the development of resistance for PSL2-targeting therapeutics, we determined the susceptibility of WT PR8 virus to LNA9 under conditions designed to promote the development of resistance over serial virus passaging (Fig. 4f). In parallel, we performed analogous experiments using the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir carboxylate (OSLT, Tamiflu). After seven virus passages in the presence of escalating drug concentrations, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of OSLT increased from 4.1 nM to 100 µM—a >20,000-fold increase (Fig. 4g). In comparison, after ten virus passages in the presence of LNA9, the EC50 value showed no significant change and remained in the range 16–22 pM (Fig. 4f). To date, we still have been unable to select for viral mutations capable of generating resistance to LNA9. Moreover, LNA9 was equally effective (EC50 = 18 pM) against a virus strain (A/WSN/33 (H1N1)) containing the H275Y mutation (N1 numbering system) that confers resistance to OSLT, whereas high-level resistance to OSLT was confirmed, with an EC50 of 53 μM (Fig. 4h,i). These results extend the therapeutic capabilities of LNA9 and provide strong support for potential treatment of NAI-resistant viruses with PSL2-targeting LNAs.PSL2-targeted LNAs protect mice from lethal IAV infectionsAs a proof of concept to assess the in vivo efficacy of prophylactic LNA treatment against PSL2, BALB/c mice were intranasally administered a single 20-μg dose of LNA9 or scrambled (Scr.) LNA 1 or 3 d before infection with a lethal dose of PR8 virus. The untreated control mice experienced dramatic weight loss and were humanely sacrificed by days 5 and 6. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of LNA9 was completely protective when administered 1 d, and even 3 d, before viral infection (Fig. 5a) and showed significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs (>2.5log10 virus reduction) compared with the Scr. LNA control at 72 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 16). In addition to the well-known benefits of LNA antisense gapmer technology that enables recruitment of RNase-H to degrade the targeted RNA23,24, LNA ASOs have also been reported to show dramatic, long-lasting effects (even >1 month) after the last administered dose in a variety of disease models25,26,27,28. We hypothesized that PSL2-targeted LNAs might similarly possess long-term prophylactic effects due to the nuclease-resistant property conferred by the phosphorthioate backbone present in LNAs.Fig. 5: PSL2-targeted LNAs demonstrate potent antiviral activity in vivo.a,b, Kaplan–Meier survival plots of mice intranasally administered a single dose of LNA9, Scr.

Error bars show mean ± s.d. m, Kaplan–Meier survival plot of mice (n = 10 per group) infected with a lethal dose of PR8, followed 3 d later with a single intravenous dose of 30 μg of LNA14, LNA9, Scr.

LNA (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 4) on day +3 post-infection. Mice given OSLT (n = 5) were treated by oral gavage twice daily for 5 d starting at day +3: Kaplan–Meier survival curve (n); percentage of day 0 weight (o); and clinical score (p). All studies were performed with 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice. Error bars in o and p indicate mean ± s.e.m.Full size imageTo test this hypothesis, we administered a single, increased dose of LNA9 (30 μg) 1 week (day −7) before infection with a lethal dose of IAV. Although 100% of untreated mice succumbed to the infection, 70% of the LNA9 1-week pretreatment group were protected from lethality (Fig. 5b). To determine whether our therapeutics could be further optimized for improved efficacy, we explored targeting other sequences in PSL2. Although LNA9 targets nucleotides in the lower 3′-stem of PSL2, our mutational analyses suggested the importance of the 52- to 65-nt pair in the upper stem (Fig. 3). We hypothesized that an LNA designed against these nucleotides (LNA14) might enhance efficacy (Fig. 4a). Indeed, SHAPE analysis indicated that LNA14 was an even more potent disruptor of PSL2 structure than LNA9 (Fig. 5c,d). In biological confirmation of this, mice treated with LNA14 were fully protected when given a single dose 1 week before infection with a lethal dose of IAV (Fig. 5e). When we increased the LNA dosage to 40 μg and administered a single LNA14 treatment to mice 2 weeks (day −14) before IAV infection, the mock-treated mice succumbed to infection between days 7 and 8 due to severe disease, whereas the entire LNA14-treated cohort survived, with significantly lower disease scores, indicative of minor-to-undetectable disease symptoms and reduced weight loss compared with controls (Fig. 5f–h and Supplementary Table 2).We attribute the LNAs’ antiviral effect to their direct binding of PSL2, as opposed to nonspecific activation of antiviral pathways. Indeed, LNA14, LNA9 or derivative molecules did not elicit activation of either interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes or the NF-κB (nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) pathway in lung or myeloid cells (Supplementary Fig. 17).Given the mild symptoms observed in LNA-treated and -protected mice, we hypothesized that the resulting highly attenuated infection might be sufficient to enable mice receiving prophylactic LNA treatment to develop an effective immunization against a secondary infection through production of immunity. To test this hypothesis, mice from the 1-week LNA14 pretreatment-surviving cohort (Fig. 5e) were challenged alongside age-matched, naive controls, 65 d post-primary infection with ten times the mouse lethal dose (10 LD100) of IAV (Fig. 5i). The secondary challenge had no effect on weight, clinical score or survival of mice from the LNA14 pretreatment group (a total of 72 d since treatment or 65 d since primary infection), whereas the age-matched controls presented with rapid disease and were humanely sacrificed by day 6 post-challenge infection (Fig. 5j–l). Blood and spleen cells were analyzed for the presence of virus-specific T cells and the development of antibodies against viral proteins (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b), which demonstrated stimulation of both the cellular and the humoral arms of the immune system, although their respective contributions to complete absence of symptoms after a tenfold higher lethal inoculum await definition.After demonstrating PSL2-targeted LNA efficacy in prophylactic models, we next tested its potential as a post-infection therapeutic. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms and illness in IAV infections, US Food and Drug Administration-approved IAV therapeutics are most challenged when administered after 48 h of disease onset29. In contrast, we hypothesized that anti-PSL2 LNAs, administered either intravenously or intranasally, could treat IAV well after an infection has been established. To test this hypothesis, mice infected with a lethal dose of PR8 virus were treated with LNA14, LNA9, Scr. LNA or vehicle control by intravenous injection 3 d post-infection (day +3) when mice typically become noticeably ill. Although animals treated with controls rapidly succumbed to the infection, 65% of mice treated with LNA9 survived lethal infection and all the LNA14-treated mice survived (Fig. 5m). Next, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of LNA14 via intranasal administration against the 2009 modern pandemic ‘swine’ virus (A/California/04/2009 pH1N1; CA09), which has since become a dominant seasonal strain worldwide. Mice were infected with a lethal dose of CA09, then given a single intranasal dose of LNA14, Scr. LNA or vehicle control 3 d post-infection. OSLT was used as a therapeutic control and administered by oral gavage twice daily for 5 consecutive days starting at 3 d post-infection. The virus was 100% lethal against the Scr. LNA and vehicle control mice, and only 2/7 OSLT-treated mice were protected from lethal disease (Fig. 5n,o). In comparison, 6/7 mice in the LNA14-treated group were protected from lethality and collectively had much lower clinical scores than the other cohorts (Fig. 5p). Sampling of lungs taken 2 d after LNA14 treatment of CA09-infected mice (that is, 5 d post-infection) showed significantly reduced virus titers (>6log10 virus reduction) compared with the controls (Supplementary Fig. 19). We also observed good dose proportionality in the lungs up to the highest dose tested to date (80 μg of LNA14) (Supplementary Fig. 20). Lowering the LNA14 dose down to 5 μg still resulted in full protection from death (Supplementary Fig. 21), whereas Scr. LNA offered no more protection than vehicle control.Programmable antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 RNA structuresWe hypothesized that we could leverage our approach to targeting IAV and similarly design potent LNAs against SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, we first performed sequence alignments of the entire 30-kb positive-sense RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 and related beta-coronaviruses to identify conserved sequence regions predicted to contain RNA secondary structures30. We then focused on highly conserved nucleotide stretches of sufficient length to enable antisense nucleotide attack, and a high probability of structural stability to identify promising candidate antiviral targets. SHAPE yielded high-resolution RNA secondary structure maps of these regions and guided LNA design. Highly conserved targets included a stem–loop structure near the end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (nt 28,743–28,792; Fig. 6a) and the structured domain spanning the terminal 5′-UTR into the ORF1-coding sequence (nt 258–276; Fig. 6b). LNAs were vetted for their ability to disrupt these structures by chemical mapping of the LNA–RNA interaction (Fig. 6c,d).Fig. 6: Antisense targeting of highly conserved RNA secondary structures in SARS-CoV-2.a,b, Two SHAPE reactivity-derived prediction of RNA secondary structures within (+)-sense SARS-CoV-2 vRNA and LNAs designed against these targets: nt 28,743–28,827, LNA-12.8 (a) and nt 258–276, LNA-14.3 (b). c,d, Electrophoretic profile of SHAPE analysis performed in the presence or absence of the corresponding LNAs. e, In vitro antiviral activity of 25 nM LNAs against SARS-CoV-2-Nluc virus in Huh-7 cells (n = 4). The nucleoside analog, EIDD-1931, was included as a positive control at 5 µM and 0.5 µM. f, LNA dose–response against SARS-CoV-2-Nluc virus in ACE2-TMPRSS2-Huh-7.5 cells, in biological replicates (n = 6–7 for all treatment groups, except for NT controls where n = 12). g,h, Virus titers of supernatant collected from A549-hACE2 cells treated with LNA or EIDD-1931 followed by infection with either WT SARS-CoV-2 (g) or a patient-isolated clinical variant of SARS-CoV-2 containing multiple mutations in the spike protein region, including Asp614Gly, Glu484Lys and Asn501Tyr present in variants of concern (n = 3) (h). Statistical analysis in e, f, g and h was performed using ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests between the controls as indicated. Error bars represent mean ± s.d.; P values are as indicated. i–k, Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Syrian hamsters: 10-week-old female Syrian hamsters were pretreated with either 100 µg of LNA-12.8 (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 4) on day −1 and day 0 before exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected sentinel hamsters for 2 h per day for 3 consecutive days. Four days after the initial exposure, lungs were harvested, and virus titers determined by CCID50 in triplicate: experimental timeline (i); virus titer of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs (two-sided, unpaired Student’s t-test) (j); and oropharyngeal swabs of LNA- or vehicle-treated hamsters (two-way ANOVA with multiple comparison tests against the vehicle controls) (k). The assay method detection limit is 0.7log10(CCID50). Error bars represent mean ± s.d. The panel i was created with BioRender.com.Full size imageThe LNAs were then screened against a SARS-CoV-2-Nluc reporter virus under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) conditions (Fig. 6e). The nucleoside analog, EIDD-1931 (ref. 31), was included as a positive control, and Scr. LNA and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treated and nontreated (NT) served as negative controls. Both LNAs against these target structures inhibited virus replication by as much as 3log10, with the 25 nM LNA-12.8 outperforming the 5 µM EIDD control by nearly 1log10 (Fig. 6e). Next, an LNA dose–response experiment with expanded replicates was performed in Huh-7.5 cells that were modified to overexpress the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors to enable more efficient virus replication32 (Fig. 6f). Indeed, the viral replication signal was enhanced by nearly 2.5log10 compared with Huh-7 cells in this system (Fig. 6e). Even at the higher virus burden, however, all tested LNA concentrations displayed statistically significant virus inhibition in a dose-dependent manner compared with the Scr. LNA controls and were nontoxic to the cells at concentrations 10× higher than the highest dose assayed for antiviral activity (Supplementary Fig. 22a). We next tested our LNAs against the fully intact WT SARS-CoV-2 virus in a lung epithelial cell line expressing hACE2-A549 (Fig. 6g), which confirmed the previous Nluc virus results, whereby LNA treatment displayed >3log10 (virus inhibition) for both LNAs at 100 nM and LNA-12.8 at 25 nM, and were nontoxic to cells tested up to 1 µM (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Fig. 22b).We next pretreated hACE2-A549 cells with LNAs and then infected them with a new SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/OH-UC-1/2020 ON642077) derived from a chronically infected cancer patient, whose sequence had evolved over a 7-month infection period (Fig. 6h). This clinical isolate harbors multiple mutations including Leu452Arg, Asp614Gly, Glu484Ala/Gln and Asn501Tyr in the spike protein receptor-binding domain shown to be involved in antibody escape, enhancement of virus replication and increased transmission found in variants of concern including alpha, beta, delta, mu and omicron33 (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#published-sars-cov-2-sequences) (Supplementary Table 3). Despite numerous mutations throughout the viral spike protein-coding region and elsewhere in the genome, the LNAs retained their high levels of potency against this variant: both 100 nM treatments, as well as the 25 nM LNA-12.8 treatment, demonstrated complete virus inhibition to the experimental limit of detection, equaling a 5log10 drop-in virus titer (Fig. 6h).Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, we sought to test the effectiveness of LNA treatment to prevent or mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a Syrian hamster model. In this system, hamsters were pretreated intranasally with a single 100 µg dose of our top SARS-CoV-2 LNA candidate, LNA-12.8, on 2 consecutive days, day −1 and day 0, before exposure to infected sentinel hamsters (Fig. 6i). Pretreated cohorts were repeatedly exposed to the infected sentinels for 2 h a day for 3 consecutive days. Daily oropharyngeal swabs were collected. Then 4 d post-initial exposure, lungs were collected and virus titers of LNA-12.8-treated versus vehicle-treated animals were compared (Fig. 6j). LNA-12.8 dramatically reduced viral titers by over 3log10 compared with vehicle in exposed animals, with two hamsters containing no detectable virus in their lungs (Fig. 6j). As shown in Fig. 6k, viral titers in the oropharyngeal swabs showed parallel reductions in response to LNA treatment to the viral titer reductions observed in the lungs, with all hamsters showing undetectable oropharyngeal viral titers by day 4. Collectively, our identification, design and targeting of highly conserved RNA secondary structures in IAV and SARS-CoV-2, are proof-of-principle evidence toward a new model of rapid and effective antiviral development.DiscussionWe describe in the present study the discovery and characterization of an RNA stem–loop structure, PSL2, that serves as a packaging signal for genome segment PB2. PSL2 is conserved across all known influenza A isolates. Knowledge of PSL2’s RNA secondary structure helps explain previously discovered packaging-defective mutations and enables rational design of more potently disrupting mutations. Compensatory mutations that restore PSL2’s structure (but not primary sequence) rescue virus packaging and titer loss in vitro and restore lethality in vivo, thus providing strong genetic validation of PSL2’s importance in influenza biology and disease. LNAs designed to disrupt PSL2 structure dramatically inhibit IAV in vitro against viruses of different strains and subtypes. In contrast to NAIs, such as OSLT, and the endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), which are vulnerable to drug-resistant mutations34,35,36, our PSL2-targeting LNAs exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance and are equally effective against WT and NAI-resistant viruses. In vivo, intranasal dosing of LNAs results in potent antiviral efficacy and prevents mortality in mice, even with a single dose administered 2 weeks before infection with a lethal IAV inoculum. Moreover, PSL2-targeting LNAs also enable the surviving mice to develop vigorous immunity. In therapeutic models, a single LNA dose given 3 d after infection provides complete protection from death. Together, these results have exciting implications for the development of a new class of pan-genotypic, anti-IAV therapies for prophylaxis of, treatment of established and ‘just-in-time’ universal vaccination against an IAV infection. In addition, because traditional vaccines take weeks to provide full protection, a co-administered single dose of LNA14 could provide protection during this vulnerability window.We envision several paths to the clinic for PSL2-targeted therapies like LNA14 against IAV, including aerosol delivery to outpatients or intravenous administration for severely ill hospitalized patients. Importantly, incorporating the virus’s RNA secondary structure into the LNA design allowed us to achieve far greater inhibition than ASOs designed against the same viral genomic sequence, but which relied only on primary nucleotide sequence homology for their design37.Although we initially focused on IAV, an analogous approach can be taken for virtually any virus of interest. Indeed, we were able to rapidly identify highly conserved RNA secondary structures in SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 30) and then design appropriate LNAs leveraging the lessons learned in targeting IAV—a process we now term ‘programable antivirals’. Our lead LNAs demonstrated greater in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 than the nucleoside analog-positive controls at 200× the LNA concentration. Moreover, the LNAs were highly effective against a clinical isolate harboring mutations that have been associated with decreased susceptibility to recent COVID-19 vaccines33, with titer reductions of up to 5log10 at 25 nM concentrations of LNA. Finally, our top anti-SARS-CoV-2 LNA exhibited profound in vivo activity by successfully decreasing and in some cases completely preventing virus transmission in hamsters. Limitations of our study include the very preliminary nature of the SARS-CoV-2 data and the need for further experiments, including assessment of therapeutic application of the LNA (which is the subject of another paper).Taken together, this programmable antiviral strategy now excitingly offers a highly adaptable potential solution to current and future viruses of concern, especially respiratory pandemic viruses. Their broad-spectrum potential can enable advanced stockpiling and prepositioning, with the ability to fill the void before a possible vaccine might be developed and deployed. Programmable antivirals can also offer protection against vaccine-resistant virus strains, as well as provide immediate protection during the months needed for vaccine-induced immunity to ramp up.MethodsCells and virusesHEK293T (CRL-1573), Vero E6 (CRL-1586) and MDCK-NLB-2 (CCL-34) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained according to ATCC instructions. A549-Dual (a549d-nfis) and THP1-Dual (thpd-nfis) were obtained from InvivoGen and maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All cell lines used in the present study were routinely checked for Mycoplasma contamination (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza) and were authenticated by the respective vendors. All cell lines used for SARS-CoV-2 experimentation, including Huh-7, ACE2-TMPRSS2-Huh-7.5 and ACE2-A549 cells, were maintained at 37 °C in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) and Hepes buffer (Gibco). The ACE2-A549 cells were specially engineered to overexpress the ACE2 receptor in human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), whereas the ACE2-TMPRSS2-Huh-7.5 cells were a kind gift of the Catherine Blish laboratory and engineered to overexpress both hACE2 and human TMPRSS2 receptors. A549-Dual and THP1-Dual cells were purchased from InvivoGen.WT influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) H1N1 virus (ATCC-VR-95) and the tissue-culture-adapted PR8 virus (ATCC-VR-1469) were purchased from ATCC. PR8 mutant viruses were generated using an eight-plasmid reverse genetic system as previously described38. Tissue-cultured adapted influenza A/Hong Kong/8/68 (HK68) H3N2 virus (ATCC-VR-1679), A/Virginia/ATCC6/2012 (H3N2) virus (ATCC-VR-1811), A/Virginia/ATCC1/2009TC (H1N1) virus (ATCC-VR-1736) and A/Wisconsin/33 (H1N1) virus (VR-1520) were purchased from ATCC. A/California/4/2009 (pH1N1) virus was kindly gifted by E. Govorkova from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis, USA). Viruses were grown and amplified in 10-d-old, specific, pathogen-free, research-grade chicken embryos at 35 °C (Charles River Laboratories; SPAEAS).WT recombinant SARS-CoV-2 was prepared and handled as described39. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2-Nluc virus is an authentic, fully replicating virus in which ORF7a has been deleted and replaced with Nluc40. The SARS-CoV-2 clinical variant was isolated from a 54-year-old man with melanoma and lymphoma, who received a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR in March 2020. Virus sequencing was performed on virus isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab sample in virus transport medium taken after the patient had been infected for 7 months.Plasmid constructs and cloningPlasmids were used containing the WT PB2 segments from influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8), A/New York/470/2004 (H3N2) (NY470), A/New York/312/2001 (H1N1) (NY312), A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) (1918), A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) (CA09) and A/Vietnam/03/2004 (H5N1) (VN1203). For the generation of PR8 packaging mutant vRNA, we utilized a Stratagene QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit for mutagenesis of a pDZ plasmid containing the PB2 gene of PR8 (ref. 38). Sequences of each mutated construct were confirmed by automated sequencing. The eight-plasmid pBD rescue system for A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was kindly donated by A. Mehle. The H275Y NA mutant was generated by QuickChange mutagenesis from the bidirectional pBD plasmids, as described above.Reverse genetics and virus titrationsRecombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus and recombinant A/WSN/33 (WSN) virus were generated using eight-plasmid reverse genetic systems38. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells of a HEK293T/MDCK co-culture were Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) transfected with 1 μg of one of each of the eight segments contained within plasmids that utilize a bidirectional dual Pol I/II promoter system for the simultaneous synthesis of genomic vRNA and messenger RNA. For rescue of compensatory PB2 mutant viruses where a nonsynonymous change was required, a WT PB2 protein expression plasmid (Pol II) was co-transfected during virus rescue. Supernatants were collected 24 h post-transfection. PR8 rescue viruses were then inoculated into the allantoic cavities of 10-d-old chicken embryos. WSN rescue viruses were passaged subsequent times on MDCK cells. Rescue of recombinant viruses was assessed by hemagglutination (HA) activity. Each newly rescued virus was further plaque titered and mutations were confirmed by sequencing of mutated genes. Plaque assays were carried out on confluent MDCK cells as described previously41. HA assays were carried out in 96-well round-bottomed plates at room temperature, using 50 μl of virus dilution and 50 μl of a 0.5% suspension of turkey red blood cells (LAMPIRE Biological Laboratories) in PBS.Isolation of packaged vRNAsTo analyze packaged vRNA for PR8 mutated viruses, 10-d-old eggs were inoculated with approximately 1,000 p.f.u. of recombinant virus and incubated for 72 h. Allantoic fluid was harvested and supernatant was dual clarified by low-speed centrifugation. Clarified supernatant was then layered on a 30% sucrose cushion and ultracentrifuged at 30,000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h (Beckman Rotor SW41). Pelleted virus was resuspended in PBS and TRIzol (Invitrogen) extracted. Precipitated vRNA was resuspended in a final volume of 20 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and stored at −80 °C. Virus supernatant from LNA-treated cells was harvested 48 h post-infection and subjected to low-speed centrifugation at 1,000 r.p.m., then 10,000 r.p.m. Isolation continued as indicated above.Quantitative PCR analysis of packaged vRNAsApproximately 200 ng of extracted vRNA was reverse transcribed using a universal 3′-primer (5′-AGGGCTCTTCGGCCAGCRAAAGCAGG) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reverse transcription (RT) product was diluted approximately 10,000-fold and used as a template for quantitative (q)PCR. Separate PCRs were then carried out as previously described42 with segment-specific primers. The 10-μl reaction mixture contained 1 μl of diluted RT product, a 0.5 μM primer concentration and SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) which included SYBR GreenER dye, 200 μM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, heat-labile UDG (uracil-N-glycosylase), optimized SYBR Green Select Buffer and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase UP enzyme. Relative vRNA concentrations were determined by analysis of cycle threshold values, total vRNA amount within a sample was normalized to the level of HA vRNA and then percentages of incorporation were calculated relative to the levels of WT vRNA packaging. Viral packaging results represent the averaged levels of vRNA incorporation ± s.d. derived from two independent virus purifications, with vRNA levels quantified in triplicate.Denaturing RNA gelExtracted viral RNA (100–300 ng) was diluted with equal volume of NOVEX TBE–Urea sample buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min before separation on a 6% TBE–Urea gel for 18 h at a constant voltage of 80 V. RNA from each sample was run in several dilutions to enable clear visualization of the genomic RNA without over-saturation of the band’s signal. The RNA was visualized by staining for 30 min in 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg ml−1 of ethidium bromide followed by visualization in a GelDoc EZ Imager system (BioRad). Silver staining was performed using the SilverXpress silver stain kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Silver staining and ethidium bromide staining were compared and shown to have the same linear range of detection (data not shown); ethidium bromide was selected for lane visualization due to a higher background signal in silver staining. The band intensity in each lane was determined using Image Lab Software (BioRad) and an analysis of the intensity of each genomic band relative to the total intensity of all genome segments was determined and normalized to the intensity of the HA band relative intensity.Strand-specific RT–qPCRMDCK cells transfected with 1 M LNA9 or Scr. LNA were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.1 24 h post-transfection. Then 8 h post-infection total cellular RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNA was purified using the Direct-Zol RNA mini-prep (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT and qPCR were performed according to the literature43. Complementary DNAs of the influenza vRNA and complementary viral RNA (cRNA) were synthesized with tagged primers to add an 18- to 20-nt tag that was unrelated to the influenza virus at the 5′-end (cRNAtag: 5′-GCT AGC TTC AGC TAG GCA TC-3′; vRNAtag: 5′-GGC CGT CAT GGT GGC GAA T-3′). Hot-start RT with the tagged primer was performed as described in Kawakami et al.43 using saturated trehalose. A 5.5-μl mixture containing 200 ng of total RNA sample and 10 pmol of tagged primer was heated for 10 min at 65 °C, chilled immediately on ice for 5 min and then heated again at 60 °C. After 5 min, 14.5 μl of preheated reaction mixture (4 μl of First Strand buffer (5×, Invitrogen), 1 μl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 1 μl of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1 μl of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U μl−1, Invitrogen), 1 μl of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (40 U μl−1, Promega) and 6.5 μl of saturated trehalose) was added and incubated for 1 h. RT–qPCR was performed with PowerUp SYBR Green SuperMix (Applied Biosystems) on a BioRad CFX96 Real-Time System. Then 7 µl of a tenfold dilution of the cDNA was added to the qPCR reaction mixture (10 μl of SYBR Green SuperMix (2×), 1.5 μl of forward primer (10 μM) and 1.5 μl of reverse primer (10 μM)). The cycle conditions of qPCR were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The qPCR primers were: PR8 segment 1 (PB2) cRNA: forward: 5′-TCC ACC AAA GCA AAG TAG AAT GC-3′; reverse: 5′-GCT AGC TTC AGC TAG GCA TCA GTA GAA ACA AGG TCG TTT TTA AAC-3′; PR8 segment 1 (PB2) vRNA: forward: 5′-GGC CGT CAT GGT GGC GAA TAG ACG AAC AGT CGA TTG CCG AAG C-3′, reverse: 5′-AGT ACT CAT CTA CAC CCA TTT TGC-3′; PR8 segment 4 (HA) cRNA: forward: 5′-CTG TAT GAG AAA GTA AAA AGC C-3′, reverse: 5′-GCT AGC TTC AGC TAG GCA TCA GTA GAA ACA AGG GTG TTT TTC-3′; and PR8 segment 4 (HA) vRNA: forward: 5′-GGC CGT CAT GGT GGC GAA TAG GAT GAA CTA TTA CTG GAC CTT GC-3′, reverse: 5′-TCC TGT AAC CAT CCT CAA TTT GGC-3′.AnimalsAll animal studies were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care and by the Utah State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed in disposable cages connected to an Innorack IVC-ventilated rodent housing system under 12 h light:dark cycle at 24 °C and 25–30% humidity. Healthy age-matched female BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks (Jackson Laboratories) were randomly separated into groups for infectionreatment or used as uninfectedontreated controls. Treatment groups were not blinded to the investigators. Mice were identified with tag numbers throughout the experiment. The 10-week-old female golden Syrian hamsters (LVG strain, Charles River Laboratories) were separated into groups for exposure studies with an additional sentinel group that was inoculated directly with virus.In vivo mouse infectionsMice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally infected with 50 μl of virus preparation at 1 LD100—a concentration of approximately 1,000 p.f.u. for virus-packaging mutant experiments and 900 p.f.u. for LNA treatment experiments. Weights and clinical scores were assessed daily, and animals were humanely sacrificed when a clinical score of 5 was recorded (see Supplementary Table 2 for clinical score determination). Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using GraphPad Prism.In vivo mouse IAV antiviral assays‘In vivo-ready’ LNAs were custom designed and ordered from QIAGEN (formally Exiqon) and later from IDT. For intranasal delivery, in vivo-ready LNA was mixed in complexes with in vivo-JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to the indicated final concentration in 50–75 μl of 5% glucose solution. Mice were then lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and 50–75 μl of the solution was delivered intranasally. For retro-orbital delivery, in vivo-ready LNA was mixed in complexes with in vivo-JetPEI transfection reagent (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to the indicated final concentration in 200 μl of 5% glucose solution. Mice were then anesthetized and the solution was delivered by retro-orbital injection. OSLT (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. SML1606) was prepared in sterile water and administered to mice at a dose of 10 mg kg−1 twice daily by oral gavage (totaling 20 mg kg−1 d−1), with 8 h between dosing intervals.Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Syrian hamstersInfection of donor sentinel hamsters (nontreated): 6-week-old WT golden Syrian hamsters were intranasally infected with 1 × 104.3 CCID50 (cell culture infectious dose 50%) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020 strain) in a 100-µl volume. LNA pretreatment group: 6-week-old golden Syrian hamsters (n = 5) were pretreated by intranasal instillation with a 200-µl volume containing 100 µg of LNA-12.8 on day −1 and day 0 before exposure to the SARS-CoV-2-infected sentinel hamsters. Vehicle-treated hamsters (n = 4) received PBS by intranasal nebulization. LNA- and vehicle-treated hamsters were co-housed and exposed to the infected sentinels for 2 h per d for 3 consecutive days. Then, 4 d after the initial exposure, the lungs were harvested and virus titers were determined by CCID50 in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student’s t-test with GraphPad Prism 9 software.LNA design and preparationOligonucleotides containing LNAs were custom synthesized by Exiqon and later by IDT. Capitalized letters denote LNA. Lower-case letters denote typical (nonlocked) DNA nucleotides. All oligonucleotides contain phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. LNA8 and -9 were designed as LNA gapmers to contain a stretch of six or seven DNA nucleotides optimized for RNase-H recruitment. Sequences of all LNAs are shown below:LNA1: 5′-AccAaaAGaaT-3′LNA2: 5′-TggCcATcaaT-3′LNA3: 5′-TagCAtActtA-3′LNA4: 5′-CCAAAAGA-3′LNA5: 5′-CATACTTA-3′LNA6: 5′-CagaCaCGaCCaaAA-3′LNA7: 5′-TAcTtaCTgaCagCC-3′LNA8: 5′-AGAcacgaccaaAAG-3′LNA9: 5′-TACTtactgacaGCC-3′LNA14: 5′-CGACcaaaagaATTC-3′Scr. LNA (negative control): 5′-AACACGTCTATACGC-3′SARS-CoV-2-directed LNAs:LNA-12.8: 5′-AGGAagttgtagCACG-3′LNA-14.3: 5′-GCTctccatcttaCCT-3′In vitro LNA antiviral assaysFor all experiments, LNAs were reconstituted in RNase-free water at 100 μM stock solutions, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C before single use. Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) was used to transfect LNA into cells at indicated concentrations per the manufacturer’s protocol.For IAV prophylactic antiviral assays, 1 × 106 MDCK cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 h before being transfected with the indicated LNA. Cells were then infected at the indicated time points with 0.01 MOI of PR8 (H1N1) or HK68 (H3N2) virus. For post-infection therapeutic assessment, MDCK cells were infected with PR8 or HK68 before LNA transfection as described above. Then 48 h post-infection, supernatant was collected and the viral titer was determined by plaque assay in triplicate.For SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assays: 1 d before transfection, Huh-7 or ACE2-TMPRSS2-Huh-7.5 was plated on 96-well clear-bottomed plates to 60–70% confluency at the time of treatment with the LNA ASOs LNA-12.8, LNA-14.3 or Scr. LNA. Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) was used to transfect LNA ASOs into cells at 25 nM or 100 nM final concentration, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus expressing nanoluciferase (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) at an MOI of 0.3 for 1 h, after which the virus was removed and fresh medium was added. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2-Nluc is a fully replicating virus in which ORF7 has been deleted and replaced with Nluc. Thus, the measurement of Nluc expression is a surrogate marker of virus replication enabling the screening of antiviral compounds. A nucleoside analog β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine, EIDD-1931, with potent activity against SARS-CoV-2, was included as a positive control. A DMSO control was included as a mock-treated, negative control. Data were graphed and analyzed in Prism v.8 and v.9 by GraphPad. Statistical analysis of the data from each cell type was computed as an ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test against the DMSO control or Scr. LNA control from each cell type, where indicated.SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay experiments were performed in 24-well plates: 24-well plates were seeded with 1 × 105 Vero E6 cells per well in DMEM, 10% FBS and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic 24 h before Lipofectamine 3000 transfection of LNA. Scr. LNA was included as a negative control. Then 12 h post-transfection, LNA-transfection medium was removed, and cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 with either recombinant WT SARS-CoV-2 (PMID: 32526206) or a SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate derived from a nasopharyngeal swab taken from a chronically infected cancer patient 7 months after the initial confirmatory COVID-19 PCR test. After adding virus inoculum, plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, after which input virus was removed, wells were washed with 1 ml of medium and 1 ml of ‘infection medium’ (DMEM, 5% FBS, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic) was added. After 48 h at 37 °C, 200 µl of culture supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until quantitation of infectious virus by plaque assay. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells per well per 2 ml in 6-well plates. After 24 h, samples were thawed at room temperature and serially diluted in PBS. Medium was removed from the six-well plates and serial dilutions were added to the plate, incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then overlaid with DMEM, 5% FBS, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic and 0.9% agarose. After 72 h, neutral red stain was added to each plate, incubated for 3 h and plaques were counted. The number of plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) per milliliter was generated using the following formula: p.f.u. ml−1 = number of plaques × serial dilution factor × 5.LNA treatment and IAV-packaging efficiency determinationBriefly, T75 flasks of 80% confluent MDCK cells were transfected with 100 nM of Scr. LNA, LNA9 or mock untreated by Lipofectamine 3000 transfection, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then 12 h post-transfection, cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of WT TC-adapted PR8 virus. After 1 h, virus was removed and the cells were washed with PBS; 48-h post-infection supernatants were collected and RNA was isolated as described in isolation of packaged vRNAs and assay methods.In vitro drug selectionLNA9 selection: 80–90% confluent MDCK cells in 12-well plates were transfected in duplicate with a starting concentration of 0.01 nM (~½EC50) LNA9 for passage 1 by Lipofectamine transfection (see above). Then 12 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and infected with an MOI of 0.01 of WT PR8 virus. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed and virus growth medium was added. Cells were incubated until 50% cytopathic effect (CPE) was evident (48–72 h). Virus supernatant was harvested, low-speed centrifuge clarified, aliquoted, plaque titered and stored at −80 °C. The virus supernatant was then continuously serially passaged in the presence of escalating concentrations of LNA9 (0.01 nM to 100 nM). If no CPE were evident, the drug concentration was lowered and the added virus concentration increased until 50% CPE occurred. OSLT selection: confluent MDCK cells in 12-well plates were infected with an MOI of 0.01 of PR8 virus. After adsorption for 1 h, cells were washed with PBS and OSLT (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. Y0001340) was added to the virus growth medium at a starting concentration of 1 nM (~½EC50). Drug selection proceeded as described above, with escalating concentrations of OSLT (0.01 nM to 250 μM) at each subsequent passage.EC50 determinationFor LNA9, the EC50 was defined as the concentration of drug effective in reducing the percentage of virus titer to 50% of that for the no-drug control. In brief, the EC50 was determined by seeding 5 × 105 MDCK cells in each well of a 12-well plate and incubating overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were then transfected with LNA9 as described above at concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10 μM. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h before infection with 0.01 MOI of WT PR8, serially passaged LNA-treated virus, WSN33 WT or WSN33 H275Y NAI-resistant virus. Then 48 h post-infection, supernatants were collected, centrifuge clarified, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The viral titer for each drug dilution was performed by plaque assay in duplicate. The EC50 was the concentration of LNA9 yielding a percentage titer of 50% of that without drug.For OSLT, the EC50 was defined as the concentration of drug reducing the total percentage of plaques to 50% of that for the no-drug control, determined by plaque reduction assay1. Briefly, confluent MDCK cells in 12-well plates were infected with approximately 100 p.f.u. of WT PR8, serially passaged OSLT-treated virus, WSN33 WT or WSN33 H275Y NAI-resistant virus and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and a 50:50 mix of 1% agarose: 2× virus growth DMEM containing varying concentrations of drug (0.1 nM to 1 mM) was added to the cells. Plates were harvested 72 h later, stained with Crystal Violet and plaques were counted. The EC50 was the concentration of OSLT reducing the total percentage of plaques to 50% of that without drug. All results were plotted in GraphPad Prism to generate EC50 curves.In vitro transcription of full-length IAV vRNAFor each WT isolate (PR8, 1918, VN1203, NY470, NY312 and CA09) and PR8 packaging mutant clones, PB2 cDNA was amplified from plasmid-using, segment-specific primers under a T7 promoter. Amplified cDNA was gel purified using an Invitrogen DNA gel kit. The vRNAs were then produced by in vitro transcription, using T7-MEGAscript kit. The vRNAs for SHAPE were purified by MEGAclear (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. AM1908) with purity and length verified by capillary electrophoresis.The single fluorophore-SHAPE 1D analysis of full-length IAV vRNAIn vitro transcribed PB2 vRNA was folded (100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 65 °C for 1 min, 5-min cooling at room temperature, 37 °C for 20–30 min) in 100 mM Hepes, pH 8. The 2′-acylation with N-methylisatoic anhydride18 and RT primer extension were performed at 45 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 25 min and 65 °C for 5 min, as previously described44. 6-Carboxyfluorescein (6FAM) was used for all labeled primers (primer sequences available on request). Exceptions to these protocols were as follows: (1) RNA purification after acylation was performed using RNA C&C columns (Zymo Research), rather than ethanol precipitation; (2) before and after SHAPE primer buffer was added, the mixture was placed at room temperature for 2–5 min, which enhanced RT yields significantly; (3) DNA purification was performed using Sephadex G-50 size exclusion resin in 96-well format, then concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, resulting in a more significant removal of primer; and (4) 2 pmol of RNA was used in ddGTP (2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate) RNA-sequencing reactions.The ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (50-cm capillaries filled with POP-6 matrix) was set with the following parameters: voltage 15 kV, T = 60 °C, injection time = 15 s. The GeneScan program was used to acquire the data for each sample, which consisted of purified DNA resuspended in 9.75 μl of Hi-Di-Formamide, to which 0.25 μl of ROX500 internal size standard (ABI catalog no. 602912) was added. PeakScanner parameters were set to the following parameters: smoothing=none; window size=25; size calling=local southern; baseline window=51; peak threshold=15. Fragments 250 and 340 were computationally excluded from the ROX500 standard45. The data from PeakScanner were then processed into SHAPE data by using FAST (fast analysis of SHAPE traces), a customized algorithm developed in our lab19. FAST automatically corrects for signal differences due to handling errors, adjusts for signal decay and converts fragment length to nucleotide position, using a ddGTP ladder as an external sizing standard and the local Southern blotting method5,19. This algorithm embedded in the RNAstructure program is freely available at http://med.stanford.edu/glennlab/download.html.RNAstructure parameters: slope and intercept parameters of 2.6 and −0.8 kcal mol−1 were initially tried, as suggested46; however, we found that smaller intercepts closer to 0.0 kcal mol−1 (for example, ~−0.3) produced fewer less optimal structures (within a maximum energy difference of 10%). We speculate that this minor parameter difference may be due to the precise fitting achieved between experimental and control datasets by the automated FAST algorithm. FAST was written in ANSI C/C++ and is integrated into RNAstructure with FAST, which requires MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes). RNA structures were drawn and colored using RNAViz 2 (ref. 47) and finalized in Adobe Illustrator.IAV PSL2 construct design, RNA synthesis and chemical modification for M2 experimentsDouble-stranded DNA templates were prepared by PCR assembly of DNA oligomers designed by an automated MATLAB script as previously described (available at https://primerize.stanford.edu)48. Constructs for M2 include all single mutants to the Watson–Crick counterpart. Compensatory mutants for M2R were designed based on basepairing in the proposed secondary structure22. In vitro transcription reactions, RNA purification and quantification steps were as described previously48. One-dimensional (1D) chemical mapping, M2 and M2R were carried out in the 96-well format as described previously48,49,50. Briefly, RNA was heated up and cooled to remove secondary structure heterogeneity, then folded properly and incubated with SHAPE reagent (5 mg ml−1 of 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7))51; modification reaction was quenched and RNA was recovered by poly(dT) magnetic beads (Ambion) and FAM-labeled Tail2-A20 primer; RNA was washed by 70% ethanol twice and resuspended in double-distilled water (ddH2O), followed by RT to cDNA and heated NaOH treatment to remove RNA. The final cDNA library was recovered by magnetic bead separation, rinsed, eluted in Hi-Di-Formamide (Applied Biosystems) with ROX350 ladder and loaded to a capillary electrophoresis sequencer (ABI 3100). Data processing, structural modeling and data deposition: the HiTRACE software package v.2.0 was used to analyze CE data (both MATLAB toolbox and web server available52,53). Trace alignment, baseline subtraction, sequence assignment, profile fitting, attenuation correction and normalization were accomplished as previously described54,55. Sequence assignment was accomplished manually with verification from sequencing ladders. Data-driven secondary structure models were obtained using the Fold program of the RNAstructure package v.5.4 (ref. 56) with pseudo-energy slope and intercept parameters of 2.6 kcal mol−1 and –0.8 kcal mol−1. Two-dimensional z-score matrices for M2 datasets and helix-wise bootstrapping confidence values were calculated as described previously22,48. The z-score matrices were used as basepair-wise, pseudo-free energies with a slope and intercept of 1.0 kcal mol−1 and 0 kcal mol−1. Secondary structure images were generated by VARNA57. These chemical-mapping datasets, including 1D mapping, M2 and M2R have been deposited at the RNA Mapping DataBase (RMDB: http:/mdb.stanford.edu)58, accession nos.: PSL2IAV_1M7_0001, PSL2IAV_RSQ_0001.SHAPE analysis of LNA-targeted IAV vRNAA truncated DNA template of PR8 virus segment PB2 containing nucleotides 1–88 was prepared by PCR assembly of DNA oligomers, and in vitro transcription reactions, RNA purification and quantification steps were as described previously48. The 1D SHAPE chemical mapping was performed in a 96-well plate format as described above, with the following exception: once RNA was denatured and refolded as described, 100 nM of each prepared LNA was added to the folded RNA and incubated with 5 mg ml−1 of SHAPE reagent 1M7. Modification quenching, RNA recovery, re-suspension, RT, cDNA-sequencing and data processing were performed as described50.SHAPE 1D analysis of nontreated and LNA-treated SARS-COV-2 RNARNA was folded (0.5 M Na Hepes, pH 8; 90 °C for 3 min, 12-min cooling at room temperature, 50 °C for 20 min, 12-min cooling at room temperate) in 100 mM MgCl2 with or without LNA and with or without SHAPE reagent 1M7 modification. RNA was purified and quenched with magnetic beads (0.5 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt, pH 6, FAM-A20 tail 2 primer, 5 M NaCl and Ampure beads) and reverse transcribed at 48 °C for 40 min, followed by a 0.4 M NaOH acid quench to improve signal intensity. The resulting cDNA was resuspended in ROX Hi-Di-Formamide and diluted for capillary electrophoresis analysis. As an internal control, the RNA was created with GAGUA hairpins in 5′- and 3′-termini designed to be reactive in the presence of 1M7. The results were analyzed using the HiTRACE method52 and standardized by the Kladwang et al. method55.PBMCs and splenocyte isolationWhole blood was collected from mice into heparinized tubes. The whole blood was overlaid on top Ficoll-Paque medium and centrifuged at 400g for 40 min at room temperature. The top layer containing plasma and platelets was removed and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at the interphase of the Ficoll layer were collected. The mononuclear cells were diluted in PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 500g for 15 min after an additional wash with PBS. The pellet was suspended in PBS. Splenocytes were isolated by manually grinding the spleen over a 40-μm cell strainer. The cells were transferred several times through the strainer and processed further as described above. TruStain fcX (anti-mouse CD16/32) antibody specific for FcyR III/II (1 μg per 1 × 106 cells) was used to block nonspecific staining, followed by staining with Zombie Aqua viability kit (BioLegend). Antibody staining was performed by mixing the cells with an antibody mix containing BD Horizon PE-CF594 Rat Anti-Mouse CD45 (BD Biosciences), PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD3 (BioLegend), APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD8a (BioLegend) and H-2Kd Influenza HA Tetramer-IYSTVASSL-PE (MBL International). All antibodies were diluted at a ratio of 2 ml of each antibody per 1 × 106 cells and HA tetramer was the diluter at a ratio of 5 ml per 1 × 106 cells. Splenocytes were isolated from a mouse spleen by immersing the spleen in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 10% FBS and washing with HBSS to remove blood. The spleen was placed in a 40-mm cell strainer and the tissue was mashed with a syringe plunger to break down the tissue and dislodge the cells. After complete disruption of the organ, the cells were run through the strainer into a conical tube. The cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 350g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in water for 20 s to disrupt red blood cells followed by addition of 2× PBS solution. The cells were pelleted and subjected to staining as described for PBMCs above.Flow cytometryAfter staining, the cells were fixed and subjected to flow cytometry using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with 488-nm, 405-nm, 640-nm and 532-nm lasers. Data were collected using BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). The gating strategy for positive tetramer cells was as follows: forward scatter area (FSC)-H/FSC-A gate used to collect cells and a gate for live cells was then generated. The live cells were gated for CD3+/CD45+ cells and the positive cells were gated to determine the CD8+/HA-tetramer+ cells. Acquired data was analyzed using a FlowJo software (TreeStar).LNA effect on IFN and NF-kB pathwaysTHP1-Dual or A549-Dual cells (InvivoGen) were transfected in triplicate with LNA9, LNA14 or derivatives thereof, or poly(I:C) (R&D Systems) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Treatment with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (hTNF-α; R&D Systems), recombinant human IFN (hIFN-γ; R&D Systems), recombinant hIFN-α (R&D Systems) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from O111:B4 Escherichia coli (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control for activation of the two pathways. Supernatant from the cultures were collected 24–32 h post-transfectionreatment to measure luciferase signal or secreted alkaline phosphatase activity as indicators of IFN pathway stimulation or NF-κB pathway stimulation, respectively. Results were normalized to reflect fold induction relative to NT cells.IL-6 and TNF-α ELISASupernatants from THP1-Dual cells (InvivoGen) were transfected in triplicate with LNA9, LNA14 or poly(I:C) (R&D Systems). Treatment with recombinant hIFN-γ (R&D Systems), recombinant hIFN-α (R&D Systems) or LPS from O111:B4 E. coli (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control to cause induction of interleukin (IL)-6 or TNF-α secretion. Supernatants were collected 24 h post-transfectionreatment and assayed for TNF-α and IL-6 concentration by ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the ELISA kit protocol.Statistical analysesWe expressed the data as the mean ± s.d. or mean ± s.e.m. where indicated. We used Student’s t-test (to compare two samples) or ANOVA (to compare multiple samples) as analyzed by GraphPad Prism (v.8 and v.9) for statistical analysis. We performed Kaplan–Meier log(rank) tests for survival analyses. We considered all P values >0.05 not to be significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The 1918 influenza pandemic resulted in the loss of over 3% of the world’s population – at least 50 million people. But it wasn’t the flu virus that caused the majority of these deaths. An analysis of lung samples collected during that flu pandemic indicated that most of the deaths were likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which ran rampant in the absence of antibiotics. Even in more recent history, like the 1957 H2N2 and 2009 H1N1 flu pandemics, nearly 18% of patients with viral pneumonia had additional bacterial infections that increased their risk of death. And the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. With yet another flu season fast approaching in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, lessening the harm caused by these viruses is important to prevent deaths and reduce infections. However, many deaths associated with the flu and COVID-19 don’t occur at the hand of the virus alone. Instead, it’s a secondary bacterial infection that is often at the root of the devastating consequences attributed to an initial viral infection. I am an immunologist who studies why and how cells die during bacterial and viral infections. Understanding the synergy between these microbes is critical not only for effective diagnosis and treatment, but also for managing current pandemics and preventing future ones. My colleagues and I published a study showing how an immune system protein crucial to fighting against viruses also plays an indispensable role in fighting bacteria. One Texas man who died in March 2020 tested positive for COVID-19, strep throat and the flu. Viruses and bacteria team up Multiple pathogens can cause multiple infections in different ways. Scientists distinguish each type based on the timing of when each infection occurs. Coinfection refers to two or more different pathogens causing infections at the same time. Secondary or superinfections, on the other hand, refer to sequential infections that occur after an initial infection. They’re often caused by pathogens resistant to antibiotics used to treat the primary infection. How viral and bacterial infections interact with each other increases the potential harm they can cause. Viral respiratory infections can increase the likelihood of bacterial infections and lead to worse disease. The reason why this happens is often multifaceted. Within your respiratory tract, the epithelial cells lining your airways and lungs serve as the first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and debris. However, viruses can kill these cells and disrupt this protective barrier, allowing inhaled bacteria to invade. They can also change the surface of epithelial cells to make them easier for bacteria to attach to. Viruses can also alter the surface of epithelial and immune cells by reducing the number of receptors that help these cells recognize and mount a response against pathogens. This reduction means fewer immune cells report to the viral infection site, giving bacteria an opening to launch another infection. Influenza, COVID-19 and bacterial infections Patients who have a bacterial infection at the same time they’re battling the seasonal flu are more likely to wind up in a hospital. Nearly a quarter of patients admitted to the ICU with severe influenza also have a bacterial infection. One study on the 2010 to 2018 flu seasons found that nearly 20% of patients admitted to the hospital with flu-associated pneumonia had acquired bacterial infections. Another study of patients hospitalized with viral or bacterial infections found that nearly half had a coinfection with another pathogen. These patients also had nearly double the risk of dying within 30 days compared to those with only a single infection. Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a common source of bacterial coinfections. Janice Haney Car/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Interestingly, the two bacteria species most commonly involved in coinfections with the influenza virus are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, which normally exist in the respiratory tract without causing disease. However, the influenza virus can damage the cell barrier of the lungs and disrupt immune function enough to make patients susceptible to infection by these otherwise benign bacteria. Secondary bacterial infections are also exacerbating the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2021 review estimated that 16% to 28% of adults hospitalized for COVID-19 also had a bacterial infection. These patients stayed in the hospital for twice as long, were four times more likely to need mechanical ventilation and had three times greater odds of dying compared to patients with only COVID-19. Addressing secondary and coinfections The immune system responds differently to viruses and bacteria. Antivirals don’t work on bacteria, and antibiotics don’t work on viruses. A better understanding of what pathways the body uses to regulate both antiviral and antibacterial infections is critical to addressing secondary and coinfections. Recent work by my colleagues and me may provide a clue. We sequenced the RNA of one type of immune cell, macrophages, in mice to identify what molecules were present in cells that were either protected from or died due to bacterial infection. We identified Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1), a molecule already known to play a regulatory role in how the immune system responds to influenza. Specifically, ZBP1 detects influenza viruses within the lungs and signals infected epithelial and immune cells to self-destruct. This induced cell death eliminates the virus and promotes recruitment of additional immune cells to the infection site. Programmed cell death takes a number of forms, two of which include apoptosis and necrosis. Building off this finding that ZBP1 is important for fighting viral infection, we found that macrophages infected with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a type of bacteria that causes foodborne illness, also use this protein to initiate cell death. This limits bacterial replication while also sending inflammatory signals that help clear bacteria. These findings raise the possibility that ZBP1 may play a dual role in how the body responds to viral and bacterial infections. It’s possible that treatments that increase ZBP1 in certain types of cells may be useful in managing bacterial and viral coinfections.

In this 2018 file photo, a nurse prepares a flu shot at the Salvation Army in Atlanta. APBy Julie Washington, cleveland.comCLEVELAND, Ohio — Flu shots for the 2022-2023 season are available now.The current flu vaccine has been updated to be a better match against the viruses that are expected to circulate, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The best time to get the flu shot is between early fall and the end of October, according to the CDC. Once you get the vaccine, your body needs roughly two weeks to develop enough antibodies to protect against the flu. Therefore, getting the vaccine before flu season is in full swing is recommended.Flu vaccines worked better this past season than initially reported. Vaccinated people last season reduced their risk of serious flu illness by about one-third, the CDC said.“This is more evidence that the flu vaccine can still offer protection, even when vaccine viruses are different from circulating viruses,” the agency said.Everyone 6 months of age and older should get a flu vaccine every season, the CDC recommends. The flu shot is especially important for people at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.Rite Aid and CVS Pharmacy have opened online scheduling for flu shots, as well as accepting walk-in customers, the pharmacy chains said in press releases.Flu shots also will be available at other pharmacies, hospital systems, county health departments and doctor offices.While the flu vaccine doesn’t totally protect against the illness, getting a seasonal influenza vaccine every year is the best protection against severe influenza.2021-22 flu season was mild, peaked twiceSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, flu seasons have been mild. That’s because measures taken to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as hand washing and mask wearing, also work against flu, health experts have said.The 2021-22 influenza season was mild, but with more flu activity than the prior season. Influenza A was dominant throughout the 2021-22 season, the CDC said.RECOMMENDED•cleveland.comOhio COVID-19 cases dip to lowest level since June; Coronavirus update for Nov. 7, 2024Nov. 7, 2024, 3:21 p.m.Cavs to get key reserve back from injury Wednesday night vs. New OrleansNov. 6, 2024, 6:55 p.m.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza cases increased in the fall and peaked in February.But during the 2021–2022 season, flu activity began increasing in November and remained elevated until mid-June, with two different waves of high spread.The first wave peaked in late December, and the second wave peaked at different times across the country. In the Midwest, influenza peaked in April — the latest peak on record, the CDC said.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Paul Harrison at the University of Oxford and his colleagues analysed the medical records of more than 1.25 million people from around the world who were diagnosed with covid-19 between 20 January 2020 and 13 April 2022. The researchers compared the participants to people who experienced other respiratory infections in this period. In this control group, the researchers only included people who hadn’t tested positive for the coronavirus at any point in the timeframe.Advertisement For both sets of participants the team analysed the risk of developing 14 neurological and mental health conditions in the two years post-infection for three age groups: children under 18, adults aged 18 to 64 and adults older than 65. Previous studies have looked at the neurological and mental health symptoms experienced by people in the six months following covid-19, but this is the first large-scale study to look for these effects up to two years post-infection, according to the researchers. “This is very important because for patients, clinicians and public health authorities… you want to know at what point after covid-19 can you be reassured that you’re no longer at increased risk of getting a psychiatric diagnosis,” says Harrison. Among adults aged 18 to 64, the risk of a first-time diagnosis of depression or anxiety in the two months after being infected with the coronavirus was 75 per cent and 60 per cent higher, respectively, than seen with other respiratory infections. For depression, this elevated risk dropped to the same levels seen after being infected with other respiratory diseases 43 days post-infection, on average, while for anxiety it was 58 days. Over two years, 18.2 per cent of those infected with coronavirus and 18.8 per cent of those infected with other respiratory diseases were diagnosed with depression. In the same period, 11.6 per cent of those with covid-19 and 11.5 per cent of those infected with other respiratory diseases were diagnosed with anxiety disorders. However, the analysis found that the risk of being diagnosed with brain fog and epilepsy in adults aged between 18 and 64 remained higher in people who had covid-19 for up to two years post-infection, compared with those who experienced other respiratory infections. In this age group, 6.4 per cent were diagnosed with brain fog within two years of covid-19, compared with 5.5 per cent of the participants who experienced other respiratory infections. A statistical analysis suggests this is a significant difference. The risk of dementia was elevated in those aged over 65 for up to two years following covid-19, with 4.5 per cent diagnosed with dementia in the two years after covid-19, compared with 3.3 per cent in the control group. How the UK responded to the covid-19 pandemic Patrick Vallance at New Scientist Live this October Children weren’t found to have a higher risk of developing anxiety or depression after covid-19, compared with those who experienced other respiratory infections. However, they did face a higher risk of epilepsy or seizures for up to two years post-infection, compared with those who experienced other respiratory infections, though the actual probability of developing these conditions remained small. Just 2.6 per cent of children infected with coronavirus developed epilepsy or seizures within two years after coronavirus infection, compared with 1.3 per cent for other respiratory infections. This age group also had a three-fold increase in psychosis in the two years after covid-19, compared with those who experienced other respiratory infections – though just 0.18 per cent of children were diagnosed with the condition in the two years. The researchers also compared people in the US who caught different coronavirus variants. The rates of most neurological and mental health diagnoses were similar following infection with the delta or omicron variants, despite the latter generally being linked to milder disease. Why covid-19 raises the risk of different neurological or mental health conditions is unclear, but there are possible explanations, says Harrison. The virus could persist in certain cells in the nervous system, or the immune system’s efforts against the coronavirus may result in some collateral brain damage, he says. Aravinthan Varatharaj at the University of Southampton in the UK says these findings may reflect the fact that people with a higher risk of neurological conditions may be more likely to get covid-19 in the first place, but it could also reflect the impact of the coronavirus on the brain. “Infections such as covid may affect the brain through a number of mechanisms, including signalling through the vagus nerve, activation of the immune system and changes in the blood-brain barrier,” he says.

Cold & FluNewsXofluza Approved to Treat and Prevent Flu in Children 5 to 12 Years OldAlthough vaccination is still the best way to protect against the flu, the drug may help reduce transmission of influenza.ByBecky UphamFact CheckedUpdated on August 15, 2022In October 2018, Xofluza was the first anti-flu medication to gain approval in 20 years.Courtesy of Genentech; CanvaDrugmaker Genentech announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its flu drug Xofluza for children ages 5 to 12.The FDA greenlighted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy children who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours, according to a statement released last week by the company. Xofluza is the first single-dose oral influenza medicine that’s been approved for children in this age group.Additionally, the FDA approved Xofluza to help prevent influenza in children in this age group following contact with someone with the flu.“Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, influenza continues to be a threat to public health, and effective influenza antivirals remain critical to alleviating the burden on healthcare systems,” said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Genentech, in the release. “Xofluza has proven to be an important tool in fighting and preventing influenza in adults as well as adolescents, and we are pleased to now offer households and younger children our single-dose oral treatment.”Xofluza is an important tool because it is a single dose and has been effective at decreasing the symptoms of influenza, says Amesh A. Adalja MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. “Having multiple antiviral options is always a good thing for any infection,” he adds.The FDA approval is based on results from two Phase 3 studies, miniSTONE-2 and BLOCKSTONE. MiniSTONE-2 evaluated Xofluza compared with oseltamivir in otherwise healthy children and included patients age 5 to less than 12 years with an influenza infection and displaying influenza symptoms for no more than 48 hours.BLOCKSTONE evaluated Xofluza compared with placebo as a preventive treatment for household members (adults and children) who were living with someone with influenza.Adverse events reported in at least 5 percent of the participants (5 to 11 years old) were vomiting (5 percent) and diarrhea (5 percent).In Adults, Xofluza Shortens Duration of Flu by About 1 DayIn October 2018, the flu drug was approved for use in people over the age of 12, making it the first anti-flu medication to gain approval in nearly 20 years.In the clinical trials in adults that were the basis for the drug’s fast-tracked approval, Xofluza reduced flu symptoms by a little more than a day in healthy patients over the age of 12. In clinical trials, Xofluza shortened the duration of the flu by about 24 hours if it’s given within the first 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.That is similar to the efficacy of Tamiflu, another drug used to treat the flu, according to the Cleveland Clinic. However, Xofluza is administered in a single dose as opposed to the 5 days of therapy that Tamiflu requires.In November 2020, the FDA expanded its approval, adding an indication for Xofluza to treat post-exposure prevention of the flu for people 12 and older after contact with someone with the flu.How Xofluza WorksXofluza works via a different mechanism of action than other available anti-flu drugs, according to the drug’s fact sheet. Once the flu virus gets into your system, it reproduces over and over and then spreads throughout your body. Xofluza inhibits polymerase acidic endonuclease, the enzyme that allows the virus to reproduce, which is earlier in the disease process than other flu medications.Early Data Indicates This Flu Season May Be More SevereDuring the 2021–2022 flu season, flu activity in the United States was lower than pre-pandemic levels despite increased reporting and testing, a trend that experts suspect may have been the result of COVID-19 precautions, according to a report released on July 22, 2022 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Using data available from early October 2021 through mid-June 2022, the agency estimated that influenza virus infection resulted in 8 to 13 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.7 to 6.1 million medical visits, 82,000 to 170,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 to 14,000 deaths.That’s significantly less severe than many earlier flu seasons. In 2018–2019, there were 29 million cases of the flu, 13 million flu-related doctor visits, 380,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 28,000 flu deaths, including more than 100 deaths of children between the ages of 5 and 17 years, according to the CDC.Heath experts often look to the Southern Hemisphere as one indicator of what the flu season will be in Northern Hemisphere (which includes the United States). This year Australia reports the number of flu cases so far has exceeded the five-year average, according to an NBC News report.Getting a Flu Shot Is the Best Way to Protect Yourself From the FluThe flu vaccine is the best way to help protect against the flu, which is why the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot (with rare exceptions) every year.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkBecky UphamAuthorBecky Upham has been professionally involved in health and wellness for almost 20 years.

So, to kind of start off, what are current key areas of interest in respiratory vaccine development at the moment?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Thanks, Aislinn, and it's a pleasure to be here. So, first of all, I would say that respiratory vaccines are a priority for Moderna because they address an important unmet need. There are lower respiratory tract infections that are quite a leading cause of death globally. And every year, approximately 1 million people die of lower respiratory tract infections. And, therefore, we have definitely prioritized this area. And currently, we are working on a number of respiratory viruses. But I would say the priority ones are COVID-19, RSV, and flu, of course. Yes, these are definitely the key areas for us.Aislinn Antrim: So, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board recently endorsed the phase 3 portion of clinical trials for the mRNA RSV vaccine candidate. Can you discuss the earlier data supporting this phase 3 launch?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Yeah, so before the starting of the phase 3 program, like for every vaccine, we make sure that we have all the necessary information to safely progress to a larger study. And the current phase 3 study which is ongoing for the RSV program is on approximately 34,000 individuals, because this trial is assessing the efficacy of the vaccine. And it's studying subjects who are vaccinated against it, the candidate vaccine versus subjects who are receiving the placebo control. And therefore, prior to that, of course, you do a phase 1, 2, and we studied several individuals, approximately 2000 individuals, in the phase 2 program, and we could see that the tolerability and safety profile was acceptable to progress. But also, interestingly, we noted the baseline titers. So, people who got vaccinated had baseline titers, including the placebo groups, which means that subjects had all encountered a previous RSV infection. However, after vaccination, when subjects were boosted with a dose of the vaccine, we could see a very strong immune response. And an immune response was against both the RSV, a component of the vaccine, and the RSV B strain. So that was quite reassuring. So, if you add the immune response, plus the new safety concern on the phase 1, 2 components of this study, the data safety monitoring board that was reassured basically to enable us to progress to the phase 3, which is currently ongoing.Aislinn Antrim: Wonderful, that's definitely encouraging. For this RSV vaccine candidate specifically, what gaps in care would this vaccine fill?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Yeah, it's interesting mainly because RSV vaccines have been studied for many years. There was an issue, though, with RSV vaccines. The protein that is the target for the vaccine, which is the F glycoprotein, is quite unstable. And the previous vaccine target used to have as a focus that post-fusion protein, but this post-fusion protein did not solicit neutralizing antibody titers. And then when it was understood, the big breakthrough was to understand that we could actually stabilize the confirmation of the protein and defining the pre-fusion component of the protein. It was an important finding. And that is what we have in our current RNA vaccine.So, our vaccine encodes for the prefusion glycoprotein F, and it cross protects against the RSV A and RSV B component. Now, the important elements are there was a gap in terms of identifying the right vaccine candidate. And so, this new feature, this new discovery, has allowed us to make a major breakthrough in research, but also there is an important unmet need remaining. Currently today, there are no vaccines available, and the treatment is quite limited. And there are many, many individuals who are both at the extreme of ages, both in children, usually below 2 years of age, that are affected by RSV, but also older adults. Now, it is more known in the younger kids. So, if you think about RSV, I think a lot of mothers would think that their children have had an RSV during the life of their children when they were very young. But not many people know that actually RSV affects a lot of individuals who are above 60 years of age. So, older adults, and this is a cause of important lower respiratory tract infection that can have severe consequences, especially if people have also additional comorbidities, for example, they suffer have additional respiratory conditions.Aislinn Antrim: Very interesting. Turning our attention to flu vaccines a little bit, attention is quickly shifting there for the upcoming season. And a phase 2 interim analysis of Moderna’s seasonal flu vaccine candidate found positive results. Can you review these findings?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Yes, again, in every clinical trial we always look into the tolerability profile of the vaccine, and then we look into the immunogenicity. And this candidate vaccine, which we call 1010, mRNA 1010, has demonstrated to be well tolerated and with no major safety concerns. But also, it elicited an immune response which was higher for the influenza A [strain], and A was higher, meaning that it has the potential to add superior immune response to the currently available vaccines which are standard of care, and has the potential to have a non-inferior response to the standard of care for the B influenza strains. Now, it is important, particularly the A, because the A strains are the ones which are associated with the highest hospitalization rates, for example, everywhere around the world. So, this is very promising.Aislinn Antrim: Wonderful. And how can mRNA flu vaccines offer new protection for patients and what does this approach change about flu vaccines?Francesca Ceddia, MD: Well, first of all, we have to think that of the currently available [vaccines] there is an unmet need still in the influenza world. Because despite the fact that there are a number of vaccines available, the efficacy of this vaccine is not the greatest. You know, when you have a well-matched year for the influenza strain, you can get between 40% to 60% vaccine efficacy, which is not really super high efficacy. Thanks to the construct of the mRNA vaccine, we have the opportunity eventually to rapidly adjust. For example, if there is a mismatch in late season, this is something that you can do with mRNA because you can produce a vaccine very quickly, but you cannot really do that with a traditional vaccine. So, with traditional vaccines, it may take up to 6 months to develop the vaccine. For mRNA vaccines, you can do this in 3 to 4 months. So, that's a major, major advantage.And the other thing, and this is what is in our pipeline and what we're trying to do, is having the potential to add additional strains, including additional antigens, like neuraminidase that are more conserved antigens and have the ability to drift less than the traditional antigens that are contained currently in the vaccines. So, speed, reliability of supply, [and] ability to include additional antigens are all advantages for the mRNA vaccines. And particularly, we believe that we have the potential to demonstrate superior responses, particularly, as I said before today, relative to the standard of care.Related VideosRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 9th 2024Staying in the Know: Pharmacists, Drug Shortages, and What Lies AheadOlivia Riggi, PharmD CandidateSeptember 19th 2024Public Health Matters: The Difference Between Misinformation and Disinformation, and How Information Can Inform Evidence-Based DecisionsNovember 8th 2024Researchers Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Brivudine as Oral Shingles Treatment Kennedy Ferruggia, Assistant EditorAugust 22nd 2024Public Health Matters: Healthcare Advocate Summit Emphasizes Advocates Have a Voice in Creating SolutionsNovember 8th 2024Moderna Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine More Effective at Preventing Hospitalization in High-Risk Patients Compared With Pfizer-BioNTech VaccineLuke Halpern, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024History of Concussion Associated With Higher Risk of Adverse Psychiatric Outcomes PostpartumGillian McGovern, Assistant EditorRelated Content AdvertisementNovember 9th 2024Staying in the Know: Pharmacists, Drug Shortages, and What Lies AheadOlivia Riggi, PharmD CandidateSeptember 19th 2024Public Health Matters: The Difference Between Misinformation and Disinformation, and How Information Can Inform Evidence-Based DecisionsNovember 8th 2024Researchers Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Brivudine as Oral Shingles Treatment Kennedy Ferruggia, Assistant EditorAugust 22nd 2024Public Health Matters: Healthcare Advocate Summit Emphasizes Advocates Have a Voice in Creating SolutionsNovember 8th 2024Moderna Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine More Effective at Preventing Hospitalization in High-Risk Patients Compared With Pfizer-BioNTech VaccineLuke Halpern, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024History of Concussion Associated With Higher Risk of Adverse Psychiatric Outcomes PostpartumGillian McGovern, Assistant EditorConsent PreferencesAbout UsClinical ForumsAdvertiseContact UsEditorial StaffPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDo Not Sell My InformationContact Info2 Commerce Drive Cranbury, NJ 08512609-716-7777© 2024 MJH Life Sciences All rights reserved.Egyptian Health Ministry advise citizens to obtain seasonal flu vaccine - EgyptToday News Business Arts & Culture Our Magazine Sports ET Scenes Haya Karima News Business Arts & Culture ET Scenes Our magazine Sports Egyptian Health Ministry advise citizens to obtain seasonal flu vaccine BY Egypt Today staff - Tue, 16 Aug 2022 - 10:11 GMT BY Egypt Today staff Tue, 16 Aug 2022 - 10:11 GMT Chairman of Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Clinical Center, Csaba Lengyel shows a vial of the Sinopharm coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at the University in Szeged, Hungary, February 24, 2021s CAIRO - 16 August 2022: The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population assured that obtaining the annual influenza vaccine this year provides protection against 4 types of influenza viruses expected to spread this season. Hossam Abdel Ghaffar, spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population, said in statements that Vaccination is especially important for people who are most vulnerable to complications from influenza, including “pregnant women,” “the elderly,” “young children,” and “people with weak immune systems.” There are things that may increase the risk of complications from influenza such as “asthma” and “diabetes” in addition to patients with cancer or those who are being treated from it, as well as health conditions related to the brain and nervous system, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart, obesity, cystic fibrosis, patients with kidney, liver and HIV Humans and AIDS. Dr. Hossam Abdel Ghaffar revealed that the formation of immunity takes approximately two weeks after receiving the vaccine, but the body can benefit from the vaccine even if you take it after the start of the flu season. “The seasonal influenza vaccine is given starting from the age of 6 months, and for those who are the first time to receive the vaccine, and their age is between 6 months to 9 years, with two doses, one month apart, and for those aged 9 years and over, one dose.” He added that the dose is fixed for all ages. It is 1/2 ml (full dose), regardless of age or number of doses. Dr. Hossam Abdel Ghaffar appealed to citizens to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine for the winter season at Vacsera, adding that the influenza vaccine is old and well-known, and its efficiency in preventing disease is from 50 to 60 percent, and its efficiency in severe infection is from 80 to 90 percent. Abdel Ghaffar said, “There are no contraindications to receiving the seasonal flu vaccine, except in the case of an allergy to the vaccine compounds. He called on everyone, the elderly, young and others, to receive the vaccine as long as there is nothing to prevent it, pointing out that the availability of the vaccine in the pharmacy does not mean receiving it there, noting that the drug must be taken by a doctor, and receiving vaccinations in pharmacies is prohibited by law.

Two of the birds in Nunavut that may have had avian influenza are herring gulls. (Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)Social SharingThree birds in Nunavut are thought to have died from avian influenza recently.On Friday, the territorial government announced a third suspected case of the flu. The first two were announced Aug. 5.The most recent case was detected in a herring gull on Tukarak Island near Sanikiluaq, a community of about 1,000 people. That's south of Coats Island, where one of the other cases was detected in a live thick-billed murre. The flu has also been detected in a herring gull near Cambridge Bay.All of the cases have been reported to the Nunavut government from the federal government's Canadian Wildlife Service.Cases of avian influenza have now been reported in all provinces and territories except for the N.W.T.In a public health advisory Friday, Nunavut's Department of Health said the risk to humans is low, but people should take precautions when handling wild birds. Generally speaking, cases of transmission to humans happen through close, lengthy contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to people if they eat fully cooked birds or eggs.People should wear gloves, wash their hands with soap and water, and clean dirty clothes and equipment as soon as possible if they harvest wild birds and eggs, the department stated.Signs that birds may have avian flu include nervousness, trembling or lack of co-ordination, swelling around the head, neck and eyes, and diarrhea or sudden death.If you come across more than one dead bird in an area, that's a sign the virus is present too.If you feel sick after handling a bird, you should contact your local health centre. If you notice unusual death or illness in birds, you can contact the local conservation office for your community.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Goose hunters in Nunavut asked to report odd bird behaviour in case it's avian flu Not just chickens: In Ontario, bird flu has killed bald eagles, Canada geese — and juvenile red foxesFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

File | Photo Credit: The Hindu photo library Along with a host of viral and vector-borne ailments, Karnataka is also under the grip of H1N1 influenza. Last year, when the second wave of COVID-19 had overwhelmed the State’s infrastructure, only 13 H1N1 cases were reported. However, this year cases have shot up to 409 in the first eight months itself.According to data from the State Health and Family Welfare Department, a total of 458 H1N1 cases and three deaths were reported in 2020 when the pandemic began. However, in 2021, cases reduced to 13 and doctors attributed the decline to increased surveillance and COVID-19 precautions such as use of masks and social distancing.H1N1 influenza is a subtype of Influenza ‘A’ virus, a communicable viral illness which causes upper and, in some cases, lower respiratory tract infection. This results in symptoms such as nasal secretions, chills, fever, decreased appetite, and, in some cases, lower respiratory tract disease. According to data, this year so far 1,621 samples have been tested (from January till August 19) of which 409 have tested positive. Last year, although 2,032 samples were tested, only 13 had tested positive. Over 50% of this year’s total H1N1 cases have been recorded in the last two months. Udupi has reported the highest number with 200 cases as H1N1 testing was done only at Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR) for the first few months. “Although there are 12 designated laboratories for H1N1 testing across the State, in the first quarter of 2022 testing was being done only in MCVR,” sources said.ILI/SARI testingState Health Commissioner Randeep D. attributed the rise in cases to increased testing of primary contacts, especially in clusters and among ILI/SARI patients at hospitals.“We have given standing instructions to hospitals to compulsorily test all ILI/SARI patients for H1N1, admit patients on time, and commence symptomatic treatment,” he said.C. Nagaraja, director of the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said the virus exhibits seasonality and there could be more cases during the winter and post monsoon months. “We have been regularly testing ILI/SARI patients for H1N1 if they test negative for COVID-19 as both these diseases have similar manifestations. Last year, cases were low because people largely followed COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Now, complacency has set in. It is advisable people wear masks and maintain hand hygiene at least in crowded areas,” he said.Satyanarayana Mysore asserts need for Influenza vaccinationSatyanarayana Mysore, chairman of the Department of Pulmonology at Manipal Hospitals, asserted the need for Influenza vaccination. “Senior citizens and those with co-morbidities should speak to their healthcare providers if they are eligible for vaccination. Those with pre-existing lung disease such as asthma, bronchitis, and smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are potential candidates for the Influenza vaccine,” he said.He said that there should be a gap of at least 30 days between the COVID-19 and the Influenza vaccinations.

He added that one shot of the vaccine costs 190 EGP plus EGP 10 for service fees, noting that the cold chain transportation guarantees the safety of the vaccines until being distributed nationwide. Influenza vaccine is effective in preventing infection with the disease from 50 to 60%, he continued. Vacsera is proceeding to localize the pharmaceutical industry in the country, according to the directives of the political leadership, said Chairman of the Board of Directors Dr. Heba Wali. Dr. Wali noted that the authority is seeking to put Egypt on the map of the global pharmaceutical market, through pharmaceutical manufacturing investments. In this regard, she added that two factories are currently being established for human and veterinary vaccines. Dr. Heba Wali further said that a huge infrastructure is being prepared for pharmaceutical manufacturing and securing medicine for all Egyptians, noting that the company aims to produce 8 major vaccines through the manufacturing technology transfer agreement concluded between the Indian company Serm, one of the largest vaccine manufacturers in the world, and Vacsera. The head of the Holding Company for Biological Products and Vaccines explained that "the vaccine complex produces vaccines for dogs, snakes, scorpions, snakes and tetanus, and also owns a factory for the production of human insulin," adding that 30 million doses of the Corona vaccine were produced in accordance with the agreement signed with China, noting that these vaccines are of high quality and can be exported abroad after meeting the needs of the country. The Vacsera factory complex, located in October city, is scheduled to produce 400 million doses of veterinary vaccines for bird flu, in addition to 7 other vaccines related to animal production. The complex can produce 300 million doses of human vaccines, including Corona vaccines, through a factory and a line Production of human vaccines packaging, she added. "We have provided 8 production control laboratories included in the complex, equipped with the latest devices for measuring production quality in the various stages of manufacturing, with the storage capacity of the cold storage complex for vaccines exceeds 150 million doses," Dr. Wali added. She stressed that thanks to the support and guidance of the political leadership, "Egypt has become among the 6 leading countries in the field of vaccine transfer and manufacturing technology." "Egypt is about to become a regional center for the production and manufacture of local vaccines on the African continent, in addition to being an important center in the field of vaccine preservation and refrigeration technology," Dr. Wali said. She pointed to the importance of the role of the logistics complex in raising the Egyptian capabilities in the field of vaccine preservation, as the logistics cooling complex will be the largest complex for preserving vaccines on the level of the African continent, stressing the importance of confronting the Corona virus and various epidemic diseases.

Pandemic response measures not only helped keep the coronavirus at bay, but also had the effect of curbing the spread of other respiratory illnesses like the common cold and influenza. But as restrictions are relaxed or lifted with the widespread use of vaccines and antivirals, several viruses and bacteria are now making a comeback. It makes sense that measures targeted at preventing COVID-19 reduced the spread of infections transmitted via respiratory droplets. People stopped travelling, worked from home, wore masks and stayed in when unwell. Combined data from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital showed that most non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses nearly disappeared by April and May 2020, when Singapore went into a "circuit breaker" period. People wearing masks cross the road at South Bridge Road in Singapore on Feb 22, 2022. (Photo: CNA/Gaya Chandramohan) With the reopening in phases in late 2020, some respiratory viruses gradually returned, though not at pre-pandemic levels, since mask-wearing in public continued. Amid concerns about the Delta and Omicron variant waves in the second half of 2021 and early months of 2022, healthcare professionals saw non-COVID respiratory illness levels drop again after response measures were tightened and subsequently come up when eased. Similar effects were seen overseas. Also, the usual flu seasons were absent. RETURN OF CHILDHOOD RESPIRATORY VIRUSES NOT SURPRISING The return of respiratory viruses is not surprising to healthcare experts. The first ones to return, in late 2020, were the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses which usually cause mild common colds. Then, early 2021 saw a reappearance of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and some parainfluenza viruses, both of which may cause more serious illness in young children, such as bronchiolitis or croup, which has a distinctive barking cough. What is surprising is the unusual pattern of activity of viruses that usually have a predictable seasonality. In Australia, the United States and Europe, waves of RSV infections were recorded outside the traditional winter months. Several countries, at some point, reported that RSV waves were stretching the capacity of children’s hospitals that were already under pressure from COVID-19. Related: Commentary: Must we choose between being a parent or employee when kids fall sick? Commentary: Parental concerns brewing ahead of approval for COVID-19 vaccinations for kids under 12 Another observation was that RSV infections occurred in older children, whereas before the pandemic, children less than one-year-old were mostly affected. In some locations, the numbers of RSV infections even surpassed those of COVID-19 paediatric infections at times. What might explain these changes? Due to all the pandemic response measures, young children, including those born during the pandemic, have had much less exposure to common respiratory viruses than same-age children in pre-pandemic years. This created an “immunity debt” towards previously common infections, meaning that the lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic left children more susceptible to various infections. INFLUENZA AND OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS MIGHT LIE AHEAD Can we expect to see other respiratory illnesses make a comeback? Probably. Influenza viruses (there are A and B strains) nearly disappeared during the pandemic, and only a small number of influenza infections were observed again in the first half of 2022, according to data from KKH. These numbers are expected to rise in the second half of 2022; Australia is currently experiencing a substantial rise in influenza infections, and international travel is likely to bring this to Singapore soon. Related: Commentary: COVID-19 restrictions keep our kids safe but their friendships take a hit Commentary: Flu will return with vengeance after all-time low during COVID-19 Before the pandemic, KKH regularly diagnosed bacterial respiratory infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia predominantly in children) and Bordetella pertussis (the agent of classical whooping cough). These infections also disappeared during the 2020 circuit breaker and have not reappeared up until mid-2022. Parents may also be concerned about children getting multiple infections. In June, Singapore recorded the first paediatric COVID-19 death in a one-and-a-half-year-old boy who had COVID-19, RSV and enterovirus infections. With Singapore recording a seven-day moving average of 3,750 COVID-19 cases (as of Aug 18) and yet another Omicron subvariant, various respiratory viruses are also returning with relaxation of some of the earlier pandemic measures. LIVING WITH RESPIRATORY VIRUSES What does this all mean for us in Singapore? Respiratory viruses have been with us for a very long time and are part of what helps train our immune systems and those of our children. It is their absence, rather than presence, that is an unusual state. Their return after the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic should be seen as part of the return to normality.

Here's how to do it But we should still take precautionary measures and stay vigilant, due to the possibility of severe illnesses in some children and vulnerable adults. This means we should take good care of ourselves and our children and seek medical care if infections look to become more serious. Signs to look out for in children are worsening or persistent fever, lethargy or drowsiness, persistent cough, breathlessness, chest pain, poor oral intake, poor urine output, or seizures. It is also recommended that we keep our influenza vaccinations up to date. Anyone above six months of age can obtain their influenza vaccination at their local general practitioner (GP) clinic or polyclinic. COVID-19 may have changed the way we think of and live with viruses, and we should keep up some of the habits we have picked up along the way.

How should you handle fever at home?Kalpana Sharma / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Aug 17, 2022, 15:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us While infections are rampant during the monsoon season, this year however seems to be different with a surge in several viruses at the same time. Staying indoors during COVID prevented us from getting normal viral infections, a sort of âinfection honeymoonâ. Is your child falling sick too frequently? Is she missing school because of her health? Is he often getting down with flu-like symptoms where some symptoms like cough take excruciatingly long to go? Well, if thatâs the case, you are not alone. All parents are busy consulting pediatricians these days because of the increased frequency of illnesses in kids.We all know that respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, typhoid, malaria and dengue are common during the monsoon season but to explore if the bout of infections this year are a normal occurrence or something that parents should be worried about, we spoke to two leading pediatricians. According to Dr. Mahesh Balsekar, Sr. Consultant (Pediatric Medicine), SRCC Children's Hospital, managed by Narayana Health, âWhile infections are rampant during the monsoon season, this year however seems to be different with a surge in several viruses at the same time. Staying indoors during COVID prevented us from getting normal viral infections, a sort of âinfection honeymoonâ. There are concerns that this may have reduced our immunity and may account for the surge in infections this year.âTalking about the commonly reported symptoms and health issues, Dr. Vineet Kwatra, Senior Consultant, Pediatrics, Medanta Hospital shares, âThese days we are finding children coming with high grade fever, coughs and colds. They are also coming with high grade fever lasting for more than 5-7 days which is no doubt turning out to be typhoid and a few dengue cases. This time we have also been seeing cases of Scrub typhus, where kids have high grade fever lasting for more than 5-7 days and not getting ok even with the regular antibiotics. We are not getting any swine flu cases as of now but yes, COVID cases among children have risen and we have seen patients with normal flu like symptoms in children turning out to be COVID positive but the good thing is that all these cases have been mild in nature as they were earlier.â âThe common infections we are seeing are COVID, hand foot mouth disease, Influenza A, Swine Flu, gastroenteritis and bronchiolitis. We are also seeing dengue and a bit of typhoid and malaria,â adds Dr Balsekar. How should the onset of fever be treated?Panic strikes the moment parents see the child has fever. And thatâs when most of us start self medicating to control it. Dr Kwatra suggests that parents should take fever seriously at home even if itâs a one day mild fever. The reason being that all the diseases which the pediatricians are seeing during this season present with a mild fever cough, cold, loose motions, vomiting and later progress to uncontrolled fever. âI would thus suggest to parents that if you find the fever is persistently there for more than 2 days, not coming down with any of the fever medications, donât wait at home, please consult your pediatrician. Secondly, how to treat fever at home? First and foremost thing for a parent to do at home is keep the basic medications of fever at home like paracetamol. Paracetamol can be given as early as 4 hrs to every 6 hrs. Now even if the fever is not coming down with paracetamol, start sponging the child with tap water! Please not donât use ice packs or cold water - it should be normal flowing tap water used for sponging. Even if the fever persists, the best way to get the fever down is by giving a bath to your child with normal flowing water. If the fever still persists for another 24 hrs, please visit your doctor as I have advised before.âRead more: Lesser known symptoms of anxiety in kidsDr Balsekar recommends that fevers need to be treated only if a child is uncomfortable, usually when the fever is above 101 F under arm. âParents should avoid trying to bring the temperature to normal and âbreakâ the fever because this leads to overmedication. Keeping the child in a cool room, lightly clothed and well hydrated is important. Most fevers are due to mild viral infections that settle in 2-3 days. If the child looks comfortable and well, the fever responds to fever medications, and there are no worrisome symptoms, it is reasonable to wait for 48 hours before seeing a doctor. However, any fever in young infants needs medical attention. Older children need to see a doctor if the fever is high or looks sick or has other worrisome symptoms. Any fever which is worsening or does not settle in 2-3 days similarly needs a doctorâs attention.âThe importance of Influenza vaccinationThe Indian Academy of Pediatrics recommends the âFluâ or Influenza vaccine to all children after 6 months of age and is advised every year till age 5. Older children are given the Flu vaccine only if they have reduced immunity or chronic diseases. During the COVID pandemic however, it has been suggested that older children should also be offered the Flu vaccine. âIt should be very clear with the parents that this vaccination will not cover all kinds of flu in the air, but it surely helps to build the immunity of our children against the deadly flu viruses which includes the Swine flu. So in my suggestion, everyone should take a flu shot since prevention is always better than cure,â adds Dr Kwatra. How to build immunityA healthy diet plays a crucial role in upping immunity. But along with a good diet, daily physical activity, ample sleep, proper management of stress are some other important aspects of keeping a child healthy. Make sure they are given all the important vaccines on time and take proper health precautions to avoid exposure to illnesses.
