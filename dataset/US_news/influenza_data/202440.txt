Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza. Flu Vaccine A number of flu vaccines will be available this season. These include: injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include: Flu shots that are made with inactivated influenza viruses. One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses. A live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray. People who can get the flu shot Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza. Flu vaccination has important benefits. It can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor's offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. Get vaccinated before flu season starts‎ It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body. Recommended vaccines depend on a person's age and other characteristics There are standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines that are approved for people as young as 6 months of age. Some vaccines are only approved for adults. For example, the recombinant flu vaccine is approved for people 18 years and older, and the adjuvanted and high-dose inactivated vaccines are approved for people 65 years and older. For people younger than 65 years, CDC does not recommend any one flu vaccine over another. For adults 65 years and older, there are 3 flu vaccines that are preferentially recommended. These are Fluzone High-Dose inactivated flu vaccine, Flublok recombinant flu vaccine, and Fluad adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine. If none of the 3 flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people 65 years and older is available at the time of administration, people in this age group can get any other age-appropriate flu vaccine instead. For many people who are 2 years through 49 years of age, the nasal spray flu vaccine is an option. The nasal spray vaccine is not recommended for some groups, such as people who are pregnant and people with some medical conditions. In general, each person should get an age-appropriate flu vaccine (that is, one that is approved for their age). However, solid organ transplant recipients who are 18 through 64 years of age and who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens may receive high-dose inactivated flu vaccine or adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine (which are currently approved for people ages 65 years and older). These vaccines are not preferred over other age-appropriate flu vaccines but are acceptable options for this population. High-dose inactivated flu vaccine, recombinant flu vaccine, and adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine are preferred for people 65 years of age and older. There are no other preferential recommendations for specific flu vaccines for specific groups of people. Keep Reading: Vaccines and People with Egg AllergiesThere are many vaccine options Pregnant people and people with certain chronic health conditions should get a flu shot. People with egg allergy may get any vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. Beginning with the 2023-2024 season, additional safety measures are no longer recommended for flu vaccination of people with an egg allergy beyond those recommended for receipt of any vaccine, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg. The most important thing is for all people 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. When to get vaccinated against flu For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additional considerations concerning the timing of vaccination for certain groups of people include: Most adults, especially those 65 years and older, and pregnant people in the first or second trimester should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time. However, early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated. Some children need two doses of influenza vaccine. For those children, it is recommended that the first dose be given as soon as vaccine is available because the second dose needs to be given at least four weeks after the first. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for children who need only one dose. Vaccination during July and August also can be considered for people who are in the third trimester of pregnancy during those months, because this can help protect their infants for the first few months after birth (when they are too young to be vaccinated). People who SHOULD NOT get a flu shot Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot. People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you. People who should talk to their health care provider before getting a flu shot Different influenza vaccines are approved for use in people in different age groups. In addition, some vaccines are not recommended for certain groups of people. Factors that can determine a person’s suitability for vaccination, or vaccination with a particular vaccine, include a person’s age, health (current and past) and any allergies to influenza vaccine or its components. Children younger than 6 months of age are too young to get a flu shot. People with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine (other than egg proteins) should not get that vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine in the past, it is important to talk with your health care provider to help determine whether vaccination is appropriate for you. Prioritized for flu vaccination during a vaccine shortage When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing): Children aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months); People aged 50 years and olderA; People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); People who are immunosuppressed due to any cause, including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; People who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season and people up to 2 weeks postpartum (after delivery); People who are aged 6 months through 18 years who are receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; People who are residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities; American Indian or Alaska Native persons; People with extreme obesity (body-mass index [BMI] is 40 or greater); Health care personnel; Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years and adults 50 years and older; and Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at increased risk for severe illness from influenza.

Toggle navigation About ASPR Newsroom FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, October 4, 2024 Contact ASPR Press OfficeASPRMedia@hhs.govaspr.hhs.govewsroomX:@ASPRgov ASPR takes next steps to prepare vaccine against H5 influenza ASPR provides approximately $72 million to CSL Seqirus, Sanofi, and GSK to boost U.S. preparedness The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response’s (ASPR) Center for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is providing approximately $72 million to CSL Seqirus, Sanofi, and GSK to complete the next steps in influenza A(H5) vaccine manufacturing as part of national preparedness. “This announcement is an illustration of the work we do at ASPR everyday to help the country prepare for and respond to disease outbreaks,” said Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell. “These awards ensure the country has access to additional pandemic influenza vaccines should they be needed now or in the future.” Under existing agreements, CSL Seqirus, Sanofi, and GSK will fill and finish additional doses of their influenza A(H5) vaccines from bulk storage into ready-to-use vials or pre-filled syringes so that vaccine will be ready to distribute if needed. The companies also will manufacture additional bulk influenza antigen - the component of vaccines that stimulates an immune response - from seed stocks that are well matched to circulating strains. In addition, Sanofi will preserve a continuous domestic egg supply so that the company is ready to manufacture egg-based influenza vaccine, such as H5 influenza vaccine, at any time of the year. BARDA has worked with Sanofi since 2006 to ensure the ongoing capability to produce egg-based pandemic influenza vaccines year-round. “Although the risk to Americans from influenza A(H5) virus infection remains low, we’re leaning forward with our preparedness efforts,” said BARDA Director and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “As influenza A(H5) virus infections in domesticated animals continue to spread, the risk for human infection could rise. In an abundance of caution, we are taking steps to increase the amount of vaccine that could be immediately available if needed.” These preparedness activities began in 2022 as soon as the first H5N1 influenza case was identified in Colorado. The steps announced today further strengthen and sustain the nation’s preparedness should vaccine be needed for any future influenza-related public health emergency. Commonly called ‘bird flu,’ high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause serious illness and fatalities in domestic poultry and other wild birds and can spread to other species, as currently seen in U.S. dairy cattle. Recent influenza A(H5) infections in dairy farm workers and poultry workers in the U.S. have resulted in mild illness without spreading through the household or community. Separately, BARDA is providing $121.4 million to CSL Seqirus for general pandemic influenza preparedness and vendor managed inventory (VMI) of additional adjuvant of the company’s H5 influenza vaccine. Adjuvant is used in some vaccines to help create a stronger immune response for people receiving the vaccine and can allow vaccines to be made with less antigen to aid in protecting more people in an influenza pandemic. Since inception in 2006, BARDA has partnered with influenza vaccine manufacturers to support pandemic influenza preparedness and domestic rapid response capabilities. BARDA also oversees the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS), created in 2005 as part of the Influenza & Emerging Infectious Diseases - Pandemic Vaccines and Adjuvants Program. Through this program, BARDA constantly monitors epidemiological data to assess risk and rapidly evaluate, refine, and update vaccine preparedness inventories. The awards announced today are part of the BARDA’s Pandemic Vaccines and Adjuvants medical countermeasure portfolio and support the ASPR/BARDA Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy and the National Pandemic Strategy.

Cordle THE STATELY 23-STORY HOTEL OPENED AT the height of the Jazz Age, but less than a year later, Wall Street’s 1929 crash snuffed out revelry in the opulent ballroom and secret speakeasy. That’s when the property, then one of Baltimore’s tallest buildings, supposedly began accumulating ghosts: failed businessmen, wiped-out tycoons, even a bankrupt couple reputed to have jumped to their deaths on a downtown street with their young daughter. Today, as tour groups try to detect the spectral child bouncing her ball down the halls of the hotel, University of Maryland researchers and colleagues are using the location to track an unseen presence that’s more substantial—and threatening. Each year, according to the World Health Organization, seasonal influenza respiratory infections kill up to 650,000 people; while science has pinned down much of the biology of flu and other dangerous viruses, it hasn’t yet provided a precise account of how they’re passed from person to person to cause illness—or clear answers about preventing their spread. Did you get flu from a dirty doorknob or a sneeze in the face? Or as recent research from UMD and other sources suggests, do airborne viruses “haunt” indoor air around infected people, waiting to be breathed deep into the lungs? As part of an audacious bid to put such questions to rest, paid volunteers have checked into a sealed-off floor of the hotel (which the managers asked not to be identified) over the past two winters, with more on the way this winter. During stays of up to two weeks, they’re participating in a randomized, controlled trial with a surprising objective: to spread, or catch, the flu for science. Supported by $20 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health and Balvi Filantropic Fund, the study could fundamentally alter how health authorities and the public fight respiratory infections. It brings together a multidisciplinary team from UMD’s School of Public Health and A. James Clark School of Engineering, and the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, led by UMD MPower Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health Donald K. Milton. He has spent much of his 40-year career analyzing airborne pathogens and advocating, at times controversially, for society to take greater precautions. It took the COVID pandemic—when he played a pivotal role in overturning national and global health authorities’ opposition to masking to stop airborne viruses—for his ideas to gain greater traction. But that was a little too late to avoid disastrous shutdowns of schools and other societal institutions. “I tried to find a way to avoid this calamity, but here we are,” he told Terp in mid-2020. “Maybe this tragedy will get us past our fear of the idea of airborne transmission and prepare to control it, which could help us to avoid all this next time.” Midway through his flu study, Milton finds himself in the odd spot of rooting for a virus—within the walls of the hotel—that he’s fought for decades. INVISIBLE THREAT Indoor air is about 90% of all the air most of us breathe, Milton said, so he frequently keeps track of what’s in his. In his office in the School of Public Health Building, Milton reaches over and plops a device on his desk reminiscent of a small digital clock. At the beginning of our interview, the big number on its LCD screen reads a little over 400, but some 45 minutes later, the number has risen dramatically. Our breath as we spoke boosted carbon dioxide in the room to nearly 700 parts per million. While the CO2 concentration itself is not a health hazard—even at much higher concentrations, like at a 2022 Maryland Public Health Association meeting he attended that had levels well over 2,000 parts per million—it’s a worrying sign. The amount of CO2 in the air indicates the risk of infectious viruses floating around, according to a mathematical model Milton proposed with the late Stephen Rudnick of Harvard Medical School in an influential 2003 paper rejected by Science but published in Indoor Air. Respiratory disease has shadowed Milton’s life. He grew up in the Baltimore area in the 1950s and ’60s, when factories and mills still crowded Sparrows Point and other parts of the city and belched pollution into the air far thicker than any hovering around Charm City today. As children, he and his two sisters watched their mother struggle with bronchiectasis, a condition that involves recurring, painful bouts of bronchitis and airway infection, and caused her death in 1995. “I think I may have gravitated toward studying respiratory issues from wondering as a child why my mother couldn’t get out of bed, what we could do to help her.” He graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and later earned a doctorate in public health from Harvard. While serving as a practicing physician in environmental and occupational medicine, Milton began focusing on indoor air quality. One tragedy in particular—the death of a woman who had been among several workers in a badly ventilated room who developed adult-onset asthma—galvanized his direction in medicine and public health. Her body was discovered in her home, clutching a rescue inhaler. “That indelible image and the failure of medical treatments to save my patient keeps me focused on the importance of indoor air,” he said. CLEARING THE AIR Many prominent physicians (not to mention the disinfecting wipe industry—“kills 99.9% of viruses and bacteria!”) still hew to the idea that the primary routes of infection are through the spray of a sneeze or cough directly into the face, or onto a surface to be transferred by touch to the mouth, eyes or nose. The developing idea that “aerosols,” fine particles that can remain suspended in the air for considerable periods, can hold enough exhaled virus to cause infection was increasingly bringing Milton into conflict with the medical establishment. One of Milton’s papers, which examined the possibilities of airborne smallpox soon after the 2001 attacks with the deadly anthrax bacteria when there was concern about bioweapons in Iraq, was met with livid responses from reviewers, including charges he was a “quack and a charlatan,” he said. Professor Donald Milton poses with the Gesundheit II machine. To prove his point about what’s in the air, he developed a machine, which he named Gesundheit II; the vaguely steampunk assemblage of tubes and gauges leads to a Victrola-like horn into which visitors to his Public Health AeroBiology Laboratory stick their faces so the machine can capture their breaths and extract viruses. In a 2013 study published in PloS Pathogens, he used it to demonstrate flu virus could be captured from infected people’s breath and cultivated. The paper also showed that surgical masks reduced the amount of influenza virus escaping into the air from an infected person by 70%. A past collaborator of Milton’s, Raymond Tellier, an associate professor and microbiologist at McGill University in Montreal, said the backlash against Milton in part stems from scientific disputes stretching back to the early 20th century, when doctors fought unscientific beliefs about “miasma,” or unhealthy night air thought to cause everything from cholera to the bubonic plague. The idea led to measures that encouraged disease, such as buildings designed to prevent ventilation with outside air; while such thinking has been universally rejected, its echoes remain, he said. “The idea of aerosols with virus particles was being lumped together with the old reaction against the miasma theory,” said Tellier, who adds that today those who refuse to consider Milton’s ideas are the ones ignoring science. Milton also attributes some of the reaction to hospital administrators’ unwillingness to swallow the cost of air cleaning or issuing masks that are more protective—and expensive—than surgical masks. But the resistance is underlain by the idea that “this is how we’ve always done it,” he said. “It’s dogma, not science,” he said. “I’m allergic to dogma.” As the COVID-19 pandemic began, Milton watched with dismay as his work seemed to have little effect on what medical and public health authorities were telling people; masking was initially widely dismissed, and social distancing, handwashing and even wiping down supermarket purchases were presented as the best means to stay COVID-free. But in March 2020, Milton and several co-authors posted a paper online that was soon published in Nature Medicine. The study used Gesundheit II to confirm that surgical masks could stop coronaviruses as well as influenza when worn by infected people. Its impact was life-changing for much of the world: Mask use soon became widespread—even mandatory in many places—perhaps signaling a growing open-mindedness about the route of transmission Milton had been focused on for two decades. He quickly became a standby source for journalists covering COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, spoke to the White House and Congress, and served on an increasing number of global public health advisory boards. “Although his contributions are now widely recognized, Don has not received the accolades that he has deserved,” said Jonathan M. Samet, professor and former dean of the Colorado School of Public Health. “It took a pandemic ... for his work to finally receive an appropriate level of attention, given its implications.” HIGH-RISK, HIGH-REWARD Milton’s latest major study began in 2021 with $15 million in funding from the National Institutes for Health, although fieldwork at the hotel didn’t kick off until late 2022. For the first time, it joins a full range of scientific elements and expertise to document in detail a flu transmission, said Professor Jelena Srebric, the Margaret G. and Frederick H. Kohloss Chair in Mechanical Engineering, an expert in indoor air quality and computational fluid dynamics, and one of Milton’s co-principal investigators. “Of course, you can’t actually see individual viruses causing someone to be infected, but the design of this study will give more understanding of every step along the way than we have ever had before,” Srebric said. “We’ll know what made you sick and what didn’t make you sick.” Researchers and students from Milton’s lab test technology used to track participants in the flu study’s common room by playing a dancing video game. Unlike other controlled trials of virus transmission, the hotel-based one calls for flu recipients to quarantine in their rooms—reading, working remotely, watching TV—when they’re not being intentionally exposed to infected flu “donors.” Previous hospital-based studies that discount the importance of airborne transmission didn’t take steps to ensure people weren’t picking up the virus at home or elsewhere. As a result, they mean little, Milton contends. In the Baltimore hotel study, participants are brought together in a common room at intervals throughout the day to play cards and board games, do yoga or belt out renditions of “Baby Got Back” and “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from Disney’s “Mulan” in karaoke. Among other tightly controlled factors, Srebric and colleagues are testing different room ventilation rates to see if cleaner air results in fewer infections via the airborne route. To examine other modes of infection, randomly chosen participants use hand sanitizer and wear face shields to prevent viruses from being propelled into their nose, eyes or mouth from coughs or sneezes, and to prevent them from touching their faces; others are unprotected. All participants are then instructed to pass digital devices and other common objects around to test touch as a route of infection. Constant rapid PCR testing, using machines donated by the Balvi Filantropic Fund, keeps track of who has the flu and who doesn’t, while the Gesundheit II allows researchers to measure how much virus donors put in the air; molecular sequencing at NIH tracks what strain virus donors bring in. A team led by School of Medicine Professor Wilbur Chen, an infectious disease physician-scientist, oversees the medical testing while keeping constant tabs on the well-being of participants; another led by mechanical engineering Professor Don Devoe focuses on creating novel testing devices and technology for analyzing airborne viruses. In another element of the experiment funded by the Balvi gift, which invests widely in respiratory infectious disease research, the researchers will test whether a new type of germicidal ultraviolet light devices prevents infections. That would support the theory that the flu virus is transmitted in room air and provide a silent and energy-efficient way to sanitize indoor air. All told, the extremely complex project could change how the world thinks about infection, or it could go off the rails. In the experiment’s first year, an unusually early flu season struck before the team was ready to quarantine participants; last year saw several flu donors, but with a dearth of recipients—just 11 in total, despite room for nearly 50—the illness hung back in the shadows like a shy ghost. No volunteer recipients tested positive for the flu virus during quarantine, although one later showed chemical markers of an infection in a blood test. And in an illustration of the challenges of human studies, another participant who developed mild symptoms despite testing negative never returned to confirm whether they had been infected. Ironically, to better fight the flu, the research team needs the flu to do better this winter. “We are going to do everything we can, so all those hotel rooms are filled,” Milton said. “The point is to get more people exposed for more time.” A former colleague at Harvard Medical School uninvolved with the current study said Milton’s scientific reputation and administrative abilities helped him secure funding for a type of study that is rare in the world of science. “It says something about Don that he’s able to launch these human-to-human transmission clinical trials,” said Edward Nardell, a physician who specializes in tuberculosis research. “These are high-risk studies—and high-reward if they succeed.” ‘LIKE SUMMER CAMP’ Soon-to-graduate UMD student Priscila Terry was entertaining competing thoughts when she arrived in the sumptuous hotel lobby in February: The information science major was unhappy that her sick roommate had coughed freely around their apartment—including directly into a fan as she slept—the likely source of Terry’s flu. On the other hand, the payment involved—donor participants in the trial receive up to $1,900, while recipients can receive $2,500—would allow her to repay her parents for the fee they’d covered when she canceled a semester abroad to graduate early. And she was wrestling with the complex ethics of medical trials, particularly those meant to induce illness: “I was always taught you should try avoiding coughing on people—it’s gross. It’s inconsiderate. But now I was supposed to make people sick.” Qualms like Terry’s were unnecessary, said Lehua Gray, who also participated in a February quarantine. The 36-year-old digital user experience designer from Baltimore County first signed up for so-called “challenge trials”—where scientists manually infect participants—to help develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but was not chosen. While Milton’s airborne transmission hypothesis lacks the electricity of the high-stakes fight against the pandemic, the deep scientific and policy questions involved quickly grabbed her. One of the most surprising aspects of the experience to Gray was the bond that the recipients developed during their activities over their two weeks—“like summer camp.” Several have since stayed in touch, even meeting for drinks and lobbying with administrators to check back in as a group this winter. “I could randomly catch the flu going to the grocery store, and it wouldn’t help anything,” Gray said. “If I get it as part of this study at the hotel, maybe it will help science understand something we don’t understand as well as we thought we did.” Topics: Research Tags: Environmental Health Health and Fitness Research Schools & Departments: School of Public Health Interested in sharing your flu or borrowing someone else’s as a paid volunteer to help researchers learn how to conquer the illness?

We develop a diverse set of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches to forecast influenza activity in Hong Kong 0 to 8 weeks ahead, leveraging a unique multi-year surveillance record spanning 32 epidemics from 1998 to 2019. We consider a simple average ensemble (SAE) of the top two individual models, and develop an adaptive weight blending ensemble (AWBE) that dynamically updates model contribution. All models outperform the baseline constant incidence model, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 23%–29% and weighted interval score (WIS) by 25%–31% for 8-week ahead forecasts. The SAE model performed similarly to individual models, while the AWBE model reduces RMSE by 52% and WIS by 53%, outperforming individual models for forecasts in different epidemic trends (growth, plateau, decline) and during both winter and summer seasons. Using the post-COVID data (2023–2024) as another test period, the AWBE model still reduces RMSE by 39% and WIS by 45%. Our framework contributes to comparing and benchmarking models in ensemble forecasts, enhancing evidence for synthesizing multiple models in disease forecasting for geographies with irregular influenza seasonality.

Forecasting infectious disease activity could inform public health responses to outbreaks, such as preparing for the increase in hospitalization2,3. In regions with stable seasonality such as the continental U.S., forecasting of influenza could be reliable, with the establishment of forecasting hub4 to generate ensemble forecast based on the forecast from several groups based on several mechanistic, statistical, machine learning and deep learning approaches4,5,6,7,8,9,10. In region with regular influenza seasonality, the start and end week of influenza season are stable, and therefore the forecasting tasks are usually conducted in a pre-defined epidemic period, such as October to the May next year in United States.In subtropical and tropical regions such as Hong Kong, influenza seasonality is irregular and causes difficulty. In these regions, the onset of influenza season is unpredictable, and there is potential of second influenza peak in summer seasons, so that accurate influenza forecast is challenging11,12,13, particularly in leveraging seasonality4,14. Due to this challenge, modification of forecasting approach is necessary, such as conducing forecast throughout the year, instead of a pre-defined epidemic period. Also, the prediction models are required to be sensitive to capture rapid changes in influenza incidence. In Hong Kong. one previous study attempted to forecast the peak time and magnitude13 but based on a single model. Ensemble approaches have proven superior across a range of disease systems and geographies4,9,15,16,17,18, therefore there is a great potential for ensemble forecast in Hong Kong.To address this challenge, we aim to develop a systematic approach for 0–8 week ahead forecasting of influenza activity in the context of irregular seasonality. Using Hong Kong as an example, we examine >20 years of data (1998–2019) to develop and evaluate various statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches. Additionally, we explore several ensemble forecasting methods that have previously demonstrated superior performance in other diseases4,9,17,19 or geographies20,21. We propose dynamically updating model weights to better capture the rapid changes in influenza activity in Hong Kong. Our approach and ensemble framework contribute to the evidence base for forecasting infectious diseases in regions with irregular seasonality.ResultsInfluenza epidemics in Hong KongIn Hong Kong, an indicator combining influenza-like-illness intensity (ILI+) and the proportion of respiratory specimens positive for influenza each week serves as the gold standard to measure influenza activity22. From 1998 to 2019, 32 epidemics occurred: 20 in winter (November to April) and 12 in summer (May to October). Winter epidemics consistently occurred, except in 2013 and 2016. The start week of epidemics varied (Fig. 1), with winter and summer epidemics ranging from week 5 (Nov, 29th)–21 (Mar, 21st), and week 27 (May, 7th)−47 (Sep, 18th), respectively.Fig. 1: Influenza activity in Hong Kong.A Influenza activity (ILI + ) in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2019, encompassing the influenza season, and the training and testing periods. Blue dotted vertical lines indicate the start of epidemics. B Influenza trends in a year Hong Kong. Epidemic week is defined as November of the preceding year to the October in the current year.Full size imageA 1-week delay exists in ILI+ reporting (i.e., at week t, ILI+ is only available up to week t−1). We mimic real-time analysis considering these delays to generate nowcasts and up to 8-week ahead forecasts. In 2009, the sentinel surveillance system was affected by the establishment of Special Designated Flu clinics (not part of the sentinel network) in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. In our previous study, we estimated that this establishment of special clinics inflated the ILI+ values by threefold in 200923. Thus, we exclude 2009 forecasts from all evaluations. This removal is due to the change in the data-generating process from sentinel surveillance to a combination of sentinel surveillance and Special Designated Flu Clinics in 2009. When changes in the data-generating process occur over time periods, our methods would not be applicable to those periods.Overview of nowcasting and forecasting of ILI+Given the irregular seasonality of influenza activity in Hong Kong and potential influenza activity in summer, we generate nowcasts and forecasts of ILI+ throughout the year. This approach contrasts with season-based methods, which only forecast influenza activity from December to May in regions with regular influenza seasonality in winter and no influenza activity in summer.We first develop various statistical models (Appendix Section 1) to nowcast and forecast ILI+ up to 8 weeks ahead, incorporating epidemiological predictors such as past ILI+ values from the previous 14 weeks, week number, and month of the year to reflect seasonality, and meteorological data including weekly temperature, temperature range, absolute and relative humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure (Appendix Section 2). Predictions from these individual models are combined into a single ensemble forecast. Eight models are tested, including the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model (GARCH), Random Forests model (RF)24, Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGB)25, Long Short-Term Memory Network Model (LSTM)26, Gated Recurrent Units Network Model (GRU)27, a Transformer-based time series framework named TSTPlus (TSTPlus)28 and an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models called InceptionTime Plus Model29.We use January 1998–October 2007 as the training period and November 2007—July 2019 as the test period. To avoid collinearity among meteorological predictors and determine the optimal lag, we compute the Pearson correlation between ILI+ data and predictors with varying lags during the training period, selecting 5 out of 8 meteorological predictors (see methods). Epidemiological predictors are included in all models. Individual models are fitted on the selected predictors and observed ILI+ data, generating forecasts using a rolling method: At each week t during the test period (Nov 2007—Jul 2019), we use meteorological data up to week t and ILI+ data only up to week t−1 to make forecasts for the period t up to t + 8. Statistical models (ARIMA and GARCH) are retrained weekly with the most recent available data. Other models (machine learning and deep learning) are retrained only in the first week of November each year, as weekly updates require higher training costs with no performance improvement (Fig. S1).Then, we generate ensemble forecasts based on individual models by using a simple averaging of the top two models and a model blending method that weights models based on past performance18,30,31. We also introduce a time adaptive decay weighting scheme, where performance with more recent data contributes more heavily to the estimation of the weight of each model. For comparison with the ensemble and individual models, we consider a baseline “constant” null model, in which the ILI+ from weeks t to t + 8 weeks remains the same as ILI+ at week t−1.Prediction intervalsMost machine learning and deep learning approaches do not provide prediction intervals, and our trials using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout) show that MCDropout may generate worse point forecasts compared to those without MCDropout (Fig. S2). To address this limitation, we extend the previous approach using a normal distribution with the point forecast as a mean and the standard deviation (SD) calculated using residuals from a rolling 20-week window32. Instead of fixing the 20-week window, we use the training data to determine the optimal week number for the rolling window for each prediction horizon and model (see method). To ensure fair comparisons, we used the same method to generate prediction intervals for baseline models, and statistical models.Evaluation metricsWe evaluate and compare the performance of individual and ensemble models during the test period (Nov 2007—Jul 2019). Primarily, we use root mean square error (RMSE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), and weighted interval score (WIS) to compare models, while also providing mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (Appendix Section 3).Performance of individual models in nowcasting and forecastingEight individual models are used to forecast ILI+ up to an 8-week time horizon. Most of these models broadly capture ILI+ dynamics (Figs. S3 and S4). Across all 9 weeks of the horizon (t = 0 to t + 8), all models outperform the baseline constant model, reducing RMSE by 23%–29%, SMAPE by 17%–22%, and WIS by 25%–31% (Fig. 2). As the prediction horizon lengthens, individual model improvements become more apparent. For instance, all models outperform the baseline, reducing RMSE by 22%–31% for 4 weeks ahead forecast and 33%–37% for 8 weeks ahead forecast (Table S1).Fig. 2: Performance comparison of individual and ensemble models over the testing period by prediction horizon.A–E referred to RMSE, MAE, WIS, SMAPE, and MAPE. Respectively. F showed the numerical value of the relative performance of metrics compared to the Baseline. Models: ARIMA Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model, GARCH Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Model, RF Random Forest, XGB Extreme Gradient Boosting, InTimePlus InceptionTime Plus Model, LSTM Long Short-Term Memory Network, GRU Gated Recurrent Neural Network, TSTPlus Transformer-based Framework for Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning Model, SAE Sample Average Ensemble model, NBE Normal Blending Ensemble model, AWAE Adaptive Weighted Average Ensemble model, AWBE Adaptive Weighted Blending Ensemble model.Full size imageWe then assess model performance during distinct epidemic phases (Fig. 3). The best-performing model varies among phases, with LSTM, InTimePlus, and RF performing best in growth, plateau, and decline phases, respectively, reducing RMSE by 24%, 31%, and 26% compared to the baseline model. We evaluate model performance by season (winter or summer) (Figs. 3 and S5) and find that the best-performing model in one season may not perform as well in the other. The RF model performs best in winter but has the worst performance in summer among all individual models. Conversely, the InTimePlus model performs best in summer but has the worst performance in winter. Since the relative skills of different types of models depend on the epidemic phase and the season, an ensemble would likely be well-positioned to improve overall performance.Fig. 3: Trajectory of the forecasts of ensemble models.Red, yellow and blue indicate the point forecasts of 0-week, 4-week and 8-week ahead, accompanying the 90% prediction interval by shaded area of corresponding colors.Full size imagePerformance of ensemble models in nowcasting and forecastingWe first examine two ensemble approaches: the simple averaging ensemble (SAE) and the normal blending ensemble (NBE). For the SAE model, we select the three best models at each week t based on RMSE calculated using data up to week t−1 and take the unweighted mean of these individual forecasts. Two models are selected based on the RMSE on ensemble models with different numbers of best models in training period (Figs. S6 and S7). For the NBE model, we fit a LASSO regression on observed ILI+ up to week t−1, and the corresponding out-sample prediction of ILI+ from all individual models, assigning weights to the nowcast and forecast periods using regression coefficients. Therefore, the weights of individual models are not constrained to sum up to one and are allowed to be negative. To further improve forecasts, we use exponential time decay to weight previous data, assigning the highest weight to the most recent week (t−1) when averaging or blending. These are named the Adaptive Weighted Average Ensemble (AWAE) and the Adaptive Weighted Blending Ensemble (AWBE) models, respectively. Based on the training data, we set the decay rate to be 0.384 in the AWAE and AWBE models, the weight decayed to 0.01 at 12 weeks before the week of conducting forecast (Figs. S8 and S9).Compared to the baseline constant model, the SAE and NBE models reduced RMSE by 27%−29%, SMAPE by 19–21%, and WIS by 28–29%, comparable to the performance of the best individual models, without showing a significant advantage. The performance further improved when considering decaying weights based on recent performance; the AWAE and AWBE ensemble models reduced RMSE by 39% and 52%, SMAPE by 35% and 43%, and WIS by 42% and 53%, demonstrating that adaptive weighting could further improve forecasting performance. Further evaluating performance by different forecasting horizons, the AWAE and AWBE improvements were more apparent at longer prediction horizons (Table S1, 2, Figs. 2 and 4). Additionally, the AWAE and AWBE ensembles consistently improved forecast accuracy for different epidemic phases and both summer and winter, compared to the SAE and NBE models or all individual models (Fig. 3).Fig. 4: Model performance by epidemic phases and seasons.All metrics are relative to the Baseline model and include RMSE, SMAPE, MAE, WIS, and MAPE. A Model performance for distinct epidemic trends, with black dashed lines representing the best individual models. B Different stages of Hong Kong flu data distinguished by color, with the gray dashed line signifying outbreak threshold. C Model performance by winter and summer seasons.Full size imageModel performance in predicting occurrence of epidemicDespite our framework is designed and optimized to generate 0–8 week ahead forecast, our framework can provide predictions on occurrence of epidemic, peak timing and magnitude (Appendix Section 3.3). We follow the evaluation criteria based on a previous study in Hong Kong13 (Details available in method section). The accuracy of predicting occurrence of outbreaks within the next eight weeks, as well as the sensitivity (TPR), specificity (SPC), precision (PPV), and recall (NPV) indicators, based on AWAE and AWBE are higher than the baseline and individual models, with values equal to 0.9 for these 5 indicators. When compared with previous predictions for Hong Kong (17), our AWAE and AWBE model demonstrates better performance in term of NPV, and comparable performance across all other indicators (Fig. S10). Regarding peak timing (Fig. S11), our individual models could perform better in 0-week ahead forecast under stricter criteria, and in 0–4-week ahead forecast under looser criteria, compared with the previous work (17). The accuracy is comparable for other horizons. It should be noted that the ensemble model may not always better than individual models. Regarding peak magnitude, AWBE model demonstrates better accuracy for 1–6 week ahead forecast under the stricter, compared to previous work (17), and similar performance for 0-week ahead forecast (Appendix Section 3.3).Feature importanceThe feature importance map illustrates the significance of different predictors for various models and time horizons, reflecting model forecasting accuracy results and intuitive model interpretation (Fig. 5). First, the ILI+ value in t−1 is highly important for all models, as expected, since it represents the most updated information about the current epidemic state. Second, different models utilize predictors differently. For statistical models (ARIMA and GARCH), except for the ILI+ value in t−1, meteorological predictors and ILI+ values at t−2 and earlier are equally and weakly important, with little change in predictors across time horizons. For machine learning models (RF and XGB), predictors become more important for longer prediction horizons. Deep learning models exhibit different feature importance maps from other approaches. For LSTM and GRU, epidemiological predictors are more important than meteorological predictors. For InTimePlus and TSTPlus, only past ILI+ values are important in nowcasts, but all other predictors become more important for longer prediction horizons. We examine the differences in feature importance between summer and winter seasons. The importance of most features remains consistent, except for ‘Minimum of temperature’. For the RF, XGB, InTimePlus, and TSTPlus models, this feature is slightly more important for long-term winter predictions than for summer predictions (Fig. S12). The differences in learning capabilities regarding features and lags of various models also support the use of ensemble models and their improvements compared to individual models.Fig. 5: Feature importance in nowcast, 4-week, and 8-week ahead forecasts.Importance is measured by average regression coefficients in ARIMA and GARCH models, average feature importance in RF and XGB models, average saliency maps for LSTM and GRU models, and average permutation importance for TSTPlus and InTimePlus models. It should be noted that the numerical results of different comparison methods may not be directly comparable.Full size imageWe conducted an ablation test to compare the prediction performances for models with or without meteorological predictors (Fig. S13). Overall, the inclusion of meteorological variables does not have a consistent impact on the performance. The impact depends on the models, evaluation metrics and evaluation period (Appendix Section 2.3).Requirement of the amount of training data and associated computational costTo determine the required amount of training data, we vary the training period duration from 1 to 9 years, retrain the models, generate forecasts, and compute the RMSE (Fig. S14). Decreasing trends in RMSE are observed when the training period increases, particularly for deep learning models. Overall, 7 years of data are needed for a performance comparable to models using all available data (relative RMSE < 20%). When there are only one year of training data, all individual models are worse than baseline (Fig. S15).We also evaluate the computational cost of each model, measured by the training running time for predicting a single week’s ILI+. The running time of ensemble models is the sum of the running time of all individual models plus the ensemble’s running time. We find that RF and XGB have low training costs regardless of the amount of training data (<1 sec), while TSTPlus and InTimePlus have high training costs, increasing from around 5–6 sec for 1 year of training data to around 170–200 sec of rolling training approach. Overall, one run of training takes at most 196 sec for the complicated deep learning model when using the rolling method. For ensemble models, since running all individual models is required, it takes around 430 sec for 1 year. However, it should be noted that individual models could be run parallelly. If so, the ensemble models required only no more than 200 sec.Model performance after COVID-19 pandemicDuring 2020–2023, Hong Kong implemented substantial public health and social measures to suppress COVID-19 outbreaks, resulting in zero influenza activity with no epidemics in these 3 years33,34. Considering the potential impact on influenza transmission dynamics due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we test our approaches in the post-COVID-19 era, using March 2023 to January 2024 as another testing period.Overall, all models except for ARIMA and GRU perform better than the baseline model during 2023–2024 but slightly worse than the pre-COVID era (Table S2, Fig. S16). Only 6 out of 8 models improve predictions, reducing the RMSE by 5–17% compared to the baseline model (Table S3). Ensemble models further enhance predictions, with NBE, AWAE, and AWBE reducing the RMSE by 24%, 27%, and 39%, respectively, compared to the baseline (Table S3, Fig. 6), but not for SAE.Fig. 6: The trajectory of forecast of adaptive ensemble models during the post-COVID period.Red, yellow, blue and purple indicate the point forecasts of 0-week, 2-week, 4-week and 8-week ahead, accompanying the 90% prediction interval by shaded area of corresponding colors. A, B show the results of Adaptive Weighted Average Ensemble model (AWAE) and Adaptive Weighted Blending Ensemble (AWBE) respectively.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we evaluate the performance of various individual models and ensemble approaches to forecast the influenza epidemics (ILI+) in Hong Kong. Based on a unique dataset covering 32 epidemics in a subtropical region from 1998 to 2019, and using the last 11 years as the test period, we examine traditional time series, advanced machine learning and deep learning approaches. We find that the RF and InTimePlus models can reduce forecasting error (RMSE) by 27%, compared with the baseline “constant incidence” model, when evaluating ILI+ forecasts from current week to 8-week ahead. We further develop an adaptively weighted ensemble model that combines forecasts from individual models and reduces the RMSE by 50% and 62% compared with the baseline model. Overall, more sophisticated ensemble methods provide a greater edge over baseline and individual models at longer time horizons.Influenza seasonality in Hong Kong is irregular, with inconsistent outbreak onset times and potential for a second outbreak in summer, unlike in other regions such as the US and Europe. Consequently, we generate nowcasts and forecasts throughout the year, using various types of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Compared to the baseline, the improvement in accuracy for these models in nowcasts is not readily apparent; however, it becomes more evident when the forecasting horizon is longer. We also find that different approaches are particularly well-skilled for different stages of an epidemic, or for summer/winter epidemics. We investigate the feature importance (Fig. 5) for individual models and the differences in learning capabilities concerning features. Most machine learning and deep learning approaches allow different types and orders of lagged variables to contribute to some extent, particularly for long-term forecasting, indicating the capability to capture the complex relationships between predictor factors and ILI+. These suggest that model structure and learning capability variations may result in performance differences across seasons or epidemic phases, motivating the need for ensemble approaches that can integrate skills from various models.We examine the SAE that assigning same model weight to the top two models, and NBE that allows for different model weights, but these models could not improve the prediction performance compared to best individual model. This may suggest that using all historical data with equal weight in the estimation of model weights in ensemble may reduce the sensitivity to capture the rapid change of ILI+ dynamics. This motivates the use of adaptive weight ensemble, which assigns higher weights to the most recent data points in estimating model weights to better capture the dynamics. Employing this approach, the accuracy in the AWAE and AWBE could improve the accuracy substantially, reducing RMSE by 41% and 52% compared to the baseline. It should be noted that the decay rate parameters in AWAE and AWBE were selected by a simple grid search. There may be better ways to select this parameter, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm in Ray et al.35, which is worth exploration. Without retraining of using post-COVID data, AWAE and AWBE models could still reduce the RMSE by 27% and 39% compared to baseline in March 2023 to February 2024, after 3-year of COVID-19 control measures in Hong Kong so that influenza activity was zero from 2020 to 2022. The slightly reduced performance may be due to the loss of population immunity against influenza for 3 years34,36 and potential virus interference between influenza and SARS-CoV-237,38. Acquiring more post-COVID era data would likely enhance forecasting performance.Contrary to the well-established influenza forecasting activity in regions with stable seasonality in winter like the US, there is limited forecasting research in subtropical regions like Hong Kong. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that attempted to forecast influenza activity at 0–8 week time horizons. Compared to a previous study that used a mechanistic model in Hong Kong13, our AWBE model has a comparable performance in predicting the peak timing and occurrence of epidemic, but a much higher accuracy in predicting peak magnitude (Figs. S10 and S11). It should be noted that our models are trained based on minimizing RMSE, and therefore, prediction targets related to values would perform better than timing, and also explained why there was no improvement in predicting the peak timing.Our systematic evaluation of various forecasting approaches has implications for advancing the science of infectious disease forecast. Regarding the probabilistic forecast of machine learning and deep learning, we test a commonly used approach ‘Monte Carlo dropout’, but it worsens the accuracy of point forecast, in line with previous studies39,40. Motivated by a previous approach32, we use the training data to determine the optimal week number for the rolling window to compute the SD to generate the probabilistic forecast, and this approach could reduce the WIS by 42% and 53% for AWAE and AWBE ensemble model. Regarding the ensemble method, we use simply a grid search to find the optimal value of decay rate (lambda) based on the training data in the AWAE and AWBE ensemble model (Figs. S8 and S9). In the future, it may be possible that this parameter could be estimated, such as using the expectation-maximization algorithm in Ray et al.35. Regarding the number of models in the ensemble forecast, we find that this optimal number is two in our study. However, we propose that it may differ according to evaluation metrics, numbers and types of individual models, so the optimal number of models in an ensemble can vary for each forecasting task, despite previous analyses suggesting four as the most optimal value in the United States41.Our adaptive weight ensemble framework aims to address the irregular seasonality of influenza in Hong Kong, enabling forecasting tasks to be conducted every week throughout the year, rather than during a pre-defined “epidemic period.” This approach enhances the model’s ability to capture rapid changes through adaptive weighting. While our framework is designed with influenza with irregular seasonality in mind, it can be applied to other diseases or regions with regular seasonality, provided there is sufficient data to train the model (at least seven years in our study). Some parameter tuning may be necessary to adapt to the specific properties of the disease and region, particularly the decay rate parameter for adaptive weight ensemble models. The individual models in our study can feasibly incorporate predictors that are informative for specific diseases. Furthermore, our ensemble forecast models can accommodate new models with strong performance, as there are no restrictions on the individual models. In the future, this approach could be extended to address other diseases or regions with regular seasonality, provided that adequate data is available for model training.Our study has some limitations. Our retrospective study may tend to overestimate the performance of the forecasting models, compared to real-time forecasting. We do not consider issues such as the holiday-related delay of data release, or sporadic data revisions or corrections. Besides these limitations, we mimic real-time analysis by strictly utilizing data available at the week of forecast to avoid hindsight bias. Second, we use regression coefficient, feature importance or the saliency maps to determine the importance of predictors for various types of models. Therefore, results from different comparison methods may not be directly comparable. Third, due to high computational cost, we only retrain machine learning and deep learning model yearly. Although we find similar accuracy of weekly and yearly retraining, we cannot rule out other approaches that could enhance the performance of weekly retraining. Fourth, the reliability of our forecasting framework depends on the stability of the influenza surveillance system in Hong Kong (i.e., no change in the data-generating process of the prediction target). While there are no documented changes except for 2009 influenza pandemic outbreak, undocumented change may impact forecast accuracy. Finally, ensemble models may require higher computational costs compared to individual models; however, our methods can be executed in parallel, as they can be trained independently. On the other hand, the interactions of predictions from different individual models are not considered during their training phase but only in the construction of the ensemble model. This may result in a lack of diversity in the prediction performance of individual models, as evidenced by the fact that the simple average ensemble model could not improve the prediction performance compared to the best individual model. In the future, exploring methods to train these models concurrently while considering their interactions may enhance their performance.In conclusion, we systematically evaluate and analyze individual and ensemble models, and develop an adaptive ensemble approach in Hong Kong, a region with irregular influenza seasonality. Our results demonstrate this approach can halve the forecast error compared to a baseline model, in 0–8 week ahead forecast. Our approach is feasible for comparisons and benchmarking of different prediction models, and integration of newly developed models in ensemble forecast, making them applicable to other infectious diseases in geographies with irregular seasonality.MethodsData on influenza virus activity in communityIn Hong Kong, influenza activity in the general community is monitored through a sentinel surveillance network of outpatient clinics, which report the number of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) weekly. ILI is defined as the presence of fever >37.8 °C, accompanied by cough or sore throat. Weekly outpatient consultation rates for ILI per 10,000 consultations are reported. The public health laboratory gathers data on the weekly proportion of specimens from sentinel outpatient clinics and local hospitals testing positive for influenza virus. We generated a proxy measure of influenza activity (ILI+), calculated as the weekly rates of outpatients with ILI multiplied by the weekly proportion of laboratory specimens positive for influenza virus, irrespective of subtype. We previously reported that this proxy offered a reliable indication of community-wide virus infection incidence based on hospital admissions42.We focus on the period from 1998 to 2019, before the outbreak of COVID-19. In 2009, the sentinel surveillance system was affected by the establishment of special Designated Flu Clinics (not part of the sentinel network)23 (Fig. 1). Therefore, the ILI+ value in that period is inflated and we exclude the data from Apr, 2009 to Mar, 2010 in our analyses. A post-COVID period (March 2023–January 2024) is also included as another testing period.Overview of the modeling approachWe develop a framework to forecast weekly ILI+ up to 8 weeks ahead. Due to a one-week delay in ILI+ data availability, the most recent data accessible in the current week t is ILI+ at week t−1. Consequently, we generate forecasts for all weeks from t to t + 8. We initially develop various statistical models to forecast ILI+ and subsequently combine these individual forecasts into a single ensemble forecast using different aggregation approaches. Our study is divided into a training period (January 1998 to October 2007) and a test period (November 2007 to July 2019). Models are fitted during the training period, and hyperparameters are tuned based on performance within the same period. We then conduct individual forecasting and model ensembles on a rolling basis throughout the test period and evaluate the performance of both individual and ensemble models.Individual forecasting modelsIn this article, we have established a total of 8 individual models, including the ARIMA, GARCH, RF24, XGB25, LSTM26, GRU27, a TSTPlus28 and an ensemble of deep CNN models, which is called InceptionTime Plus Model29 (Full details in appendix). We added a persistence model as a null baseline, in which the values of 0–8-week ahead forecast of ILI+ in week t are the same as the ILI+ value of week t−19,32.For each individual model, we include a set of predictors that may inform the trajectory of ILI+. We consider two types of predictors: epidemiological predictors, including the week number and month of the year, which may capture influenza seasonality, and prior ILI+ values from week t−1 to t−14; and 8 meteorological predictors, including the maximum and minimum values of weekly temperature, the range of weekly temperature, absolute and relative humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed and atmospheric pressure. Meteorological predictors are included since prior studies reported their association with influenza incidence43,44,45,46,47.Before model fitting, we conduct a covariate selection for 8 meteorological predictors using Pearson’s correlation between each predictor and ILI+, selecting 5 meteorological predictors with the highest correlations: the maximum and minimum of temperature, the relative humidity, total rainfall, and solar radiation. At each week t, the best lag is automatically selected for each predictor and model based on the Pearson correlation analysis between ILI+ data and the predictors at varying lags. Considering the differences in learning capabilities among models, the ARIMA and GARCH models only have a single predictor \({X}_{t-k}\) with the optimal lag k for each selected predictor, while the RF and XGB models have the predictors from lag 1 to the optimal lags (\({X}_{t-1},\,{X}_{t-2},\,\cdots,\,{X}_{t-k}\)). For deep learning model, lag 1 to 14 is included for each select predictor. Additionally, influenza seasonality in Hong Kong, characterized by winter and summer peaks48, is accounted for by including week number and month of the year by default in all models.Model evaluationFor each week t in the test period, several evaluation metrics are computed using observed data from t to t + 8. Model performance is primarily evaluated using RMSE49, widely employed in previous literature. Furthermore, we use the SMAPE, a variant of the MAPE with added symmetries to eliminate skewness and improve resistance to outliers, making it more suitable when ILI+ values are near zero50. We also provide MAE and MAPE for reference. Regarding probabilistic forecast, we employ weighted interval score (WIS) as the evaluation metric. WIS is a proper score combining a set of interval scores for probabilistic forecasts that provide quantiles of the predictive forecast distribution (Supplementary method 3.2). It measures how closely the entire distribution aligns with the observation51.To evaluate the performance of interval prediction, we initially employed Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDropout), the most commonly used interval prediction method for deep learning39,40. However, we found that MCDropout may reduce the accuracy of point forecast (Fig. S2). Therefore, we adopted an interval prediction method in Aiken et al.32, assuming predictions follow normal distributions characterized by a mean of \(\hat{y}\) (the point forecast) and a standard deviation of \(\sigma\). The method for calculating \(\sigma\) is as follows: For a fixed calculation window length \(k\) and a given week \(t\), we first compute the out-of-sample prediction and prediction errors (\(\beta=\,\hat{y}-y\)) for the historical \(k\) weeks, denoted as \({\beta }_{t-k-1},{\beta }_{t-k},\cdots,{\beta }_{t-1}\), and then calculate the standard deviation \(\sigma\) based on them. Instead of setting k = 20 as in Aiken et al., we use the training data to determine the optimal k. We select the optimal k for each model and each prediction horizon by first testing \(k\) from 5–50 and then calculating the 90% coverage rate for each k. Based on this, we obtain the optimal window length for each prediction horizon and for each model, by selecting the k with the corresponding 90% coverage rate closest to 90%. We then apply these optimal window lengths to the testing period.We also evaluate model performance by winter and summer seasons, and by epidemic trends. We define the trends to be growth (increasing for three consecutive weeks), decline (decreasing for three consecutive weeks) and plateau (the weeks between adjacent growth and decline phases) (Fig. 4).Model ensembleEnsemble models combine forecasts from individual models into a single forecast, by assigning weights to each individual forecast. Given a set of m models, denote \({\hat{Y}}_{t}^{i}\) as the forecast of model \(i\) at week \(t\) and \({w}_{i}^{t}\) the ensemble coefficient for model \(i\) at week \(t\), then the ensemble forecast \({\hat{Y}}_{t}\) is:$${\hat{Y}}_{t}={\sum }_{i=1}^{m}{w}_{t}^{i}\,{\hat{Y}}_{t}^{i}.$$We test the following approaches to determine the weights: (1) SAE model: The model selects the top two models based on RMSE up to t−1, and then take the unweighted mean of the individual forecast of these 3 models9 (\({w}_{t}^{i}\) = 1/3 if model i is selected and 0 otherwise). 2) NBE model: This model fits a LASSO regression of observed ILI+ up to week t−1 on predicted ILI+ from different models to obtain coefficients to generate ensemble forecast for week t52. Therefore, the weights of individual models in NBE are not constrained to be sum to one and are allowed to be negative.We introduce adaptive weighting on the past ILI+ value, with higher weights for observations closer to the date of the forecast. We use the exponential time decay function to weight past ILI+ values to generate an ensemble forecast. For week t, the weight of the ILI+ of week t–k is:$${w}_{t-k}={e}^{-\lambda \cdot k}$$We use grid search to select the optimal value of lambda based on the RMSE in training period (Appendix Section 1.4). We apply these weights in the simple averaging ensemble when we compute the RMSE to select the best three models. This approach is called the AWAE model. We also use a similar approach for the blending ensemble, applying these weights when fitting the LASSO regression. This approach is called the AWBE model.ImplementationThe entire experiment was conducted on a Windows system equipped with a 12th-generation Intel i7 CPU processor and an Intel UHD Graphics 770 graphics card, ensuring a fair comparison of model running times. Statistical analyses were performed using Python version 3.9 and R version 4.0.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Model performance in prediction targets other than 0–8 weeks ahead forecastWe also test 3 more prediction targets, including occurrence of epidemic, peak magnitude and peak timing and adopt an evaluation approach in Yang et al.13. We evaluate the prediction on occurrence of epidemic in coming 0–8 week, according to the definition of epidemic in above. Since it is a classification problem, we use accuracy, TPR, SPC, PPV, and NPV indicators to evaluate performance.Regarding peak timing and peak magnitude, given that our maximum prediction horizon is only 8 weeks, the peak of the predicted curve could be censored, i.e. predicting a strict increasing trend from 0 to 8 weeks, but the actual peak may be later than 8 weeks. Therefore, we only consider the model’s predictive performance 0–6 weeks ahead of the outbreak peak. We use the two evaluation criteria (strict and looser). Under the strict criterion, a prediction is considered accurate if the predicted peak week matches the observed result exactly, and if the predicted peak amplitude falls within ±20% of the observed ILI+ value. For the looser standard, predictions of the outbreak’s occurrence or peak within ±1 week of observation, and predictions of the outbreak’s peak amplitude within ±50% of observation are all considered accurate.Feature importanceFor interpretability and better understanding of the role of each predictor, we analyze the feature importance of individual models. Specifically, we obtain regression coefficients for each variable for regression-based model (ARIMA and GARCH) and feature importance for machine learning model (RF and XGB)53. For deep learning models, we use saliency maps for LSTM and GRU54 and permutation importance for transformer-based approach TSTPlus and InTimePlus55,56. As models are trained dynamically, the feature importance in each model may change from week to week. We normalize the importance data and take an average for the entire study period. Figure 5 compares the average feature importance of different predictors and models with different lag order for ILI+ nowcast, and 4 weeks and 8 weeks ahead forecast.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

It brings together Member States, industry, other stakeholders and WHO to implement a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Framework includes a benefit-sharing mechanism called the Partnership Contribution (PC). The PC is collected as an annual cash contribution from influenza vaccine, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical manufacturers that use the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Funds are allocated for: (a) pandemic preparedness capacity building; (b) response activities during the time of an influenza pandemic; and (c) PIP Secretariat for the management and implementation of the Framework.This report presents overall success metrics and infographics to illustrate progress in PIP Framework implementation. A progress report is published four times a biennium, and covers technical and financial implementation for the PIP PC High-Level Implementation Plan II (HLIP II), as well as the PIP Secretariat. Milestones are reported every six months and indicators are reported yearly. All data are presented cumulatively from the beginning of each biennium, in this case, 1 January 2022.

In total, 22.1% of influenza patients (n = 15) were older than 60 years and/or had comorbidities for which annual influenza vaccination is recommended, but only one had received an influenza vaccine. Patients with respiratory and musculoskeletal symptoms who presented during the German influenza season had the highest risk proportion of positive tests (54%, n = 25/46). Overall, three (4.4%) influenza patients were hospitalised, two (2.9%) received antiviral treatment, and eight (11.8%) received antibiotic therapy.ConclusionsInfluenza occurs throughout the year in international travelers and can cause significant morbidity. Travelers with febrile illness should be tested for influenza, especially if they have respiratory or musculoskeletal symptoms, present during the local influenza season, or have travelled to South-East Asia. Influenza vaccination coverage among international travelers needs to be improved among high-risk individuals. Peer Review reports IntroductionOn average, influenza affects 5 to 15% of the world’s population, resulting in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year [1, 2]. Approximately one percent of travelers to subtropical and tropical destinations are known to be infected with influenza viruses, making it the most commonly reported vaccine-preventable infection among travelers prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [3, 4]. Travel-associated outbreaks have been reported particularly among Hajj pilgrims [5] and cruise ship passengers [6]. As the volume of international travel and the proportion of high-risk individuals among international travelers continues to increase, the impact of influenza on traveler morbidity is growing [7]. In addition, travelers may introduce existing and novel influenza viruses into their home country or other countries [8]. The aim of this single-centre retrospective analysis was to analyse demographic, travel-related and clinical information of international travelers diagnosed with seasonal influenza at our travel clinic. We also aimed to identify risk factors for testing positive for influenza when presenting with febrile illness after international travel by comparing these patients with a control group without influenza infection.Materials and methodsStudy populationWe identified all febrile international travelers, defined as having a temperature > 38.0 °C, either self-reported or measured in the travel clinic, who were tested for influenza virus infection by PCR at the Travel Clinic of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, between January 2015 and March 2020. According to the diagnostic algorithm at our center, all international travelers with febrile illness receive influenza testing by PCR. Only patients with complete data were included in the analysis. As the incubation period of influenza is one to four days, we included patients in the final analysis who reported a maximum of four days between return from travel and onset of symptoms. To identify risk factors for testing positive for influenza, we included a control group of patients who also presented at our travel clinic with febrile illness after international travel but had a negative PCR test. We aimed to match each influenza case with three controls within the same time period. We did not group the patients by calendar year (January to December) but instead chose time periods from July to June of the following year in order to capture the entire influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. This approach allows us to encompass a full influenza season in Germany within a 12-month period. If we identified more than three controls for an influenza case in the respective time period, controls were randomly selected. The influenza group and controls were compared for sex, age, symptoms at presentation, duration of travel, and region of travel. We grouped travel destinations into the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions African Region, Region of the Americas, South-East Asian Region, European Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Western Pacific Region. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the electronic and paper-based patient records and documented in a pseudonymised manner using a web-based, centralised, password-protected clinical database management system (REDCap) [9, 10].Statistical analysesAge of patients in the influenza and control groups is expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR) and compared by Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages and compared by Fisher’s exact test. Conditional binary logistic regression was calculated to show associations between influenza diagnosis and categorical variables stratified by year of recruitment. An interaction term was included in the regression to show the effect of a risk factor within categories of a second variable. The regression coefficients of the interaction terms were linearly combined to present odds ratios (ORs) representing these combined effects. Patients whose region of travel was unknown were not included in the statistical analyses. Due to small sample sizes, the travel destinations Eastern Mediterranean region and European region were combined into a single category. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictive factors for testing positive for influenza. An a priori decision was made to include the variables age ≥ 60 years, male sex and age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) in the model. Finally, a classification and regression tree (CART) was constructed based on the results of the multivariable regression analysis to translate the associations into a decision flowchart. Variables with effect estimates of OR < 0.5 or > 2.0 were included in the model. All data analyses were performed using R (version 4.3.1) with the packages survival (version 3.5–5) for calculating conditional logistic regression, multcomp (version 1.4–25) for combining regression coefficients, and rpart (version 4.1.19) for constructing the CART. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism, version 9 for MacOS (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).ResultsStudy populationDuring the study period, 82 international travelers were diagnosed with seasonal influenza virus infection. Fourteen of these were excluded from the final analysis because they reported more than four days between return from travel and onset of symptoms. Finally, 68 patients with seasonal influenza were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). Duration between onset of symptoms and return from travel was less than one day (n = 17; 25.0%), one day (n = 19; 27.9%), two days (n = 2; 2.9%), three days (n = 5; 7.4%), or four days (n = 4; 5.9%). Twenty patients (29.4%) had developed symptoms before returning to Germany. During the same time period, 438 patients were tested negative for influenza virus infection at our travel clinic after international travel. To identify potential risk factors for testing positive for influenza after international travel we selected a control group of 207 febrile travelers who tested negative for influenza as described above (Supplement S1). Overall, 27.9% (n = 19) of the influenza patients presented outside the influenza season in Germany, which runs from calendar week 40 in early October to calendar week 20 in late May. All these patients returned from countries with perennial influenza virus circulation. The detailed monthly distribution of influenza cases is shown in Fig. 2. In the control group, 42.5% (n = 88) presented outside the German influenza season. An interaction analysis was calculated for German influenza season and travel to South-East Asia, using the risk of positive influenza test outside the German season for patients not travelling to South-East Asia served as the reference group. Patients presenting during the German influenza season and travelling to South-East Asia showed the highest risk for a positive test result (OR = 4.27; 95% CI 1.62–11.28; p = 0.36), followed by travelers during the German influenza season with a destination outside South-East Asia (OR = 3.31; 95% CI 1.36–8.06; p = 0.01). An increased risk was also seen in those who travelled outside the German season, but to a destination within South-East Asia (OR = 2.44; 95% CI 0.89–6.73; p = 0.08).Fig. 1Selection of the study population and the control group. Legend: We included international travelers diagnosed with influenza at our travel clinic between January 2015 and March 2020. Those reporting more than four days between their return from travel and the onset of symptoms were excluded. To identify risk factors for testing positive for influenza among travelers presenting with febrile illness, we aimed to match influenza negative control patients who presented during the same time period at a 3:1 ratioFull size imageFig. 2Monthly distribution of influenza cases. Legend: The number of patients diagnosed with influenza is shown per calendar month of presentation at our travel clinic. The German influenza season (calendar week 40 in early October to calendar week 20 in late May) is highlighted in light blueFull size imageDemographic and travel-related characteristicsThe median age in the influenza group was 33 years (IQR: 27–44 years), and 38.2% (n = 26) of the patients were female (Table 1). The majority of patients (77.9%; n = 53) were diagnosed with influenza A virus infections, which were subtyped as H1N1 (38.2%; n = 26) or H3N2 (35.3%; n = 24). Three patients with influenza A virus infections could not be subtyped. Fourteen patients (20.6%) were diagnosed with influenza B virus infections. One patient had a coinfection with influenza A virus (H3N2) and influenza B virus. The most common travel regions for influenza cases were the South-East Asian Region (42.6%; n = 29), the African Region (27.9%; n = 19), and the Region of the Americas (17.6%; n = 12). The majority (61.8%; n = 42) of travelers were tourists. Less common reasons for travelling were work (16.2%; n = 11) or visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (7.4%; n = 5). The duration of travel was most frequently up to one week (20.6%; n = 14), between one and two weeks (30.9%; n = 21) or two and three weeks (33.8%; n = 23). Travel modalities and travel duration were not associated with testing positive for influenza. The most common symptoms among cases were respiratory symptoms (76.5%; n = 52), musculoskeletal symptoms (69.1%; n = 47) and headache (55.9%; n = 38). Patients presenting with respiratory symptoms (OR 5.42; 95% CI 2.73–10.76; p < 0.001) and musculoskeletal symptoms (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.29–4.20; p = 0.01) were more likely to test positive for influenza. Table 1 shows the results of the bivariable and multivariable regression models described above. The results of the multivariable regression did not change substantially from the bivariable estimates. The multivariable regression was used for the CART analysis, which is shown in Fig. 3. Travelers without respiratory symptoms (10.4%; n = 13/125) and those with respiratory but no additional musculoskeletal symptoms (22.2%; n = 16/72) had the lowest proportion of positive influenza test results. The highest proportion of positive tests was seen in patients with respiratory and musculoskeletal symptoms who travelled during the German influenza season (54.3%, n = 25/46) or who travelled outside the season but to a country in South-East Asia (53.3%, n = 8/15).

Variables with effect estimates of OR < 0.5 or > 2.0 were included in the modelFull size imageVaccination statusAmong the influenza cases, only one patient had received an influenza vaccination before departure or during the last influenza season in Germany. A further 35 (51.5%) patients reported that they had not been vaccinated, and no information on influenza vaccination status was available for the remaining 32 (47.1%) patients. However, 22.1% (n = 15) of the travelers diagnosed with influenza were older than 60 years (2.9%; n = 2) and/or had comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary disease (8.8%; n = 6) or autoimmune diseases (7.4%; n = 5), for which annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended by the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany (Supplement S2) [11]. In the control group, 4.3% (n = 9) of patients were vaccinated against influenza, 62.8% (n = 130) were unvaccinated, and for 32.9% (n = 68) of patients, no information on the influenza vaccination status was available.Clinical characteristicsOverall, 2.9% (n = 2) of the influenza patients received antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, and 11.8% (n = 8) received antibiotic treatment for suspected bacterial superinfection. Three male patients were hospitalised for one, six, and seven days, respectively, due to poor general clinical condition. They were 30, 50, and 78 years old and none of them required oxygen supplementation. None of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and there were no deaths in our study cohort. The most common alternative diagnoses in the control group were bacterial gastroenteritis (n = 36; 17.4%), dengue fever (n = 14; 6.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (n = 9; 4.3%), urinary tract infection (n = 5; 2.4%), community-acquired pneumonia (n = 4; 1.9%), and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection (n = 4; 1.9%) (Supplement S3).DiscussionIn this retrospective case–control study, we report the demographic and clinical characteristics of 68 patients with travel-acquired influenza. Three patients were hospitalised, demonstrating the significant morbidity associated with influenza in international travelers. An important finding of our study is the low proportion of patients who were vaccinated against influenza before departure or during the previous influenza season. In Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for all adults over 60 years of age, patients with certain chronic comorbidities, and pregnant women [11]. More than a fifth of cases in our study cohort met at least one of these criteria, but only a minority were vaccinated. This is consistent with the overall low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in the general population in Germany. In the 2021/22 season, only 43.3% of adults aged over 60 years, 35.4% of those with relevant comorbidities and 17.5% of pregnant women were vaccinated against seasonal influenza [12]. In addition to the above recommendations, many national and international societies advise all international travelers to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza to prevent both direct morbidity and onward transmission [13, 14]. We have previously conducted a questionnaire-based survey of travel health advisers in Germany regarding their attitudes, practices, and barriers to influenza vaccination of international travelers [15]. Although respondents reported that they generally recommend seasonal influenza vaccination to a significant proportion of international travelers throughout the year, very few respondents reported having regular access to influenza vaccines in June (6.5%), July (4.0%) and August (6.9%). Only 4.4% of respondents said they had ever ordered doses of influenza vaccine produced for the southern hemisphere to vaccinate travelers during the summer months in Germany. Among the influenza cases in our study cohort, only a minority had received pre-travel medical advice and only the single patient mentioned above had received influenza vaccination. In the current analysis, we cannot determine how often influenza vaccination was recommended by the travel health advisors but declined by the travelers and how often vaccination was not administered due to limited availability. Patients with febrile illness who also reported respiratory symptoms or musculoskeletal symptoms were significantly more likely to test positive for influenza than control patients. This finding is consistent with previously reported symptoms of seasonal influenza [16, 17]. However, it is important to note that malaria must always be excluded in all travelers returning from endemic regions with febrile illness. First, co-infection with malaria and influenza may occur [18, 19]. Second, malaria itself can cause influenza-like illness [20]. Interestingly, patients presenting during the German influenza season were more likely to test positive for influenza than patients presenting outside the German influenza season. This may reflect the risk of acquiring influenza infection not only at the travel destination, but also through close contact with other people in confined spaces after returning home, e.g. on the plane, at the airport or during land transport. In total, 27.9% (n = 19) of the patients who presented outside the influenza season in Germany returned from countries with perennial influenza virus circulation, so that infection at the travel destination is likely. Furthermore, the CART analysis showed a comparable proportion of positive test results in patients with influenza symptoms who were traveling during the German influenza season and in patients with influenza symptoms who returned from South-East Asia but traveling outside the German influenza season.Our study has several limitations. First, we only included patients who presented to our travel clinic with symptomatic febrile illness and were subsequently diagnosed with influenza. Therefore, unlike prospective seroprevalence studies [3, 16], we are unable to determine incidence rates or identify risk factors for influenza virus infection during international travel. Patients with asymptomatic infection, those with milder illness who may not have sought medical attention, and those who became symptomatic during travel and have sought medical attention at the travel destination would have been missed. However, our study is valuable in characterising the demographic, travel-related and clinical information of travelers presenting with influenza and in identifying risk factors for testing positive for influenza in patients presenting with febrile illness after international travel. Second, we do not know with absolute certainty that all patients in our cohort were infected during international travel. Although we only included patients who reported a maximum of four days between return from travel and onset of symptoms with regard to the incubation period of influenza, some patients may have become infected after their return to Germany, especially during the local influenza season. While 27.9% (n = 19) of the influenza patients presented outside the influenza season in Germany, the remaining patients theoretically may also have acquired autochthonous infections. A total of 275 patients were included in the study; however, this sample size may not be sufficient to provide robust estimates for subgroup analyses. This limitation should be considered when interpreting the effects of combined risk factors, as calculated in the CART analysis, where group results are based on small case numbers.ConclusionInfections with seasonal influenza viruses occur throughout the year in international travelers and can cause significant morbidity. Travelers with febrile illness should be tested for influenza, especially those with respiratory or musculoskeletal symptoms, who travel during the local influenza season or who have visited South-East Asia. There is a pressing need to increase influenza vaccination coverage among international travelers, focusing on those at higher risk of severe disease.

Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed those obstacles by approving the at-home use of FluMist®, an influenza vaccine administered by nasal spray. Made by AstraZeneca, FluMist will be available for home use starting in the fall of 2025. It is approved for people ages 2 through 49 (the vaccine doesn’t help prevent flu in people ages 50 and older). Getting annual vaccinations against flu is highly recommended by health experts. Each year, the flu causes up to 41 million illnesses, 710,000 hospitalizations, and 51,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Making this vaccine available to use at home is a great step for public health purposes,” says Scott Roberts, MD, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist. “There are always patients who don’t get vaccinated because they can't get to the clinic, or it's not top of mind. If you can offer this at home via self-administration, I imagine it's only going to increase the percentage of people who are vaccinated against the flu. Plus, it’s the only needle-free option. So, it’s helpful for patients who have a needle—or doctor—phobia.” FluMist contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains A and B and is sprayed into the nose. It was first approved by the FDA in 2003, and, until the approval for at-home use, was administered only by a health care provider in a medical setting (including pharmacies). A prescription will be required for at-home use. Beginning in fall 2025, an individual can get one by visiting the FluMist website and entering information to determine if they are eligible. If they are, a pharmacist will grant approval, and the vaccine will be shipped to them. A caregiver should administer the vaccine to anyone between the ages of 2 and 18. Below, we talk more with Dr. Roberts about FluMist as a nasal spray vaccine used at home. How effective is FluMist?Effectiveness for all flu vaccines, according to the CDC, can vary from year to year among different ages, risk groups, vaccine types, and virus types and subtypes. Before the 2009 H1N1 virus, or swine flu, pandemic, the nasal spray vaccine was found to be effective against different flu viruses, including influenza A and B viruses. But after the 2009 pandemic, several U.S. studies of 2- through 17-year-olds found that the nasal spray was less effective than the traditional injectable vaccine against the influenza A H1N1 pandemic strain—even though it provided the same protection against other influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses as the standard flu shot. Still, the CDC recommended against the use of the nasal spray vaccine for the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 flu seasons. “Since then, they updated the formulation of the nasal vaccine, and now it is just as efficacious as injectables for H1N1 and A and B influenza viruses in non-U.S.-based studies,” Dr. Roberts says. Because of its limited use, there have not been effectiveness estimates in the U.S. since the nasal spray was endorsed again by the CDC for the 2018-2019 season. But, as Dr. Roberts mentions, data from other countries have shown protection to be similar to standard-dose, egg-based inactivated flu vaccines in 2- to 17-year-olds. What are the side effects of FluMist?The most common reported side effects of FluMist include a fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in children ages 2 through 6, a runny nose and nasal congestion in people ages 2 through 49, and a sore throat in adults ages 18 through 49. “FluMist is a live attenuated, or weakened, virus, so it’s not fully inactivated­—as is the case with the standard injectable flu vaccine. Because of that, theoretically, you could have more side effects, including nasal congestion,” Dr. Roberts says. “But you can’t get the flu from it.” Side effects shouldn’t last more than a few days, he adds. The CDC offers a full list of side effects. Is there anyone who should not get FluMist?As noted, the nasal spray vaccine is for people between ages 2 and 49. It should not be administered, according to the CDC, to the following groups: Anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine ingredient (except for egg protein) or to a previous dose of any flu vaccine. Children ages 2 to 17 who take aspirin or medicines containing salicylate Children ages 2 to 4 who have a history of wheezing in the past 12 months Anyone with a weakened immune systemPregnant people People with an active leak between the cerebrospinal fluid and the mouth, nose, ear, or other place in the skull People with cochlear implants People who have taken antiviral flu drugs within a certain amount of time. The CDC provides a full list of those who should not get the nasal vaccine. Should I get FluMist if I have a runny nose?“Nasal congestion changes the local immune dynamics of the nasal mucosa, which means there is a chance the vaccine is not going to reach all the mucosa and instead is going to be bound up in the debris of a runny nose,” says Dr. Roberts. “In a perfect world, if someone is healthy and feeling good, they can administer this and I wouldn't have any concerns. But if someone has nasal congestion, then I think the injectable may be a better route, since it is a more tried-and-true strategy.” How do I decide if at-home FluMist is right for me?It really depends on your comfort level, but overall, using FluMist at home is a convenient option for the right individual, says Dr. Roberts. “For instance, some people might worry that they are administering it incorrectly and wonder if that changes its efficacy,” he says. “But as long as there is room for user error and the instructions are clear, which I expect them to be, this may not be an issue.” However, if someone is anxious about logistics and can get to a clinic that administers flu vaccines, there’s no reason not to stick with the “tried-and-true” option, he notes. “But, if you qualify for the at-home nasal vaccine, I have no qualms about someone getting it,” Dr. Roberts says.

And for the past couple of years there has been the looming threat of a combination of a severe flu season with COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This year, while it was a busy summer with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the availability of an updated COVID-19 vaccine in addition to the influenza and RSV vaccines, offers hope for the winter season. But that is only if people use the tools to mitigate infection and illness. Everyone six months of age and older is recommended to get the influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of severe outcomes. Advancing public health AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Learn More Last year’s flu season resulted in at least 35 million illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths in the U.S. This included 187 pediatric deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For the 2022–2023 flu season, the CDC estimated that flu vaccination prevented 6 million flu-related illnesses in the U.S., 2.9 million medical visits, 65,000 hospitalizations and 3,700 deaths.The AMA’s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew™ series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today’s health care headlines.In this installment, Kate Kirley, MD—a family physician and director of chronic disease prevention at the AMA—took time to discuss what doctors wish patients knew about the influenza vaccine to help clear up any misinformation. The vaccine doesn’t give you the flu The vaccine doesn’t give you the flu The flu vaccine is made of pieces of the virus or inactivated virus, and “the nasal spray is a whole virus, but it’s an attenuated form of the virus, so neither kind can actually give you the flu,” said Dr. Kirley. “It’s not uncommon for people to have a low-grade fever or feel a little run down for a couple of days after they get their vaccine. That’s just their immune system responding to the vaccine and doing exactly what we want it to do.”Patients will sometimes coincidentally come down with the flu shortly after receiving the vaccination, but that’s just a quirk of timing, Dr. Kirley said, noting that this is one of many common misconceptions about influenza and flu vaccines.“It takes the vaccine a couple of weeks to generate a full immune response, so you don’t have your full protection until a couple of weeks after you get your shot,” she noted. OK for flu, COVID-19 shots at same time OK for flu, COVID-19 shots at same time The updated COVID-19 vaccine, designed to better match currently circulating variants, is now available for patients 6 months or older. Coadministration of flu and updated COVID-19 vaccines is recommended if you are eligible and the timing coincides. “People heading to their doctor’s office or pharmacy for their COVID vaccine can also get their influenza vaccine at the same visit,” said Dr. Kirley. This means “people can get their flu shot on the same day—it’s safe and effective, so there’s no need to make multiple trips.”“Every year, influenza causes hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States,” she said, noting that “it’s important to do everything we can to keep people out of the hospital and getting a flu shot is one of the best things we can do to stay healthy during flu season.”Additionally, it is “possible to get influenza and COVID at the same time, and then you really have that double whammy in terms of two significant respiratory illnesses,” said Dr. Kirley. The flu vaccine is “really to get the protection against that scenario.” Getting a seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against H5N1 bird flu. But if a person may have frequent exposure to potentially infected birds or other animals, it is still important to get a seasonal flu vaccine two weeks before potential exposure. That is because it can reduce the prevalence and severity of seasonal flu and may reduce the very rare risk of coinfection with influenza and an avian virus at the same time, according to the CDC. What doctors wish patients knew Subscribe for the answers to the latest questions patients are bringing to the exam room. Subscribe Now Can reduce flu risk by up to 60% Can reduce flu risk by up to 60% “We typically don't know the effectiveness of the vaccine until we really get into flu season, and we can see what types of viruses actually end up circulating in the population,” said Dr. Kirley, adding that every year, the flu vaccine is adjusted to align with what is predicted to be the most likely strains circulating.“It typically falls somewhere between 40% and 60% effectiveness,” she said. “Even when the vaccine is only 30% effective at preventing flu, that is still very meaningful and crucial for preventing hospitalizations and deaths.” Get it as soon as possible Get it as soon as possible The general recommendation is to “shoot for September or October to get your flu vaccine,” said Dr. Kirley. “You can start to get your vaccine, ideally before the end of October, but if you don’t squeeze it in, go get it any time.”“Ideally before January is what’s best. But we’ll tell people all throughout flu season, if you haven’t gotten the vaccine yet, it’s still OK to get it and you’re likely to benefit as long as influenza viruses are circulating,” she said. Everyone should get vaccinated Everyone should get vaccinated “There are a couple reasons why someone might not be able to get the flu vaccine—that’s relatively rare,” said Dr. Kirley. “A real allergy to it might be the most common reason, but generally speaking, if you are older than 6 months old, you should definitely get the flu vaccine.”Older adults “are a higher-risk population. They have slightly different vaccine options that are designed to protect them a little bit more,” she said. “Because they are also clearly one of those high-risk populations for COVID, it is even more important for them to protect themselves against the flu as well.” Related Coverage What doctors wish patients knew about the flu There are nasal sprays too There are nasal sprays too “The sprays are only approved for ages 2 through 49,” said Dr. Kirley. “There are some medical conditions or reasons why you may not be able to get the spray, or it may not be the best choice for you, but most people can take that option of getting the nasal spray if they really are anxious about getting the shot.“We will definitely say, ‘If it means you end up getting a flu vaccine and you'd rather choose a nasal spray, get that nasal spray,’” she added. “It is typically pretty comparable to the shot in terms of effectiveness.” Do it for yourself and others Do it for yourself and others “There are benefits to us as individuals: We're less likely to get the flu. Even if we do develop the flu, we're less likely to need to be hospitalized and it tends to be less severe if you get the vaccine,” said Dr. Kirley. “It is also about protecting others—your family, friends, community members.”“The flu vaccine is most effective for all of us when more of us get it, so we can get closer to achieving—at least for flu season—that herd immunity,” she said. “Getting the flu shot is not just doing something for yourself, but it definitely is a way you can contribute to good health in your community.” There are many ways to get it There are many ways to get it “You have a lot of options in terms of where you can receive the flu shot. We usually suggest that people reach out to their primary care doctor's office first,” said Dr. Kirley. “Primary care physician offices usually have lots of options for how you can come in and get your flu shot, but there are other places as well.”Vaccines are key to keeping everyone healthy and preventing infection.

U. J. Alexander / iStock The local health department was notified after the patient experienced conjunctivitis, which was the only symptom. In its emailed press release, the CDPH said the patient’s specimen will be sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmatory testing.If confirmed, the illness would bring the nation’s number of H5N1 infections since the first of the year to 15. Four earlier illnesses occurred in dairy workers, nine occurred in poultry cullers, and one was found in a Missouri patient who had no known animal exposure.The patient is being treated with antiviral medication and is isolating at home. Tomás J. Aragón, MD, DrPH, CDPH director and state public health officer, said, "Ongoing health checks of individuals who interact with potentially infected animals helped us quickly detect and respond to this possible human case. Fortunately, as we've seen in other states with human infections, the individual has experienced mild symptoms."H5N1 strikes 11 more California dairy herdsIn related developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 11 more H5N1 outbreaks in California dairy herds, boosting the national total to 255 across 14 states.California, the nation’s largest dairy producer, has now reported 55 infected farms since September. Study: Prolonged antibiotics common in COVID patients with and without sepsis News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship COVID-19 Prolonged antibiotics were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis during the first 33 months of the pandemic, despite low rates of proven bacterial infection, researchers reported today in Antimicrobial Stewardship & Healthcare Epidemiology.For the study, researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital analyzed electronic health record data for patients hospitalized for community-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections at five Massachusetts hospitals from March 2020 through November 2022. Their primary aim was to describe prolonged antibiotic use (4 or more days of antibiotics within the first week following admission) in COVID-19 patients presenting with sepsis, which is primarily caused by bacterial infections and typically treated with antibiotics but can be triggered by viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2.Prolonged antibiotic use remains elevatedOf the 431,017 hospitalizations during the study period, 21,563 (5%) had COVID-19, and 4,769/21,563 (20.5%) presented with sepsis. Prolonged antibiotics were prescribed for 48.7% of COVID-19 patients with sepsis and 17.1% without sepsis, despite low rates of positive bacterial cultures on admission (15.0% vs 6.3%, respectively). While quarterly rates of prolonged antibiotics declined between the first and second pandemic quarters for both sepsis (66.8% to 43.9%) and no-sepsis (31.8% to 24.4%) groups, there was no significant change in prolonged antibiotic use from the second quarter through November 2022 in either group, with quarterly adjusted odds ratios of 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99 to 1.05) and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03), respectively.The study authors say the elevated ongoing rates of prolonged antibiotic prescribing for COVID-19 patients likely reflects concerns about possible bacterial co-infections."Our findings highlight an ongoing opportunity to improve antibiotic use in patients presenting with severe respiratory viral infections," they wrote. APHIS gives $12 million to states, tribes for fight against chronic wasting disease News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Deb Watson / Flickr cc Today, the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced that it's giving about $12 million to state and tribal governments to implement and enhance chronic wasting disease (CWD) management efforts in wild and farmed cervids such as deer and elk.CWD is a fatal neurologic disease in cervids caused by misfolded infectious proteins called prions, which are extremely resilient and can persist in the environment for years. CWD poses an ongoing threat to cervids, because it can spread from animal to animal and through environmental contamination. This funding will help APHIS and our state and Tribal partners find and implement new solutions to this challenging disease while protecting the health of animals and the livelihoods of our farmers. Jenny Lester Moffitt Priorities for fundingAPHIS said it worked with state agricultural, wildlife, and tribal officials and the cervid industry to establish priorities for funding to:Improve CWD management of affected farmed and wild cervidsEnhance CWD management of affected areas or premisesResearch amplification assays and other new testing methodsStudy the application or implementation of a whole-genome predictive genetics CWD management plan for farmed or wild cervids, andDevelop and/or deliver educational outreach materials or programsAPHIS prioritized jurisdictions that have detected CWD or that border CWD-endemic areas and have either launched surveillance programs or plan to do so. More details on the individual projects are available in the 2024 APHIS spending plans for farmed, wild, and tribal nation wild cervids."Deer, elk, moose, and other cervids are important wildlife resources that continue to be at risk of contracting chronic wasting disease," Jenny Lester Moffitt, USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, said in a news release. "This funding will help APHIS and our state and Tribal partners find and implement new solutions to this challenging disease while protecting the health of animals and the livelihoods of our farmers."

By Dr. Jaisingh Rajput Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can lead to severe symptoms, hospitalization, and even death in some cases. However, there are effective strategies to protect yourself during flu season. Get Vaccinated: The flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza. It helps your body develop immunity against the virus, reducing the likelihood of severe illness. The vaccine is recommended for everyone aged six months and older. Email newsletter signup Sign up for our daily email newsletter Practice Hand Hygiene: Good hand hygiene is vital in preventing the spread of the flu virus. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching potentially contaminated surfaces. Follow Respiratory Etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of flu droplets. Properly dispose of tissues and wash your hands immediately. Avoid Close Contact: Keep your distance from people who are sick with the flu. If you are ill, stay home to prevent spreading the virus to others. It’s important to remain at home until you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications. Clean Surfaces Regularly: The flu virus can survive on surfaces for several hours. Regularly disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls. Boost Your Immune System: Strengthen your immune system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management. Consider Antiviral Medications: If you are at high risk for flu complications, consult with a healthcare professional about antiviral medications. These drugs can be used for prevention or early treatment of the flu. Use Face Masks: In situations where you might be in close contact with others, such as in crowded public places during flu season, wearing a mask can help reduce virus transmission. However, masks should be used alongside other preventive measures. Stay Aware During Flu Season: Be mindful of the flu season in your area and take extra precautions during peak periods. Flu outbreaks can vary in timing and severity, so staying informed is key. Stay Updated: Keep up with the latest flu information and recommendations from reliable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). These organizations provide guidance on flu prevention and management. Vaccination for High-Risk Groups: Certain groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health conditions, are more susceptible to severe flu complications. It’s particularly important for these individuals and their close contacts to get vaccinated. Implement Workplace Policies: Employers can play a role in flu prevention by encouraging sick employees to stay home and offering on-site vaccination clinics. In conclusion, preventing and avoiding the flu requires a combination of personal responsibility and community efforts. By following these guidelines, you can reduce your risk of contracting and spreading the flu. Annual vaccination, good hygiene, and healthy habits are fundamental in protecting yourself and others. Staying informed and vigilant during flu season is crucial for a healthier, flu-free community. Dr. Jaisingh Rajput is a physician at Regional Medical Center of Central Alabama in Greenville.

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) New animal study suggests natural immunity from infection may boost immune response In a new study funded by the National Institutes of Health, University of Georgia researchers found that natural immunity from previous flu infections has a significant impact on how well future influenza vaccinations work. That may mean if you’re one of the unlucky estimated 1 in 5 Americans who gets the flu each year, according to the NIH, there may be an unexpected upside to your illness. It may help you battle future versions of the virus. Ye Shen “Overall, the preexisting immunity you develop through natural infection helps to strengthen immune responses,” said Ye Shen, study corresponding author and a professor in the UGA College of Public Health. “We didn’t fully understand how preexisting immunity through natural infection with different influenza strains changes vaccine-elicited immune responses before this study. Now we have a better understanding of how preexisting immunity to influenza influences immune responses to different types of vaccines.” Flu shots aim to keep up with an evolving virus Each flu season, your flu shot targets certain strains of the virus. So when scientists develop the influenza vaccine, they have to make educated guesses about which strains are most likely to be circulating ahead of time. While plenty of research goes into developing the shot, it’s never going to be right 100% of the time. The flu virus’s ability to constantly evolve and develop new and more virulent strains makes it difficult to fight. “In some years, we don’t have very good protection from the vaccine because of that mismatch,” Shen said. “People have started to worry about whether the shot is actually protecting them from the flu because of that. With this study, though, we do see benefits of having preexisting immunity, and that’s good to know.” Vaccination post-recovery can bolster immune system The researchers tested vaccines made of various flu strains. They found when animals were infected with one strain of the flu, the animals had a heightened immune response when given a vaccine targeting that same strain. But overall immunity also improved significantly when the animals were given a vaccine targeting a different flu strain, after being infected with the original strain of the virus. With the body protecting itself against one strain with its natural immune response and the vaccine eliciting broader immune responses to a spectrum of flu strains, the body was better shielded. Animals that were not initially infected with the virus but did get the vaccine were more likely to need a booster because they lacked natural immunity. This research is part of a larger, seven-year NIH-funded study that aims to create universal influenza vaccines for vulnerable populations. “Our future studies will further explore more clinically relevant outcomes including actual infections in humans. It may not be enough just to push your antibodies higher,” Shen said. “Is that enough to protect you from mutations of different influenza strains? This is where individual-level heterogeneity becomes important, which remains an ongoing area of research in the field.” Published in the journal Vaccine, the study was co-authored by Yao Lu, who also conducted much of the data analysis, and Andreas Handel, from the UGA College of Public Health, and Ted Ross, of the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine. Additional co-authors include Yang Ge, James D. Allen, Tal Einav, Dennis I. Nkaleke and Fengwei Bai.

Research shows that getting the flu vaccine can reduce influenza illnesses by 40% to 60%. It’s important to stay healthy, and if we get the vaccine sooner rather than later, we can avoid a strain on our healthcare system. Here are a few common questions about the flu vaccine to help ease any doubt that the flu shot is well worth the needle prick. Learn more about our flu clinics Why do I need a flu vaccine every year? We have to get the vaccine every year, because the flu virus is constantly changing. So, the flu strains in the vaccine are updated every year by the World Health Organization to ensure it includes inactive strains of the viruses that are predicted to circulate. Unfortunately, we don’t yet have a universal flu vaccine that would protect us from all influenza for all time. Scientists are working on one, but until then, we have to get a vaccine every year. Does the flu shot wear off? Yes, the flu shot wears off in about six months. The flu shot does not provide long-lasting protection, which is another reason we need to get one every year. When should I get a flu shot? We typically suggest getting the flu shot in the early fall, before the virus starts circulating in the community. It takes about two weeks to be fully protected after vaccination. We don’t know when influenza will peak this year, so try to get the vaccine before the end of October. If that’s not possible, it’s never too late — it’s still worth getting the shot, even by February. Will the shot inject me with the actual flu virus? Can it give me the flu? No, the vaccine is made of an inactive version of the flu virus and, therefore, is not infectious. The nasal spray is made of a weakened form of the virus and cannot cause influenza but may cause a mild runny nose for a day or two. After vaccination, some people may experience other side effects such as a headache, mild fever, or muscle aches for a couple of days; these side effects may contribute to the misconception that the flu shot can give someone the flu. Can I get my flu shot and my COVID-19 vaccine (or booster) at the same time? Yes, studies have found that it is safe and effective to get both a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. Studies show there is a slightly increased risk of side effects such as muscle aches and fatigue, but that these are mild and go away quickly. In the near future, we expect a single shot that combines COVID-19 and flu vaccines. Learn about the new RSV prevention methods, includes vaccines for adults and an antibody treatment for infants Is it true that the flu shot doesn’t always work? Yes, it’s true that the flu vaccine won’t always work in everyone who gets it. A person’s immune history has a lot to do with their response to the vaccine. Also, the effectiveness of the vaccine varies each year. However, even when the shot isn’t as effective, it can help minimize how sick people become if they are infected. Can people with egg allergies still get a flu shot? Yes, it’s safe for people with egg allergies to get a flu vaccination, including vaccines made in eggs. However, those with a severe egg allergy are encouraged to get the vaccine in a medical setting with supervision by a healthcare provider who can manage an allergic reaction should one occur. Are non-needle versions of the flu vaccine available? Yes, the nasal flu vaccine is available for most people between the ages of 2 and 49 who are healthy and not pregnant. The FDA recently approved the use of the nasal vaccine by individuals at home by themselves or a caregiver, meaning it does not necessarily need to be administered by a healthcare provider. This nasal vaccine, first approved by the FDA in 2003, has been used safely and effectively for years. Who should not get a flu shot? Children younger than 6-months-old should not get a flu shot, nor should people with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccines. Those who are immunocompromised should talk with their healthcare provider before getting the vaccine, as should those who are not feeling well. To protect individuals who cannot get the flu shot, it is vitally important that everyone around them get their flu shots.Allison Bartlett, MD, MSAllison Bartlett, MD, MS, specializes in the medical management of acute and chronic infectious diseases.

Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies by season. What is added by this report? In five South American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) the 2024 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated hospitalization among high-risk groups by 35%. VE might be similar in the Northern Hemisphere if similar A(H3N2) viruses predominate during the 2024–25 influenza season. What are the implications for public health practice? CDC recommends that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months receive seasonal influenza vaccine. Early antiviral treatment can complement vaccination to protect against severe influenza-related morbidity. Article Metrics Altmetric: TablesTable 1Table 2Related MaterialsArticle PDFFull Issue PDF Abstract To reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, countries in South America recommend annual influenza vaccination for persons at high risk for severe influenza illness, including young children, persons with preexisting health conditions, and older adults. Interim estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) from Southern Hemisphere countries can provide early information about the protective effects of vaccination and help guide Northern Hemisphere countries in advance of their season. Using data from a multicountry network, investigators estimated interim VE against influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization using a test-negative case-control design. During March 13–July 19, 2024, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay identified 11,751 influenza-associated SARI cases; on average, 21.3% of patients were vaccinated against influenza, and the adjusted VE against hospitalization was 34.5%. The adjusted VE against the predominating subtype A(H3N2) was 36.5% and against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 37.1%. These interim VE estimates suggest that although the proportion of hospitalized patients who were vaccinated was modest, vaccination with the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine significantly lowered the risk for hospitalization. Northern Hemisphere countries should, therefore, anticipate the need for robust influenza vaccination campaigns and early antiviral treatment to achieve optimal protection against influenza-associated complications. Top Introduction Influenza epidemics typically occur during the cool weather months of April–September in the Southern Hemisphere and October–May in the Northern Hemisphere. Every year, it is estimated that influenza results in 716,000–829,000 hospitalizations and 41,007–71,710 deaths throughout the Americas (1,2). To prevent influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, most countries in the Americas have implemented influenza vaccination programs (3). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean – influenza (Red para la Evaluación de Vacunas en Latino América y el Caribe – influenza [REVELAC-i])† provides timely information about the vaccination status of hospitalized influenza patients and vaccine effectiveness (VE), which guides public health messaging and influenza vaccine composition decisions for each Southern Hemisphere season. Southern Hemisphere VE estimates also herald what Northern Hemisphere jurisdictions might anticipate about VE if the same influenza viruses circulate during their upcoming influenza season. Top Methods Data Sources Patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), defined as an acute respiratory illness with either a history of fever or measured body temperature ≥100.4°F (≥38°C), cough, and onset ≤10 days before hospitalization, were identified through the SARInet Plus network.§,¶ Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza virus by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and typed and subtyped in national reference laboratories. The study population comprised SARI patients in three mutually exclusive PAHO target groups for vaccination: young children, persons with comorbidities, and older adults; definitions of young children and older adults varied among the countries.** March–July 2024 data were pooled from 2,535 hospitals, including 30 in Argentina, 2,477 in Brazil, 13 in Chile, five in Paraguay, and 10 in Uruguay. VE evaluation began 2 weeks after commencement of each country’s influenza vaccination campaign.†† All countries used World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended egg-based Southern Hemisphere formulations. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay used trivalent vaccines containing antigens from A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus, A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like virus, and B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus. Paraguay used quadrivalent vaccines that also contained the B/Yamagata lineage–like virus.§§ Study Design VE against influenza-associated hospitalization was estimated using a test-negative case-control study design. Case-patients were SARI patients who received a positive influenza RT-PCR test result. Control patients were SARI patients who received negative RT-PCR test results for both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 (4). Vaccination status was ascertained using unique patient identifiers to link to national electronic immunization records. SARI patients who received the 2024 influenza vaccine ≥14 days before symptom onset were considered vaccinated. Those not vaccinated before symptom onset were considered unvaccinated, and those vaccinated 0–13 days before symptom onset were excluded from the evaluation. Data Analysis VE was calculated by comparing the odds of influenza vaccination between influenza test-positive SARI case-patients and influenza test-negative control patients using multivariable logistic regression, overall and by target group.¶¶ To reduce potential confounding, models were adjusted for country, sex, age in years (cubic spline), week of symptom onset (cubic spline), and presence of at least one comorbidity. Analyses were stratified by influenza type and subtype when at least five patients contributed to each stratum or when the width of the 95% CI was <140 percentage points from lower to upper bounds. Because Brazil accounted for the majority of SARI cases, a sensitivity analysis excluding Brazil was conducted. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** Top Results Characteristics of the Study Population During March 13–July 19, 2024, among a total of 111,856 SARI patients identified, 100,260 were excluded because of missing influenza RT-PCR results (70,055); ineligibility or not being in a vaccine target group (14,245); symptom onset before vaccine availability, outside the influenza season, or after hospital admission (7,581); unknown vaccination status or vaccination date (5,157); specimen collection >10 days after symptom onset (1,220); vaccination <14 days before symptom onset (911); receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (503); not meeting the SARI case definition (251); or missing demographic information (201). A total of 11,751 patients met inclusion criteria, including 630 (5.4%) from Argentina, 9,095 (77.4%) from Brazil, 1,584 (13.5%) from Chile, 162 (1.4%) from Paraguay, and 280 (2.4%) from Uruguay (Table 1). Overall, 6,851 (58.3%) patients were young children, 1,702 (14.5%) were older children and adults with comorbidities, and 3,198 (27.2%) were older adults. The majority of SARI patients in Brazil were in the young children target group. Characteristics of Influenza Case-Patients Approximately one third (32.7%; 3,848) of SARI patients received a positive influenza test result; most (98.6%) viruses identified were influenza A viruses. Only 26 (0.7%) patients were infected with influenza B viruses, all of which were B/Victoria lineage; influenza virus type was missing for 28 (0.7%) case-patients. Among 2,382 (61.9%) influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 1,628 (68.3%) were A(H3N2) and 754 (31.7%) A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure). The majority of influenza case-patients were older adults (59.2%), followed by persons with comorbidities (50.4%); the lowest percentage of cases (16.0%) occurred among young children (p<0.001). Vaccination Status of Case- and Control Patients Overall, 21.3% of SARI patients were vaccinated; vaccination coverage varied by target group: 29.3% of older adults, 19.4% of young children, and 14.5% of persons with comorbidities were vaccinated (p<0.001) (Table 1). Among 3,848 influenza case-patients, 704 (18.3%) had received a 2024 seasonal influenza vaccine compared with 1,804 of 7,903 (22.8%) control patients (p<0.001). Vaccine Effectiveness The adjusted VE against any influenza-associated hospitalization was 34.5% overall, including 58.7% among persons with comorbidities, 39.0% among young children, and 31.2% among older adults (Table 2). Among influenza A subtypes, VE was 36.5% against the predominating A(H3N2) and 37.1% against A(H1N1)pdm09. As of July 19, too few influenza B detections were available to estimate VE. Adjusted VE against SARI from any influenza virus was 42.2% in Argentina, 30.3% in Brazil, 56.9% in Chile, and 61.0% in Uruguay; VE was not calculated for Paraguay because data were insufficient. In the sensitivity analysis excluding Brazil, the adjusted VE for all other countries was 56.5%. Genetic Characterization of Viruses Reported by REVELAC-i Countries As of August 12, most A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses reported by REVELAC-i countries to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data††† were clade 5a.2a.1 (64.2%) or 5a.2a (35.8%). Most reported A(H3N2) viruses were clade 2a.3a.1 subclade J.2 (92.3%), subclade J.1 (7.5%), or subclade J (0.1%).§§§ Top Discussion This evaluation suggests that while only one in five SARI patients had received the 2024 influenza vaccine, those who were vaccinated were at significantly lower risk for hospitalization from any influenza virus infection, including the predominant influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes. Although South American countries prioritized young children, persons with comorbidities, and older adults for vaccination to prevent influenza illness complications, the documented influenza vaccination coverage levels (21.3%) were below pre–COVID-19 norms. This finding is consistent with postpandemic declines in vaccination coverage across the Americas associated with vaccine misinformation, hesitancy, and disruptions in routine immunization services, prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic (3). Vaccination remains one of the most effective measures to prevent influenza-associated complications, including death.¶¶¶ Annual influenza vaccination should be encouraged for young children, persons with comorbidities, and older adults (5). Influenza vaccine postintroduction evaluations and knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys might identify additional reasons for low coverage and strategies for improved coverage for the next Southern Hemisphere season. Despite the low influenza vaccination coverage, those vaccinated were protected against hospitalization. The 34.5% REVELAC-i VE against all influenza-associated hospitalization was within historical ranges of 34%–53% against A(H3N2) and 18%–56% against A(H1N1)pdm09 (6). Vaccination likely prevented 36.5% of influenza A(H3N2)–associated and 37.1% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09–associated hospitalizations. VE was lowest in Brazil, likely because a higher proportion of cases in Brazil occurred among young children, a population with a VE estimate in the lower range among the three target groups. If these clades predominate during the Northern Hemisphere influenza season and the updated A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like virus antigen provides similar protection against clade 2a.3a.1, health authorities might anticipate similar levels of protection from the 2024–25 vaccine (7). To enhance this year’s modest influenza vaccine protection against hospitalization, providers should treat patients with suspected or confirmed influenza as soon as possible with antivirals. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, small interim-estimate sample sizes precluded the estimation of VE against influenza B. Second, although the analyses were robust, 63% of patients were excluded because they did not receive RT-PCR results in time for the interim analysis. Third, Brazil, which is approximately three times as populous as the other countries combined,**** accounted for approximately 80% of the study population and included a higher percentage of SARI patients in the young children target group compared with that in other countries. Overall analyses were adjusted for country and target group but might still be more representative of Brazil’s VE estimate. Fourth, this analysis does not distinguish between young children who received 1 or 2 vaccine doses; VE might be higher among young children who received 2 influenza vaccine doses. Finally, these results might not be generalizable to other target groups or to countries with different viral circulation and vaccination strategies. Implications for Public Health Practice Interim VE estimates from the REVELAC-i Network suggest that influenza vaccines are effective in preventing approximately one third of influenza-related hospitalizations among groups prioritized for vaccination. Although Southern Hemisphere influenza VE is not necessarily predictive of Northern Hemisphere VE, it can help the Northern Hemisphere plan contingencies for vaccination demand and use. These data suggest that influenza vaccine demand was still low post–COVID-19 but that vaccination prevented approximately one third of influenza-associated hospitalizations among groups at high risk for influenza-associated complications. These findings support CDC and WHO’s recommendation that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months should receive influenza vaccination (5,8). If similar influenza viruses continue to predominate during Northern Hemisphere influenza season and the updated A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)–like antigen provides similar protection against circulating influenza A(H3N2) viruses, health authorities might anticipate similar levels of protection. Nonpharmaceutical measures, such as hand washing and mask use, and early antiviral treatment can complement vaccination for stronger protection against influenza illness and its complications.

While hemagglutinin mutations are recognized for their role in cross-species transmission, the contribution of neuraminidase remains understudied. Here, the NA’s role in FLUAV adaptation was investigated using a swine-adapted H3N2 reassortant virus with human-derived HA and NA segments. Adaptation in pigs resulted in mutations in both HA (A138S) and NA (D113A). The D113A mutation abolished calcium (Ca2+) binding in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket of NA, enhancing enzymatic activity and thermostability under Ca2+-depleted conditions, mirroring swine-origin FLUAV NA behavior. Structural analysis predicts that swine-adapted H3N2 viruses lack Ca2+ binding in this pocket. Further, residue 93 in NA (G93 in human, N93 in swine) also influences Ca2+ binding and impacts NA activity and thermostability, even when D113 is present. These findings demonstrate that mutations in influenza A virus surface proteins alter evolutionary trajectories following interspecies transmission and reveal distinct mechanisms modulating NA activity during FLUAV adaptation, highlighting the importance of Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity calcium-binding pocket.

This is because the virus must undergo adaptive evolution to replicate, transmit, and become endemic in the new host population. FLUAV have two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA recognizes sialic acids (SAs) on the cell surface and triggers virus entry into the host cells1,2. The NA shows an opposite activity, cleaving SAs to allow the virus to move through the respiratory mucus by preventing binding to decoy receptors and to promote virus release from infected cell3,4.Due to its central role in the infection process, the HA protein is considered the primary driver of adaptation to a new host species. This adaptation often involves the acquisition of mutations in the receptor binding site (RBS) that enhance affinity for host-specific SA conformations5,6,7. Previous studies have demonstrated that adaptation of FLUAVs isolated from humans to pigs results in amino acid changes in the HA RBS, increasing affinity for swine airway epithelial cells8 and improving transmission efficiency compared to the original human virus9. However, other gene segments also contribute to the adaptation of human-origin FLUAVs to pigs, with the acquisition of a well-adapted internal gene segment constellation seemingly essential10,11,12. Human FLUAVs introduced to pigs frequently lose their internal gene segments through reassortment, acquiring swine-adapted gene segments from endemic strains13. Interestingly, the surface gene segments (HA and NA) often persist in the swine population, albeit with significant genetic differences from the precursor strains13,14, leading to the establishment of new lineages.The NA protein is a critical factor in FLUAV adaptation across species, as it must maintain a functional balance with HA for successful infection15. Adaptive mutations in the HA RBS can disrupt this balance, often prompting compensatory mutations in the NA protein16. NA is a homotetrameric enzyme with hydrolase activity, with each monomer consisting of a transmembrane domain, a stalk domain, and a head domain containing the catalytic pocket17,18,19. While the catalytic pocket is present in each monomer, optimal sialidase activity is only achieved in the tetrameric state20,21,22. Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential cofactor for NA activity, and most NA subtypes possess a high-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket near the active site of each monomer23,24,25. This binding event is thought to induce a conformational change in the catalytic site, facilitating proper SA binding26,27. In addition to the high-affinity site, certain subtypes such as N1 and N2 NAs have a second, low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket located within the symmetry axis of the tetramer27,28. This second site is believed to contribute to tetramer stability and, indirectly, to NA activity, as NA activity is dependent on the tetrameric form28,29,30. Notably, the crystal structure of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus NA revealed that the virus quickly changed its calcium preference in the symmetry axis after jumping from pigs to humans28.Despite these observations, the precise role of the second Ca2+-binding site in the adaptation of FLUAV between species remains poorly understood and requires further investigation. In this study, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms of human-derived FLUAV HA and NA gene segments during transmission in a swine host. Utilizing a reassortant virus carrying HA and NA segments from the human strain A/Victoria/361/2011 (hVIC/11) in a swine-origin FLUAV backbone. The rapid emergence of an adaptative mutation was observed in HA (A138S, H3 numbering—herein referred to as the hVIC/11-A138S strain) near the RBS that evolved after infection of pigs8. Subsequently, and after two serial transmission events in vivo in pigs, the emergence and fixation of a novel mutation in the NA, D113A, was observed. In silico structural analyses revealed that amino acid 113 in the N2 NA of hVIC/11 interacts with Ca2+ in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket, a characteristic typically observed in human H3N2 strains. Remarkably, the D113A mutation abolished Ca2+ binding in this pocket, but concurrently enhanced NA thermostability and activity under Ca2+-depleted conditions. However, the A113 variant is uncommon in both human and swine H3N2 strains, and, notably, swine-origin H3N2 FLUAVs harboring this mutation are predicted to be unable to bind Ca2+ in the low-affinity pocket. This observation prompted further investigation into the molecular determinants of this differential binding behavior, which revealed an important role of amino acid at position 93 in NA that further influences Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity pocket and impacts replication and transmission efficiency in pigs. These findings highlight the intricate molecular determinants of FLUAV adaptation between hosts and underscore the critical role of Ca2+ binding in this process.ResultshVIC/11-A138S infects the lower respiratory tract and increases affinity following transmission to contact animalsTo evaluate adaptation to a new host, 3-week-old pigs (seeders) were inoculated intratracheally and intranasally with 3 × 106 TCID50/pig of either hVIC/11-A138S9 or the control swine-adapted virus sOH/0431. Two days post-inoculation (dpi), three naïve pigs (contact 1, C1) were introduced with the inoculated pigs (seeders, Fig. 1). At 5 dpi, seeders were euthanized, and three new naïve pigs (contact 2, C2) were introduced to the C1 pigs. This cycle was repeated for a total of four contact groups. Nasal swabs were collected throughout the study, and lung samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected during necropsies at 5 dpi.Fig. 1: hVIC/11-A138S replicates in pigs’ upper and lower respiratory tract with increasing lung involvement by the fourth round of sustained transmission.Pigs were challenged with either sOH/04 or hVIC/11-A138S and nasal swabs were collected. Lung tissue and BALF samples were collected during necropsies at 5 dpi/6 dpc. a Viral titers in nasal swab samples (n = 3 per contact) from pigs challenged with hVIC/11-A138S. b Viral titers in nasal swab samples (n = 3 per contact) from pigs challenged with sOH/04. Viral titers from the trachea (c), right cranial lobe (d), left cranial lobe (e), right caudal lobe (f), left caudal lobe (g), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (h), and the accessory lobe (i) from hVIC/11-A138S-infected pigs were determined by RT-qPCR and normalizing all samples to 1 μg total RNA. All statistical analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA. Values represent the mean ± SD.Full size imageVirus titration of nasal swabs confirmed successful transmission of hVIC/11-A138S among all contacts, peaking at approximately 105 TCID50eq/mL by 3 dpi (Fig. 1a). The sOH/04 virus control was also detected in all contacts (Fig. 1b), albeit at higher titers (approximately 106 TCID50eq/mL). The hVIC/11-A138S virus infected the trachea of all seeders and contact pigs (Fig. 1c). Virus titers in the right cranial, left cranial, and right caudal lobes (Fig. 1d–f) increased significantly by contact 4 (approximately 104 TCID50eq/mL) compared to the seeder and/or C1 pigs. While no significant differences were observed in the left caudal lobe or BALF samples (Fig. 1g, h), although a trend towards higher titers was noted in contact 4 pigs’ BALF samples. Notably, the virus initially failed to infect the accessory lobe of seeders and C1 pigs (Fig. 1i), with titers below the limit of detection (<101 TCID50eq/mL) but was detected in subsequent contacts from C2 onward (approximately 103 TCID50eq/mL). These findings suggest that hVIC/11-A138S replication efficiency in the lower respiratory tract increased with each transmission, ultimately infecting all lung lobes by the study’s conclusion.Serial transmission of hVIC/11-A138S in pigs selected for a mutant with a single amino acid mutation in NAAfter sequencing analysis of nasal swabs and BALF samples, only minor variants (present in less than 50% of sequences) were observed in the hVIC/11-A138S HA segment (Fig. 2a), and none of these variants became fixed or were transmitted. However, a mutation in the NA, D113A, was detected in contact 2 pigs as a major variant (present in more than 50% of sequences) that eventually became prevalent and was transmitted to all contact 3 and 4 pigs (Fig. 2b). No positive selection was observed in the HA segment (Supplementary Fig. 1a), while signs of positive selection were observed for the NA segment in contacts 1 and 2 sequences (Supplementary Fig. 1b). After acquisition of the D113A amino acid change, no positive selection was observed in this segment. No major changes were observed in the sOH/04 control virus surface gene segments (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using the NA crystal structure information that closely matches the sequence of hVIC/11 NA (A/Tanzania/205/2010, Supplementary Fig. 3) revealed that the amino acid at position 113 located within the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket of the NA is essential for Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2c). The polar side chain of aspartic acid (D) at this position is predicted to stabilize a water molecule via a hydrogen bond (one per monomer) in the symmetry axis (Fig. 2c, top panel), facilitating the coordination of a single Ca2+ ion. When D113 is mutated to alanine (A), this polar interaction is lost, likely impairing Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2c, bottom panel). Notably, temporal analysis of residue frequency reveals that D113 and A113 were similarly prevalent in swine H3N2 viruses until the early 2000s (Fig. 2d). However, D113 has since become predominant, reaching 100% frequency by 2022.Fig. 2: In vivo transmission of hVIC/11-A138S selects for a single mutation in the NA segment.Nasal swab samples collected at days 1, 2, and 5 dpi and 1, 3, and 6 dpc were sequenced and viral variants across the HA (a) and NA (b) segments were identified and their abundance was quantified. Mutations were classified as nonsynonymous (yellow) or synonymous (blue). A minimum threshold for major variants was arbitrarily set at 0.5 and the fixation point at a frequency of 1 (dashed lines). The frequency is expressed in the y axis in a log scale from 0 to 1. The data represents the diversity observed in three pigs per contact.

To investigate this effect in viruses with the N2 NA D113A mutation, two recombinant viruses were produced carrying this mutation, with or without the HA A138S mutation (hVIC/11-A138S/D113A and hVIC/11-D113A, respectively). Replication kinetics of these viruses were evaluated in various human and swine cell lines (Fig. 3a) and compared to hVIC/11-A138S, hVIC/11, and sOH/04 viruses. The N2 NA D113A mutation did not affect virus replication in MDCK, PK15, A549, or differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells (Fig. 3a). Neither hVIC/11 nor hVIC/11-D113A replicated in differentiated primary swine airway epithelial (SAE) cells, unlike hVIC/11-A138S and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A, confirming the advantage conferred by the HA A138S mutation for replication in swine cells9.Fig. 3: The NA D113A mutation provides no advantage for virus growth in SAE cells but increases NA thermostability and sialidase activity under Ca2+ -depleted conditions.a Viral growth kinetics of sOH/04 (blue), hVIC/11 (yellow), hVIC/11-A138S(red), hVIC/11-D113A (black), and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A (purple) in MDCK, PK15, A549, HAE, and SAE cells infected at an MOI of 0.01.

Values represent the means ± SD of three independent experiments. p values were obtained by ordinary one-way ANOVA.Full size imageDisruption of Ca2+ binding in the symmetry axis may negatively impact NA stability28. To investigate this, the temperature at which 50% of NA activity is lost (T50) was established for NAs containing either D113 or A113 (Fig. 3b) in the absence or in the presence of physiological Ca2+ concentration (2 mM). The assay revealed that introducing the D113A mutation decreased the T50 of NA proteins at 2 mM Ca2+ (hVIC/11-D113A, 52.03 °C; hVIC/11-A138S/D113A, 51.19 °C) compared to control viruses with wild-type (WT) NA (hVIC/11, hVIC/11-A138S, and sOH/04), which exhibited T50 values averaging 5 °C higher (Fig. 3b, left panel; Fig. 3c). In the absence of Ca2+, all T50 values decreased compared to those at 2 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 3b, right panel). Remarkably, viruses carrying D113A, particularly hVIC/11-A138S/D113A (T50 44.44 °C), showed significantly higher values than the WT hVIC/11 (T50 39.51 °C) in the absence of Ca2+, behaving more like the sOH/04 strain (T50 43.40 °C) (Fig. 3c). These findings suggest that disrupting Ca2+ binding in the symmetry axis decreases NA thermostability at 2 mM Ca2+ but stabilizes the protein in the absence of Ca2+.The sialidase activity in the absence of Ca2+as a percentage of the activity at 2 mM Ca2+ measured at 37 °C (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 4) revealed that mutant viruses containing the A113 mutation (hVIC/11-A138S/D113A and hVIC/11-D113A) maintained high levels of NA activity under Ca2+-depleted conditions similar to sOH/04 (39.14%). These mutants also exhibited enhanced activity compared to hVIC/11, which was nearly inactivated in the absence of Ca2+ (3.81%). Notably, the virus with both the A138S mutation in the HA and the D113A mutation in the NA retained the highest levels of sialidase activity in the absence of Ca2+, exceeding 50%.Ca2+ binding within the low-affinity Ca2+ binding pocket is influenced by amino acid 93Analysis of the predicted hVIC/11 and sOH/04 and NA structures (sOH/04 model derived from homology with A/Moscow/10/1999 (H3N2), Supplementary Fig. 5), suggests that the latter likely does not bind Ca2+ in this pocket despite having D113 (Fig. 4a). This model indicates altered interactions between sOH/04 NA and water molecules within the symmetry axis compared to hVIC/11, disrupting Ca2+ coordination. This is attributed to a reduced ϕ angle between G111 and G112 in sOH/04’s NA (159.3°) relative to hVIC/11’s NA (176.8°), which repositions the D113 side chain (Supplementary Fig. 6a). To verify this, the D113A mutation was introduced into sOH/04 NA (sOH/04-D113A). This did not alter NA activity at varying Ca2+ concentrations compared to WT sOH/04 NA (Fig. 4b) nor affected thermal stability at 2 mM or 0 mM Ca2+, further supporting the notion that sOH/04 NA does not bind Ca2+ in this pocket (Fig. 4c). Sequence alignment revealed an important difference at position 93, in which asparagine (N) is present in sOH/04 NA and glycine (G) in hVIC/11 NA (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Temporal analysis of human and swine H3N2 NA sequences (1992-2023) showed residue 93 in human isolates shifting from K (lysine) to N to D by the early 2010s, with G becoming prevalent as of 2023 (Supplementary Fig. 6c and d). Swine H3N2 viruses initially carried K93, gradually replaced by N93 (Supplementary Fig. 6c, bottom panel), which became fixed by the 2010s and has not changed ever since. This change at position 93 appears to affect subsequent residues, potentially explaining the altered ϕ angle between G111 and G112 (Supplementary Fig. 6e). This is further supported by comparing NA activity of swine- and human-origin H3N2 FLUAVs at different Ca2+ concentrations. Human H3N2 FLUAVs have exhibited reduced tolerance to Ca2+ depletion since the early 2000s (Supplementary Fig. 7a–i), contrasting with swine H3N2 strains, which largely retain high sialidase activity in the absence of Ca2+ (Supplementary Fig. 7j–q). This effect on NA activity seems to be associated with the residue at position 93 (Supplementary Table S1).Fig. 4: Amino acid 93 modulates Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity Ca2+ -binding pocket and stabilizes the NA tetramer under Ca2+-depleted conditions.a NA protein model showing the interaction of G111, G112, and D113 with water molecules in the symmetry axis of the NA tetramer of hVIC/11 (right panel, green) and sOH/04 (left panel, blue).

Values are shown as the means of three independent experiments and p values were obtained by ordinary one-way ANOVA.Full size imageTo investigate the influence of residue 93 on NA physiochemical properties, the N93 substitution was introduced into the hVIC/11 NA, generating both hVIC/11-G93N and hVIC/11-A138S/G93N mutants. While the presence of Ca2+ led to a slight decrease in T50 compared to the unmodified hVIC/11, the absence of Ca2+ revealed a distinct pattern. In this Ca2+-depleted environment, the hVIC/11-G93N mutant exhibited a significant increase in T50 (47.22 °C) compared to both hVIC/11 and hVIC/11-A138S/G93N (Fig. 4d, e). The impact of residue 93 was not limited to the hVIC/11 NA. The N93G mutation in sOH/04-N93G NA also affected stability, resulting in reduced T50 values under both Ca2+-replete and Ca2+-depleted conditions compared to the sOH/04 control virus. These observations underscore the consistent influence of residue 93 on NA stability, regardless of the specific NA mutant or Ca2+ availability. Interestingly, this influence on stability extended to NA activity. The hVIC/11 mutants containing N93 demonstrated a remarkable 6-fold increase in sialidase activity compared to hVIC/11 in the absence of Ca2+ (hVIC/11-G93N, 22.14%; hVIC/11-A138S/G93N, 31.02%; hVIC/11, 3.8%; Fig. 4f, g). Conversely, the G93 mutation in sOH/04-N93G led to a reduction in activity compared to the sOH/04 control. These contrasting effects suggest that residue 93 not only modulates stability but also plays a crucial role in fine-tuning NA activity in response to Ca2+ availability.Amino acids 93 and 113 differentially modulate neuraminidase enzymatic parametersThe impact of amino acids 93 and 113 on NA enzymatic activity was investigated by analyzing substrate affinity and sialic acid hydrolysis velocity. Recombinant NA constructs (rNA) consisting of the NA ectodomain fused to various tags (Fig. 5a) were expressed, purified, and evaluated for purity (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Upon cleavage of the introduced domains (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 8b and c), the released NA ectodomain was used to assess reaction velocity using MUNANA. While D113A did not affect the velocity of hVIC/11-D113A rNA, it reduced the reaction velocity in sOH/04-D113A rNA (Fig. 5c, d). Conversely, introduction of N93 increased the reaction velocity five-fold in hVIC/11-G93N rNA compared to hVIC/11 rNA (0.017 μM/min and 0.0033 μM/min, respectively), while G93 decreased the velocity of sOH/04-N93G rNA compared to sOH/04 rNA (0.011 μM/min versus 0.036 μM/min, Fig. 5d). These findings suggest that residues 93 and 113, although not part of the active site, influence NA catalytic properties.Fig. 5: Amino acids 93 and 113 distinctly affect NA kinetic parameters and promote NA activity under Ca2+-depleted conditions by stabilizing the NA tetramer.a Schematic representation of NA constructs expressed in High 5 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. b Western blot of recombinant NAs detected using an anti-His antibody before and after thrombin digestion to release the NA ectodomain. c NA enzymatic reaction velocity using recombinant proteins from hVIC/11rNA (yellow), hVIC/11-G93N rNA (brown), hVIC/11-D113A rNA (black), sOH/04 rNA (blue), sOH/04-N93G rNA (orange), and sOH/04-D113A rNA (pink).

Conversely, both sOH/04-N93G rNA and sOH/04-D113A rNA exhibited increased KM, indicating reduced substrate affinity compared to sOH/04 rNA. Assessment of maximum velocity (Vmax) showed that hVIC/11-G93N rNA displayed the highest Vmax among hVIC/11-derived NAs, while hVIC/11-D113A rNA had a reduced Vmax compared to hVIC/11 rNA (Fig. 5g). Similarly, G93 and A113 reduced Vmax in sOH/04 NA. These results suggest that residue N93 enhances the reaction Vmax, whereas A113 decreases it.Calculation of the turnover number (kcat) further supported these observations (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e, Supplementary Table 2), demonstrating increased kcat in hVIC/11-G93N rNA and decreased kcat in hVIC/11-D113A rNA compared to hVIC/11 rNA. The opposite effect was observed in sOH/04 NA mutants. Additionally, the specificity constant (kcat/KM) was increased in hVIC/11-G93N rNA and reduced in both hVIC/11-D113A rNA and sOH/04 NA mutants (Supplementary Fig. 8f, Supplementary Table 2). This analysis indicates that N93 modulates catalytic power by affecting interactions after enzyme-substrate complex formation, while A113 decreases the catalytic efficiency noted as a reduced kcat/KM.Examination of T50 values linked the increased activity of hVIC/11-G93N rNA to enhanced thermostability, whereas hVIC/11-D113A rNA exhibited reduced T50 under 2 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 5h, i). Similar trends were observed in sOH/04 NA mutants. Notably, both hVIC/11-G93N rNA and hVIC/11-D113A rNA displayed increased stability and activity at 0 mM Ca2+ compared to hVIC/11 rNA (Fig. 5j, Supplementary Fig. 9), whereas sOH/04r-N93G rNA showed reduced activity. The correlation between NA thermostability and activity under Ca2+-depleted conditions was confirmed by a Pearson test (Fig. 5k). Thus, residues 93 and 113 differentially modulate NA catalytic power by influencing the tetramer stability. Notably, amino acids destabilizing Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket, prevalent in recent swine H3N2 viruses, enhance NA stability and activity in Ca2+-depleted conditions.Amino acids 93 and 113 impact the HA/NA balanceTo assess the impact of NA mutations at positions 93 and 113 on the balance between HA and NA activities, a red blood cell elution assay was performed, measuring the time required for a 50% reduction in HA titers under NA activity (Fig. 6a–f). At 2 mM Ca2+, hVIC/11-A138S exhibited the fastest elution, while mutations at either residue 93 (G to N) or 113 (D to A) increased elution time. Similarly, sOH/04-N93G showed slower elution kinetics. In the absence of Ca2+, hVIC/11 and hVIC/11-A138S displayed a marked increase in elution time, which was reversed by introducing either N93 or A113. Conversely, sOH/04-N93G maintained a slower elution time even without Ca2+. No elution was observed in the presence of oseltamivir, confirming assay functionality. These differences were statistically significant, indicating that residues 93 and 113 modulate viral elution time, reflecting alterations in the HA/NA balance. The observed changes in elution kinetics suggest that these residues influence the functional interplay between HA and NA, highlighting their role in optimizing viral fitness and adaptation.Fig. 6: Amino acids 93 and 113 affect the HA/NA balance.Viruses were normalized to 32 HAU and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time. a Elution kinetics of hVIC/11 mutants at 2 mM Ca2+. b Elution kinetics sOH/04 mutants at 2 mM Ca2+. c Elution kinetics of hVIC/11 and sOH/04 mutants at 2 mM Ca2+ and 1 μM oseltamivir. d Elution kinetics of hVIC/11 mutants at 0 mM Ca2+. e Elution kinetics sOH/04 mutants at 0 mM Ca2+. f Elution kinetics of hVIC/11 and sOH/04 mutants at 0 mM Ca2+ and 1 μM oseltamivir. g Elution time of hVIC/11 and sOH/04 mutants at 2 mM Ca2+. h Elution time of hVIC/11 and sOH/04 mutants at 0 mM Ca2+. Values are presented as the mean ± SD of two independent experiments. p values were determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test.Full size imageDisruption of Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity site reduces Ca2+ dependency for viral replication and aerosol infectionGiven the importance of NA activity in the FLUAV replication cycle, the biological significance of the D113A mutation in hVIC/11-A138S/D113A was assessed through plaque assays under varying Ca2+ concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 10). At both 2 mM and 0 mM Ca2+, hVIC/11-D113A and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A produced the largest plaques (Fig. 7a). sOH/04 plaques were larger than those of hVIC/11. The hVIC/11 strain exhibited strong Ca2+ dependency, with plaque size reduced by nearly 60% in the absence of Ca2+ compared to the 2 mM condition (Fig. 7b). Conversely, Ca2+ concentration had less impact on hVIC/11-A138S, hVIC/11-D113A, and sOH/04, with plaque size reductions around ≤40%. The hVIC/11-A138S/D113A mutant showed minimal plaque size reduction under 0 mM Ca2+.Fig. 7: D113A decreases Ca2+ requirements for viral replication and enhances aerosol infection under Ca2+ -depleted conditions.a MDCK cells were infected with 10-fold dilutions of hVIC/11 NA mutants and the control sOH/04 virus in media containing 2 (orange), 0.5 (cyan), or 0 mM Ca2+ (purple).

Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 and at 5 hpi the media was replaced with fresh media containing the mentioned Ca2+ concentrations. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. d Viral growth kinetics of hVIC/11, sOH/04, hVIC/11-A138S, hVIC/11-D113A, and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A in aerosol infected MDCK cells. Viruses were aerosolized with (orange) or without (purple) Ca2+ and viral titers were recorded at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. e Viral growth kinetics of hVIC/11, sOH/04, hVIC/11-A138S, hVIC/11-D113A, and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A in aerosol infected PK15 cells. Viruses were aerosolized with (orange) or without (purple) Ca2+ and viral titers were recorded at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.Full size imageViral particle release, predominantly mediated by NA activity, was also evaluated. The hVIC/11 and hVIC/11-A138S viruses showed decreased release in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7c). In contrast, sOH/04 and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A, particularly the latter, exhibited negligible differences among tested Ca2+ concentrations. These findings suggest that impairing Ca2+ binding in the symmetry axis reduces optimal Ca2+ requirements for growth, likely due to enhanced NA activity under low Ca2+ conditions, leading to improved viral release. This effect was particularly pronounced in aerosol infectivity assessments. The hVIC/11 and hVIC/11-A138S viruses showed delayed kinetics in MDCK cells when aerosolized in Ca2+-free media, reaching lower titers at 72 hpi compared to Ca2+-supplemented media (Fig. 7d). In contrast, hVIC/11-D113A, hVIC/11-A138S/D113A, and sOH/04 showed no differences under both conditions, indicating that viruses with Ca2+-destabilizing mutations are less sensitive to Ca2+ concentrations during aerosolization. This phenomenon was even more evident in swine-origin PK15 cells. While no significant differences were observed among viruses upon direct inoculation (Fig. 3a), aerosol delivery revealed a striking contrast (Fig. 7e). The hVIC/11 strain exhibited minimal replication with Ca2+-supplemented media and no detectable titers without Ca2+. However, hVIC/11-D113A and hVIC/11-A138S/D113A replicated similarly under both conditions, although hVIC/11-D113A titers were ultimately lower. These results demonstrate that viruses with reduced Ca2+ requirements for replication (hVIC/11-A138S/D113A, hVIC/11-D113A, and sOH/04) exhibit reduced dependency on this ion during aerosol infection, with minimal differences in growth kinetics between Ca2+ conditions.DiscussionThe NA protein plays a critical role in FLUAV infection, facilitating viral movement through respiratory mucus and promoting viral release by hydrolyzing sialic acid32,33. NA activity is strongly dependent on Ca2+ 34,35, with some subtypes binding up to two Ca2+ ions per monomer plus a central ion in the symmetry axis36. However, most NA subtypes, including N2, primarily bind two Ca2+ ions in distinct high- and low-affinity binding pockets17. The high-affinity pocket is consistently occupied and essential for NA catalysis, as Ca2+ binding repositions the catalytic residues for proper sialic acid binding26. Recent studies have revealed that the low-affinity pocket’s role in modulating N1 NA activity by stabilizing the tetramer is crucial for optimal function28,37. Findings in this report extend this understanding to N2 FLUAV, demonstrating that the low-affinity pocket also modulates N2 NA catalytic properties, potentially serving as a mechanism for regulating the balance between HA and NA activities, and providing a mechanism to modulate NA enzymatic properties without mutating the catalytic residues.Leveraging a swine sustained transmission model and a mutant virus with a mutation in HA (hVIC/11-A138S) previously detected after transmission of a human strain to pigs8, we identified a potentially compensatory mutation, D113A, in the N2 NA low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket. N2 crystal structures of prototypical human strains revealed that residue 113 is the sole amino acid involved in Ca2+ binding at this site in this FLUAV subtype. This contrasts with N1 NAs, where residues K111, D113, and particularly Y170 play key roles in Ca2+ binding in the symmetry axis28. Unlike the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, acquisition of D113A by the human-origin N2 NA did not affect viral replication in the cell lines tested. Furthermore, the failure of hVIC/11-D113A to replicate in swine respiratory cells suggests that this mutation alone does not enhance replication in pigs (Fig. 3a), underscoring the critical role of the HA mutation A138S in adaptation to pigs due to increased affinity for swine cells38,39,40. These findings argue for a sequential adaptation model for human FLUAVs in pigs: initial acquisition of adaptive HA mutations to facilitate binding to swine cells, followed by NA mutations, such as D113A, to restore HA/NA balance disrupted by the prior HA changes. This model emphasizes the dynamic interplay between HA and NA in viral adaptation to new hosts, highlighting the importance of compensatory mechanisms in maintaining viral fitness during host transitions.While the D113A mutation did not affect viral fitness in vitro in this study, it did impact NA thermostability, which is closely linked to Ca2+ binding41. The importance of Ca2+ in enhancing N2 activity has been previously established42. Notably, the D113A mutation increased N2 thermostability under Ca2+-depleted conditions, accompanied by an increase in its activity. Interestingly, swine-adapted N2 NAs inherently exhibit higher sialidase activity in the absence of Ca2+, contrasting with human viruses. The observation of stronger Ca2+ dependency in human-origin N2 aligns with previous reports28,42. The high activity of swine FLUAVs under Ca2+-depleted conditions, despite carrying D113, suggests a lack of Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket. Modeling of sOH/04 NA confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that Ca2+ binding is prevented by repositioning of water molecules in the symmetry axis due to a change in D113 side chain location (Fig. 4). Further support for this mechanism was provided by the introduction of D113A in sOH/04 NA, which resulted in no changes in thermostability compared to sOH/04 (Figs. 4 and 5), confirming that the virus does not bind Ca2+ when either amino acid is present. This suggests that the presence of D113, even without direct Ca2+ interaction, contributes to the overall stability of the NA structure, highlighting the complex interplay between amino acid residues and Ca2+ binding in modulating NA function.Residue 93 appears to be under different selective pressures in humans and swine. While K93 and N93 were present in both human and swine FLUAV in the early 1990s, human isolates rapidly transitioned to D93 and G93, while N93 was retained in swine H3N2 FLUAVs. Protein modeling suggests that the N93 residue destabilizes the interaction of D113 with Ca2+, thereby preventing Ca2+ binding. Interestingly, a similar mechanism has been reported for residue 106 in N1 NAs, which also modulates Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket28. This suggests a conserved mechanism between N1 and N2 NAs for modulating Ca2+ binding at this site, involving specific residues distant from the pocket itself. The presence of this mechanism across subtypes may be due to the high conservation of the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket. Such a mechanism could prevent modifications near the Ca2+-binding pocket that might interfere with tetramer formation, as NA oligomerization is driven by both the head and transmembrane domains43. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.Residues 93 and 113 exert similar effects on Ca2+ binding in both human and swine N2 FLUAVs, yet their impact on NA catalytic properties differs. Notably, while D113A minimally affects sOH/04 rNA Vmax, it reduces hVIC/11 rNA velocity. Conversely, N93 drastically increases reaction velocity within the hVIC/11 rNA. Additionally, sOH/04 rNA displays higher substrate affinity than hVIC/11 rNA, with no difference observed in hVIC/11-G93N rNA, suggesting that N93 seems to influence steps occurring after the enzyme-substrate complex formation, while A113 decreases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. This aligns with previous reports of Ca2+ modulating reaction velocity by favoring enzyme-substrate interactions44,45, although the mechanism remains unclear. The D113A mutation impacts substrate binding, decreasing affinity regardless of NA backbone, potentially explaining its rarity in natural isolates due to disruption of HA/NA balance46,47. Previous work has demonstrated that hVIC/11-A138S exhibits higher affinity for α2,6-SA, indirectly enhancing NA activity9. Based on this, it was hypothesized that the D113A mutation emerged in vivo to compensate for the A138S change in HA and regulate NA activity. Indeed, data revealed a higher elution rate for hVIC/11-A138S compared to hVIC/11 and sOH/04, which was restored to sOH/04-like levels upon introduction of D113A (Fig. 6). These findings underscore the intricate interplay between HA and NA, whereby mutations in one protein can necessitate compensatory changes in the other to maintain optimal viral fitness. Notably, A113 negatively impacted tetramer stability in the hVIC/11 NA backbone, suggesting that other residues might prevent this effect in sOH/04 NA. These two amino acids thus represent distinct mechanisms for N2 NA modulation of activity during host jumps, explaining the tendency of human viruses to bind Ca2+ in the low-affinity Ca2+-binding pocket, while swine H3N2 viruses do not. This suggests a novel role for Ca2+ in FLUAV host range, where viral changes may modulate sialidase activity without modifying the conserved catalytic pocket, by influencing Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity site. This is supported by previous studies on the 2009 pandemic H1N1 NA crystal structures28. Early isolates, upon jumping from pigs to humans carried V106 that destabilized the tetramer at 2 mM Ca2+, but it was quickly replaced by I106 that enhanced N1 NA thermostability and activity under this condition. While that study did not directly link FLUAV host range and Ca2+ binding, the order of events aligns with the hypothesis that HA changes are required early in host adaptation, followed by NA activity modification through altered substrate affinity or reaction velocity, depending on specific residues involved in Ca2+ binding. However, this process seems to cycle between binding and not binding calcium in the symmetry axis28, which could represent a mechanism to compensate for changes in the HA, as the D113A mutation alone cannot grant replication in swine airway cells (Fig. 3).Increased NA thermostability conferred by the D113A substitution reduced the Ca2+ requirement for optimal virus replication to levels comparable to sOH/04. This is likely due to enhanced NA activity under low Ca2+ conditions, leading to more efficient virus release from infected cells28. The increased stability of A113-containing mutants also resulted in more efficient aerosol infection of MDCK cells when the inoculum was aerosolized in the absence of Ca2+, similar to sOH/04. This effect was even more pronounced in PK15 cells, with limited to no replication observed for hVIC/11 and hVIC/11-D113A. Notably, hVIC/11-A138S/D113A demonstrated similar replication kinetics to sOH/04 across all tested conditions. These findings suggest that the absence of Ca2+ in the symmetry axis enhances aerosol infection under Ca2+-depleted conditions, potentially reflecting differences in mucus composition between human and swine, which could select for viruses with distinct aerosol stability. This could explain why hVIC/11 fails to transmit in pigs9 and only replicates in the upper respiratory tract of swine (~37 °C) but not in the lungs (~39 °C)8,9, given that the NA of hVIC/11 is almost inactive at 39 °C in the absence of calcium (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). However, further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.Overall, this study demonstrates distinct Ca2+ binding profiles in human and swine H3N2 FLUAVs, with swine strains lacking Ca2+ binding in the low-affinity pocket. This difference leads to enhanced stability and activity of swine-origin FLUAVs under Ca2+-depleted conditions compared to human-origin FLUAVs, which are almost inactivated under these conditions. Residue 93 modulates Ca2+ binding and significantly impacts reaction velocity by affecting steps after SA binding in the NA catalytic pocket. This difference in reaction velocity and Ca2+ binding suggests a role of Ca2+ in the host range of FLUAV, with those from humans requiring higher Ca2+ concentrations for replication while their swine counterparts have reduced Ca2+ requirements. A better understanding of the biochemical differences of the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans and pigs is needed to understand why swine N2s need to retain high activity under calcium-depleted conditions. Nonetheless, the identification of residues that lead to enhanced fitness in swine cells (such as N93 and A113) can help recognize new spillover events that are more likely to be sustained in pigs and help improve biosecurity measures to decrease viral spread and prevent establishment of novel lineages. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms utilized by FLUAV to regulate NA activity during host adaptation and the potential effects on the HA/NA balance.Materials and methodsEthics statementAnimal studies were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Georgia (protocol A2019 03-031-Y3-A9).

Cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells/well and cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until a 100% confluency was reached. After reaching confluency, cells were differentiated by changing to air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions by removing the apical media and replacing the basal media with PneumaCult ALI Base Media (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), supplemented with PneumaCult ALI Supplement (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 1% PneumaCult ALI Maintenance Supplement (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and 0.5% gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 0.2% heparin (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), and 0.5% hydrocortisone (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 8% CO2 for 5 days and then were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 16 more days.Spodoptera frugiperda pupal ovarian tissue (Sf9) cells were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and maintained in SF-900 II SFM media (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). High Five™ Insect cells (BTI-TN-5B1-4) were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and cultured in Express Five SFM media (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 18 mM L-glutamine (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Both insect cell lines were maintained in suspension at 28 °C.FLUAV viruses used in this study (Table 1) were generated using an eight-plasmid reverse genetics system as previously described49. Parental viruses (hVIC/11, sOH/04, and hVIC/11-A138S) were described before8,9. D113A and G93N/N93G mutations were introduced into hVIC/11 or sOH/04 NA by site-directed mutagenesis using the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 according to the manufacturer’s instructions and plasmids’ sequences were confirmed by whole plasmid sequencing. Viruses were propagated in MDCK cells using Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing 1 μg/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ) at 37 °C. Viral titers were determined by TCID50 using the Reed and Muench method50.Table 1 Swine and human H3N2 viruses used in this studyaFull size tableIn vivo studies3-weeks-old cross-bred pigs obtained from Midwest Research Swine Inc (Glencoe, MN, USA) and housed in animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) facilities at the University of Georgia. Animals were negative for anti-FLUAV NP antibodies by competitive ELISA (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME) and randomly distributed into two groups. Pigs (n = 3, seeders) were inoculated intratracheally and intranasally under anesthesia using a cocktail of ketamine (6 mg/kg), xylazine (3 mg/kg), and Telazol (6 mg/kg) with 3 × 106 TCID50 per pig of hVIC/11-A138S or sOH/04. Animals were checked daily for clinical signs and nasal swabs were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days-post infection (dpi) in 2 mL of brain hart infusion broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). At 2 dpi, naïve pigs (n = 3) were placed as contacts (contact 1, C1) with the directly inoculated animals and were kept together until 5 dpi. At 5 dpi, seeders pigs were sedated using a cocktail of ketamine (3 mg/kg), xylazine (1.5 mg/kg), and Telazol (3 mg/kg) and then humanely euthanized by an intravenous pentobarbital overdose (Euthasol, 390 mg/10 lb). Contact 1 pigs were moved into a clean enclosure after removal of seeder pigs, and additional naïve pigs (n = 3) were placed as new contacts (contact 2, C2). This process was repeated for a total of 4 contacts. Nasal swabs from contact pigs were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 days-post contact (dpc). At 6 dpc, contact pigs were sedated and humanely euthanized as described above. During necropsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected from all pigs.Virus titration from lung tissue, nasal swabs, and BALF samplesLung samples were homogenized using the Tissue Lizer II (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and a Tungsten carbide 3 mm bead (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) for 10 min at 30 Hz. Subsequently, RNA from lung tissues, nasal swabs, and BALF samples was extracted using the MagMax-96 AI/ND viral RNA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) isolation kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA from lung tissue was normalized to 1 μg in 20 μL of nuclease-free water while RNA from nasal swabs and BALF samples were used directly for titration. Samples were titrated using the Quantabio qScript XLT One-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix kit (Quantabio, Beverly MA) targeting the M segment (Supplementary Table 3) according to manufacturer’s instructions.Primary swine tracheal epithelial cells isolationTrachea samples were obtained from three 7-weeks old cross-bred pigs obtained from Midwest Research Swine Inc (Glencoe, MN) and airway epithelial cells were isolated as previously described51 with minor modifications. Briefly, trachea sections were digested for 12 h at 4 °C in DMEM/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 1.5 mg/mL pronase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). After overnight incubation, trachea sections were scraped to release individual cells, and fibroblasts were discarded by plastic adherence for 4 h52. Non-adherent cells were then plated in type I collagen-coated flasks and cultured with BEGMTM Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth Medium BulletKitTM (Lonza, Bend, OR, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Differentiation was performed by seeding 3 × 105 cells/well in type I collagen-coated 12 mm transwell plates (0.4 μm pore size, Corning Inc., NY, USA) in BEGMTM media at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until a 100% confluency was reached. After reaching confluency, BEGMTM media was removed from the apical and basal compartments and ALI media composed of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% NuSerum (Corning Inc., NY, USA), 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and 15 ng/mL retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added to the basal compartment. ALI media was changed every two days and ALI conditions were maintained for 3 weeks prior to use.Next-generation sequencingViral genomic RNA was extracted from nasal swabs collected at 1, 2, and 5 dpi or 1, 3, and 6 dpc and BALF samples using the MagMax-96 AI/ND viral RNA isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After extraction, HA and NA segments were amplified using specific primers (Supplementary Table 3) and the SuperScript III One-Step PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer’s instructions in duplicates. Duplicate PCR products from both HA and NA PCRs from the same sample were pooled in equal volumes and cleaned with 0.45X Agencourt AMPure XP Magnetic Beads (Beckman Colter, Brea, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Clean PCR product concentration was measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) on a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and normalized to 0.2 ng/μL. Sequencing libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Indexed libraries were cleaned with 0.7X Agencourt AMPure XP Magnetic Beads and samples size distribution was analyzed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA-HS assay (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were then pooled, denatured, and further diluted to 10 pM. Finally, samples were sequenced using a MiSeq Reagent Kit V2, 300 cycles (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).Variant analysisAnalyses of FLUAV variants were performed as previously described53,54. Briefly, sequencing adapters were removed using Cutadapt (version 3.4) and then mapped back to their respective reference sequence using option mem from BWA (version 0.7.17)55. Read-pairing errors that may have been introduced by the alignment were corrected using option fixmate, and secondary and unmapped reads were removed. The resulting bam file was used by LoFreq56 following practices outlined in the Genome Analysis Toolkit57 to identify non-consensus variants. Only variants with a frequency of 0.01 (1%) and coverage equal to or above 100 were used. Synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were identified using SNPdat (version v1.0.5)58. The output from SNPdat was inputted into RStudio (R version 4.1.2) for visualization. Variants with a frequency equal to or above 0.5 (50%) were considered major variants.Diversity analysisNucleotide diversity π was calculated using the πN (nonsynonymous) to πS (synonymous) ratio statistics determined using SNPGenie59 for estimation of nucleotide diversity from next-generation sequencing. An arbitrary minimal variant frequency of 0.01 was set for π determination.Amino acid temporal frequency analysis55,590 human origin and 15,514 swine origin N2 sequences from H3N2 FLUAVS from 1992 to 2022 were obtained from GISAID60. Duplicated sequences were discarded, and samples were aligned using Clustal Omega version 1.2.261. Alignments were exported and amino acid frequency at position 93 and 113 was assessed using Geneious version 2024.0.2.NA homology modelFLUAV NA sialidase domains were modeled using the SWISS-MODEL server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)62. hVIC/11 NA model was made using A/Tanzania/205/2010 as template (PDB accession code: 4GZO63) while A/Moscow/10/1999 (PDB accession code: 8DWB64) was used to generate the sOH/04 NA 3D structure. NA structures were visually inspected using PyMOL 3.0 and model quality was assessed using PROCHECK65.Growth kineticsMDCK, A549, and PK15 cells were seeded in 6 well-plates and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until an 80% confluency before use. Cells were infected at a MOI of 0.01 for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and supplemented with fresh Opti-MEM containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. Timepoints were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, and viral titers were determined by RT-qPCR. HAE and differentiated swine tracheal cells were infected by adding 200 μL of virus in the respective ALI media into the apical compartment and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed 5 times with PBS. Timepoints were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi by adding 200 μL of PBS onto the cells and incubating them at 37 °C for 15 min. Viral titers were determined as described above.Neuraminidase activity and thermostabilityNeuraminidase sialidase activity was evaluated using the whole virus as previously described66 or purified recombinant NA (rNA). Briefly, viruses were diluted in reaction buffer (32.5 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid -MES-, 2 mM CaCl2 -unless stated otherwise-, pH 6.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To evaluate purified recombinant proteins, samples were normalized to 50 ng for all of the assays described below. After incubation, 100 μM 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate (MUNANA, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added and reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured every 60 s at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and 460 nm, respectively, using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Agilent BioTek, Santa Clara, CA).NA thermostability was assessed by incubating equal amounts of each virus at 33, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, and 64 °C for 10 min. After incubation, viruses’ NA sialidase activity was measured as mentioned above. NA relative activity was calculated as percentage of the activity at 33 °C. T50 values were obtained by adjusting the curves to a non-linear dose-response logarithmic four parameters equation of the form:$$Y=\frac{a+(a-b)}{1+{10}^{\left(\left(\log \left({T}_{50}-X\right)\, * \, H\right)\right.}}$$Where Y is NA activity in percentage, X is the log(temperature), a is the theoretical maximum activity, b is the theoretical minimum activity, and H is the Hill slope.NA sialidase activity under different concentrations of Ca2+ was performed by adding 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, or 0 mM CaCl2 to the reaction buffer (32.5 mM MES, pH 6.5). Reaction velocity was measured as described above, and relative NA activity was calculated by comparing the reaction velocity under each condition to the 37 °C and 2 mM Ca2+ condition.Enzyme kineticsrNA samples were diluted in NA reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 4-MU production over time was evaluated under different MUNANA concentrations (1.17, 2.34, 4.68, 9.37, 18.75, 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 μM). Fluorescence was measured every 60 s at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and 460 nm and data was fitted to a simple saturation-kinetics Eq. (1) and kcat was obtained by rearranging the Michaelis–Menten Eq. (2) assuming saturated substrate concentrations and a steady-state model:$$v=\frac{{v}_{\max }* [{MUNANA}]}{{K}_{M}+[{MUNANA}]}$$ (1) $${k}_{{cat}}=\frac{{v}_{\max }}{[{E}_{t}]}$$ (2) Red blood cells elusion assayViruses were normalized at 32 HA units (HAU) in Ca2+ -free PBS or PBS supplemented with 2 mM Ca2+. Normalized samples were then mixed with 0.5% turkey red blood cells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, samples were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were collected every 30 min until all HAU were lost. As a control, a duplicate sample supplemented with 1 μM oseltamivir (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was included. Elution due to NA activity was confirmed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h to allow re-agglutination.NA protein expression and purificationNA ectodomain from hVIC/11 and sOH/04 was cloned into the pFastBac1 transfer vector. The stalk domain was replaced and fused in frame to a GG linker, a thrombin cleavage site, a tetramerization domain from the human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), 6x His tag, and a secretion signal as previously described67. D113A and G93N/N93G mutations were introduced as described above. Cloned pFastBac1 plasmids were then used to generate the recombinant bacmids by transforming DH10Bac competent cells (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and insert transposition was confirmed by colony PCR using M13 primers (Supplementary Table 3). Bacmids were purified by alkaline lysis and used to rescue recombinant baculoviruses in Sf9 cells according to the Bac-to-Bac system manual (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).NA proteins were produced by infecting High Five cells at an MOI of 10. When cells reached an 80% mortality (∼72 hpi), the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm. NA constructs were purified from clarified supernatant by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using the HisPur Ni-NTA Spin purification kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in elution buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, and 300 mM imidazole. Subsequently, eluted NAs were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-200 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) column with a running buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.00. NA activity was monitored for each fraction. Finally, purified samples were digested using the Thrombin CleanCleave Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and digestion products were passed through a Superdex-200 column.SDS-PAGE and western blotProtein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 100 ng of either cleaved or non-cleaved NA constructs were boiled for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE using a Mini-Protean TGX Stain-Free Precast Gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For total protein imagining, gels were then fixed with 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid in water for 1 h. Then samples were sensitized for 1 min with 0.02% Na2S2O3 and incubated for 20 min with staining solution (0.1% AgNO3 and 0.02% formaldehyde in water). Finally, gels were developed by incubating them in 3% NaCO3 and 0.05% formaldehyde in water. Gels used for western blot were transferred to a TransBlot Turbo Mini Nitrocellulose membrane and blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBS) at room temperature. After incubation, membranes were washed two times with T-PBS (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, washing buffer) and incubated for 1 h with an anti-His tag primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Membranes were then washed three times (5 min each) and incubated for 1 h with a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in a 1:1,000 dilution in T-PBS. Finally, membranes were washed 5 times and then developed with the SuperSignal West Femto Maximun Sensibility Substrate kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Membranes were imaged using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Plaque assayMDCK cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/cm2 and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) until a 100% confluency before use. The day of infection, culture media was discarded, cells were washed three times with Ca2+ -free DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and were infected using 10-fold serial dilution of each virus in Ca2+ -free DMEM. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, unbound virus was removed by washing cells three times with Ca2+ -free DMEM and then cells were supplemented with DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 0.8% avicel, and variable concentrations of Ca2+ chloride (2, 0.5 or 0 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Infections were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Finally, cells were fixed with 37% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and stained for 15 min with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol.Viral particle releaseViral particles release was evaluated as previously described28. Briefly, MDCK cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Unbound virus was removed by washing cells three times with PBS and cells were supplemented with fresh Opti-MEM containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals, Lakewood, NJ). At 5 hpi, media was discarded and 3 mL of DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.3% BSA, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin, and variable concentrations of CaCl2 was added. Starting at 6 hpi, 100 μL was collected from each condition every 1 h until 12 hpi, and HA titers were measured using 50 μL of sample and 50 μL 0.5% turkey red blood cells.Aerosol infectionMDCK and PK15 cells were seeded and incubated as described above until 80% confluence was reached. Viruses were diluted in Ca2+ -free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 0.3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and used at an MOI of 0.01. For infections performed with Ca2+, 2 mM CaCl2 was added to the infection media. A total of 6 mL of inoculum was aerosolized using the Aeroneb Lab Neubilizer (Small VMD; Kent Scientific, CT, USA) with an expected particle size of 2.5–4 μm. Aerosol was passed through an exposure chamber at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. Cells were exposed for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a 5 min purge. Infections were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed three times with PBS. Finally, Opti-MEM media supplemented with 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin was added, and time points were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi.Statistics and reproducibilityAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 10.3.1. P values were obtained by ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. No data was excluded from the analyses. All data is presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Animal sample size of three animals per group (seeders or contacts) was based on previously published work68,69. Animals were randomly allocated to each group to ensure reproducibility. In vitro experiments were performed at least three times independently in triplicates (n = 3 biological replicates) unless stated otherwise in the figure legend, and results were reproducible between experiments.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Despite their huge potential for achieving herd immunity, child-focused national vaccination strategies that favor pain-free nasal vaccines are uncommon. CENTRAL, Embase, and MEDLINE were last searched on November 13, 2023. Active-controlled randomized controlled trials comparing the live-attenuated intranasal vaccine with the inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccine in children were included. Event rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection, all-cause mortality, hospitalization, serious adverse events, adverse events, and financial outcomes were extracted based on the PRISMA 2020 Guideline. PROSPERO: CRD42021285412. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model when at least three comparable outcomes were available. We found no significant difference between quadrivalent live-attenuated intranasal and trivalent inactivated intramuscular (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 0.49–4.45) or between trivalent live-attenuated intranasal and inactivated intramuscular vaccines (OR = 0.77, CI = 0.44–1.34) regarding their efficacy. However, the subgroup analysis of large, multi-center trials indicated that the trivalent live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine was superior to the trivalent inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccine (12,154 people, OR = 0.50, CI = 0.28–0.88). Only 23 “vaccine-related serious adverse events” were recorded among 17 833 individuals, with no significant difference between methods. The widespread initiation of pediatric national flu vaccination programs prioritizing the live-attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine would be beneficial. Multi-continent, high-quality studies that include children younger than two years old and those living in subtropical and tropical regions are needed to further enhance our understanding. BackgroundGlobally, approximately 290,000–650,000 deaths occur due to influenza each year [1]. As children are particularly at risk for influenza-related complications, vaccination is recommended for those older than six months, with updated recommendations provided annually [2]. Unfortunately, in most countries, vaccination coverage is not well reported and remains well below the WHO target of 75% [3,4,5,6].Trivalent inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccines (IIV) have been licensed for children since 2001 [7]. They are available for children at least 6 months old, with the only contraindication being a previous anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction [8]. Live attenuated vaccines (LAIV) became available later, in 2007 in the USA and 2011 in Europe, for children older than two years, with several contraindications, such as immunosuppression or aspirin use [8,9,10]. After the introduction of trivalent vaccines containing two influenza A and one influenza B subtypes, the first quadrivalent vaccines (containing an additional B subtype) were approved in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in 2013 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [9,10,11]. After the “era” of quadrivalent LAIV and IIV, the World Health Organization (WHO), the FDA, and the EMA have recommended reverting to trivalent vaccines starting from the 2024–2025 season [12,13,14]. Although LAIV might be more accepted by children and families due to its pain-free, potentially self-administrable form, its worldwide use varies, ranging from government-funded school-based vaccination programs to unavailability [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].Meta-analyses on the topic predominantly contain data from observational studies [23, 24]. A recent meta-analysis of test-negative studies suggests similar vaccine effectiveness for all vaccine types, but it included only one study describing trivalent LAIV. Interestingly, it found lower vaccine effectiveness in Asia than in North America, but it could not differentiate between children and adults [24]. According to another meta-analysis, all trivalent vaccines were significantly more effective than placebo, with trivalent LAIV showing superior efficacy [23]. In contrast, no significant difference was observed, when comparing quadrivalent influenza vaccines to a placebo [23]. This study neither included quadrivalent head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) nor detailed safety or cost information [23].Thus, we decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis, including only head-to-head RCTs, to directly compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of LAIV and IIV in children. If the nasal vaccine proves to be as efficacious, safe, and cost-effective as the intramuscular one, it should form the basis of potential national vaccination strategies to support the WHO’s Global Influenza Strategy 2019–2030 [22, 25].MethodsSelection, data extraction, and quality assessmentWe conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [26]. The search was last updated on November 13, 2023, using the following search key: (vaccine OR vaccin* OR immunization OR shot OR injection) AND (influenza OR H1N1 OR H3N2 OR flu OR A/H1N1 OR A/H3N2) AND (pediatric OR paediatric OR child*) AND (random*).We included randomized, active-controlled trials that investigated children after influenza vaccination, comparing LAIV to IIV if they reported rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza, safety events, or numerical data on cost-effectiveness, with no further restrictions. We also performed a manual search for cited and citing papers (via Google Scholar) of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two independent review authors (RG and ÁJ) performed the selection on Rayyan.ai (Rayyan Systems Inc., 2020) [27]. After duplicate removal, articles were screened based on title, abstract, and full text. Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was calculated after each stage to measure inter-rater agreement. Any conflicts were resolved through discussion and consensus. The following data were extracted by RG and VH when at least three comparable outcomes were available: first author, year of publication, age and health status of the study population, study period and site, treatment type and dose, event rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza after vaccination, reactogenicity, and adverse events.We deviated from our protocol (PROSPERO CRD42021285412) by including data on individuals up to 21 years of age, allowing us to include two additional relevant articles [28, 29]. Also, we decided to exclude data on mono- or bivalent vaccines, as they are now clinically irrelevant. Due to insufficient data, we could not report on influenza-like illness rates. Additionally, we chose not to analyze data on antibody responses, as the outcome measures were diverse and merely predictive of real-world performance [30]. Finally, we included data from clinical trial registry sites.Data analysisResults are presented as pooled odds ratios (OR) with p-values, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and prediction intervals using the random effects variant of the Mantel–Haenszel method [31, 32]. In the presence of zero frequency, ORs within the studies were calculated by adding 0.5 to the cell frequencies; however, to calculate the pooled ORs, the exact Mantel–Haenszel method was applied to handle zero frequencies without the mentioned correction. To estimate \({\tau }^{2},\) we used the Paule-Mandel method [33] with Hartung-Knapp adjustment [34]. Besides the prediction interval, heterogeneity was assessed by calculating the I2 measure and its CI and performing the Cochrane’s Q test. The results of the meta-analyses are displayed in forest plots. Publication bias was examined via funnel plot in the presence of eight studies and Egger's test when at least ten studies were available. We assessed the influence of individual studies on the overall pooled effect by leave-one-out analysis for the efficacy analysis. The analysis was executed with package `meta` of the R statistical software (version 4.1.2.) in line with Harrer et al. [35].In the case of overlapping data [36,37,38,39], we prioritized those from the peer-reviewed articles. Data for overall serious adverse and adverse events analyses were derived from cumulatively published data. The risk-of-bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for randomized trials (RoB2) [40] and the GRADE approach [41] were applied to assess evidence quality by RG and VH.SubgroupsMajor subgroups were based on the valency of vaccines. We created additional subgroups based on study size, as the detectable number of influenza virus infections is highly determined by its incidence (3–11% in the USA) [42], to decrease the number of zero events and increase generalizability. Additionally, studying large, multi-center studies helped us analyze cumulative data from different geographical sites. We also aimed to investigate the hypothesis that pre-existing immunity in the host can disturb the immunogenicity of LAIV, especially if the contained strain is antigenically similar to a previously acquired one, limiting its nasal replication. This, in combination with children’s developing immune system, could lead to an improved efficacy for seronegative, usually younger children [43, 44]. Therefore, we designed age categories according to age ranges.ResultsOf the 3,648 relevant trials, 19 were included in the quantitative synthesis (Fig. 1, Table 1). Studies in the meta-analysis were conducted between 1985 and 2021, including data on 15 156 individuals for the efficacy comparison of trivalent vaccines (Table 1, Fig. 2).Fig. 1PRISMA 2020 flowchart representing the study selection processFull size imageTable 1 Basic characteristicsFull size tableFig. 2Comparing the incidence of confirmed influenza cases after influenza vaccination presented in odds ratios. (Results of trivalent versus trivalent analyses are separated from the single quadrivalent LAIV versus trivalent IIV trial, presented on the same forest plot)Full size imageEfficacyThe only active-controlled RCT incorporating results on confirmed influenza virus infection rates was a Phase IV clinical trial conducted in 131 children aged 5–17 years, which resulted in no significant difference between quadrivalent LAIV and trivalent IIV [45] (Fig. 2).When comparing trivalent vaccines directly, there was no significant difference between the methods in the odds of reducing flu infections after vaccination (Fig. 2). No study was identified as significant by the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although we found LAIV superior in large, multi-center studies, we observed the opposite result in smaller trials (Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference between trivalent vaccines when analyzing data from children younger than six years (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Subgroup analyses of the trivalent efficacy analysis. A Comparing larger, multi-center studies with smaller studies. Large, multi-center studies (more than a 100 centers), smaller studies (less than a 100 centers). B Results of children younger than 6 years of ageFull size imageSafetyData from 8958 children obtained from clinical trial protocol sites showed no vaccination-related deaths (Supplementary Fig. 2A).The odds of experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) were significantly higher in the trivalent nasal vaccine group than in the trivalent injectable group (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2Ba). No reported SAEs were found regarding quadrivalent vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 2Ba–c). We observed no significant difference between the groups when investigating the odds of SAEs based on the number of affected individuals (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2Bb). Only 23 “vaccine-related SAEs” were recorded among 17,833 individuals (none after quadrivalent vaccines), with no significant difference between trivalent or quadrivalent methods (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2Bc); even when investigating children younger than nine years (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2Bd).Table 2 Pooled safety results of trivalent vaccines displayed in sequence of the level of GRADE and effect sizeFull size tableOverall, 316 patients (LAIV:1.29% vs. IIV:1.34%) were hospitalized, with a tendency for fewer hospitalizations after administering trivalent LAIV (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2C).A tendency for fewer adverse events (AEs) was observed after administering the trivalent nasal vaccine when comparing event rates (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2D). However, when evaluated by the number of affected individuals, there was a significant difference, with lower odds after the trivalent injectable form (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2D).We compared 21 types of AEs experienced after administering trivalent vaccines (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2A–Yb). A significant difference was observed only for “nasal symptoms”, with lower odds after the injectable form (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2R). We could not meta-analyze asthma exacerbations, but according to the two available studies, there was no significant difference in the odds ratios (OR = 1.08 95% CI 0.90; 1.29 [46] and OR = 1.12 95% CI 0.78;1.60 [36]) (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Regarding quadrivalent vaccines, only coughing (OR = 0.88 95% CI 0.44;1.76) [47], significant wheezing (OR = 0.62 95% CI 0.31;1.21 [47] and OR = 1.67 95% OR = 0.02;137.35 [48]) and asthma exacerbations (OR = 0.70 95% CI 0.26;1.90) [49] were evaluated, with no significant difference between methods; however a meta-analysis could not be conducted (Supplementary Figs. 2H, Yb, E).Cost-effectivenessThree studies assessed cost-effectiveness based on the results of previous trivalent RCTs (Table 1). We could not meta-analyze the data, as confidence intervals of mean costs were reported by only one study [50]. Nonetheless, all studies concluded that LAIV was financially more beneficial [50,51,52]. The explanation behind this is that although the administration of the nasal vaccine was more expensive, in the long term, with the reduction of influenza cases, healthcare utilization, and productivity loss of parents, LAIV resulted in direct and societal savings, making it more favorable for a potential child-focused national vaccination strategy [50,51,52].We found no study comparing quadrivalent RCTs.Quality assessmentThe overall risk of bias in the efficacy analyses was low for all but one study, which raised some concerns in the “deviations from the intended interventions” domain, as the number of patients lost to follow-up was high but accounted for. Two other studies raised concerns regarding the “selection of the reported results” domain due to the lack of statistical analysis plan protocols (Supplementary Table 1). The overall bias in the safety analysis was high in 6 out of 19 studies. (Supplementary Table 2).The certainty of evidence of trivalent LAIV being more efficacious is “high” based on large, multi-center trials. Over half (24/34) of trivalent safety analyses were reported as having a “low” or “very low” grade of evidence (Table 2). All three quadrivalent safety analyses have a “very low” level of evidence. Detailed GRADE results can be seen in Supplementary Table S3, S4.We performed Egger’s tests for one analysis, and funnel plots for four analyses, with no evidence of publication bias (Supplementary Fig. S3–S6.).DiscussionOur analysis of trivalent vaccines, involving data from 15,156 children, found no significant difference between LAIV and IIV in the odds of having a confirmed influenza virus infection after vaccination, indicating similar efficacy. When analyzing data from large, multi-center trials, which are more likely to be generalizable, the nasal vaccine was significantly more efficacious than IIV. In contrast, opposing results were observed in smaller studies. Two trials particularly influenced these outcomes, favoring the application of IIV. One was conducted mainly on malnourished Indian children [53], and the other was based in a Hutterite community [54]. Race and ethnicity-related disparities such as group living conditions, limited access to healthcare, intrinsic variables, and vaccine uptake rates can regulate susceptibility. Additionally, in 2014–2015, when the dominant strain was a poor antigenic match for both vaccines, very low vaccine efficacy [10] may have influenced the results of the Loeb et al. [54] and NCT02250274 [45] studies. Also, in 2015–16, when LAIV was considered less protective against H1N1 strains [10], the dominant isolate was the 2009 H1N1, possibly impacting the Krishnan et al. [53] trial as well.Although we could not verify the age-related hypothesis of trivalent LAIV performing better in younger children [42], we observed a tendency for lower odds of infections after the nasal vaccine was administered to children younger than six years compared to IIV. Encouragingly, based on a recent test-negative, multi-center European trial conducted at the beginning of the 2022–2023 season, higher influenza vaccine effectiveness was observed in children (50–90%) compared to adults, further supporting the viability of child-focused national vaccination strategies [22, 55]. Unfortunately, as the type and valency of vaccines were mixed, the study did not determine if one vaccine type was superior to others [55].We did not find any published RCTs directly comparing the rates of confirmed flu infections after quadrivalent nasal versus quadrivalent injectable influenza vaccines in children. Only a small trial from clinicaltrials.gov compared quadrivalent LAIV to trivalent IIV, finding no significant difference [45].Efficacy can also be described by comparing immunogenicity. However, it is important to note that antibody responses are only predictors of real-world performance. Yet, a meta-analysis from 2020 reported similar outcomes for common influenza strains in both quadrivalent vaccines in children; LAIV had significantly higher immunogenicity for the unique B lineage than IIV, providing broader protection [56], which could be attributed to LAIV’s ability to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses [44].The second key factor affecting decision-making is safety. It is important to acknowledge that vaccines are among the safest medical products available [57]. A meta-analysis from 2004 found no evidence that flu vaccination results in any significant risk of developing clinically significant adverse events (1 in every 250,000 cases) [22]. However, the discussion of which method is ‘safer’ to use is important.When coincidental deaths are temporally associated with vaccination, causality is naturally questioned [57]. Although we could not meta-analyze data on all-cause mortality, we reassuringly did not observe any vaccination-related deaths [28, 36, 47].Our trivalent analysis showed significantly more SAEs after LAIV. However, it should be noted that the two highest-weighted studies were conducted in children with respiratory diseases [58] and in those younger than 5 years [37]. Additionally, when we analyzed SAEs declared to be related to vaccination, their number was distinctively lower in the above-mentioned groups, indicating no difference between vaccines. Moreover, we found no reported SAEs in terms of quadrivalent vaccines [28, 45, 47, 48]. A recent systematic review investigating the safety of LAIV in people with asthma [59] and a novel RCT comparing quadrivalent vaccines in asthmatic children [49] also concluded that there were no safety concerns.Our finding for hospitalization rates is similar to those reported by Minozzi et al., with no significant difference between trivalent vaccine types [23]. However, we did not find data concerning quadrivalent vaccines. Since the 2013–2014 season, a universal pediatric flu vaccination program utilizing LAIV has been introduced in the United Kingdom. Their recent test-negative study investigating laboratory-confirmed infections resulting in hospitalization estimated that LAIV provided effective protection over three seasons, highlighting the advantage of such programs. This is further supported by the fact that this study includes the 2015–2016 season, when LAIV’s usage was temporarily suspended in favor of IIVs in the United States due to observed lower effectiveness, which they did not detect [60].According to our trivalent analysis, the injectable form seemed preferable regarding AEs based on the number of affected individuals, but data on children with respiratory diseases strongly influenced this result as well [46, 58]. For overall AEs there was no significant difference. Minozzi et al. did not report more systemic AEs after any of the vaccines compared with placebo, but they did report significantly more local AEs after administering LAIV [23]. To provide a more detailed picture of safety, we compared 21 types of AEs and found no significant difference for all but one (nasal symptoms), with lower odds after trivalent IIV (dominated by results of children with respiratory diseases [46, 58] and those younger than 5 years [37]). The age restriction on LAIV’s application is partially based on the observed higher rates of wheezing in children younger than 24 months [20, 50]. Our analyses of wheezing showed no significant difference between trivalent vaccines, but we could not investigate different age groups or quadrivalent vaccines. Only two trials reported the rates of coughing, wheezing, and asthma exacerbations after quadrivalent vaccines. Sokolov et al. [49] concluded that there was no increase in the frequency of asthma exacerbations and asthma-related symptoms after quadrivalent LAIV compared with IIV in children older than 5 years with persistent asthma [48].Strength and limitationsAs regulatory bodies advise conducting active-controlled trials when proven therapies exist, our main objective was to investigate head-to-head RCTs across multiple aspects, providing a comprehensive interpretation to determine which influenza vaccination strategy could best serve our patients, aiming for the highest level of evidence [61,62,63].The primary limitation of our study—the low number of included quadrivalent studies – can be attributed to the recent trend of conducting less expensive and ethically less questionable test-negative studies to investigate vaccine effectiveness [64, 65]. These studies can provide valuable information relevant to real-world settings but are also at risk for unmeasured confounding, indication, and collider stratification biases [66, 67]. We should also emphasize the drawbacks of RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating vaccine efficacy; they are more expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes not feasible or ethical to perform [68]. Additionally, handling the results of active-controlled studies requires careful consideration, as the lack of a placebo group introduces the possibility of detecting similarly low or high effectiveness for both vaccine types [62]. Thus, knowing the efficacy of currently available vaccines against placebo is essential.Another limitation is the high heterogeneity and risk of bias in several analyses. As immunogenicity is influenced by previous influenza vaccinations and infections, the degree of matching strains, and the receiver’s individual characteristics [69], it should be acknowledged that finding homogeneous studies might be difficult due to the nature of the topic.Investigating safety outcomes presents multiple challenges [30], as we encountered diverse, overlapping, or missing safety definitions (Supplementary Table S5, S6) [70]. Therefore we did not differentiate between reactogenicity and adverse events. Another interesting issue is the relatedness of different AEs to vaccination in a population already at high risk of experiencing irritability, appetite changes, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and other conditions, especially in autumn when immunization occurs [71, 72].Overall, the rigorous methodology -including the pre-study PROSPERO protocol, RoB2 analysis, GRADE assessment, and adherence to PRISMA 2020 guidelines—along with the thorough implications for policymakers and for future research, enhances the value of our study. This is a great example of how translational medicine can contribute to improved medical care [41, 73, 74].Implications for policymakersIt is crucial to identify predictors for immunization, as a survey from 2019 reported that 26.0% of parents were unsure about vaccination [75]. This finding aligns with an Italian study from 2022, which reported that only 29.0% of parents were advised by their doctor to vaccinate their children against flu, and 32.5% of them were unaware that it is recommended for children. Unfortunately, 72.7% chose not to vaccinate even after acknowledgment, although 40.2% said they might consider it if it could be administered without an injection. Additionally, of those choosing to vaccinate, 83.0% preferred the needle-free option [21].As we live in a globalized, aging world in a pandemic era, alongside stable or even increasing influenza-related mortality over the years, there is a tremendous need to re-evaluate current prevention strategies [22]. A “no one size that fits all” strategy is also under discussion because due to countries’ varying latitudinal spread and seasonality [6]. We also highlight the massive difference in the number of studies conducted in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern [24], which confirms the need for a deeper evaluation of influenza vaccination’s hemispheric recommendations [76, 77].Achieving herd immunity through national child-focused vaccination programs could decrease the epidemic-related health, social, and financial burden, as it is estimated that with 90% vaccination coverage, the incidence could decrease by two-thirds in children and nearly 80% in the most vulnerable elderly population [22]. Unfortunately, there are many countries where the use of LAIV is neither available nor governmentally funded [15,16,17,18]. Countries, such as Hungary, where vaccination programs are highly effective (over 90% vaccination rates; National Insurance covers mandatory vaccines, a health visitor network, and some of the recommended vaccines), should consider establishing a pediatric national influenza vaccination program similar to that of the United Kingdom [22, 60, 78]. As our data supplement the existing literature of LAIV being at least as efficacious and safe for children without contraindications, and given that vaccine hesitancy against recommended vaccinations is estimated to be high (44.8%), the vaccine of choice should be pain-free [19, 78, 79]. The potential to achieve herd immunity lies in the prospects of higher acceptance rates; therefore, introducing a government-funded influenza policy for children is estimated to be cost-effective in the long term [80, 81].Implications for researchBefore the era of universal influenza vaccines, multi-continent, long-term high-quality studies with yearly revaccination, investigating children with different health conditions and age groups (especially those under 2 years), would be highly beneficial. It is crucial to support the decision-making process of countries in the subtropics and tropics with evidence, as nearly half of the world’s population lives in these regions and might face an even greater burden of influenza [6]. They might benefit even more from LAIV’s higher production yield, lower cost, and mode of application [82]. Guidelines are required for uniform safety definitions.ConclusionBased on randomized controlled trials, live-attenuated intranasal vaccines are at least as efficacious and safe as inactivated intramuscular influenza vaccines for those without contraindications. Additionally, they are presumed to be more cost-effective. Therefore, we recommend the initiation of pain-free pediatric national flu vaccination programs with live-attenuated nasal influenza vaccines, given their potential to achieve the WHO’s influenza strategy goals. There is a decisive need for multi-continent, high-quality influenza studies to improve influenza control, especially for countries in the subtropics and tropics where LAIV’s availability is critically low.

Intranasal inoculation is the traditional route for constructing an influenza virus-induced pneumonia mouse model, while intratracheal inoculation has been gradually applied in recent years. In this article, the pathogenicity of influenza virus-induced pneumonia mouse models following intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation were compared.MethodsBy comparing the two ways of influenza inoculation, intranasal and intratracheal, a variety of indices such as survival rate, body weight change, viral titer and load, pathological change, lung wet/dry ratio, and inflammatory factors were investigated. Meanwhile, the transcriptome was applied for the initial exploration of the mechanism underlying the variations in the results between the two inoculation methods.ResultsThe findings suggest that aerosolized intratracheal infection leads to more severe lung injury and higher viral loads in the lungs compared to intranasal infection, which may be influenced by the initial site of infection, sialic acid receptor distribution, and host innate immunity.ConclusionIntratracheal inoculation is a better method for modelling severe pneumonia in mice than intranasal infection. IntroductionInfluenza virus, a prevalent respiratory pathogen, poses a serious threat to human health and healthcare systems due to its widespread transmission and high mortality rates on a global scale each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately one billion individuals contract seasonal influenza annually, with 3–5 million cases classified as severe [1, 2]. Certain populations, such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses, and those with compromised immune systems, are particularly susceptible to infection by the influenza virus [3,4,5]. In certain instances, influenza virus epidemics may result in serious complications and even death [6, 7].Reliable animal models are solid foundations for influenza-related basic and applied research. Small mammals are crucial in the construction of influenza virus pneumonia models [8, 9]. While established models utilizing ferrets and guinea pigs exist, mice are preferred by researchers for their cost-effectiveness and ease of management [10,11,12].In the process of mouse model construction, intranasal and intratracheal inoculation are two common approaches employed to simulate the infection process. Intranasal inoculation is characterized by simplicity and suitability for large-scale experiments, but results may vary depending on the manipulations of researchers [13]. In contrast, intratracheal inoculation allows for precise administration of the virus to a precise anatomical location, making it a more targeted approach compared to intranasal inoculation [14]. The aerosolized intratracheal inoculation offers advantages in terms of non-invasiveness, reduction of liquid particle size, and increased lung deposition rates, thereby contributing to more precise modelling of infection pathways and pathological processes. The MicroSprayer (Huironghe Company, Beijing, China) allows for the aerosolization of influenza virus solution to directly target the lungs and closely replicate the natural process of human infection [15,16,17,18].In this study, C57BL/6J mice were employed to construct an influenza-infected model [19]. The aim was to compare the different pathogenic phenotypes, disease progression, and other relevant factors resulting from two distinct methods of inoculation (intranasal inoculation and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation) in the mouse model. Additionally, mechanisms that may contribute to these observed variances were investigated.Materials and methodsMice and virusEight-week-old, wild-type, female C57BL/6J mice (Vital River Laboratory, Beijing, China) were housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions and provided with ad libitum access to food and water. The animal experiments were approved by the Animals Ethics Committee of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (approval no. IACUC-DWZX-2023-008).Mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) [20] was cultured in chick embryos, and the virus-containing allantoic fluid was harvested and stored in aliquots at -80 °C.Aerosolization of influenza virus solutionsInfluenza virus aerosolization was accomplished with a MicroSprayer (Huironghe Company, Beijing, China). Anesthetized mice were fixed on the operating table, and a laryngoscope was inserted into the deep oral cavity to expose the vocal fold. Then the needle of the MicroSprayer was inserted into the trachea for rapid injection to achieve aerosolization of influenza virus. The mean mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the influenza virus aerosol particles was determined using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS 3321, TSI, USA) with a sampling time of 15 s and a sampling flow rate of 5 L/min. The experiment was repeated three times.Aerosol distribution of Trypan Blue and cyanine dyeMice were anaesthetized using a 1% pentobarbital sodium solution administered via intraperitoneal injection and immobilized on the operating table. Intranasal inoculation was performed by instilling 50 µL of Trypan Blue or Cy7.5 through one nostril of the mouse with a pipette gun attached to the tip. Trypan Blue and cyanine dye (Cy7.5) were separately sprayed into the lungs of mice using the MicroSprayer for aerosolized intratracheal inoculation. The purpose of employing Trypan Blue was to compare the distribution effects of intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation in the lungs through visual observation, and the difference in fluorescence level was presented by Cy7.5. Following the ejection of Trypan Blue, the mice were immediately executed and their lungs were extracted. In vivo imaging of the lungs was conducted using an IVIS Spectrum small-animal imaging system, employing excitation and emission wavelengths of 770/820 nm after the cyanine dye inoculation. The isolated lungs were subjected to the same imaging procedure.Animal experimental protocolC57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups and were respectively inoculated with influenza virus by intranasal or aerosolized intratracheal inoculation, with virus titer of 4.6 PFU, 83.8 PFU, 420 PFU, and 1790 PFU. Lung tissues were removed for histopathological assay, and viral titer and viral load detection was performed at 1, 3, and 5 days post-infection (dpi). Alveolar lavage fluid was collected for cytokine ELISA assays at 1, 3, and 5 dpi. Lung wet/dry ratio was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 dpi and transcriptome analysis was conducted at 5 dpi.Plaque assay and viral loadMice that were subjected to the aforementioned treatment were euthanized, and their lungs were surgically removed and placed in 1 mL DMEM at 1, 3, and 5 dpi. The lung tissues were then homogenized and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, repeated twice, to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was subsequently filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. MDCK cells were utilized to assess the viral titer of the supernatant. Total RNA was extracted from 200 µL supernatant using a PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (12183018 A, Thermo Fisher), followed by Q-PCR to detect viral load, with a nucleic acid upload of 100 ng, using primers NP-forward, 5 -GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3; NP-reverse, 5 -GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG-3; NP-probe, TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGCACG.Histopathological assayFollowing intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal infection of C57BL/6J with PR8, the mice were euthanized and the lungs were removed at the indicated time points. The lung tissues were fixed by immersion in a 4% formalin for at least 1 day. Subsequently, the tissues were embedded in paraffin to form paraffin blocks, which were then sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The histopathology score was primarily determined by assessing the degree of alveolar wall thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, perivascular edema, haemorrhage, and bruising through a 4-point scoring system [21]. The more severe the above lesion, the higher the histopathological score.Lung wet/dry ratioThe wet/dry ratio of the lungs was applied to estimate pulmonary edema. On days 1, 3, and 5 post-challenge, the right lung tissues were excised, dried with a clean paper towel, and instantly weighed for wet lung weight (W), followed by incubation of the lungs at 80 ℃ for 48 h to acquire dry weight (D). Ultimately, the lung W/D ratio was calculated.ELISABronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at 1, 3, and 5 dpi. The BALF was obtained by instilling 800 µL PBS into the trachea of mice, followed by three repeated lavages. The collected fluid was then transferred into 1.5 mL EP tubes and centrifuged at 4℃ for 10 min at 3000 g. The concentration of cytokines in the BALF was determined using a mouse ELISA kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) in accordance with the provided instructions. The ELISA assay included the measurement of IL-6, IL-17 A, MPO, ICAM-1, and IL-1β.RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencingTRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract total RNA from lung tissues [22]. After RNA extraction, DNase I was used to carry out DNA digestion. Utilizing a Nanodrop™ One C Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), A260/A280 values were examined to assess the purity of the RNA. RNA Integrity was confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Qubit3.0 was implemented to quantify the qualified RNAs using the Qubit™ RNA Broad Range Assay kit (Life Technologies, Q10210). As directed by the manufacturer, 2 µg total RNAs were used to prepare the stranded RNA sequencing library using the KCTM Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina®. 200–500 bps PCR products were enriched, quantified, and then sequenced on a DNBSEQ-T7 sequencer with PE150 model.RNA-Seq data analysisFirst, low-quality reads were removed and reads tainted with adaptor sequences were trimmed from the raw sequencing data using Trimmomatic. With STRA software and default parameters, clean data were mapped to the mouse reference genome. Following the count of reads mapped to each gene’s exon regions using featureCounts, RPKMs were determined. The edgeR software was used to identify genes that were expressed differently between groups. The statistical significance of variations in gene expression was assessed using a fold-change criteria of two and a p-value cutoff of 0.05. KOBAS software was implemented to perform gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A p-value limit of 0.05 was used to determine statistically significant enrichment. Using rMATS with a 0.05 FDR value threshold and a 0.05 absolute value of Δψ, alternative splicing events were found.Statistical analysisAll data were analysed with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Unless specified, the data are presented as the mean ± SD in all experiments. Comparisons between.survival curves were analyzed using the log-rank test. Except for survival analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine statistical significance between two groups at multiple time points, and t-test was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups (n.s., not significant; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001).ResultsThe aerosolized solution is delivered to the mouse lung in a targeted and quantitative manner with a more uniform distributionThe physical diagram of the nebulizer was shown in Fig. 1A. The mean mass aerodynamic diameter of aerosolized virus particles was 6.22 ± 0.13 μm, closely aligning with the range of particles that settle in the lungs during normal human respiration (Fig. 1B) [23, 24]. The schematic of intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation was shown in Fig. 1C. Intranasal inoculation was achieved by pipetting 50 µL liquid twice into the one-sided nostril of the mice. For aerosolized intratracheal inoculation, the needle of the MicroSprayer was inserted through the mouse trachea, and a quantitative amount of liquid (50 µL) was aerosolized directly into the lungs through a rapid lever push.To assess the particle distribution within the lungs under different inoculation methods, C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with Trypan Blue and Cy7.5, respectively. Intratracheal administration of Trypan Blue resulted in a uniform dye distribution throughout all lung lobes, encompassing a significant portion of the lungs, whereas Trypan Blue administrated intranasally primarily localized at the junction between the lungs and the bronchi (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the above results, the mice inoculated with Cy7.5 intratracheally showed a higher fluorescence area and intensity in the lungs in vivo (Fig. 1E) and ex vivo (Fig. 1F) compared to mice received intranasal inoculation. The results indicated that aerosolized intratracheal inoculation was more effective in penetrating into the lungs of the mice and achieving uniform particle distribution compared to intranasal inoculation.Fig. 1Characterization of influenza virus aerosolization.

The effects of various doses on time to death and percent survival were presented in Fig. 2A. At infectious doses of 83.8 PFU and 420 PFU, the mortality both reached 100% after intratracheal inoculation, while intranasal administration resulted in death rates of 0% and 60%, respectively. Intranasal inoculated mice exhibited prolonged survival compared to intratracheal inoculated mice when administered a dose of 1790 PFU, despite both groups ultimately reaching 100% mortality. Weight loss was observed earlier in the mice underwent intratracheal inoculation compared to those received intranasal inoculation when administered the same dosage (Fig. 2B). With the exception of 1790 PFU, the degree of weight loss in mice following intratracheal inoculation was more pronounced than that following intranasal inoculation, with a statistically significant difference observed.Fig. 2Survival and weight change curve plots for multi-dose influenza viruses. (A-B) C57BL/6J mice (5 per group) were infected intranasally or intratracheally with 4.6 PFU, 83.8 PFU, 420 PFU, and 1790 PFU of influenza virus, respectively, and monitored daily for 14 days for survival (A) and weight loss (B). Any mouse which lost > 25% initial body weight was euthanized. Log-rank test or two-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance among different groups (n.s., not significant; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001)Full size imageHigher viral load and titer were observed upon aerosolized intratracheal inoculationTo compare the viral load and viral titer levels of the two inoculation methods, C57BL/6J mice were infected intranasally or intratracheally with 4.6 PFU, 83.8 PFU, 420 PFU, and 1790 PFU of influenza virus, respectively. Viral load was detected by applying Q-PCR to viral RNA extracted from 200 µL supernatant of grinding fluid obtained from the entire lung. MDCK cells were utilized to assess the viral titer of the supernatant from homogenized lungs. The supernatant was serially diluted by DMEM containing 1% TPCK trypsin for plaque assay. The viral load results shown in Fig. 3A indicated that at the doses of 83.8 PFU and 420 PFU, the viral load via intratracheal inoculation was significantly higher than that via intranasal inoculation. The results of the viral titer demonstrated a correlation with the viral load. Mice infected by intratracheal inoculation exhibited higher viral titers in the lungs compared to those infected via intranasal inoculation, with statistically significant differences observed (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Comparison of viral load and titer in mice after intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation with PR8. (A-B) C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per sampling time) were inoculated with PR8 via intranasal and intratracheal inoculation, and the viral load (A) with a detection limit of 1 copy/100 ng and viral titer (B) with a detection limit of 50 PFU/mL were determined by RT-qPCR and plaque assay, respectively, at the indicated time. The infected doses in the graph from left to right are 4.6 PFU, 83.8 PFU, 420 PFU and 1790 PFU in sequence. Significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA (n.s., not significant; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001)Full size imageAerosolized influenza leads to more pronounced histopathological lesionTo compare the extent of pathological damage caused by two different virus inoculation methods, the left lungs of mice were removed at 1, 3 and 5 dpi. Pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with multi-dose influenza virus were shown in Fig. 4A. Histopathological scores (Fig. 4B) and lung wet/dry ratio (Fig. 4C) were both higher after intratracheal inoculation than intranasal inoculation at the same viral dose.Fig. 4Pathological analyze, pathological score and lung wet/dry ratio in mice at 1, 3 and 5 dpi (n = 5 per group per time point).

Arrows indicated lesions: black for inflammatory cell infiltration, yellow for vascular bruising, red for necrotic cellular debris of lung tissue, blue for perivascular oedema, dark blue for inflammatory cell infiltration and necrotic debris visible in the lumen of the tubes, green for eosinophilic material visible in the lumen of the alveoli, and dark for green bronchial epithelial cell necrosis. Scale bar: 50 μmFull size imageAerosolized influenza virus infection triggers higher levels of inflammatory factorsTo assess the early immune response in infected mice, cytokines including IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17 A were assayed and analyzed. These pro-inflammatory factors are involved in immune cell activation and viral clearance during the influenza infection process. The mice infected via intratracheal inoculation expressed significantly elevated levels of cytokines than those infected via intranasal inoculation (Fig. 5). Specifically, the expression level of multiple cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-17 A, increased significantly at 3 and 5 dpi in intratracheal inoculated mice compared to intranasal inoculated mice. Besides, the expression of IL-1β increased significantly at 3 dpi. These findings demonstrated that aerosolized PR8 could induce more robust immune responses in mice. In addition to the cytokines mentioned above, the expressed levels of neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were compared between intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal inoculation. MPO is crucial in influenza-induced severe pneumonia, as it mediates the production of a tissue-damaging factor named hypochlorous acid when released extracellularly [25]. In addition, MPO plays an important role in the killing of microorganisms by neutrophils [26]. The lung ICAM is indispensable for innate leukocyte migration into influenza-infected lungs and long-term antiviral cellular immunity [27]. The expression levels of MPO and ICAM-1 in intratracheal inoculated mice remained higher than that in intranasal inoculated mice. These findings suggested that aerosolized influenza virus infection led to more severe tissue damage accompanied by a more intense antiviral response of the mouse organism.Fig. 5Comparison of inflammatory responses in the lungs of mice (n = 5 per group per sampling time) infected with PR8 virus intranasally or intratracheally. Comparison of inflammatory factors in PR8-infected mice in BALF: BALF was collected at the indicated times. Inflammatory factor expression was recorded as the lowest limit of detection when the value converted by substituting the OD value into the standard curve was less than the lowest limit of detection. Significance was calculated by two-way ANOVA (n.s., not significant; *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001)Full size imageIntratracheal inoculation of aerosolized PR8 leads to robust innate immune responses in the lungsTo further elucidate the mechanism of the difference in transcript levels between intranasal and aerosolized intratracheal administration of the virus, the lung transcriptome of mice infected with influenza virus was determined at 5 dpi. Mice that received intranasal inoculation were designated as the control group, while those that underwent aerosolized intratracheal inoculation were assigned to the experimental group. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using normalized counts to assess the transcriptome data quality (Fig. 6A). The data indicated that compared to intranasal inoculation, the expression of 895 genes increased and the expression of 314 genes decreased after aerosolized intratracheal inoculation (Fig. 6B). In addition, KEGG pathway enrichment revealed differences in multiple inflammatory pathways, including the NOD-like receptor signalling pathway, JAK-STAT signalling pathway, Toll-like receptor signalling pathway, IL-17 signalling pathway, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and other immune pathways (Fig. 6C). The findings presented above aligned with prior results indicating that intratracheal inoculation induced a more intense inflammatory response and greater pathological damage. Furthermore, GO analysis performed at the bioprocess level revealed that mice that received intratracheal inoculation exhibited enhanced leukocyte recruitment, proliferation, migration and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, along with increased expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in comparison to intranasal inoculation (Fig. 6D). In comparison to intranasal inoculation, aerosolized intratracheal inoculation in mice resulted in a significant up-regulation of genes in the lungs. Specifically, 13 genes were found to be involved in the inflammatory process, including proinflammatory factor production, neutrophil recruitment, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and ECM protease. Additionally, 9 genes were significantly down-regulated, primarily affecting the composition of the ECM (Fig. 6E).Fig. 6DEGs in PR8-infected C57BL/6J mice after aerosolized intratracheal inoculation obtained by RNA-seq compared to intranasal inoculation.

Intranasal inoculation is the traditional route for constructing an influenza virus-induced pneumonia mouse model, while intratracheal inoculation has been gradually applied in recent years. In this study, we compared two mouse models inoculated with influenza virus by intranasal or aerosolized intratracheal routes. Aerosolized intratracheal inoculation resulted in higher lethality and more rapid weight loss compared to intranasal inoculation. Additionally, intratracheal inoculation led to higher viral load and titer in the lung, accompanied by more pronounced pathological changes and a more intense inflammatory response. Similar results have been observed in ferrets. Ferrets have been shown to mimic the pathogenic mechanism of human infection with influenza most closely. Studies have shown that high morbidity and mortality in ferrets infected with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses can be achieved by the intratracheal route [28]. And there are data suggesting that intratracheal inoculation may be more suitable for investigating influenza virus-induced lower respiratory tract disease in ferret models of influenza infection compared to intranasal inoculation [29].It was found that the influenza virus tends to replicate at a higher level in the lungs compared to nasal tissues, despite being inoculated via intranasal inoculation [30]. For instance, mice infected with A/Korea/01/2009 (H1N1) virus via intranasal inoculation exhibited high virus replication in lungs and low replication in nasal tissues [30]. With intranasal inoculation, the influenza virus replication initially occurred in the nasal cavity and subsequently spread to the lungs after virus shedding. That means that a reduced amount of virus reaches the distal lungs through intranasal inoculation. Intratracheal inoculation allows the influenza virus to directly reach the lungs of mice, bypassing the spreading process. Since the two inoculation methods contribute to the difference in the initial site of infection, aerosolized intratracheal inoculation ensured greater exposure of the virus to the lungs and was more stable compared to intranasal inoculation, explaining precisely why the lung viral titer and load remained higher in the intratracheally-inoculated lungs.In addition, the distribution of sialic acid receptors varies throughout the respiratory system. It has been proved that PR8 binds preferentially to α2,3-linked sialic acid receptor [31]. It was mentioned that it is now generally accepted that mice have more α2,3-linked sialic acid receptors distributed in their lungs [32]. Given this, in combination with the fact that the initial site of infection is different between the two methods of inoculation, aerosolized intratracheal inoculation exposes more α2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, which results in a higher amount of invading virus and more viral replication.Regarding the comparison between aerosolized intratracheal inoculation and intratracheal instillation, preliminary results from other research models in our laboratory have shown that there was no significant difference in survival and pathological changes between aerosol and droplet methods of intratracheal inoculation [33]. Moreover, intratracheal instillation was prone to cause unilateral pneumonia, stress, hypoxia and even death in mice. In contrast, aerosolized intratracheal inoculation demonstrated better lung distribution, pathologic homogeneity, and reproducibility among animals. To simulate aerosolized infections, some researchers have also infected mice via animal nose-only aerosol exposure device to mimic natural inhalation [34, 35]. However, it is difficult to quantify and therefore produces inconsistent results. Aerosolized intratracheal inoculation can provide stable results, thus becoming a more adopted way of aerosolizing infected mice. Secondly, intratracheal inoculation in earlier studies was invasive [36, 37]. Aerosolized intratracheal inoculation employed in this study was non-invasive and can be independently performed by lab researchers with minimal training. Compared to previous studies [13, 29, 38, 39], the transcriptome was applied in our study for the first time to investigate the mechanisms of intranasal and intratracheal inoculation.As revealed by GO analysis of transcriptomes, the positive regulation of innate immunity was essential in the early stages of influenza virus infection in mice. Compared to intranasal infection, aerosolized intratracheal inoculation induced a stronger innate immune response. From the transcriptome results in Fig. 6E, “neutrophil activation” was manifested by elevated expression of genes including activated inflammatory pathways (Ccl4, Il1b, Clec4d, Cxcl3, and Casp1), neutrophil extracellular trap formation (Ncf2, Cybb, Itgb2, Selp, Clec7a, and Casp4), and delayed apoptosis (Bcl2a1b), all of which are associated with lethal endpoints in animal models [40,41,42,43]. Neutrophil extracellular trap formation represents a novel mechanism of cell death, wherein neutrophils release DNA fibres carrying MPO and other enzymes in response to infection or stimuli [44]. The protein level of MPO in the BALF of mice subjected to aerosolized intratracheal inoculation was higher than those of mice inoculated intranasally, consistent with the trend observed at the transcript level. ECM is a critical regulator of tissue morphogenesis and repair [45, 46]. Genes related to ECM synthesis were highly expressed in the lungs of mice inoculated intranasally compared to those inoculated via aerosolized intratracheal infection. Hence, we speculated that the mice subjected to intranasal inoculation had already entered the repair phase at 5 dpi.ConclusionIn conclusion, aerosolized intratracheal infection leads to more severe lung injury and higher viral loads in the lungs compared to intranasal infection, which may be influenced by the initial site of infection, sialic acid receptor distribution, and host innate immunity. Intratracheal inoculation is a better method for modelling severe pneumonia in mice than intranasal infection.

Cannon, MD, Editor in Chief, Harvard Heart Letter; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing A diagnosis of influenza (flu) was linked to a sixfold risk of having a heart attack over the following week, according to a study in the June 25, 2024, issue of NEJM Evidence. The study included adults ages 35 and older who were tested for respiratory viruses over a 12-year period ending in 2019. The testing revealed more than 23,000 separate cases of influenza. Researchers then compared the incidence of heart attack during the risk period (the week after a positive test) to the control period (one year before and 51 weeks after the risk period). Heart attacks were six times more likely to occur during the risk period versus the control period. Earlier research has consistently shown a heightened risk of heart attack soon after viral infections like the flu, as well as the common cold and COVID-19. The findings are a good reminder to get your annual flu vaccine if you haven't already. On average, the vaccine can reduce your chance of getting the flu by about 50%.

However, the fundamental characteristics of the disease remain unclear. This paper conducts a systematic review to explore the epidemiological features of the disease, aiming to provide a foundation for epidemic prevention and control and to serve as a reference for clinical diagnosis. Method: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang and gray literature up to November 15, 2023. All articles were about the epidemic features of the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza, written in English or Chinese. Results: This review encompasses 24 documented outbreaks of human H5N6 avian influenza, exclusively reported in southern China. The age range of cases spanned from under 2 years old to 81 years old. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 13 days, with a mean of 4.3 days. Among the 24 cases, 22 individuals had a documented history of contact with poultry. Of the 23 cases with available prognosis data, 12 resulted in fatalities, yielding a significant fatality rate of 52.2%. A noteworthy observation is that all cases with a history of contact with sick and dead poultry resulted in fatalities, and the difference in fatality rates between this group and others was statistically significant (χ2 = 7.441, p = 0.014). This study identified a total of 888 close contacts, none of whom demonstrated infection. Conclusion: This study represents a comprehensive summary of the epidemiological characteristics of human H5N6 avian influenza. Significantly, it sheds light on the incubation period of the disease and underscores a potential elevated risk of mortality among patients with a history of contact with sick and dead poultry. 1 Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) is the most diverse and epidemiologically significant pathogen associated with severe disease manifestations in humans (1). Wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoirs for IAV, but it can infect a variety of animals, including poultry, aquatic animals (e.g., seals, dolphins, and whales) and terrestrial mammals (e.g., cats, dogs, horses, pigs, mink, tigers, and humans) (2, 3). Taubenberger conducted a complete genome sequence and evolutionary analysis of the 1918 Spanish flu virus, confirming it to be a strain of avian influenza virus adapted entirely to humans, namely the H1N1 avian influenza virus (4). In early 2013, China reported the first cases of human infection caused by a novel H7N9 avian influenza virus (5). Importantly, the low-pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N9 evolved into a highly pathogenic strain. Due to the lack of pre-existing immunity in the majority of the population, infections with these viruses resulted in severe illnesses and fatalities (6). Coincidentally, in April 2014, the world’s first reported case of human infection with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in Sichuan Province, China (7). Later that year, Guangdong Province in China reported a second case of this nature (8). Over the following years, more than 10 provinces in China reported cases of human infections with the H5N6 avian influenza virus. While numerous cases of H5N6 avian influenza infections in humans have been reported, the lack of systematic analyses, primarily in the form of individual case reports, has left essential characteristics of human H5N6 infection unclear. Basic features of this disease, such as its regional and temporal distribution, modes of exposure, incubation period, prognosis for those infected, and potential for human-to-human transmission, remain inadequately understood. Addressing these fundamental epidemiological questions is crucial for clinical diagnosis and the control of outbreaks associated with this disease. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate previous case reports to provide insights into these questions and offer valuable references for clinical diagnosis and epidemic control of H5N6 avian influenza. 2 Methods 2.1 Search strategy This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (9). All analyses were conducted based on previously published studies, obviating the need for additional ethical approval or patient consent. The literature retrieval process encompassed databases such as WANFANG, CNKI, PubMed, and Web of Science, utilizing search terms including “Human infection,” “H5N6,” and “Highly pathogenic avian influenza” up to November 15, 2023. In addition to database searches, reference lists of the identified articles underwent manual scrutiny for potential inclusion of supplementary studies. Possible gray literature was also searched using Google Scholar to identify additional relevant studies. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) website and regional health department websites were examined to find pertinent articles and reports. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers (Fengying Li and Zhou Sun). In the event of disagreements, a consensus on data extraction was reached through discussion involving a third investigator (Mingyong Tao). 2.2 Selection criteria Inclusion Criteria were as follows: (1) reporting of H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks, including details such as outbreak time, province, the number of cases, age and gender of the case, the number of close contacts and close contacts with the medical observation time, prognostic information, avian exposure history; (2) publications in English or Chinese; (3) positive nucleic acid tests for H5N6 in specimens of the case. Exclusion criteria included: (1) outbreaks reported due to mixed infections with other pathogens; (2) unavailability of full-text with the inability to collect data from the abstract; (3) insufficient information about the epidemiological characteristics; (4) articles categorized as review articles. 2.3 Data extraction For studies with repeated outbreaks, each instance was counted only once. Duplicated information found across different studies was systematically summarized and integrated. An information extraction table was created in Excel to collect the following details from the qualified literature: first author, reporting province, age, sex, exposure type, exposure time, onset time, prognostic information of the cases, number of close contacts, and medical observation information of the close contacts. 2.4 Statistical analysis The data from the literature were extracted and entered into Microsoft Excel. Calculations for both the percentage and mean values relevant to this study were conducted using Excel software. The correlation analysis concerning age, gender, mode of exposure, and case prognosis was performed employing the statistical software SPSS 13.0 through the application of the chi-square test. 3 Results 3.1 Identification and selection of studies A total of 161 studies were initially identified through a comprehensive primary search. Subsequent to the meticulous removal of 19 duplicate entries and the exclusion of 76 studies deemed irrelevant to the scope of our investigation, the detailed full texts of 66 papers underwent a thorough evaluation for eligibility in this study. From this scrutiny, 42 articles were excluded, comprising 25 studies unrelated to H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks, 8 review articles, and 9 lacking sufficient data for extraction. The study selection process, including the exclusions and the reasons for each, is visually depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. Flow chart for study identification in the systematic literature review of the epidemiological characteristics of human infection with H5N6 avian influenza. The final inclusion comprised 24 published articles, each contributing unique insights into H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks. These outbreaks, totaling 24, were exclusively documented in Chinese territory and occurred during the period from April 2014 to November 2023. A comprehensive overview of the fundamental characteristics of the included literature is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Table 1. The overview of the fundamental characteristics of the included literature. 3.2 Epidemiological characteristics 3.2.1 Distribution of the age and gender In the 24 documented cases, the age range spanned from less than 2 years to 81 years, with a mean age of 37 years. The distribution across age groups revealed that the majority of cases, 16 in total, fell within the young adult category (20–60 years old), constituting 66.7% of the cases. Five cases were under 20 years old, representing 20.8%, while an additional 5 cases were over 60 years old, accounting for 12.5% of the total. Gender-wise, the cases were evenly distributed, with 12 cases each reported for both men and women. 3.2.2 Regional distribution In the preceding period, H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks were documented across 14 provinces or municipalities (including Beijing, and Chongqing) in China. Notably, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces exhibited the highest incidence, each contributing 4 out of 24 cases, representing 16.7% of the total. Following closely were Anhui with 3 cases (12.5%) and Hunan and Jiangsu with 2 cases each (8.3% each). The remaining provinces or municipalities, including Beijing, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, and Chongqing, reported a single case each, constituting 4.2% each. Our investigation revealed a predominant concentration of outbreaks in southern China (south of the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River). Furthermore, all documented outbreaks occurred within the southeastern China (from Heihe City in Heilongjiang province to Tengchong City in Yunnan province, effectively dividing China into two distinct halves—southeast and northwest). The regional distribution of H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Regional distribution of H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks in China from April 2014 to November 2023. The dotted black line is the Hu line, which divides China into two parts, namely southeast and northwest. The blue line represents the Qinling Mountains and the Huai River, which divides China into the southern and northern parts. H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks were documented across 14 provinces or municipalities. The darker the color, the greater the number of outbreaks in the province. 3.2.3 Temporal distribution All 24 outbreak reports meticulously documented the time of patient onset. The earliest outbreak was recorded in April 2014, while the most recent occurred in March 2022, creating a comprehensive temporal span for our analysis. The zenith of outbreaks transpired in 2016, constituting 25.0% of the total cases, followed by 2020 with 4 cases (16.7%), 2015 with 3 cases (12.5%), and 2021 also with 3 cases (12.5%). The years 2014 and 2018 each accounted for 2 cases (8.3% each), and 2022 similarly contributed 2 cases (8.3%). Both 2017 and 2019 reported a single case each, representing 4.2% each of the total cases. H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks occurred in every season throughout the studied period. Specifically, there were 9 outbreaks in winter (December to February), constituting 37.5% of the total cases. Spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) each reported 6 outbreaks, accounting for 25.0% of the total cases, respectively. In summer (June to August), there were 3 outbreaks, contributing to 12.5% of the total cases. Basically, it is consistent with the seasonal distribution characteristics of other respiratory transmission, high in winter, followed in spring and autumn, and least in summer. A detailed monthly breakdown of the number of cases is provided in Figure 3. Figure 3 Figure 3. Temporal distribution of 24 H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks from April 2014 to November 2023. The 24 H5N6 avian influenza outbreaks occurred in every season throughout the studied period. There were 9 outbreaks in winter, 6 outbreaks each in spring and autumn, and 3 outbreaks in summer. This pattern generally aligns with the seasonal distribution characteristics of other respiratory infections, showing a peak in winter, followed by spring and autumn, with the fewest outbreaks occurring in summer. 3.2.4 Exposure and incubation period Based on the actual exposure history of the 24 cases, we categorized the avian exposure into four distinct types: exposure to infected sick and dead birds, exposure to infected live birds, exposure to infected slaughtered birds, and no clear avian exposure history. Impressively, 22 out of the 24 cases, representing 91.7%, had a clearly documented history of avian exposure. Only 2 cases lacked a clear avian exposure history. Among the cases with clear exposure history, the majority had been exposed to live poultry, accounting for 58.3%. A significant portion had a history of exposure to sick and dead birds, representing 25.0%, while the least number of cases were exposed to slaughtered poultry, accounting for 8.3%. In the process of calculating the latency of H5N6 avian influenza, we refined our analysis by excluding cases with unclear exposure history and continuous exposure. This yielded a dataset comprising only cases with a single, well-documented exposure history, resulting in a cohort of 12 cases with a clear and singular exposure history. The incubation period of H5N6 avian influenza was then calculated from the time of patient exposure to the earliest manifestation of clinical symptoms, measured in days. Notably, among these 12 cases, the shortest incubation period observed was 1 day, while the longest recorded was 13 days. The mean incubation period across these cases was determined to be 4.3 days. Remarkably, the majority of cases exhibited a relatively short incubation period, with 10 out of the 12 cases (83.3%) developing symptoms within 1 week. Importantly, no cases in the dataset displayed an incubation period exceeding 2 weeks. The number of cases with different incubation period is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 Figure 4. The number of cases with different incubation period in the cohort of 12 H5N6 cases with a clear and singular exposure history. The incubation period of H5N6 avian influenza was calculated from the time of patient exposure to the earliest manifestation of clinical symptoms, measured in days. Among these 12 cases, the shortest incubation period observed was 1 day, while the longest recorded was 13 days. The majority of cases exhibited a relatively short incubation period, with 10 out of the 12 cases developing symptoms within 1 week. No cases displayed an incubation period exceeding 2 weeks. 3.2.5 Prognosis of the cases Among the 24 documented outbreaks, 23 provided clear prognostic information, while details on one case were not mentioned. Of the 23 cases with available prognostic data, 11 individuals survived, and 12 died. Calculating based on this information, the survival rate for H5N6 cases was determined to be 47.8% (11 out of 23), while the corresponding fatality rate stood at 52.2% (12 out of 23). In our effort to discern prognostic factors associated with H5N6 influenza cases, we conducted a comprehensive analysis examining the interplay between age, sex, mode of exposure, and case prognosis. Notably, all cases over 60 years old resulted in fatalities, implying a seemingly elevated case fatality rate in this age group. While this aligns with expectations, considering the likelihood of concurrent underlying diseases in older individuals, our statistical analysis did not reveal a significant difference (χ2 = 3.162, p = 0.217), potentially due to the limited sample size.Among the female cases, 7 out of 11 had succumbed to the infection, yielding a case fatality rate of 63.6%, surpassing that of male cases (41.7%, 5 out of 12). However, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two genders (χ2 = 1.110, p = 0.414). A noteworthy finding emerged concerning cases with a history of exposure to sick and dead birds, where the case fatality rate was 100% (6 out of 6). This was markedly higher than the fatality rate in other exposure groups (35.3%, 6 out of 17), and the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 7.441, p = 0.014). This discrepancy may be attributed to the potentially higher viral load encountered by cases with exposure to sick and dead birds. The detailed statistical results are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Table 2. The analysis between age, gender, mode of exposure, and case prognosis. 3.2.6 Close contacts for medical observation In the context of 24 outbreaks of H5N6 avian influenza, it was explicitly indicated that there were 20 cases with a specified number of close contacts. Among these, 4 cases underwent a specified 14-day medical observation period for close contacts, 4 cases had a 10-day observation period, and 9 cases had a 7-day observation period. The study encompassed a total of 888 close contacts, yet no instances of infection were identified among them. 4 Discussion In this study, we determined for the first time that the shortest incubation period for H5N6 avian influenza in humans is 1 day, the longest is 13 days, and the average is 4.3 days. When calculating the incubation period of the disease, we typically need to know the specific single exposure time of the patient, so we excluded cases with continuous exposure (7, 10–14). In the end, only 12 cases met our criteria for calculating the incubation period. Understanding the incubation period of H5N6 avian influenza is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. After being infected with the H5N6 avian influenza virus, cases often present with symptoms such as fever, cough, and unexplained pneumonia upon hospital admission. This underscores the importance for clinicians to consider the patient’s poultry contact history during the incubation period to enable earlier diagnosis and timely administration of oseltamivir, thereby reducing the mortality rate (15). Additionally, co-exposed persons and close contacts of cases usually require medical observation, and the incubation period is the premise for determining the duration of medical observation and is also an important part of epidemic control. Based on the calculated incubation period, and considering the severity of the prognosis for this disease, we believe that a two-week medical observation period for this disease is reasonable. Additionally, Zhou et al. using data from cases-patient groups in China from 2013 to 2017, estimated the incubation period of H7N9 avian influenza virus infection, with a median incubation period of 4 days (16). This indicates that the incubation period of H5N6 avian influenza is similar to that of H7N9 avian influenza. We calculated the case fatality rate of H5N6 avian influenza to be 52.2%, which is relatively high compared to the H7N9 subtype of avian influenza and is generally consistent with the H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (17). It is worth mentioning that we discovered for the first time that the case fatality rate of cases with exposure history to sick and dead poultry and dead birds is 100%, which is significantly higher than that of other exposure groups. This may be related to the fact that sick and dead poultry have more virus loads. It also reminds us that avian flu patients exposed to sick and dead birds have a higher risk of death. In current systematic review, we categorized the prognosis of cases into two groups: death and survival, rather than death and recovery. Mainly because some cases, although discharged after clinical treatment, left severe sequelae. As the Zhejiang cases occurred in Hangzhou, our team learned through follow-up that the cases experienced the invasion of the H5N6 avian influenza virus, which led to severe and irreversible fibrosis in the lungs, resulting in a very poor physical condition. The cases often experienced pulmonary bleeding and were unable to engage in physical labor in daily life (18). One case in Jiangsu Province exhibited early symptoms of encephalitis, such as seizures, epilepsy, and coma. After being diagnosed with H5N6 virus infection, the patient underwent treatment with oseltamivir and received methylprednisolone pulse therapy. However, during the 2–4 month follow-up after discharge, obvious characteristics of posterior cerebral atrophy was observed in the patient (19). This indicates that in addition to having a very high fatality rate after infection with H5N6, some cases also have severe sequelae. In general, the H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H10N8 subtypes of avian influenza have a relatively high risk of death compared to other subtypes (20). In this research, we classified exposure into four categories: exposure to infected and dead birds, exposure to infected live poultry, exposure to infected slaughtered poultry, and no clear history of poultry exposure. The essence of this classification is based on the patient’s exposure object, rather than the traditional classification based on exposure pathways. The main reason is that for some cases, the exposure object is clear, while the exposure pathway may be mixed, making it impossible to determine which pathway caused the infection. For example, in the articles by Chen, Li, and Kong, it was only investigated that the cases had slaughtered live poultry a few days before, making it impossible to determine whether the infection occurred through respiratory exposure to the H5N6 virus during the slaughtering process or through contact exposure (21–23). Similarly, Liu’s study suggested that the cases were infected with avian influenza virus through aerosol transmission (24). We believe that using the classification method of exposure objects avoids subjective errors introduced by classifying exposure pathways and is more practically meaningful for epidemic prevention and control. Our research includes 888 close contacts, who have undergone a medical observation of at least 7 days. However, no instances of infection were found among these close contacts. Due to the limited number of cases in our study, we cannot yet rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, our data suggests that the human-to-human transmission capability of H5N6 avian influenza is limited. In contrast to the H5N6 avian influenza outbreak, there have been more reports of H7N9 outbreaks (25), some of which include reports of illness among close contacts and instances of familial clustering (26, 27). While our research results can provide a basis for the prevention and control of H5N6 avian influenza, as well as provide references for clinical diagnosis and treatment, our systematic review also has certain limitations. Firstly, the sample size of our study is not large enough. Secondly, our article lacks some clinical treatment information, making it challenging to provide sufficient support for clinical treatment. Additionally, case ascertainment may be influenced by the healthcare infrastructure, diagnostic criteria, and reporting practices of the region. In this review, the reliance on data from China means the findings may not be fully generalizable to other regions with different healthcare systems and practices. Moreover, the limitation to published cases may introduce the risk of publication bias. Thus, more reliable conclusions will require additional data in the future.

However, the exact evidence of the driving factors involved in the prodrome period is unclear, posing great difficulties for early and accurate prediction in practical work.MethodsIn order to avoid the serious interference of strict prevention and control measures on the analysis of influenza influencing factors during the COVID-19 epidemic period, only the impact of meteorological and air quality factors on influenza A (H3N2) in Xiamen during the non coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period (2013/01/01-202/01/24) was analyzed using the distribution lag non-linear model. Phylogenetic analysis of influenza A (H3N2) during 2013–2022 was also performed. Influenza A (H3N2) was predicted through a random forest and long short-term memory (RF-LSTM) model via actual and forecasted meteorological and influenza A (H3N2) values.ResultsTwenty nine thousand four hundred thirty five influenza cases were reported in 2022, accounting for 58.54% of the total cases during 2013–2022. A (H3N2) dominated the 2022 summer epidemic season, accounting for 95.60%. The influenza cases in the summer of 2022 accounted for 83.72% of the year and 49.02% of all influenza reported from 2013 to 2022. Among them, the A (H3N2) cases in the summer of 2022 accounted for 83.90% of all A (H3N2) reported from 2013 to 2022. Daily precipitation(20–50 mm), relative humidity (70–78%), low (≤ 3 h) and high (≥ 7 h) sunshine duration, air temperature (≤ 21 °C) and O3 concentration (≤ 30 µg/m3, > 85 µg/m3) had significant cumulative effects on influenza A (H3N2) during the non-COVID-19 period. The daily values of PRE, RHU, SSD, and TEM in the prodrome period of the abnormal influenza A (H3N2) epidemic (19–22 weeks) in the summer of 2022 were significantly different from the average values of the same period from 2013 to 2019 (P < 0.05). The minimum RHU value was 70.5%, the lowest TEM value was 16.0 °C, and there was no sunlight exposure for 9 consecutive days. The highest O3 concentration reached 164 µg/m3. The range of these factors were consistent with the risk factor range of A (H3N2). The common influenza A (H3N2) variant genotype in 2022 was 3 C.2a1b.2a.1a. It was more accurate to predict influenza A (H3N2) with meteorological forecast values than with actual values only.ConclusionThe extreme weather conditions of sustained low temperature and wet rain may have been important driving factors for the abnormal influenza A (H3N2) epidemic. A low vaccination rate, new mutated strains, and insufficient immune barriers formed by natural infections may have exacerbated this epidemic. Meteorological forecast values can aid in the early prediction of influenza outbreaks. This study can help relevant departments prepare for influenza outbreaks during extreme weather, provide a scientific basis for prevention strategies and risk warnings, better adapt to climate change, and improve public health. Peer Review reports Introduction Influenza is a common acute respiratory viral infectious disease caused by influenza virus [1]. It has spread worldwide, poses a considerable disease burden on human health and economic development and is currently one of the greatest public health challenges. In 2019, the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) estimated that influenza-related lower respiratory infections caused approximately 145,000 deaths across all age groups [2], carrying a heavy mortality burden [2, 3]. In China, the reported incidence of influenza surged to 253.36 per 100,000 people in 2019. Although in the context of COVID-19, the incidence rate of influenza in China decreased to 81.58/100,000 and 47.40/100,000 in 2020 and 2021, respectively [4], the number of reported influenza cases in southern China in the summer of 2022 showed an unusually high incidence [4]. To date, there is no clear evidence of the influencing factors involved.Due to the potential impact of mechanisms such as affecting the survival rate, stability and transmissibility of the virus, damaging the respiratory system and increasing host susceptibility on the spread [5, 6], meteorological factors (MFs) and air quality are closely related to human health [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. These research results were not entirely consistent. For instance, studies have shown that low humidity within a week is associated with a greater incidence of influenza-like diseases [13], but Zhu et al.‘s study showed that both high humidity and low humidity increase the risk of influenza [8]. In a study by Yang et al., the air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO increased the incidence of influenza-like diseases, while O3 was negatively correlated with the incidence of influenza-like diseases [9]. However, another study showed that short-term exposure to O3 was positively correlated with the risk of hospitalization among men and the risk of death among women from respiratory diseases [15].The difference in the impact of influenza virus transmission is related to influenza subtype, and there are differences in the incidence of different subtypes in terms of season and region [16] (such as A (H1N1) and A (H3N2)).The spread of influenza is also related to various other important factors. For example, Despite decades of testing and drug and nondrug interventions for influenza viruses worldwide, seasonal influenza viruses continue to cause annual outbreaks worldwide, which may be associated with continuous mutations in their strains [17]. In addition, the immunity of the population significantly affects the influenza epidemic. The decrease in acquired immunity can lead to antigen mutations and the invasion of viruses that have not undergone antigen mutations [18], resulting in influenza outbreaks.The outbreak of infectious diseases can be divided into the following periods: prodrome period, rising period, stable period and falling period. Early detection refers to the detection of abnormal outbreaks or epidemic information from a series of complex factors that drive the occurrence of infectious diseases and pathogen transmission, such as changes in the environment, case discovery, and an increase in the number of cases. Due to the limited evidence on the driving factors in the prepandemic period, it is difficult to predict infectious disease outbreaks accurately in advance, which poses great difficulties for risk assessment and prevention in practical work.Xiamen city is located on the southeast coast of China in southern Fujian Province (Figure S1). The city has a mild and rainy climate characterized by a subtropical marine monsoon climate. Xiamen, as an economic special zone, has a large population, developed economy, and complete infectious disease reports. In addition, Xiamen has an area of only 1700.61 square kilometres, making meteorological and air quality monitoring more representative.The deep learning random forest (RF) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) model are often used by researchers for prediction and yield good results [8, 19]. However, few researchers have combined these methods to achieve better predictions for disease. In addition, different from previous studies, the prediction of influenza cases by risk factors in this study was not limited to the actual data of the day but also included the forecasted risk factors values for prediction. This allows for earlier prediction and thus early intervention.Thus, we aimed to explore the potential risk factors for influenza outbreaks by studying the driving factors in the prodrome period of an abnormal influenza epidemic in Xiamen in 2022 and make early predictions based on the RF-LSTM algorithm to provide a basis for early warning and intervention.Materials and methodsData sourcesAt present, there is no definition or standard for an abnormal influenza epidemic (high incidence of influenza). In this series of studies, it is uniformly defined as the occurrence of influenza outbreaks in a certain region during non-seasonal epidemic periods, or the intensity of influenza activity during seasonal epidemic periods is significantly higher than the historical normal level in the region, due to potential impacts of global warming and climate change such as extreme weather events, pathogen mutations, human behavior, and other factors.The influenza case data, including clinical cases and laboratory confirmed cases, from 2013 to 2022 for Xiamen reported by medical and health institutions at all levels according to the diagnostic criteria for epidemic disease cases (WS 285–2008) [20], as well as the resident population data used to calculate influenza vaccination rates, were all downloaded from the China Disease Prevention and Control Information System. The influenza pathogen data for this study was obtained from the Fujian Provincial Influenza Monitoring Network Laboratory, and samples were collected from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients by the Influenza Surveillance Sentinel Hospital in Xiamen. ILI is a nonspecific disease that can be caused by various pathogens, including influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. Among them, influenza virus is one of the most common pathogens, especially during the flu season. All influenza cases in this study were counted based on the date of onset. The floating population data were obtained from the Yearbook of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, which is officially published on a yearly basis by the Xiamen Municipal Bureau of Statistics (https:/jj.xm.gov.cnjnj/publish/). The influenza vaccination data were obtained from the Fujian Provincial Immunization Planning Information Management System.The MF data were monitored by Xiamen Meteorological Station and provided by the Fujian Climate Center. The MFs in this study included 6 indicators, of which air pressure (PRS, hPa), relative humidity (RHU, %), air temperature (TEM, °C), and wind speed (WIN, m/s) were the average values in a day, precipitation (PRE, mm) was the accumulated precipitation in a day, and sunshine duration (SSD, h) was the accumulated sunshine hours in a day.Extreme weather events: The state of the weather deviates significantly from its climatic state. One type is when the hourly, daily, monthly, or annual values of meteorological elements reach a recurrence interval of 25 years or higher. Another type is when the difference between meteorological elements during a certain period and the 30-year average climate state of the same period in previous years exceeds twice the standard deviation. The measurement of extreme weather events includes two dimensions: extremely low or extremely high measured values; extremely long or extremely short duration. And the extreme weather involved in this study comes from the annual climate bulletins of the Climate Center in Fujian Province and Xiamen City.The daily average concentrations of air quality indicators, including CO (mg/m3), NO2 (µg/m3), O3 (µg/m3), PM10 (µg/m3), PM2.5 (µg/m3) and SO2 (µg/m3), were obtained from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (http://106.37.208.233:20035/).The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Fujian Province on January 22, 2020. The sharp decline in influenza activity in the context of the public health and social measures during the COVID-19 pandemic had significantly affected the long-term multi-year analysis of the association between meteorology factors and influenza and of the prediction of influenza [21]. In order to avoid this serious interference factor, we deleted the data during the COVID-19 and extended the buffer period for the influenza epidemic by two days. Therefore, the impact of MFs and air quality on influenza during the non-COVID-19 epidemic period (2013/01/01-2020/01/24) was analysed, and based on these characteristics, the factors causing an abnormally high incidence of influenza in 2022 were explored. The number of influenza cases from January 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022, was subsequently predicted.Statistical data analysisThe map of China in Figure S1 was sourced from the Standard Map Service Network (http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn/). The map of Fujian Province in Figure S1 was drawn using ArcGIS software (version 10.3; ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).We first calculated the proportion of influenza virus subtypes in the surveillance results of the Xiamen Influenza Surveillance Outpost Hospital and then reverse calculated the daily number of influenza subtypes reported by Xiamen medical and health institutions through the China Disease Prevention and Control Information System.The HA gene sequences of 33 influenza A (H3N2) strains isolated from Xiamen were sequenced by the Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (FJCDC) or downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. Among them, 11 strains (8 sequenced by the FJCDC, 3 downloaded from GISAID) were isolated in 2022, and 23 strains (17 sequenced by the FJCDC, 6 downloaded from GISAID) were isolated from 2014 to 2021.Viral nucleic acid was extracted using a GeneRotex 96 fully automatic nucleic acid extractor (Xi’an Tianlong Technology Co., Ltd., China) and its supporting reagents. The influenza virus HA gene was amplified with universal primers and RT‒PCR reagents (SuperScript™ III One-Step RT‒PCR System with Platinum™ Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase; Invitrogen, Cat. No.: 12574035) for reverse transcription and amplification of the viral RNA.After purification, the amplified products were subjected to high-throughput sequencing using an Ion Torrent S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and related reagents. The sequences were spliced with a CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN, Ver.11.0). The clades of the strains were analysed through the GISAID FluSurver online website. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 6.06 software (neighbour joining method, bootstrap = 1000 resamples).R software (version 4.2.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to visualize and statistically analyse the data. The effects of MFs and air quality on influenza were analysed using Spearman correlation analysis and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs).When the measurement data followed a normal distribution, the mean and standard deviation were used to describe it, while followed a non normal distribution, daily average, minimum, median (M), quartile (P25, P75), and maximum values were used. When the econometric data followed a normal distribution and had homogeneity of variance, Pearson correlation analysis, independent sample t-test, and one-way analysis of variance were used, while followed a skewed distribution or did not satisfy homogeneity of variance, Spearman correlation analysis and non-parametric rank sum test were used. The difference is statistically significant with P < 0.05.The DLNM obtained new data through cross-basis feature transformation using a generalized linear model combined with nonlinear and delay effects for modelling. Influenza, MF, and air quality factors were included in the DLNM in this study. TYt is the t-day number of influenza cases in this study P < 0.05.The basic model was as follows:$$\log\left[E\left(Yt\right)\right]=\alpha+\sum\beta ixi+NS\left(time_{t},\;df\right)\;+\;\sum NS\left(Zj,\;df\right)\;+\;Dow$$ (1) Yt is the t-day number of influenza cases in this study, α was the constant term, βi was the coefficient of the explanatory variable in the regression model, xi was the influencing factor (meteorological and air quality factors included in this study), timet was used to control for seasonal and long-term trends, df was the degrees of freedom, Zj was used to control the mixing effect of other MFs and air quality, Dow was the dummy variable for the effect of the day of the week (controlling for the day of the week effect), and NS (…) was a natural spline function (used to control for seasonal and long-term trends, the day of the week effect and other MFs and air quality) [8, 22]. Df was determined by the AIC minimum principle, which compares different df of a certain item with the same df of other items and then selects the df with the lowest AIC value to establish the model and conduct sensitivity analysis and comparison [23, 24]. Based on the incubation period and epidemic characteristics of influenza and to capture more complete information on impact effects, we determined a maximum lag time of 21 days (d).FZ-MOS system was used to predict the weather in Xiamen. The core of the Model Output Statistics (MOS) forecasting model is to use fine grid meteorological elements such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as forecasting factors, select historical data with the same or similar changing backgrounds, and use statistical methods to establish forecasting models. FZ-MOS was built by conducting daily forecasts of meteorological elements such as precipitation, humidity, and temperature for the next 1–10 days at the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Station over the years and designing various training period schemes for verification and improvement.In this study, based on the intelligent grid comprehensive forecast results of FZ-MOS, we calculated the meteorological forecast values for the next 1 to 10 days at the grid point where Xiamen Station was located starting at 20:00 every day. This manuscript displays the predicted results only for Day 1, Day 4, Day 7, and Day 10.The mean absolute deviation (MAD) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of meteorological forecasting. The MAD calculation formula was as follows:$$\:\text{M}\text{A}\text{D}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}|{x}_{i}-m\left(x\right)|$$ (2) TensorFlow 2.8.0 software (Google Brain Team, Mountain View, CA, USA) and Python 3.8.13 software (Python Software Foundation, Delaware, USA) were used to predict cases of influenza through the RF-LSTM method.An RF algorithm integrates multiple trees through the idea of integrated learning. Its basic unit is the decision tree, and its essence is a major branch of machine learning [25]. It is an extended variant of bagging.The operation process includes five steps. The first step is feature splitting, which is used to split the data and construct supervised learning data. Then, random sampling is performed, and N samples are obtained by randomly sampling N times from the original dataset and placing them back. Third, a decision tree is constructed and trained for each sampled sample dataset. The fourth step is decision-making, in which each tree makes its own decisions based on the data. Finally, there is decision aggregation, with the average value of the tree predicted as the final result [26]. The RF process is shown in Figure S2.The result of the final decision tree is as follows.$$\:\:\:\text{D}=\{\left({x}_{1},{y}_{1}\right),\left({x}_{2},{y}_{2}\right),\dots\:,({x}_{n},{y}_{n}\left)\right\}$$ (3) $$\:{h}_{i}\left(x\right)={\upzeta\:}(\text{D},{D}_{bs})$$ (4) $$\:\text{H}\left(\text{x}\right)=\frac{1}{T}\sum\nolimits_{t=1}^{T}{h}_{i}\left(x\right)$$ (5) (Note: D: all the data; x: feature; y: label; hi(x): the output of each base model; \(\:\zeta\:\): base learning algorithm; Dbs: sample set generated by self-service sampling.)LSTM is an artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm that is suitable for time series data analysis [8]. The whole process is divided into three parts: The first step is to determine what information should be discarded from the neuron state through the sigmoid layer of the “forgetting gate”. The second step is to determine what new information is stored in the neuron state. Finally, the “output gate” determines the output information.The single cell of LSTM is displayed in Figure S2.The LSTM calculation formulas are as follows:$$f_{t} = \sigma (W_{f} [h_{t-1},\ x_{t}] + b_{f})$$ (6) $$i_{t} = \sigma(W_{i} \cdot [h_{t-1},\ x_{t}] + b_{i})$$ (7) $$\tilde{\boldsymbol{C}}_{t} = \text{tanh} (W_{c} \cdot [h_{t-1},\ x_{t}] + b_{c}$$ (8) $$C_{t} = f_{t} \cdot C_{t-1} + i_{t} \cdot \tilde{\boldsymbol{C}}_{t}$$ (9) $$o_{t} = \sigma (W_{o} \cdot [h_{t-1},\ x_{t}] + b_{o})$$ (10) $$h_{t} = o_{t} \cdot \text{tanh} (C_{t})$$ (11) (Note: ht−1: the output of the previous neuron state; Xt: the input of the current neuron state; σ: the sigmoid function; Ct−1 is updated to Ct.)RF-LSTM was used for time series prediction in this study. The goal of this method was to fully utilize the advantages of the RF and LSTM models to improve the accuracy and stability of time series prediction.The specific steps were as follows: Data preparation: Time series data, which included time, climate data and influenza incidence data, were prepared into a format suitable for model training; that is, the data were divided into input sequences and target sequences. The input sequence was the historical time step data used for prediction, while the target sequence was the future time step data after the input sequence. RF feature extraction: The RF model was used to extract features from the input sequence. Through the RF training process, the importance of meteorological factors that affected the number of influenza outbreaks was ranked, redundant information was eliminated, and the resulting model was subsequently used as a new feature combination input model. LSTM model training: The LSTM model was trained using input sequences and target sequences. Prediction: The trained LSTM model was used to predict the test time series. Figure S2 shows the RF-LSTM process.Four evaluation indicators were used to quantify the accuracy of the model predictions, namely, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) [8]. The smaller their values are, the higher the prediction accuracy, and the higher the confidence level (best value = 0; worst value=+∞) [8, 27,28,29].The calculation formulas of the four evaluation indicators are as follows:$$\text{RMSE} = \:\sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{n}}\sum\nolimits_{\text{i}=1}^{\text{n}}{({\text{P}}_{\text{i}}-{\text{X}}_{\text{i}})}^{2}}$$ (12) $$\text{MAE} = \:\frac{\sum\nolimits_{\text{i}=1}^{\text{n}}\left|{\text{X}}_{\text{i}}-{\widehat{\text{X}}}_{\text{i}}\right|}{\text{n}}$$ (13) $$\text{MAPE} = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum\nolimits^{n}_{i=1} \left|\frac{P_{i} - X_{i}}{P_{i}}\right|$$ (14) $$\text{SMAPE} = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum\nolimits^{n}_{i=1} \frac{|P_{i} - X_{i}|}{|\frac{|P_{i}| + |X_{i}|}{2}|}$$ (15) (Note: Pi: the observed daily incidence of influenza cases on day i; Xi: the predicted daily incidence of influenza cases on day i, where i = 1…, n [8].)ResultsDescriptive statisticsA total of 50,278 influenza cases, including clinical cases and laboratory confirmed cases, were reported by medical and health institutions in Xiamen from 2013 to 2022, with 330, 602, 431, 799, 586, 3994, 8437, 4710, 954, and 29,435 cases, respectively. Among them, laboratory confirmed cases accounted for 33.04%, 86.41%, 90.57%, 81.78%, 64.34%, 61.63%, 48.33%, 49.75%, 81.86%, and 91.23%, respectively. The number of cases in 2022 was particularly high, accounting for 58.54%. The proportion of laboratory confirmed cases exceeded 90.00% in 2015 and 2022. Figure S3 shows the clinical cases and laboratory confirmed cases of influenza. The correlation between the number of influenza cases and the proportion of laboratory confirmed cases was not significant (r = 0.15, P = 0.68).A total of 2760 influenza patients were diagnosed by a network laboratory between 2013 and 2022. Among them, the numbers of those positive for influenza viruses A (H3N2), B (Victoria), A (H1N1) pdm09, B (Yamagata), B (line not defined), A (H7N9), and A (unsubtyped) were 919, 742, 679, 409, 6, 3, and 2, respectively. Figure S4 shows the detailed weekly distribution. The numbers of A (H3N2), B (Victoria), A (H1N1) pdm09, and B (Yamagata) virus infections calculated based on the daily proportion of each virus subtype and the daily influenza count reported by health care institutions were 28,699, 11,998, 7362, and 1529, respectively. Among them, in the winter and spring epidemic seasons of 2017–2018 and 2021–2022 in Xiamen, B (Yamagata) and B (Victoria) were dominant, accounting for 53.37% and 100.00% of all pathogens, respectively. During the winter epidemic season of 2018–2019, influenza A accounted for 96.52%, with A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) pdm09 accounting for 65.35% and 30.72%, respectively. During the winter epidemic season of 2019–2020, there was a tripartite pattern of A (H1N1) pdm09, A (H3N2), and B (Victoria), accounting for 26.71%, 33.30%, and 39.99%, respectively. B (Victoria) was the main prototype of influenza in the spring and summer of 2019, accounting for 91.37%. A (H3N2) dominated the 2022 summer epidemic season, accounting for 95.60%. The influenza cases in the summer of 2022 accounted for 83.72% of the year and 49.02% of all influenza reported from 2013 to 2022. Among them, the A (H3N2) cases in the summer of 2022 accounted for 83.90% of all A (H3N2) reported from 2013 to 2022. Figure 1 shows the detailed daily distribution.Fig. 1Cluster bar chart of the daily distribution of influenza pathogens in Xiamen City, 2013–2022Full size imageThe number of, daily average, minimum, P25, median, P75, and maximum A (H3N2) cases were 19,282, 1.99, 0, 0, 0, 4 and 101, respectively, from January 1, 2013, to January 24, 2020, and were 23,578, 64.60, 0, 0, 0, 2 and 1460, respectively, in 2022. Compared with that from January 1st, 2013, to January 24th, 2020, the maximum PRE in 2022 was significantly lower (70.00 mm, 172.70 mm), while the daily average was closer, but the P75 was larger (1.00 mm, 0.60 mm). The daily average, minimum, median, and maximum O3 concentrations in 2022 were 91.95, 30.00, 90.00, and 213.00 µg/m³, respectively, which were higher than the values of 82.76, 12.00, 80.00, and 178.00, respectively, from January 1, 2013, to January 24, 2020. Figure 2 shows more information on MFs and air quality.Fig. 2Box chart of MFs and air qualityFull size imageThe daily values of PRS, RHU, SSD, TEM, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 exhibited significant seasonal periodicity, meanwhile CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 exhibited downward trends annually. Figure 3 shows more information on MFs and air quality.Fig. 3Time series of MFs and air qualityFull size imageThe incidence of A (H3N2) increased sharply from week 23 to week 30 in 2022, with a peak significantly higher than the same period from 2013 to 2019, and significantly higher than previous peak periods (week 51 to week 4 of the following year). The highest value occurred in the 25th week, with an average of 1240 cases per day, compared to less than 2 cases in the same period in previous years.The PRE and RHU during the high incidence and precursor periods of A (H3N2) anomalies in 2022 were higher than those in 2013–2019, while SSD and TEM were lower. The CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 concentrations in 2022 were almost consistently lower than the average for the same period from 2013 to 2019 throughout the year. Compared with the average values in previous years, the PRS, WIN, and O3 values during the high-incidence period of influenza A (H3N2) showed no special changes in 2022. Figure 4 shows more information on the weekly distributions of A (H3N2), MFs, and air quality.Fig. 4Daily average values of weekly distribution of A (H3N2), MFs, and air qualityFull size imageCorrelation analysis The connecting line on the upper right side of Fig. 5 shows a significant correlation between A (H3N2) in 2022 and all the MFs and air quality factors in this study, while the correlations between A (H3N2) and PRS, RHU, WIN, and O3 from January 1, 2013, to January 24, 2020, were not significant.Fig. 5Heatmap of Spearman correlation analysis of A (H3N2), MFs, and air qualityFull size imageThe heatmap at the bottom left of Fig. 5 shows a strong positive correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 (r = 0.91, P < 0.01). There was a strong negative correlation between PRS and TEM (r=-0.86, P < 0.01) and a negative correlation between PRE and SSD (r=-0.56, P < 0.01). The detailed correlations between MFs and air quality and A (H3N2) are presented in Fig. 5.DLNMThe cumulative effect of low PRE (20–50 mm) on the risk of infection with A (H3N2) first increased and then decreased with increasing lag time, with 46 mm having the most significant impact (RR = 1.99, accumulated lag = 8 d, 95% CI = 0.04-100.78). However, the impact of high PRE (> 100 mm) on A (H3N2) appeared after a lag of 2 weeks, but there was no cumulative effect.The cumulative effect of RHU (51–60%) on the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2) decreased with increasing lag time and was no longer significant after 4 days. The cumulative effect of RHU (70–78%) on the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2) gradually increased after 12 days of lag (peak: RHU = 73%, accumulated lag = 21 d, RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.48–3.27).The cumulative effect of SSD on the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2) first increased and then decreased with increasing lag time. Shorter SSDs (≤ 3 h) and longer SSDs (≥ 7 h) had more significant cumulative effects on the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2) (peak: SSD = 0 h, accumulated lag = 20 d; RR = 3.49, 95% CI = 0.01–1.60 × 103).The lower the TEM (≤ 21 °C), the greater the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2). The cumulative effect first increased and then decreased with increasing lag days (peak: TEM = 4 °C, accumulated lag = 4 d, RR = 18.97, 95% CI = 0.11–3.36 × 103); nevertheless, it rapidly increased again after a delay of 12 days. The higher the TEM was (≥ 26 °C), the greater the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2), but the risk decreased sharply after 3 days of accumulation.The greater the CO concentration was (≥ 1.1 mg/m3), the greater the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2). The cumulative effect first increased and then decreased with increasing lag days (peak: CO = 1.1 mg/m3, accumulated lag = 16 days, RR = 2.68, 95% CI = 0.15–47.66).NO2 (≥ 60 µg/m3) was a risk factor for infection with influenza A (H3N2), and the risk effect increased with increasing NO2 concentration (peak: NO2 = 127 µg/m3, lag = 21 d, RR = 2.78, 95% CI = 0.81–9.53); however, the cumulative effect decreased sharply and was no longer significant after 2 days.O3 (≤ 30 µg/m3) was a risk factor for infection with influenza A (H3N2), and the cumulative effect first increased and then decreased with increasing O3 concentration and lag days (peak: O3 = 12 µg/m3, accumulated lag = 20 d, RR = 1.60, 95% CI = 0.18–14.36). The larger the O3 concentration was (> 85 µg/m3) and the longer the lag time, the greater the cumulative effect.With increasing concentrations of high PM10 (> 107 µg/m3) and PM2.5 (> 93 µg/m3), the cumulative risk effect on influenza A (H3N2) increased. However, the impact of high PM10 on influenza A (H3N2) was short term, so the cumulative effect was not significant. Moreover, medium PM10 concentrations (30–60 µg/m3) were also a risk factor for influenza A (H3N2), and the cumulative effect increased with increasing lag days (peak: PM10 = 46 µg/m3, accumulated lag = 21 d, RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.55–3.51).SO2 (14–42 µg/m3) was a risk factor for influenza A (H3N2) infection, and the cumulative effect first increased and then decreased with increasing SO2 concentration and lag time (peak: SO2 = 26 µg/m3, accumulated lag = 11 d, RR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.40–9.35). Additional characteristics of MFs and air quality related to influenza A (H3N2) are presented in Fig. 6.Fig. 63-D plots and cumulative lag effect plots of the impacts of MFs and air quality on the risk of A(H3N2), 2013/01/01-2020/01/24Full size imageInteraction between influencing factorsThe interaction between TEM and SSD was statistically significant (t=-4.09, P < 0.01). With increasing SSD, the number of influenza A (H3N2) cases in the low-TEM group first increased and then decreased.There was also an interaction effect between TEM and SO2 (t=-8.09, P < 0.01). When the air SO2 concentration was low, the number of influenza A (H3N2) cases showed a faster downward trend with increasing TEM, but this downward trend became more gradual with increasing air SO2 concentration. In addition, there were interaction effects between RHU and PM10, RHU and PM2.5, SSD and SO2, TEM and NO2, CO and SO2, NO2 and SO2, PM10 and SO2, PM10 and PM2.5, and PM2.5 and SO2. Figure S5 and Table 1 show the interactions between the influencing factors studied. Table 1 Interaction between the influencing factors studied, 2013/01/01-202/01/24Full size tableProdrome period of the abnormally influenza epidemic in 2022The daily values of PRE, RHU, SSD, and TEM in the prodrome period of the abnormal influenza A (H3N2) epidemic (19–22 weeks) in the summer of 2022 were significantly different from the average values of the same period from 2013 to 2019 (P < 0.05). The detailed information are presented in Table 2. Table 2 Descriptive statistics and difference tests of various factors during the prodrome period of the abnormal influenza epidemic in 2022 (daily within 19–22 weeks) and the same period from 2013 to 2019Full size tableIn addition, during the prodrome period of the abnormal A (H3N2) epidemic in the summer of 2022, there were two instances of continuous precipitation, each lasting for 9 days, with a daily maximum value of 47.7 mm. RHU showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, with a minimum value of 70.5%. Meanwhile, TEM and SSD were lower than the average values of the same period in previous years (2013–2019), with the lowest TEM value being 16.0 ° C and no sunlight exposure for 9 consecutive days. The O3 concentration first increased and then decreased, reaching a maximum value of 164 µg/m3. The range of these factors were consistent with the risk factor range of A (H3N2). The detailed information are presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 6.The concentrations of CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 during the prodrome period of the abnormal A (H3N2) epidemic in the summer of 2022, were significantly lower than the average levels of the same period in previous years (2013–2019). The range of these factors did not fall within the risk factor range of A (H3N2). The detailed information are presented in Table 2.Floating population and vaccinationFrom 2013 to 2022, the dose of influenza vaccine in Xiamen showed an upward trend, but the vaccination rate was relatively low (only 2.85% in 2022), while the number of mobile population in Xiamen (around 300,0000) had not changed significantly over the years. There was no significant correlation between the number of A (H3N2) cases and influenza vaccine dose (r = 0.38, P = 0.28), as well as between the number of A (H3N2) cases and the number of floating population (r = 0.15, P = 0.70) in Xiamen from 2013 to 2022. Figure S6 shows the annual changes in influenza vaccine doses, the floating population, and the number of influenza A (H3N2) cases in Xiamen from 2013 to 2022.Pathogenic variation evolutionPhylogenetic analysis revealed that the A (H3N2) influenza virus prevalent in Xiamen during the 2022 epidemic season was similar to the vaccine strain A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3), which was recommended for the 2021–2022 epidemic season and belongs to 3 C.2a1b.2a.1a. The evolutionary branch of influenza A (H3N2) virus that was prevalent before COVID-19 in Xiamen was 3 C.2a1b.2, while the evolutionary branch of influenza A (H3N2) virus that was prevalent in 2022 was 3 C.2a1b.2a. The detailed results are shown in Fig. 7.Fig. 7Genetic evolution analysis of influenza A (H3N2) virus circulate in Xiamen, 2022Full size imageMfs prediction and prediction based on this for a (h3n2)The predicted MAD values for PRE on days 1, 4, 7, and 10 in 2022 were 6.18 mm, 7.50 mm, 8.08 mm, and 10.02 mm, respectively; for RHU, the values were 7.75%, 10.36%, 10.52%, and 10.43%, respectively; and for TEM, the values were 1.14 °C, 2.14 °C, 2.46 °C, and 2.49 °C, respectively. There was a significant difference in the trend test of the MAD value of PRE (F = 46.25, P = 0.02). Figure 8 and Table 3 show the predicted and actual values of the MFs. Table 3 Prediction of MAD values using different MFs and Cox Stuart trend testingFull size tableFig. 8Predicted and actual daily values of MFs and A (H3N2) from Jan to Aug 2022 (Note: The predicted values of A (H3N2) were based on the actual MFs values including PRE, RHU, and TEM, as well as the predicted values for days 1, 4, 7, and 10.)Full size imageBased on the actual values of the MFs, including PRE, RHU, and TEM, the predicted RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SMAPE for influenza A (H3N2) were 82.42, 30.40, 0.60, and 0.90, respectively. Table 3 also shows the evaluation effect of the influenza A (H3N2) prediction based on the MF prediction values. Figure 8 shows the predicted and actual values of influenza A (H3N2) cases.DiscussionThe research results indicate that the end of each year, the beginning of the following year (December to February), and the summer (May to July) in Xiamen are the epidemic seasons for influenza, with sporadic cases occurring between epidemics. This study shows that during the 2022 summer pandemic, the activity level of influenza significantly exceeded historical normal levels, and A (H3N2) dominated absolutely (during the 2022 summer pandemic season, A (H3N2) accounted for 95.60%, accounting for 83.90% of all A (H3N2) from 2013 to 2022). In China, as the screening measures for respiratory tract infection pathogens during the COVID-19 were strengthened, the proportion of laboratory confirmed cases of influenza in Xiamen in 2021 and 2022 exceeded 80% (since the influenza cases in 2020 mainly occurred before the COVID-19, laboratory confirmed cases accounted for 49.75%), which may increase the number of influenza reports. However, the proportion of laboratory confirmed cases of influenza during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2021 accounted for 81.86%, which was not accompanied by a high incidence of influenza, and the correlation between laboratory confirmed cases and the number of influenza cases from 2013 to 2022 was not significant, so the impact was limited. Moreover, there were differences in the distributions of various pathogenic subtypes of influenza and heterogeneity in the dominant strains during the epidemic and interepidemic phases (Figure S4). Therefore, it is crucial to explore the influencing factors and predict influenza outbreaks at the pathogenic subtype level to overcome the issue of the vague and changeable characteristics of influenza epidemics.With the influence of the driving factors in the early phase of the abnormally high-incidence period of influenza, the density of infected people gradually increased, human-to-human transmission became the dominant driving factor, and the number of infected people in the outbreak period showed an exponential sharp increase to an abnormally high level. Therefore, to avoid significant bias in association analysis results due to abnormal data caused by nonearly detection drivers during the outbreak period, the DLNM was not used in this study to analyse the effects of MFs and air quality on influenza A (H3N2) in 2022.The correlations between influenza A (H3N2) and PRS and WIN from January 1, 2013, to January 24, 2020, were not significant (Fig. 5). Moreover, there were no abnormal occurrences of PRS or WIN during the precursor period of abnormally high incidence in 2022 compared to the weekly average values from 2013 to 2019 (Fig. 4). Therefore, PRS and WIN were excluded from the subsequent analysis in this study.The DLNM analysis results in this study revealed a positive correlation between PRE (20–46 mm) and influenza A (H3N2) during the non-COVID-19 epidemic period, which is consistent with the inverted U-shaped results reported by Lu et al. [30]. However, their study showed that weekly (not daily) precipitation (10–97.5 mm) was positively correlated with influenza (not A (H3N2)), which is different from the findings of this study. In addition, a study in which virus subtypes were not classified suggested a monotonically increasing positive correlation between precipitation and influenza, which is inconsistent with the results of this study [31]. The relationship between RHU and influenza A (H3N2) had an inverted U shape, with RHU (70–78%) having the most significant cumulative effect on the risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2), which increased with the number of lag days. Zhou et al. also showed that low RHU had no significant effect on the incidence of influenza A (H3N2), and relatively high RHU was also associated with influenza A (H3N2), which further proved that persistently high relative humidity may be related to an increased risk of influenza A (H3N2). However, inconsistent with the findings of this study, Zhou et al. reported that high RHU also increases the risk of influenza A (H3N2) infection, possibly because the GAM and the DLNM used in the study may have contributed to the inconsistency of the results. In addition, the difference in the data types (weekly vs. daily) used by Zhou et al. and in this study may also impact the results [32].Studies have shown that humid and rainy conditions are conducive to the spread of influenza A (H3N2) in low-latitude areas, respiratory droplets are the main route of influenza transmission, and their abundance of salt and protein is beneficial for the survival of A (H3N2). The low-temperature and humid environment indirectly affects the evaporation rate of respiratory droplets, thereby affecting the survival and transmission of A (H3N2) [5]. However, some studies also suggest that precipitation does not directly affect the onset of influenza but rather affects the onset of influenza by affecting relative humidity [33]. Relevant mechanistic studies have shown that the humid tropical rainy season can promote the spread of influenza by increasing virus deposition on surfaces and enhancing virus survival in droplets [34].In this study, in the early stages of the abnormal A (H3N2) epidemic (May June) in 2022, there was sustained precipitation (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the findings of the Xiamen Climate Bulletin of 2022 that “Xiamen City experienced sustained long-term precipitation from May to late June 2022, with abnormally high precipitation during this period” [35]. The weekly average PRE during this period was also significantly higher than the average level from 2013 to 2019 (Fig. 4). In addition, compared with the same period of previous years (2013–2019), there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the daily values of PRE and RHU during the prodrome period (19–22 weeks) of this abnormal epidemic, during which two precipitation events lasting for 9 days occurred and RHU showing a trend of first decreasing and then increasing (Figs. 3 and 4; Table 2). The range of these factors is consistent with the risk factor range of A (H3N2). Therefore, the extreme precipitation event caused by continuous precipitation and the sustained high relative humidity may be the driving factor for the abnormal epidemic of influenza A (H3N2) in Xiamen in 2022.The results of this study indicated that TEM was negatively correlated with the onset of influenza A (H3N2). The risk of infection with influenza A (H3N2) decreased with increasing temperature at low temperatures (≤ 21 °C). Zhang et al. also reported the contributions of low temperature to the transmission efficiency of influenza A (H3N2) [6]. Low temperature can reduce the body’s immune function through mechanisms such as vasoconstriction, changes in metabolic rate, and decreased antioxidant capacity leading to a greater incidence rate. In addition, some researchers suggest that temperatures between 18 °C and 23.5 °C may lead to larger outdoor gatherings and increased risk of disease transmission [29].A low SSD (≤ 3 h) and high SSD (≥ 7 h) had more significant cumulative impacts on the risk of influenza A (H3N2) infection in this study. However, Du et al.‘s study showed a negative correlation between average temperature and sunshine duration and influenza, but they did not target specific subtypes [36]. For sunlight duration, some studies suggest that a shorter duration of sunlight cannot promote the synthesis of vitamin D in the human body, thus failing to have an immune boosting effect [36]. However, increased exposure to sunlight can increase the risk of infection by increasing people’s activity [37].During the prodrome period of the abnormal A (H3N2) epidemic in the summer of 2022, TEM and SSD were lower than the average values of the same period in previous years (2013–2019), with the lowest TEM value being 16.0 ° C and no sunlight exposure for 9 consecutive days (Fig. 3; Table 2). The 2022 Climate Bulletin of Xiamen also reported extreme weather events with low temperatures and abundant rainfall during this period [35]. Thus, this may be one of the important reasons for this anomaly.Although all six air pollutants in this study were risk factors for influenza A (H3N2) (Fig. 6), the concentration ranges of CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 did not match those of the precursor period of the abnormally high incidence in Xiamen (Fig. 3; Table 2), and the weekly average values from May to June 2022 were lower than those from 2013 to 2019 (Fig. 4), which suggests that these air quality factors were not the main cause of this outbreak.The weekly average O3 concentration in the pre-peak period of influenza was lower than that from 2013 to 2019 (Fig. 4). According to the DLNM analysis, the longer the lag period was, the more obvious the cumulative effect when O3 was at a high concentration (> 85 µg/m3). As a secondary pollutant, high concentrations of O3 have been shown to increase the risk of viral infection by generating strong oxidative free radicals and disrupting metabolism and other mechanisms in the human body [38]. In addition, this study revealed that a low concentration of O3 (≤ 30 µg/m3) was also a risk factor for the incidence of influenza A (H3N2). With increasing lag days, the incidence risk first decreased and then increased with increasing O3 concentration. Ali et al. suggested that the link between environmental ozone and decreased influenza transmission may be due to the antiviral activity of ozone and its effect on host defence [39]. However, the antiviral effect of low concentrations of O3 was not significant, enhancing the risk of influenza onset. O3 at medium concentrations was shown to reduce the risk of influenza, which may explain the reduced risk of influenza A (H3N2) at medium concentrations of O3. Yang et al.‘s study also reported the U-shaped relationship of O3 with influenza transmission, which is consistent with the results of this study [40]. During the abnormally high incidence of influenza in Xiamen, the O3 content was within the range of medium to high concentrations, with a weekly average lower than that in previous years. However, due to the UV intensity and NOx concentration, the O3/NOx balance was affected, and in the early stage of the abnormally high incidence, the temperature and sunshine duration in Xiamen were relatively low, resulting in a decrease in the O3 concentration. Due to the reaction balance, the NOx concentration increased, and research has shown that NOx increases the risk of disease through a decrease in virus-specific immunity and an increase in cellular inflammation [41]. Although the concentration range of O3 in this study was not sufficient to confirm the impact of O3 on the abnormally high incidence, and the increase in NOx (non-NO2) concentration caused by reaction equilibrium may have had an impact on the incidence, NO2 was not a risk driving factor for the abnormally high incidence in Xiamen in the summer of 2022.This study revealed interactions between MFs and air pollutants, suggesting that their influence is not independent but rather mutual. For instance, the interaction between TEM, SO2, and SSD was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The interaction between low to medium TEM (3.9-22.29 ° C) and low to medium SSD (0–4 h) enhanced the impact on A (H3N2), which may be due to a decrease in human immunity and an increase in virus stability. Low sunshine hours can lead to lower temperatures, and during lower temperatures, the survival time of the virus will be prolonged. In addition, low sunshine hours can indirectly affect vitamin D in the human body, leading to a decrease in immunity [36]. The interaction between the two increases the risk of contracting A (H3N2). Low concentration SO2 (1.0–6.9 µg/m3) interacted with medium and low SSDs (0–4 h), significantly increasing the influence on the incidence of influenza A (H3N2). Several studies have shown that low concentrations of sulfur dioxide do not result in acidic environments, which to some extent benefits the survival of viruses and reduces their transmission [14]. In addition, short sunshine duration may increase atmospheric stability and limit the diffusion of SO2 [42]. The interaction between the two increases the risk of A (H3N2) infection. During this precursor period of abnormally high incidence in Xiamen, both SO2 and SSD were at low levels, and these interactions may have contributed to the abnormally high incidence of influenza in Xiamen in 2022.This study involved a systematic evolutionary analysis of the HA gene of the A (H3N2) influenza virus and revealed that the administration of the vaccine component A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3) before the abnormally high-incidence period may have had a good protective effect against the prevalent A (H3N2) influenza virus at that time.According to the data from the 37th weekly report of the National Influenza Center of China in 2022, 86.4% of the A (H3N2) influenza viruses circulating in China at that time were similar to the A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3) chicken embryo strain [43], but only 77.2% were similar to the A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3) chicken embryo strain [44]. This finding indicates that the results of systematic evolution analysis are consistent with those of antigen analysis.In addition to antigen matching between vaccine strains and epidemic strains, the vaccination rate is an important factor affecting the protective effect of vaccines. Compared with that in other developed countries and regions, the influenza vaccination rate in mainland China is extremely low [45] and reached only 2.84% in Xiamen in 2022, indicating that vaccination cannot form a sufficient immune barrier in the population, which will contribute to the spread and prevalence of the virus. In addition, this study showed that there was no significant correlation between floating population, vaccination rate and influenza incidence rate (P < 0.05). Therefore, from a demographic and statistical perspective, the vaccination rate and floating population may not have been the main driving factors for the abnormally high incidence of influenza.Influenza A (H3N2) was not detected domestically in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, but a variant strain appeared in 2022. First, the mutated strain was imported from overseas, where it reached a population with insufficient immune barriers, which is conducive to rapid transmission. However, the abnormally high incidence of influenza occurred in only the southern provinces, despite the presence of similar immune barrier populations in the north, thus, the driving effect of the mutated strain on the abnormally high incidence of influenza was limited. Second, the immune barrier formed by the influenza epidemic before COVID-19 may not have provided an effective immune effect against the virus that was prevalent during this time. Even if the immune barrier formed by this natural infection had a certain cross-immune effect, the 2-year span of the COVID-19 epidemic may have also allowed this effect to disappear.However, on the basis of the main driving forces of MFs, low vaccination rates, the emergence of new mutant strains and insufficient immune barriers formed by natural infections may further strengthen the driving force behind this abnormally high incidence.Table 3 shows that a low MAD indicates a good meteorological prediction effect in Xiamen, but as the number of predicted days increased, the MAD gradually increased (although only the MAD trends on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th days of PRE were significant, P < 0.05), indicating an increase in prediction error. The prediction results for influenza A (H3N2) showed that the four evaluation indicators predicted by the actual meteorological value of influenza A (H3N2) were greater than the meteorological prediction value, and the difference in the four evaluation indicators predicted by the four sets of meteorological prediction values of influenza A (H3N2) was not significant (Table 4). It was suggested that using meteorologically predicted values to predict influenza A (H3N2) was more accurate than predicting actual meteorological values, and the prediction effect did not decrease with increasing meteorologically predicted days. Table 4 Evaluation effect of A (H3N2) prediction based on MFs from Jan to Aug 2022Full size tableBoth meteorologically predicted values and true values are important features of influenza A (H3N2) prediction, but the predicted values integrate historical, current, and future meteorological information, which has temporal characteristics and contains richer information. Moreover, MFs that affect diseases often have a certain lag effect, and meteorologically predicted values can capture long-term meteorological trends and changes, such as seasonal or periodic changes, which can alleviate the lag effect to a certain extent. Obtaining meteorological values with temporal characteristics does not involve disease data and can be seen as a process of enriching feature information. Therefore, using meteorologically predicted values will have a better effect on predicting influenza A (H3N2) than using only the meteorological values of the day (meteorologically true values). These findings suggest that in the future, additional meteorological predictions can be used for predicting influenza A (H3N2) to achieve earlier intervention goals.Currently, the climate is constantly changing worldwide, and climate change will cause extreme weather, such as continuous precipitation, high temperatures and low temperatures [46]. Relevant review studies have shown that climate change and the potential vulnerability of a country or region (weak coping ability in health and social fields) will intensify each other, amplifying the negative impact on people [47, 48]. Therefore, a study of the sensitivity and tolerance of influenza to climate change, combined closely with predictions, is beneficial for better addressing the challenges of climate change.This study has some limitations. First, because the daily prototype incidence of influenza was calculated based on pathogen monitoring data and influenza data reported by Xiamen medical and health institutions, the influenza data in the reporting system of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention includes laboratory confirmed cases and a small number of clinically diagnosed cases, and there may be some deviation in the use of the prototype proportion monitored by sentinel hospitals for the counter calculation of clinical diagnosis cases. Second, due to the interaction effect of SSD and TEM on the incidence of influenza A (H3N2), this study chose to accurately predict the incidence of influenza A (H3N2) by using three other MFs and historical data on influenza A (H3N2) without the predicted value of SSD. However, if the SSD prediction values can be captured, the prediction effect of influenza A (H3N2) may improve. Third, the pre-existing immune system in the population might had reduced its protective effect against A (H3N2) variant genotype 3 C.2a1b.2a.1a, thereby increasing the transmission capacity of A (H3N2), but there was currently a lack of evidence. The newly evolved A (H3N2) data for the prediction training set was very limited, therefore, the prediction results of this study may underestimate the true values.ConclusionExtreme weather conditions, including continuous rainfall (15–70 mm), low TEM (below 23 °C), high RHU (70–78%), and low SSD, may be the important driving factors for the abnormally influenza A (H3N2) epidemic in the summer of 2022 in Xiamen. The low vaccination rate, the emergence of new mutant strains, and the insufficient immune barrier formed by natural infections may have further strengthened the epidemic intensity. A high concentration of air pollutants was also a risk factor for influenza A (H3N2), but it may not be the driving factor for this abnormally high incidence. However, the reaction equilibrium between O3 and NOx, as well as the interaction between SSD and TEM and SO2, may have had an impact on this incidence. The combination of the LSTM and RF models for influenza A (H3N2) prediction had good accuracy, and the use of meteorologically predicted values was better than the use of only meteorologically true values for prediction. This study can help relevant departments prepare for influenza outbreaks during extreme weather, provide a scientific basis for prevention strategies and risk warnings, better adapt to climate change, and improve public health.

Lee1 & Minoru Yoshida2,3 The Journal of Antibiotics volume 77, pages 711–712 (2024)Cite this article 580 Accesses Metrics details The Editorial Board of The Journal of Antibiotics has given the 2022 JA Ōmura Award for an original article to an outstanding paper entitled “Azithromycin, a 15-membered macrolide antibiotic, inhibits influenza A(Hl N1)pdm09 virus infection by interfering with virus internalization process” by Tran et al. [1]. Historically, influenza pandemics have often caused tremendous casualties: in 1918, Spanish influenza A(H1N1) led to a global pandemic, causing a catastrophe that killed an estimated 20–50 million people. In addition, several decades ago, a new influenza A(H1Nl)pdm09 virus caused the most recent global pandemic. Clinically used neuraminidase inhibitors are effective against human influenza by inhibiting the production of progeny viruses during the acute phase of infection. However, drug-resistant A(H1N1) viruses have been increasing and are now an emerging threat worldwide. Thus, new strategies are required to prepare for the next global pandemic. Tran et al. found that azithromycin (AZM), a clinically used 15-membered ring macrolide antimicrobial agent, inhibits the internalization of influenza A(H1 N1)pdm09 virus when it directly interacts with the virus before infection. As a result, replication of progeny viruses is markedly inhibited by blocking viral entry into host cells during the early stages of the infection process. Furthermore, intranasal administration of AZM to mice infected with A(H1Nl)pdm09 virus successfully reduced the amount of virus in the lungs and alleviated hypothermia induced by the infection. Because developing new anti-influenza drugs from scratch is a time-consuming process, repositioning of approved drugs is one of the most effective strategies to identify new anti-influenza drugs in a short time. AZM may be prescribed to prevent both primary infection by influenza A virus and secondary infection by bacteria.The 2022 winner of the Ōmura Award for an original review article is “Splicing Modulators: on the Way from Nature to the Clinic” by Schneider-Poetsch et al. [2]. This review article examines more than two decades of research on the discovery and application of splicing modulators and their function as chemical probes and drug candidates. Splicing is a fundamental process in eukaryotes, which is not found in prokaryotes. Thus, it is not surprising that complex cytotoxic antibiotics targeting this mechanism have evolved. Antibiotic classes examined in this review include spliceostatins, pladienolides, and herboxidienes. Synthetic analogs of these classes have become powerful probes for studying splicing and mRNA processing. The related splice-site modifiers NVS-SM1/Branaplam and Risdiplam, which avoid overt toxicity and have shown impressive therapeutic benefits in the treatment of splicing disorders, are also discussed.The review covers the initial splicing inhibitor discoveries and subsequent efforts to optimize the modulators, the identification of the spliceosome and its function, the cellular effects of splicing modulation, ongoing clinical trials, new approaches such as the use of targeted protein degradation to manipulate this pathway, and RNA-binding modulators exemplified by those that have been successfully developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy caused by splice variants. It concludes with an outlook for the future of the field.This outstanding review is highly recommended to those interested in learning more about the current state of the art in research and development surrounding the discovery and development of splicing modulators.

Read time: 2 minutes Summary A University of Georgia study reveals that natural immunity gained from previous influenza infections enhances immune responses to subsequent vaccinations. This finding suggests that individuals who contract the flu may benefit in their battle against future strains, contributing to the development of more effective influenza vaccines.Key TakeawaysPreexisting immunity from natural flu infections strengthens immune responses to vaccines, offering an unexpected benefit.Infected animals showed heightened immunity when vaccinated with both matching and different flu strains.The study supports ongoing efforts to create universal influenza vaccines for vulnerable populations.In a new study funded by the National Institutes of Health, University of Georgia researchers found that natural immunity from previous flu infections has a significant impact on how well future influenza vaccinations work.That may mean if you’re one of the unlucky estimated 1 in 5 Americans who gets the flu each year, according to the NIH, there may be an unexpected upside to your illness.It may help you battle future versions of the virus.Want more breaking news?Subscribe to Technology Networks’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.Subscribe for FREE“Overall, the preexisting immunity you develop through natural infection helps to strengthen immune responses,” said Ye Shen, study corresponding author and a professor in the UGA College of Public Health. “We didn’t fully understand how preexisting immunity through natural infection with different influenza strains changes vaccine-elicited immune responses before this study. Now we have a better understanding of how preexisting immunity to influenza influences immune responses to different types of vaccines.”Flu shots aim to keep up with an evolving virusEach flu season, your flu shot targets certain strains of the virus. So when scientists develop the influenza vaccine, they have to make educated guesses about which strains are most likely to be circulating ahead of time.While plenty of research goes into developing the shot, it’s never going to be right 100% of the time.The flu virus’s ability to constantly evolve and develop new and more virulent strains makes it difficult to fight.“In some years, we don’t have very good protection from the vaccine because of that mismatch,” Shen said. “People have started to worry about whether the shot is actually protecting them from the flu because of that. With this study, though, we do see benefits of having preexisting immunity, and that’s good to know.”Vaccination post-recovery can bolster immune systemThe researchers tested vaccines made of various flu strains.They found when animals were infected with one strain of the flu, the animals had a heightened immune response when given a vaccine targeting that same strain.But overall immunity also improved significantly when the animals were given a vaccine targeting a different flu strain, after being infected with the original strain of the virus.With the body protecting itself against one strain with its natural immune response and the vaccine eliciting broader immune responses to a spectrum of flu strains, the body was better shielded.Animals that were not initially infected with the virus but did get the vaccine were more likely to need a booster because they lacked natural immunity.This research is part of a larger, seven-year NIH-funded study that aims to create universal influenza vaccines for vulnerable populations.“Our future studies will further explore more clinically relevant outcomes including actual infections in humans. It may not be enough just to push your antibodies higher,” Shen said. “Is that enough to protect you from mutations of different influenza strains? This is where individual-level heterogeneity becomes important, which remains an ongoing area of research in the field.”Reference: Ge Y, Lu Y, Allen JD, et al.

Without blood test results, officials can't sayAntibody blood test results expected later this month may help answer a crucial question: Is there human-to-human transmission of the bird flu?A total of 16 people have tested positive for bird flu since March. All but one had contact with either poultry or dairy cows. David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOct. 4, 2024, 8:17 PM UTCBy Berkeley Lovelace Jr.A total of seven people who were in close contact with a bird flu patient in Missouri developed symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, but it remains unclear whether these represent cases of human-to-human spread of the virus. Antibody blood test results, which will come back later this month, officials said, are needed to answer that question. Since most of the seven people weren’t tested for bird flu, it’s not yet known whether any of them were infected with the virus or another pathogen.The Missouri patient, who didn’t have known contact with poultry or dairy cows, was hospitalized in August with underlying medical conditions. On a call with reporters Friday, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said officials were able to retroactively track the patient’s movements during their time in the hospital in August and identify health care workers who were exposed and potentially at risk.After the patient was hospitalized, Daskalaskis said, doctors tested the individual for influenza, a result that came back positive, and gave the patient Tamiflu. After the positive flu result, health care workers started using more personal protective gear around the patient.Separately, as part of routine flu surveillance and not because doctors suspected anything unusual in the patient’s case, the hospital sent the patient’s flu sample to be tested for H5, which is the bird flu virus strain. The positive H5 result triggered the investigation. Officials found that during the patient’s time at the hospital, 112 health care workers had interacted with them. Six developed respiratory symptoms. The other close contact who developed symptoms was a household contact. All have recovered.Among the 112 workers, 18 were considered to have had higher risk interactions because they occurred before the patient tested positive for flu and therefore before “droplet precautions” were taken to protect workers from infection, Daskalaskis said. The remaining 94 interacted with the patient after the precautions were in place. Normally, he said, these health care workers wouldn’t be considered “exposed,” but the agency pursued them anyway “out of an abundance of caution.”Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that even if the health care workers interacted with the patient after precautions were in place, it doesn’t rule out the possibility that they were infected with bird flu. The virus can be transmitted through aerosols, particles smaller than droplets that can suspend the air for long periods of time. Osterholm said he would be “very surprised,” however, if any of the sick health care workers had bird flu, given that officials had a very hard time getting viable virus from the patient. Still, he said, the lack of information isn’t helping matters. “Unfortunately, just to delay getting the confirmatory information has led people to speculate that this is a cluster of H5N1,” he said. “It builds suspense that somehow there’s something we don’t know.” One of the sick health workers tested negative for influenza, Daskalakis said, suggesting that their symptoms weren’t related to bird flu. Blood tests, however, will need to help rule out the remaining five health workers as their symptoms were only discovered after the investigation began. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, said that while the investigation’s findings shed more light on the patient’s interactions with health care workers, there are still unanswered questions about those who became ill.For example, it remains unclear whether the health care workers became sick on the same day they met the patient, the following day or several days later.After exposure to the bird flu virus, people typically develop symptoms within 3 to 5 days. Depending on the timing of symptom onset, it’s possible that the workers could have been sick with a different virus, such as Covid.“Timing would be helpful,” Rivers said. “If the dates were very commensurate with transmission then that would raise concern.” Daskalakis shared a similar sentiment on Friday’s call.“We are in the middle of respiratory season,” he said. All of that additional information on the health workers will be secondary to the blood tests results, Rivers said, and whether they show signs of a previous infection. “It would be notable, because the Missouri bird patient didn’t have any known exposures, and so already there is a mysterious circumstance that could be concerning,” she said. “If human to human transmission were confirmed that would be the first instance in the United States. H5 has been circulating for a long time in wild animals.”The H5N1 bird flu outbreak in dairy cows has infected 254 herds across 14 states as of Thursday, according to the CDC. Since March, there have been a total of 16 cases in humans, including two cases reported in California dairy workers on Thursday. Those two cases are not related, the CDC said. With the exception of the Missouri patient, all human cases have been in dairy or poultry workers. All have recovered.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

Below, we highlight our current and upcoming products related to respiratory virus season. We will share additional products as the season progresses. Current Epidemic Trends CFA provides weekly estimates of Rt, the time-varying reproductive number, at the national and state levels to determine the current epidemic trends. Estimates are currently available for COVID-19 and influenza. Rt is a data-driven measure of disease transmission. Rt can tell us whether infections are growing, declining, or remaining stable, and can help public health practitioners prepare and respond to these viruses – read more about Rt and how we calculate it. Example of the Epidemic Trend tool. Visit the page to view the current epidemic growth status. Keep Reading: Current Epidemic Trends (Based on Rt) for States Improving CDC’s Tools for Assessing Epidemic Trends CFA is building modeling tools and computational pipelines so that we can analyze data quickly and accurately in response to outbreaks. Our goal is to make these tools accessible to federal, state, tribal, territorial, local, and academic partners. One of these efforts is to estimate the time-varying reproductive number, Rt, a measure that helps us quickly assess whether infections are increasing or decreasing. Rt is a data-driven quantity. We identify all the individuals infected on a particular date (this is referred to as the "infectee generation", with four newly infected persons), and divide by the number of people who caused those infections (or the "parents" of those cases, making up the "infector generation").Show More Keep Reading: Behind the Model: CDC's Tools to Assess Epidemic Trends Respiratory Disease Season Outlook CFA led development of the 2024-2025 CDC respiratory disease season outlook to provide decision-makers information to assist with public health preparedness, including planning for potential surges in hospital demand. CDC expects the 2024-2025 fall and winter respiratory disease season will likely have a similar or lower number of combined peak hospitalizations due to COVID-19, influenza, and RSV compared to last season. See the October update to the season outlook. CDC will continue to monitor respiratory disease activity throughout the fall and winter. View Larger Experts believe there’s a roughly 80% chance that the hospitalization burden for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV combined at their peak during the 2024-25 season will be similar to or lower than last season. Keep Reading: 2024-2025 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook – October Update How scenario modeling can inform decision-making CFA has developed scenario modeling capability that allows decision-makers to examine a range of possible outcomes under different assumptions about the future, providing insights for addressing specific policy questions and for general preparedness and planning.

Keep Reading: Behind the Model: How Scenario Modeling Can Inform Public Health Decision-Making. COVID-19 Forecasts (coming soon) Previously, CDC has submitted short-term forecasts of COVID-19 hospital admissions to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. The COVID-19 Forecast Hub, which is currently paused, receives forecasts from modeling teams from across the country and builds a single ensemble forecast. These ensemble forecasts for COVID-19 hospitalizations have helped public health decision-makers anticipate healthcare burden and prepare for potential COVID-19 surges. One of the forecasts CFA submitted was informed by wastewater data – read more about CFA's wastewater-informed COVID-19 hospital admission forecast.

In the context of Child Health Day 2024, this research emphasizes that continued efforts should be made to increase vaccination coverage among children for future seasons. Context and methods Influenza A was dominant in the 2023/2024 season, with influenza B rarely being detected. The influenza vaccination campaign for children started in the autumn of 2023, with a national vaccination coverage of 31.6%. The test-negative case–control study analyzed surveillance data from 12 of 19 regions in Spain and 27 hospitals, and included pediatric patients aged 6-59 months that had been tested for influenza. The study comprised 1,364 patients presenting at primary care with acute respiratory infections, 244 of which tested positive for influenza (i.e. cases), and 302 patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), 48 of which tested positive for influenza (i.e. cases). Influenza vaccination data for patients was then collected from regional vaccination records. Vaccine effectiveness was determined by comparing the vaccination rate of those who tested positive for influenza to the rate of those who did not, with higher vaccination rates for those who tested negative (i.e. controls) being indicative of effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness was then adjusted for potential confounders including sex, age in months, epidemiological week, presence of chronic conditions, and region or hospital for ARI or SARI models. Findings The study estimated the influenza vaccine to be 70% effective against any influenza type (95% confidence interval (CI): 51 to 81%) in primary care patients with ARI, and 77% effective against influenza (95% CI: 21 to 93%) in hospitalized patients with SARI.

Where influenza A viruses were subtyped, A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most frequent influenza virus subtype with 61.2% and 43.8% in primary care and hospitals, respectively, followed by A(H3N2), with 19% and 18.8%, respectively, and unsubtyped influenza A virus with 18.6%, and 35.4%, respectively. Circulation of influenza B virus was low. Public health implications It is estimated that 109 million influenza virus infections occur among children between 0–59 months worldwide, and infections can lead to severe disease and outcomes. In Spain, children under 5 years of age have the second highest rate of hospitalization for influenza, just after the age group of over 65 year-olds. The results of this study are consistent with previous research supporting the effectiveness of influenza vaccines to protect children's health.

Home / Why You Need a Flu Shot This YearPrimary CareWhy You Need a Flu Shot This Year September 30, 2024Summer is over, are you ready for flu season? The best way to reduce your risk from seasonal flu and potentially serious complications is to get a flu vaccine every year. One reason: protecting yourself against the flu is easier than treating the flu. September and October are the best times to get vaccinated. Here are some reasons you need a flu shot this year.Preventative healthcare. Fall is time for Flu Shots Influenza/flu vaccines or “flu shots”, are recommended in the United States, and are shown to reduce the risk of flu and its potentially serious complications in vaccinated people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older with rare exceptions.Flu vaccination has important benefits…PREVENTATIVE: Every year, it prevents flu illnesses, doctor’s visits, and missed work or school. It also reduces flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC estimates that the flu has caused between 4,900 and 51,000 deaths in the US each year between 2010 and 2023.PROTECTIVE: It is an important preventive tool for people with chronic health conditions. PREGNANCY: For pregnant women it helps protect them from flu illness and hospitalization. It has also been shown to help protect the baby from flu infection for several months after birth, before the baby can be vaccinated.CHILDREN: A 2017 study showed that it can be lifesaving in children.REDUCES SEVERITY: While some still get sick, flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce severity of illness.Why it’s important to get vaccinated every year… Flu viruses are constantly changing. Vaccines can be updated from one season to the next to protect against the viruses that are expected to be common during that flu season. Your protection from a flu vaccine declines over time. Yearly vaccination is needed for the best protection. Vaccination are particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious influenza complications.While influenza viruses spread year-round, flu activity often begins to increase in October. Most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing and duration of flu activity has been less predictable. For most people who need only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against influenza. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Flu vaccines are offered in many doctors’ offices and clinics, and other locations, including: health departments, pharmacies, urgent care clinics, health centers, or the workplace.Get your flu vaccine at West Tennessee Medical Group Primary CareGetting a flu vaccine each year is an important step towards keeping you and your family healthy.

Inglis1 Nature Aging volume 4, page 1336 (2024)Cite this article 64 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects AgeingPreventive medicinePublic health Access through your institution Buy or subscribe The authors had previously conducted a trial (termed, NUDGE-FLU) during the 2022–2023 influenza season in Denmark, where the government maintains Digital Post (an online mailbox for most citizens aged 15 years or older). As part of the NUDGE-FLU trial, the authors sent messages through Digital Post to adults aged 65 years and older and concluded that these electronic reminders could improve influenza vaccine uptake. In their Nature Medicine study, the authors were interested in whether the benefits of sending these electronic reminders were consistent across consecutive influenza seasons. The authors relied on a cohort of 881,373 older adults, who represented 70.4% of the total eligible study population in Denmark. Participants were randomly assigned into seven different groups, which influenced either the number of messages they received through Digital Post or the content of the message they received about influenza vaccinations. For instance, participants in one group were sent a standard notification about the upcoming influenza season, which included a reminder that they were eligible to receive a free vaccine. In other groups, this standard message was supplemented with text that notified participants about the benefits of influenza vaccination in limiting cardiovascular disease risk, respiratory complications or the spread of the infection to friends and family. Alternatively, participants may have received the standard message twice in the span of about two weeks or a single message that contained a link to directly book a vaccination appointment. Finally, as a control comparison, a subset of older adults did not receive any nudges or reminders about the influenza vaccine through Digital Post.After pooling all participants who had received any kind of digital nudge, the authors observed a 0.31% increase in vaccinations by the end of the year, compared to participants who did not receive an electronic reminder. There were no significant differences in vaccination rates when considering participant age, sex, geographical location in Denmark or disease status, or whether individuals had taken part in the original NUDGE-FLU trial. Participants who received electronic reminders were also more likely to get vaccinated earlier in the year, although the authors were unable to resolve whether any single kind of reminder or letter offered a significant benefit in improving vaccination rates.

Nearly half of the children had at least one pre-existing medical condition.Stock photoRecep-bg/Getty ImagesMORE: ER doctor shares how to prepare for flu season with a 'flu box'Everyone over the age of six months is recommended to get their annual flu vaccine before the end of October, according to the CDC.Children up to 8 years old receiving their first flu shot should receive two doses if they previously have not, the CDC notes.Older adults over the age of 65, who are at higher risk of severe illness including hospitalization and death, may opt for a higher dose flu shot for further protection. "Vaccination remains our most effective tool to prevent illness and reduce the risk of serious complications in children," said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor.Vaccination rates among children for flu have been declining in recent years. About 53.9% of children were vaccinated against influenza this season, about 2.2% points lower than last season and 8.5% points lower than pre-pandemic."The decline in flu vaccination rates among children is deeply concerning and is at least partly linked to the rise in pediatric cases we're witnessing," Brownstein said.A child is given a flu shot.Adobe StockMORE: Missouri reports 1st human case of bird flu in the stateEstimates show that flu vaccination reduced the risk of flu medical visits by about two-thirds and halved the risk of hospitalization among kids, according to the CDC."We must address this drop in vaccinations to prevent further unnecessary and preventable loss of young lives," Brownstein added.The influenza virus spreads year-round, but flu activity typically picks up in the fall and winter, peaking between the months of December and February.While the impact of flu varies from season to season, estimates from the CDC show the virus has resulted in up to 41 million illnesses, 710,000 hospitalizations and 51,000 deaths annually in the past decade, according to the CDC."The record number of pediatric flu deaths this season is a stark indicator of how severe influenza can be," Brownstein said.Related TopicsFlu SeasonPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsH5N1 infects second farm worker in California as feds bolster vaccine supply | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

Both patients worked on farms in the Central Valley, where the virus has now been detected in 56 dairy farms since September.The California Department of Public Health said, as in the first case, the second patient had mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis. Neither reported respiratory symptoms or was hospitalized.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it confirmed both cases as H5 avian flu, bringing the nation’s total to 16 cases since the first of the year. All but one—which involves a patient from Missouri—have been connected to contact with sick cows or poultry.CDC scientists will conduct additional tests on the specimens from California’s patients, including genetic sequencing and attempting to isolate and grow the virus.At a briefing today, Nirav Shah, MD, JD, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said the additional cases don’t change the CDC’s assessment that the risk to the general public is low, though more cases in people exposed to sick animals are expected.He commended California officials for actively monitoring workers and quickly identifying and following up on people with symptoms. “This is public health in action,” Shah said.Serology challenges in the Missouri investigationAt today’s briefing, Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, who directs the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the agency’s scientists face a complex task in conducting serology tests to determine of any of the seven symptomatic contacts, six of them healthcare workers, of Missouri’s recent H5N1 patient had been infected with the virus.He said H5 serology testing isn’t commercially available and that the process is more involved than clinical serologic testing. A sample of the live virus is needed to rule out a false-negative result. The work needs to be done in a biosafety level 3 lab, and because scientists couldn't isolate the complete virus from Missouri’s confirmed patient, they had to reverse engineer one to match the Missouri virus. That step was completed on September 30. He said scientists are moving at an accelerated pace and hope to have results by mid to late October.Daskalakis also shared more details about Missouri’s investigation, including that the Missouri hospital instituted droplet precautions for the patient as soon as the respiratory virus panel showed a positive for influenza A. Missouri health officials conducted a traceback investigation, which identified 112 people at the hospital who likely had contact with the patient during the individual’s stay at the facility. Eighteen of them had higher-risk interactions before droplet precautions were introduced.He said health systems are well prepared to detect another rare event, such as the one in Missouri, adding that all influenza A samples from Missouri are being subtyped, and no unusual signals have been seen from Missouri syndromic surveillance.Feds double doses for national stockpileAt today’s briefing, David Boucher, PhD, director of infectious disease preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's)Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), said the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has given $72 million in new awards to three vaccine companies to produce H5N1 vaccine. The awards cover more fill-and-finish activities, the production of additional bulk antigen, and maintenance of vaccine seed stocks.The companies include CSL Seqirus, which makes a cell-based vaccine, and Sanofi and GSK, which make egg-based vaccine. Boucher said the overall H5N1 vaccine strategy, which includes mRNA vaccine development, is designed to pivot to new threats while leaning into other areas. Currently, H5N1 vaccination isn't recommended for any group. The new manufacturing agreements will double the amount of finished H5 vaccine in the strategic national stockpile to just over 10 million doses by the end of the first quarter of 2025, he said.On October 10, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory group will meet, partly to discuss the composition of H5 vaccines.Bulk milk sampling in CaliforniaAt today’s briefing, Eric Deeble, DVM, acting senior advisor for the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) H5N1 response, said bulk milk sampling has played a role in identifying all of California’s 56 H5N1 outbreaks so far.He said that though the B3.13 genotype had been confirmed in the California outbreaks, state officials are still investigating how the virus is spreading among the state’s Central Valley dairy farms. California officials had already requested a USDA epidemiologic strike team, which will be increased from three to five members.In California, agriculture officials are conducting weekly bulk milk samples at farms in a 10- kilometer (6.2-mile) radius around outbreak locations, he said. The strategy seems to have worked in Colorado, which has seen a dramatic reduction in outbreaks, even in the absence of a vaccine.In other developments on the animal health side, Deeble said the USDA today released an H5N1 research agenda, which is part of broader H5N1 research priorities unveiled today by the HHS.

Experts will discuss the risks, increases in cases, and what we can do to protect ourselves.Globally and domestically, infectious diseases are on the rise. This summer, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency. Earlier this year in the U.S., H5N1 bird flu spread from cows to dairy farm workers, and recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a case in which the virus was contracted by a human without known animal exposure. As we transition from summer to fall, cases of parvovirus B19 and seasonal influenza continue to increase, with the fall flu season expected to arrive as early as October. Additionally, COVID-19 cases are anticipated to increase between November and January. The live briefing will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, October 2, via Zoom and will feature two experts from the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Kari Debbink, PhD, and Andrew Pekosz, PhD, will discuss:Predictions for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases, especially in vulnerable groups.Influenza vaccine efficacy and what can be learned from the influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere.Current COVID-19 vaccines, effectiveness, and when to get vaccinated.Insights into the recent summer COVID surge and expectations for winter.Mpox clades, U.S. status, and the global response to WHO's alert on Clade 1.Mpox vaccination recommendations for at-risk groups.Avian influenza in dairy cows, human cases, and dairy product pasteurization safety.The recent rise in Parvovirus B19 cases, symptoms, and transmission risks.Experts:Kari Debbink, PhD, is an associate teaching professor in the W. Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She studies viral evolution, how the structure of viral proteins impacts interactions with host cells and antibodies, and ways to improve microbiology education through research-based approaches.Andrew Pekosz, PhD, is a professor and vice chair of the W. Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He investigates the replication and disease potential of respiratory viruses, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other emerging viruses.Registration required: Media should register here by 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, October 1, to receive the Zoom link and password for Wednesday’s briefing.

New report reveals 'disappointing' dataAdrianna Rodriguez USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Vaccines Have Saved a Staggering 154 Million Lives in The Last 50 YearsVaccination has saved 154 million lives since 1974 when the World Health Organization launched its expanded global immunization program. Veuer’s Maria Mercedes Galuppo has the story.New flu data from the southern hemisphere suggests this year’s vaccine isn't as effective against severe illness as previous iterations, a finding that may not bode well for Americans as the nation kicks off flu season.Researchers tracked the vaccine’s effectiveness in five South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay – during their flu season from March to July.They found flu shots reduced the risk of hospitalizations by about 34%, according to the study published Thursday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Public health experts typically expect flu vaccines to reduce hospitalization risk by closer to 50%, said Dr. Kawsar Talaat, associate professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.“It’s a little bit disappointing,” she said. “This is on the lower end of what would be expected but not outside the range.”Back-to-school shots: Fewer kindergartners were vaccinated last year, CDC saysVaccines distributed in the U.S. target two influenza A strains – H1N1 and H3N2 – and a B-lineage, the same strains targeted by vaccines used in South America.A typical flu season occurs between April and September in the southern hemisphere and from October to May in the northern hemisphere. Public health experts often look at data from the southern hemisphere to gain insight into how Americans may experience the flu season.But they may not suffer a fate similar to their South American peers, Talaat said, because multiple variables determine the outcome of a flu season.One of the most important variables is the circulating strains. It remains to be seen if the strains that appeared in South America will be the same strains that circulate in the U.S.“It’s very early here... We’re not seeing a lot of flu, yet,” Talaat said. “We might have different virus (strains) and different proportions.”Vaccination coverage is also an important factor, she said. A high flu vaccination rate will prevent the virus from spreading and infecting people who are likely to become severely ill.Even if the strains targeted by the current U.S. flu shot don’t match the strains that appear in the northern hemisphere, studies have shown the vaccine will still provide some protection.The 2018-2019 influenza season is one such case.The vaccine’s effectiveness during that year was an abysmal 29%, according to the CDC. But a 2020 study found the shot still prevented an estimated 4.4 million infections, 58,000 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths in the U.S.Sanofi and CSL Seqirus, two of the nation’s largest flu vaccine manufacturers, conceded that the circulating virus strains could differ from those the World Health Organization recommended be included in this year’s flu vaccine. While trends from the southern hemisphere offer valuable insights, they don't always predict outcomes in the U.S., according to a spokesperson for CSL Seqirus.“This is a natural phenomenon linked to the unpredictability of the influenza epidemiology: the viruses can mutate as they move across populations and geographies,” said Thomas Grenier, Sanofi's head of vaccines in North America. "Vaccination remains the best preventative strategy for influenza."GSK, another large manufacturer of flu vaccine, did not respond on Friday to requests for comment.It’s still too early in the flu season to tell if this will be a “mismatch year,” but Talaat still urged eligible Americans to get their vaccinations.

That means, vaccinated people in those groups were 34.5% less likely than unvaccinated people to get sick enough to go to the hospital.Last year, the CDC's report had estimated vaccine effectiveness in South America was 51.9% against hospitalization among at-risk groups. A study by the same group looking at data from 2013 to 2017 estimated effectiveness was around 43% for fully vaccinated young children and 41% for older adults. These data come from a research network coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. The biggest drop in effectiveness this year may be the result of fewer cases from "A(H1N1)pdm09," a strain that has spread since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009. In the past, flu vaccines have usually performed better against H1N1 than H3N2.While H1N1 dominated nearly all infections last year in South America, this year the World Health Organization says there were more detections of the H3N2 subtype of flu.If the Northern Hemisphere sees similar patterns of flu virus strains, the study's authors wrote that "health authorities might anticipate similar levels of protection."A CDC spokesperson said that the effectiveness of the vaccine for H1N1 was "within the range" of previous seasons. "Overall, flu vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization by about one-third, which would have a significant impact on disease burden. Receiving a flu vaccine can offer significant protection against severe outcomes," David Daigle, the CDC spokesperson, said in an email. U.S. officials often look to Southern Hemisphere countries for a preview of how this year's flu season might fare, since their winter happens during the Northern Hemisphere's summer.The CDC said in August that the Southern Hemisphere's flu season this year had been "similar to previous flu seasons," but also flagged unusually high severe flu hospitalizations reported from Chile, Ecuador and Uruguay.

This will ensure vaccines are ready to distribute, if necessary.MORE: What you need to know about bird flu after person became infected in Texas"The actions taken today will improve the country's preparedness against novel influenza, including H5," said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness and response at HHS' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), on a call with reporters. "The ability to rapidly develop and distribute vaccines is essential in preparing for a public health emergency."The HHS said the company will manufacture additional influenzas antigen -- the component of vaccines that stimulates an immune response -- in bulk that is well-match to the strain of bird flu that are currently circulating.Health officials had previously filled nearly 5 million vaccines doses and expect the new funding to double the ready-to-use stockpile.Bill Powers checks on his flock of white turkeys, which have been kept under shelter all year to prevent exposure to avian influenza, at his family's farm in Townsend, Del., Nov. 14, 2022.Nathan Howard/Getty Images"We're still working through manufacturing schedules with our industry partners, but we do expect that we will have a total of just over 10 million doses filled and finished by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2025," Boucher said.Other companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, are continuing efforts to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine, which is the same technology used in the companies' respective COVID-19 vaccines.There have been 16 bird flu cases confirmed in the U.S. so far this year but the risk of bird flu to the general public remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Those working with potentially infected livestock are at higher risk and should take appropriate precautions."This announcement is an illustration of the work we do at [the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response] everyday to help the country prepare for and respond to disease outbreaks," Dawn O'Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, said in a statement. "These awards ensure the country has access to additional pandemic influenza vaccines should they be needed now or in the future."MORE: WHO acknowledges bird flu patient in Mexico died of other medical conditionsSanofi will also make sure it is prepared to manufacture an egg-based influenza vaccine, such as a vaccine for H5 influenza, which is a strain of bird flu, if needed."Although the risk to Americans from influenza A (H5) virus infection remains low, we're leaning forward with our preparedness efforts," Dr. Gary Disbrow, director and deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the HHS' Center for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA, said in a statement."As influenza A(H5) virus infections in domesticated animals continue to spread, the risk for human infection could rise. In an abundance of caution, we are taking steps to increase the amount of vaccine that could be immediately available if needed," the statement continued.Related TopicsBird FluVaccinationsPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsAvian Influenza: Pathogenesis, Management, and Host Dynamics | Frontiers Research Topic Skip to main content Frontiers in Microbiology Virology Research Topics Avian Influenza: Pathogenesis, Management, and Host Dynamics Avian Influenza: Pathogenesis, Management, and Host Dynamics Total Downloads Total Views and Downloads Participate in this topic Submit Overview Articles Authors Impact Views About this Research Topic Manuscript Summary Submission Deadline 31 December 2024 Manuscript Submission Deadline 30 April 2025 Guidelines Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) continue to pose remarkable threats to domestic and wild birds across the world. Traditionally confined to avian species, AIVs have shown an alarming trend of expanding their host range to include mammals, posing significant zoonotic threats. Recent reports of AIV infections in cattle highlight the virus's evolving adaptability and potential for cross-species transmission. Multiple virus, host, and ecological factors drive the host range expansion of AIVs. Mutations that facilitate viral adaptation to new hosts, the transmission dynamics between avian and mammalian species, and the interactions between viral proteins and host immune responses provide insights into the mechanisms underlying differential susceptibility of avian species and cross-species transmissions. The knowledge is crucial for informing surveillance strategies and risk assessments, preventing future outbreaks and mitigating the impact of AIVs on both animal and human health.This Research Topic aims to consolidate current knowledge and spur the understanding of the mechanism of differential pathogenicity across birds and mammals, development of innovative diagnostic approaches for avian influenza, improve vaccine design and efficacy, and assess the ecological impact on affected bird and mammal populations.To enhance our strategies against avian influenza, it is essential to delineate the current research landscape and pinpoint critical areas requiring further investigation. Our focus will be on both basic and applied research, examining virus behaviour in controlled laboratory settings as well as in natural environments. This comprehensive approach will help us understand virus mechanisms of transmission, adaptation, and pathogenicity, thereby informing the development of more effective prevention and control measures.

The Ministry of Health said in a statement that it was investigating to determine the origin of infection, and that those infected had been isolated for treatment. 26 cases have been confirmed, with six fatalities reported to date. Twenty cases are in isolation and receiving treatment, while 161 people who came into contact with the reported cases have so far been identified and are being monitored. Cases of the virus have been reported in seven of the country’s 30 districts. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Saturday affirmed a scaling up of support to government of Rwanda in response to the outbreak. WHO, Reuters, Barron’s, The New Times The Global H5N1 Influenza Panzootic in Mammals Two decades after H5N1 “bird flu” became established in poultry in Southeast Asia, its descendants have resurged, setting off an H5N1 panzootic in wild birds that is fueled by rapid intercontinental spread, fast evolution via genomic reassortment, and frequent spillover into terrestrial and marine mammals. The virus has sustained mammal-to-mammal transmission in multiple settings, including European fur farms, South American marine mammals, and US dairy cattle, raising questions about whether humans are next. Historically, swine are considered optimal intermediary hosts that help avian influenza viruses (AIV) adapt to mammals before jumping to humans. However, the altered ecology of H5N1 has opened the door to new evolutionary pathways. Could dairy cattle, farmed mink, or South American sea lions serve as new mammalian gateways to humans? Nature Public Health Emergency Status Declared for Southeast States Hit by Hurricane Helene U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra declared Public Health Emergency (PHE) status for Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina this week to address the health impacts of Hurricane Helene. HHS/ASPR has pre-positioned approximately 200 medical providers and disaster management professionals in Florida, Alabama, with additional personnel in route to North Carolina. ASPR’s deployed personnel include multiple Health Care Situational Assessment Teams (HCSAT) who stand ready to assess the storm’s impacts to hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis centers, and other health care facilities and four Health and Medical Task Forces and one Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) from the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) for rapid response following assessment findings. HHS POLICY + GOVERNMENT WHO Report on the Responsible Use of the Life Sciences and Dual-Use Research The WHO Technical Advisory Group on the Responsible Use of the Life Sciences and Dual-Use Research (TAG-RULS DUR) was established to provide independent advice to WHO on the monitoring and mitigation of biorisks, the advances in the life sciences and related technologies, the governance of dual-use research and the responsible use of the life sciences. This new report summarizes discussions from the first meeting of the group that took place in April. WHO NTI | bio Briefs Capitol Hill on Innovative Solutions to Biotechnology Risks NTI | bio and the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation (CACNP) hosted a September 17 Congressional staff briefing on “Preventing Biological Catastrophe and Protecting the U.S. Bioeconomy.” The event, which explored opportunities for Congress and the White House to mitigate the risks, featured a panel discussion on safeguarding evolving capabilities that arise from the combination of artificial intelligence with biotechnology and providing oversight of dual-use life science research of concern. NTI MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES US to Donate 1 Million Mpox Vaccine Doses to Halt Outbreak in Africa U.S. President Joe Biden announced 24 Sep the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak. Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic’s vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak. Reuters CSL Seqirus Picks Up $121M BARDA Contract For Bird Flu Pandemic Preparedness Vaccine maker CSL Seqirus has lined up yet another contract with the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to help with avian influenza preparedness, this one worth $121.4 million to boost supplies of the company’s MF59 adjuvant, used in some influenza vaccines to strengthen the body’s immune response. Fierce Pharma 2025 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season Vaccine Composition The World Health Organization (WHO) this week announced recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025 influenza season in the southern hemisphere. The announcement was made at an information session after a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines. WHO BIOSECURITY + BIOPREPAREDNESS The Complexities of Bioterrorism: Challenges and Considerations The COVID-19 case study serves as a stark example of how a biological agent can disrupt the world on a massive scale. The research will delve into the pandemic’s impact on Pakistan and beyond, exploring areas like tourism, public health, education, and the spread of misinformation. By analyzing the effects of COVID-19, this research aims to prepare for potential future bioterror attacks. Understanding how novel viruses or bacteria can spread and cause devastation is vital to developing effective prevention and response strategies. International Journal of Contemporary Issues in Social Sciences Infection Control and Outbreak Preparedness When the Virus is Loose “We often think of preparedness as stuff, having access to the right gear and material. Especially thinking back to the pandemic, everyone might remember the lack of face masks and other problems with PPE. And that’s obviously important. But preparedness is more than having the right things in stock. Not least, we need to have staff who can work and who have the right skills.” Karolinska Institute MIDRP Focuses on Mitigating Disease Impacts in Large-Scale Combat Operations Prolonged care, degraded MEDEVAC capability and overstretched lines of communication during large-scale combat operations could increase the prevalence of disease-related injury and death among Warfighters, risks that the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command’s Military Infectious Diseases Research Program (MIDRP) is working hard to mitigate. U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command SELECT AGENTS + PRIORITY PATHOGENS Virulence of Burkholderia pseudomallei ATS2021 Unintentionally Imported to United States in Aromatherapy Spray In the United States in 2021, an outbreak of 4 cases of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiologic agent of melioidosis and a Tier One Select Agent, resulted in 2 deaths. By using mouse melioidosis models, researchers determined median lethal dose estimates of the strain and analyzed the bacteriologic and histopathologic characteristics of the organism. Emerging Infectious Diseases Mpox May Trigger Large Outbreak in One of Africa’s Biggest Cities Mpox for the first time appears to be making serious inroads in Kinshasa, the capital city of 17 million people in the country hardest hit by the disease, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A recent sharp uptick in suspected mpox cases in the capital—including some from a viral strain that has spread widely through sexual contact elsewhere—could portend a larger outbreak. Although many mpox cases in Africa go unreported, Kinshasa had largely been spared until now. Science Co-circulation of Monkeypox Virus Subclades Ia and Ib in Kinshasa Province The geographic range of Clade I, and predominantly subclade Ib within, is currently expanding, with cases reported in countries historically non-endemic for mpox, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Characterization of complete MPXV genome sequences derived from mpox cases in Kinshasa, the capital city of the DRC, reveals co-circulation MPXV strains of subclades Ia and Ib in one health zone of the city. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses suggest multiple introductions of both subclades in the city. Eurosurveillance Surge in Oropouche Fever: The Tip of the Iceberg in a New Public Health Challenge in Brazil The number of cases Oropouche virus in Brazil has surpassed 7930 by August, 2024, which is already ten-fold of 773 cases reported throughout 2023. Miscarriages and fetal malformations have now been linked to the virus, and for the first time, two deaths with a direct correlation to the viral infection have been confirmed (in two young women without comorbidities). The absence of specific diagnostic tests and nascent genomic surveillance for acute febrile illnesses further underscore the need for renewed efforts concentrated in these two areas. The Lancet Microbe, Infectious Diseases Protect the Prosciutto: Italy Battles Swine Fever Pig farmer Alberto Cavagnini has slaughtered 1,600 of his hogs due to swine fever, a virus threatening the 20-billion-euro pork industry in Italy, including its world-famous prosciutto. The disease, which is fatal for pigs and disastrous for the economy, has particularly affected the northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Liguria—and its spread is spooking neighbor France. Italy recorded cases of the virus in just under 25,000 pigs in 50 farms, and in nearly 2,500 wild boars, between January 2022 and September this year, official figures show. Phys.org Addressing the Ripple Effect of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Pakistan This communication emphasizes the urgent need to curtail the annual outbreaks in the country and prevent further CCHF cases and associated mortality. Key measures include annual or biannual screenings of individuals, particularly in rural communities where the majority of cases occur. A surveillance system or local database should be established by the health district in order to maintain official records of cases and other statistics related to CCHF, which will aid in the early detection and prevention of future outbreaks. Sentinel surveillance should be included in the curriculum of all undergraduate programs that offer community medicine and health courses. Infectious Diseases & Clinical Microbiology AVIAN INFLUENZA CDC A(H5N1) Bird Flu Response Update Since April 2024, 14 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have been reported in the United States. Four of these cases were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows and nine were associated with exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus-infected poultry. The source of the exposure in the most recent case, which was reported by Missouri on September 6, has not been determined. CDC Missouri Human H5 Flu Case Health Care Worker Contact Monitoring To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1). Missouri identified two health care workers who were exposed to the hospitalized case before droplet precautions were instituted and subsequently developed mild respiratory symptoms (among 18 workers with this higher risk exposure); one tested negative for influenza by PCR, as previously reported, and the second provided a blood specimen for testing by CDC for potential influenza A(H5N1) antibodies. Missouri has since identified four additional health care workers who later developed mild respiratory symptoms. One of these workers was in the higher risk category and provided a blood specimen for H5 antibody testing. Three of these workers are among 94 workers who were exposed to the hospitalized case of avian influenza A(H5) after droplet precautions were instituted (i.e., lower risk exposure); blood specimens for those who became symptomatic have been collected for H5 antibody testing at CDC. Aside from the one health care worker reported to have tested negative for influenza by PCR, the five remaining exposed health care workers had only mild symptoms and were not tested by PCR for respiratory infections. PCR testing would have been unreliable at the time of discovery of these individuals’ prior symptoms. CDC Case Study of the First HPAI Outbreak in the Subantarctic Region Documented the detection, monitoring, and impact of the first known outbreak of H5N1 HPAI in the subantarctic region, at Bird Island in South Georgia. Deaths from HPAI were first suspected in September 2023 and later confirmed by genetic analysis (in several species including Gentoo penguins, Snowy Albatrosses, Antarctic Fur Seals and Brown Skuas. Bird Study Thermal Inactivation Spectrum of Influenza A H5N1 Virus in Raw Milk The spillover of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus to dairy cows and shedding of high amounts of infectious virus in milk raised public health concerns. Here, researchers evaluated the decay and thermal stability spectrum of HPAI H5N1 virus in raw milk, and heat virus positive milk following different thermal conditions including pasteurization and thermization.

MedComm SURVEILLANCE + DETECTION BARDA-Supported Rapid COVID-19 Test Receives FDA Clearance Developed with BARDA support, the SCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Test from partner InBios International recently received FDA 510(k) clearance and a CLIA waiver. The point-of-care lateral flow test qualitatively detects the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in nasal swab samples from patients with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. BARDA has previously partnered with InBios to develop other diagnostics for Zika virus, anthrax, and COVID-19. Medical Countermeasures Malaria Rapid Tests, Febrile Illness Management, and Child Mortality Across Sub-Saharan African Countries Increasing distribution of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria was associated with increased blood testing, use of antimalarial drugs, and antibiotic use and modestly improved child survival. The greatest benefits occurred in areas with a high prevalence of malaria. JAMA Shining Light on Biosensors: Chemiluminescence and Bioluminescence in Enabling Technologies The integration of chemiluminescence (CL) and bioluminescence (BL) into point-of-care devices has found applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. This review highlights recent advancements in both CL and BL technologies, mainly focusing on their implications in biosensor development. TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry Cross-Priming Amplification for Point-of-Care Detection of Tuberculosis Cross-Priming Amplification (CPA) technology has been shown to rapidly and effectively detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum samples under isothermal conditions. Currently, POCT testing for Mtb in sputum specimens based on CPA technology, like many NAATs, still requires several manual steps for sputum processing. Another bottleneck is the that infectious and viscous sputum specimens used for tuberculosis diagnosis require complex and labor-intensive sample preparation steps. This study directly applied high concentrations of guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) to liquefy highly viscous sputum specimens, evaluating the effectiveness of GTC in liquefying sputum and inactivating Mtb in viscous sputum specimens. The aim was to simplify sputum sample preparation steps, enabling Mtb nucleic acid testing to be conducted without a BSL-2 laboratory, and to achieve POC testing for Mtb and non-tuberculosis mycobacteria using CPA technology on portable devices. Heliyon A Comprehensive Approach to Assessment of the Tuberculosis Infection Screening Strategy Cost-Effectiveness Given that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains in a low replicative state during TBI, no reliable tool for the direct detection of bacteria is currently available. Instead, an indirect evaluation of infection based on measuring the Mtb-specific immune response is applied using tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs). IGRA assays approved by the World Health Organization include QIAGEN QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, Oxford Immunotec T-SPOT.TB, and Beijing Wantai’s TB-IGRA. In 2022, newer Mtb antigen-based skin tests (TBSTs) based on the detection of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antigens have also been approved by the WHO. Clinical Microbiology and Infection INFECTIOUS DISEASES Elevated Noroviruses Activity in Europe and the United States During the 2023/24 norovirus season (July 2023 to June 2024), elevated norovirus activity with an increase of GII.17 noroviruses was reported in at least six European countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and England. A similar trend was observed in the United States (US), where the proportion of GII.17 outbreaks exceeded the number of GII.4 outbreaks. Findings aim to raise awareness about an increase of the number of GII.17 norovirus infections. Eurosurveillance As Concerns About Respiratory Diseases Among Public Drop to New Lows, US Health Officials Urge Vaccination Following a summer wave of COVID-19 activity and a record number of reported influenza (flu) deaths among US children during the 2023-2024 respiratory season, new survey results released by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) show that few US adults intend to get vaccinated against flu, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or pneumococcal disease this fall and winter, citing concerns about vaccine side effects and a general distrust of vaccines. “Last flu season, an estimated 25,000 people in the US died from flu or related complications and 75,000 from COVID-19 in 2023, demonstrating how dangerous these diseases can be,” said CDC Director Mandy K. Cohen, MD, MPH. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases Study on Effectiveness of Pneumococcal Vaccination Strategies Comparative effectiveness of PCV13 and PPSV23 and their combinations for adults in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) using population-based data from the Veterans Health Administration. In multivariate analysis adjusted for comorbidities of a large cohort, the combination of PCV13 and PPSV23, particularly PCV13 followed by PPSV23, was associated with a lower risk of IPD, indicating additional benefits in combined vaccinations with potential importance in vaccination order. Clinical Microbiology and Infection Co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Victoria Lineage Viruses with Further Genetic Diversification in the 2022/23 Influenza Season Influenza virus surveillance data provide an important mechanism for monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses over the season and provide crucial data for the vaccine composition decision which led to the change of the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the NH 2023/24 influenza season. Efforts in standardizing the selection of specimens for sequencing and antigenic characterization across the countries could improve results and therefore future efforts should be made to improve randomness or representativeness of the sequences to improve quality of virological influenza surveillance data to inform the epidemiological picture and vaccine composition. Eurosurveillance Unprecedented Dengue Outbreak in Los Angeles Signals Infection Tipping Point Dengue cases have been identified in Los Angeles in the sprawling city’s first outbreak of the disease with no ties to international travel. Local health officials have described the outbreak as “unprecedented” in the area, where dengue has not been transmitted by mosquitoes before. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported three cases to date in Baldwin Park, just a 30 minute drive from Hollywood. “Local dengue cases in LA are the canary in the coalmine indicating that this has truly come. Once Aedes have expanded their range, there’s no turning back.” The Telegraph ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE CRISIS Better Late Than Never: Addressing Antibiotic Pollution On Sept 3, WHO published Guidance on wastewater and solid waste management for manufacturing of antibiotics, its first such document on antibiotic pollution by manufacturers. This guidance is advisory and so does not compel manufacturers to meet its standards, but it is nonetheless a coherent text that can underpin regulations used by bodies that do have statutory power. However, responsible manufacturers will be motivated to pre-empt future regulations by ensuring that they meet the WHO standards.

Nature Machine Intelligence SPECIAL INTEREST A Decade Later, Nebraska Biocontainment Unit’s First Ebola Patient Returns for Emotional Reunion 10 years ago, medical missionary Dr. Rick Sacra high-fived his way out of Nebraska Medicine’s bio-containment unit after being treated for Ebola. The doctor who led the CDC’s clinical Ebola response team says there’s lasting impact from the hospital’s work caring for Ebola patients a decade ago. “This really contributed to optimizing supportive care of patients with Ebola everywhere,” said Tim Uyeki, who now is the CDC’s chief medical officer for the Influenza Division. Sacra remembers his three weeks in Omaha well, and not just because of how sick he was. “They just went above and beyond,” Sacra said of the unit’s care team. “You gave me my life back.” KETV Omaha, WOWT News Tips to Localize News About National Infectious Disease Outbreaks One of the challenges of covering infectious diseases is people are often burned out hearing about COVID-19 or flu — or the biggest news is an outbreak that’s not geographically relevant to most of them. But even when a disease feels, or literally is, distant from the region you cover, you can localize the news and inform readers, viewers and listeners about what they need to know. Health Journalism Mpox in the DRC: Working at the Outbreak Epicentre Agnese Comelli, who leads the mpox response team of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Goma, where concerns are heightened by hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people taking refuge in displacement sites from the ongoing conflict in North Kivu, outlines a typical day in the field.

La Jolla Institute for Immunology Celebrating Public Health Spectacular breakthroughs in science can’t benefit people without translation to populations. To quote Paul Farmer, “In an age of explosive development in the realm of medical technology, it is unnerving to find that the discoveries of Salk, Sabin, and even Pasteur remain irrelevant to much of humanity.” In the United States, public health leaders have been vilified and front-line workers have been threatened since the beginning of the Covid-19 epidemic. During each Ebola outbreak, public health workers have faced suspicion and attacks. And community health personnel providing polio vaccines continue to be killed in places such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. In this sense, there may never have been a more difficult time in public health. So let’s take this opportunity to celebrate the thousands of people who, working together, are trying to bring better health to our communities.

Six health care workers in the state developed mild respiratory symptoms after caring for a somewhat high-profile patient—the first person to have caught bird flu despite having no known contact with infected animals. The fear was that the virus could be spreading from person to person.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize that so far only the original patient has tested positive for bird flu, however; one of the workers has tested negative for the virus, while the others were not tested and have provided blood samples for further analysis.This kind of bird flu is caused by the H5N1 virus, one of many subtypes of influenza A, the most common type of flu virus known to infect people. H5N1 has circulated in birds and some other animal populations for years but has only occasionally caused small outbreaks in humans. The concern is that this could change. H5N1 is constantly evolving and might be getting better at transmitting between humans. Since the vast majority of people have no immunity to this particular flu virus, some worry that it could cause the next pandemic.“So far, it doesn’t seem like it’s widespread in humans,” says Gabrielle Scher, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. “On the chance that [that changes], we need to be ready.”Scher and her colleagues are working on messenger RNA vaccines for bird flu. A revelation during the Covid-19 pandemic, mRNA jabs can be manufactured very quickly, which is useful in a pandemic scenario. They work by depositing short pieces of RNA—molecules that carry genetic information—into your body. These snippets of genetic code prompt your immune system to replicate—for example—part of a virus encoded by that mRNA and then learn how to fight it off. With the Covid vaccines, those instructions targeted a key part of the coronavirus’ outer structure, the spike protein.Scher has seen for herself what happens when an mRNA bird flu vaccine is put to work. She has watched a lab instrument detect tiny amounts of fluorescence as antibodies in blood from vaccinated mice bind to H5N1 proteins—like tiny countermeasures neutralizing an incoming missile. She and her colleagues published the results of their work on an H5N1 vaccine tested in animals earlier this year and are now working toward human trials.Most PopularSecurityThe AI Machine Gun of the Future Is Already HereBy Jared KellerCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranScientists have been developing mRNA influenza vaccines since before the pandemic. Drug companies such as Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK are working on mRNA jabs that would target various different flu strains responsible for regular seasonal outbreaks; all three are also separately developing bird flu vaccines.But clinical trials have yielded some mixed results. Last year, Moderna reported that a trial of one of its mRNA flu vaccines showed good results against strains of influenza A but insufficient efficacy against strains of influenza B, the second most common type of flu. Pfizer has had similar problems, according to brief reports about one of its mRNA flu vaccines that emerged in August; a spokesperson says the company is analyzing the full data from the study. GSK has also grappled with efficacy against influenza B but last month reported improved success of its mRNA flu candidate against B strains, following adjustments.It isn’t necessarily obvious what part of a flu virus any potential mRNA vaccine should aim for. “You need to make sure you’re targeting the right part of the virus,” says Scher. With Covid-19, the prominent spike protein fit the bill. But influenza viruses are arguably more complicated and mutate more quickly, meaning that if you pick the wrong protein, your jab could prove less effective than hoped. The flip side, Scher suggests, is that mRNA vaccines could make it possible to target multiple proteins or parts of proteins on the same virus—a multipronged strategy.And while they’re tricky to develop, the speed with which mRNA vaccines can be produced could be hugely beneficial. Traditionally, flu vaccines contain inactivated viruses that are grown in hens’ eggs. This works reasonably well, but it takes a long time to make such jabs, which means health authorities have to publish their predictions about which strains of flu will be circulating during the upcoming winter well in advance. If you could manufacture vaccines more quickly, you could make more accurate predictions nearer to flu season.Not only that, researchers hope that a single mRNA shot could one day target 20 or more strains of flu at once, relieving the need for some of this guesswork. Scher’s colleagues are working on such a “universal” flu vaccine.Most PopularSecurityThe AI Machine Gun of the Future Is Already HereBy Jared KellerCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranWith clinical trials ongoing, it’s still early days. Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester, has watched reports about emerging mRNA flu jabs with interest but says that questions remain. “We don’t yet know how long-lasting the immunity they produce is,” she says.Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, concurs, though he notes that all flu jabs, regardless of how they are made, have a waning immunity problem—your protection could decline by around 10 percent every month following injection.A concern specific to mRNA vaccines is that they tend to cost more than traditional flu vaccines and must be kept refrigerated, which may make them difficult to roll out in areas with poor infrastructure. Researchers are also concerned that they may meet with more vaccine hesitancy. “The mRNA vaccine platform, per se, is probably the one that seems to get the most misinformation,” notes Cruickshank. “That could be a disadvantage.”A new wave of mRNA flu vaccines could be particularly impactful for older patients, says Jenna Bartley, an assistant professor at UConn Health, a health research center and hospital. Older people are among the most at risk from flu, but current vaccines are less effective in higher age groups, as their immune response tends to be weaker. mRNA Covid-19 jabs, however, have proven effective in older people as well as younger people.It may be some time before mRNA jabs are available for seasonal flu. However, if H5N1 starts infecting a lot more people, and especially if we find that it is transmitting frequently between humans, there’s a chance that an mRNA bird flu vaccine could be the first such jab rolled out on a wide scale. US health officials have said that an mRNA H5N1 vaccine could be made available within weeks, if required.Osterholm agrees that such a timeframe is realistic. The real challenge, he points out, would be getting any new H5N1 vaccine to the people who most need it. Covid-19 jabs emerged in wealthy countries and were delivered to people very quickly, he says, but “for much of the world, that wasn’t the case at all.”You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gearA bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmareThe Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girlI made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meetEvent: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoTopicssciencehealthvaccinesflubird fluinfectious diseaseRead MoreA Neuralink Rival Says Its Eye Implant Restored Vision in Blind PeopleScience Corporation's retinal implant allowed some people who lost their central vision to read, play cards, and recognize faces.Emily MullinAfter Hurricane Milton, Get Ready for MoldThousands may now be at risk of mold-related illnesses following this year's hurricanes in the American South.Emily MullinCells From Different Species Can Exchange ‘Text Messages’ Using RNALong known as a messenger within cells, RNA is increasingly seen as life’s molecular communication system—even between organisms widely separated by evolution.Annie MelchorThe US Has a Cloned Sheep Contraband ProblemAfter a Montana man illegally cloned and bred an endangered giant sheep species, government agencies must now contend with the illicit offspring.Matt ReynoldsRFK Jr. Wants to Reshape US Health Policy.

Data from South America hints that's this year's flu shot should lower high-risk groups' chance of hospitalization. (Image credit: Iparraguirre Recio via Getty Images) This year's flu shot lowers the chance of being hospitalized for flu by 35% among high-risk groups, data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests.The new data, published Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), was pulled from five South American countries.The Southern Hemisphere's flu season typically runs between April and September, while the Northern Hemisphere's runs from about October to May. Because of this alternating timing, the Northern Hemisphere looks to Southern Hemisphere data to see which strains of flu virus are circulating, to plan the design of flu shots for the upcoming season, and to determine how well those vaccines will likely work.In the new MMWR, researchers looked at the flu shot's effectiveness in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. The report focuses on people at high risk of severe flu infections, including young children, older adults and people with conditions such as chronic lung disease, liver disorders, heart disease or immune-system problems.Related: Flu shots have changed this year — here's whyBetween mid-March and mid-July, these five countries reported that more than 11,700 people in these groups were hospitalized with severe respiratory illnesses. Of these, about 3,850 tested positive for the flu, with the vast majority testing positive for an influenza A virus. (Influenza A and influenza B are the two broad groups of flu viruses that circulate seasonally, and in the study, two subtypes of influenza A stood out as dominant: H3N2, followed by H1N1.)The remaining 7,850 or so people in the study tested negative for both flu and COVID-19, and they acted as a point of comparison for the analysis. About 23% of these patients had been vaccinated for the flu, compared with only 18% of the group that ended up hospitalized for the viral infection.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Crunching the numbers, the researchers found that the vaccine likely lowered the risk of flu hospitalization by 34.5%. Breaking it down further, the shot lowered the risk of hospitalization by nearly 59% among adults with medical conditions, 39% for young children and 31% for older adults."While only one in five [severe acute respiratory infection] patients had received the 2024 influenza vaccine, those who were vaccinated were at significantly lower risk for hospitalization from any influenza virus infection," the study's authors concluded. These data suggest the flu shot was "effective in preventing approximately one third of influenza-related hospitalizations among groups prioritized for vaccination."RELATED STORIES—Why is the flu shot less effective than other vaccines?—At-home flu vaccine approved by FDA — what to know—Could we ever eradicate the flu?Trends in the Southern Hemisphere's flu season don't always accurately predict what will happen in the Northern Hemisphere. However, assuming the same flu virus strains circulate in the upcoming months, "health authorities might anticipate similar levels of protection from the 2024-25 vaccine," the authors wrote.With a few exceptions, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get the annual flu vaccine. Additional measures, such as regular handwashing, can help reduce the spread of flu. For those who do catch the flu, getting antiviral treatments, such as Tamiflu, as soon as possible can significantly reduce the risk of flu-related complications.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Because of this, it is possible to get a negative result even though you are infected. Known as a false negative, this can happen for several reasons, including when you picked up the virus and the type of flu you have. Of course, you should also always consider the possibility that your flu-like symptoms aren't actually due to the flu and that you're testing negative because you have something else, like COVID-19. This article goes over what it means if you get a negative rapid flu test and what to do if you think the result may be wrong.

A benefit of the tests is that the results are ready in as little as 15 minutes; other flu tests take time because they must be sent to a lab. While they're faster, rapid tests are not as accurate. Factors that can affect the outcome of a rapid flu test include: How long you've been sick: Tests are the most accurate when the specimens are collected within three to four days of when a person's symptoms started because that's when the flu virus sheds the most.How the sample was collected: Each flu test has rules for collecting a specimen—for example, some have to be taken from the nose and others from the throat. These instructions must be followed to ensure the test is accurate.The type of influenza: Rapid flu tests are better at detecting influenza A than influenza B.Current flu activity: False negatives are more likely to happen when flu activity is high, but can happen at any time. False positives (results that indicate you have the flu when you really don't) are more common when flu activity is low. Rapid flu tests are a tool for providers, but results are not the only thing that matters in making a flu diagnosis. Your provider will consider all of these factors when reviewing your results to decide whether you could have the flu and need treatment. False Negative You have the flu, but the test did not detect it More common when community flu rates are high False Positive The test detected the flu, but you do not really have it More common when community flu rates are low Your Influenza Treatment Options Other Possibilities If You're Truly Negative If your rapid test comes back negative and it's accurate, you do not have influenza. There are several different viruses that can cause flu-like illness and produce symptoms that are more severe than a common cold. Some possibilities include: Adenovirus COVID-19 (coronavirus) Parainfluenza Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) These viruses can leave you feeling very sick for a few days or even a week, and may pose a threat to people at higher risk. Flu-Like Symptoms and Their Causes Treatment of Presumed Positive Cases If your flu test is negative but you have classic flu symptoms, your healthcare provider may test you for other respiratory viruses. Also, they may use a confirmatory test (RT-PCR) when flu activity is high in your area but the test is negative. However, if flu activity is high where you live, your provider may still diagnose you with the flu and and prescribe an antiviral drug, such as Tamiflu (oseltamivir), Relenza (zanamivir), Rapivab (peramivir), and Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil). For most people, taking antivirals without a confirmed case of the flu is not as big of a risk as not treating influenza. When they're started within the first 48 hours of getting flu symptoms, antivirals have been shown to lessen the severity of symptoms, shorten the duration of illness by about one day, and reduce the risk of flu complications. If your symptoms do not improve with antiviral treatment, you probably did not have the flu after all. In that case, you might need different treatment. However, many over-the-counter (OTC) medications for symptom relief work for many different flu-like illnesses. CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance If you are sick with a respiratory virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you:Isolate at home until you've been fever-free for 24 hours (without taking fever-reducing medication) AND your symptoms are mild and improving.Take additional precautions for five days following isolation, such as wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance from others, and washing your hands often. People at High Risk for Flu Complications Do I Need to Get Retested? Some providers won't do rapid flu tests because of the limited accuracy. Instead, they'll treat you based on your symptoms. However, additional flu tests can be helpful in some situations, especially if your provider thinks your flu test was a false negative. For example, retesting is helpful for pregnant people and people who are immunocompromised or live with someone who is. In these cases, confirming a flu diagnosis helps providers make the right treatment decisions. More accurate flu tests can be done by special labs, but they are rarely used to make a flu diagnosis in the general population aside from confirming the cause of a new respiratory illness outbreak. When these tests are done, the results usually get sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to keep tabs on circulating flu strains and the rate of flu activity throughout the country. Summary If you have flu symptoms but a rapid flu test is negative, you may truly have another illness (like COVID-19 or RSV) and not the flu. However, these tests are not always accurate and there are several factors that affect the results. You may get a false negative result, which means you do have the flu but the test didn't pick it up. Regardless of your test results, if you have symptoms of a respiratory virus, it's important to take certain precautions to avoid spreading it to others. If your provider thinks you have the flu based on your symptoms and the level of flu activity in your community, they will probably treat you without a flu test or even with a negative test.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Vaccines for the 2024-2025 flu season do not contain the "Yamagata lineage" of influenza because this branch of the flu virus family tree hasn't been detected since 2020. (Image credit: A boy and the sea via Getty Images) For more than a decade, the annual flu shot has protected against four types of the influenza virus — but this year, that has changed.In the United States, vaccines for the 2024-2025 flu season provide protection against only three subtypes of influenza: two influenza A viruses, called H1N1 and H3N2; and one influenza B virus, known as the "Victoria lineage." A fourth kind of flu virus — the "Yamagata lineage" — has been dropped from the formulation. This will be the first time since 2012 that U.S. flu vaccines have been trivalent, meaning three-component, as opposed to quadrivalent, or four-component.But why the change?Based on all available evidence, the Yamagata lineage is now extinct. So, in March 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that this year's flu vaccines would not include that subtype of virus, because it hasn't sickened anyone in years. We know this because there is a global consortium of scientists that regularly isolates flu viruses from sick patients and then analyzes the viruses' genetic material.Related: At-home flu vaccine approved by FDA — what to knowThe FDA made this decision following recommendations from its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, and shortly after, the World Health Organization issued the same recommendation on a global scale. However, it may take time for global manufacturers to switch to the new formula, STAT News reported.Flu vaccines are designed to protect people against the most common subtypes of influenza that sicken people each season. Within those subtypes, scientists predict which strains are most likely to circulate in the upcoming flu season by tracking infections in the opposite hemisphere, since the Northern and Southern hemispheres' flu seasons alternate.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Flu shots work by priming the immune system to make antibodies that are ready to attack the selected flu strains if a vaccinated person is exposed.Scientists reported early hints that the Yamagata lineage had gone extinct in 2021, when they started to notice that no one in the world was getting sick with that subtype of flu. The most likely explanation, experts speculated at the time, is that Yamagata disappeared due to public health measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Early in the pandemic, many people were masking, social distancing and staying at home when they were sick, which had a knock-on effect of curtailing other respiratory infections, like the flu.From 2013 until the 2023-2024 flu season, all flu vaccines in the U.S. were quadrivalent, meaning they provided protection against four subtypes of the influenza virus. (Image credit: Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images / Contributor via Getty Images)Of the influenza B viruses, Yamagata probably took the hit because it was circulating at much lower levels than Victoria before the pandemic began, Kevin McCarthy, an assistant professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of Pittsburgh, told Live Science. Yamagata also might be inherently more vulnerable to extinction than other subtypes of the virus, he suggested. It has a comparatively poor ability to infect large numbers of people at once.Because no one's been spotted with a Yamagata infection since March 2020, it makes sense to drop Yamagata from future flu vaccines."There's really no reason to include the strain if you're not expecting people to actually be exposed to it and get infected," Hanover Matz, a postdoctoral research associate at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, told Live Science.With Yamagata out of the equation, manufacturers might be able to make more doses of the flu vaccine, CNN reported in March. Plus, they wouldn't need to cultivate as many viruses in the lab, so the change could cut down on the potential risks associated with this production step. Currently, many flu vaccines require scientists to grow flu viruses in eggs or cells, which introduces a very tiny risk that the viruses may escape; scientists follow strict safety protocols to avoid such accidents.RELATED STORIES—Source of person's recent bird flu case remains a mystery — and experts say that's concerning—Scientists find secret 'back door' flu viruses use to enter cells—4th person catches bird flu from cows, this time in ColoradoImportantly, dropping Yamagata won't lower the effectiveness of future flu shots, because the vaccines are designed to provide protection only against the strains of the virus they contain, McCarthy said. Thus, removing Yamagata won't influence how well the vaccines work against H1N1 or the Victoria lineage.Public health officials will continue to monitor for any traces of the Yamagata lineage, despite evidence of its extinction. If Yamagata were to return, scientists could just make the vaccine quadrivalent again, McCarthy said.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.

Here's how to avoid it.Despite a number of farm workers catching bird flu across the U.S., experts say there's low risk to the general public with a few exceptions.Federal officials plan to double the stockpile of emergency bird flu vaccines as they identify more people infected with the disease.Three manufacturers were awarded $72 million to increase pandemic preparedness including against avian influenza, officials announced in a Friday morning briefing. The funding is expected to bring the country's stockpile to 10 million doses by next spring, according to David Boucher, an infectious disease preparedness director at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. prepared the first 4.8 million doses this summer, though officials have not used them.Officials this year have identified 16 people infected with H5N1 avian influenza. All have had mild symptoms. There has been no human-to-human spread of the virus. If that happened, public health authorities would likely change their assessment about putting the vaccines to use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasized that despite the human cases, the risk to the general public remains low.The latest $72 million in funding will be awarded to three companies: CSL Seqirus, which produced the first round of doses, and to Sanofi and GSK. The three companies would fill and finish doses of influenza vaccines from bulk storage into ready-to-use vials or pre-filled syringes to ensure the vaccines are ready for distribution if needed. The companies will also manufacture the components for vaccines against circulating influenza strains, and Sanofi plans to keep a stable egg supply on hand for future production of the egg-based vaccine.As more herds infected, more dairy workers getting sickThe new funding was announced after officials identified two new bird flu cases in California dairy workers on Thursday. Several dairy herds in the state have been infected since officials first identified the virus circulating among cows in August. Federal officials said 56 herds were infected as of Thursday. The two workers at separate Central Valley farms had been in contact with infected animals. Both developed eye redness, a common symptom among people infected this year. Six of the country’s 16 bird flu cases have been among dairy workers, and nine were poultry workers in Colorado.On Saturday, the California Department of Public Health said a third person is suspected of contracting bird flu pending CDC specimen testing. All three cases involve people in contact with infected cows at different Central Valley dairy farms. None of the people infected have been hospitalized.“As there are more herds that test positive, there are more workers who are exposed,” Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at CDC, told reporters. “And when there are more workers who are exposed, the chances of human infection increase.”Another person was recently infected in Missouri with no known source of transmission. The CDC is testing blood samples for nearby contacts, including several health workers and another person in the same household. Those results are forthcoming.In the meantime, the CDC is distributing seasonal flu vaccines – which don’t prevent bird flu infection – to farm workers, Shah said. The goal is to reduce the risk of seasonal flu among workers who are at greater risk of catching bird flu from sick livestock. They fear that cross-reaction of bird flu and seasonal flu in the body may cause bird flu to mutate to spread easier or cause more serious disease.Quarantine, test milk for bird fluDr. Eric Deeble, a senior official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said California officials have quarantined dairy farms where cattle are infected. They have also established 10-km zones around farms that have had infections to test milk in these areas for traces of H5N1.Bulk milk sampling has been the primary way for officials to detect virus in herds, Deeble said, referencing reductions of spread on Colorado farms. After Colorado herds began getting infected, he explained, officials found a significant number of infections across the state. By mandating bulk milk testing, officials tracked down and isolated the spread of the virus. Now, only one herd, out of 86 in the state, was infected with H5N1, Deeble said.This is a concern for California, the nation’s largest milk producer. Federal regulators have said pasteurization is effective at eliminating bird flu virus in dairy milk.(This story has been updated to add new information.)

But over 40% of infected farms continued to move cattle off the farm after cows showed clinical signs of illness, Suarez said.“For us as poultry people, that’s just something that’s inconceivable,” Suarez said.While influenza in poultry is controlled by depopulating the farm, dairy infections have been controlled with movement restrictions. David Suarez, a laboratory director at the National Poultry Research Center, speaks at the National Meeting on Poultry Health, Processing and Live Production on Oct. 2, 2024, in Ocean City, Md. PHILIP GRUBER | Staff After all, depopulating large dairies would be difficult. Trading partners didn’t press for culling, and USDA lacks the regulations that would allow the agency to pay farmers for cows that are destroyed, Suarez said.Since April, USDA has required testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cows.While Suarez said the testing requirement is important, it’s not clear how effective it’s been.Avian influenza has continued to spread among dairies, and he said some experts suspect farmers are circumventing the rules.“At least the rumor’s in the field that the dairy farmers are being very sneaky about how they’re moving some of these cattle,” he said.USDA also has a weekly bulk milk testing program that allows farms to move cows without testing each group.Only 60 herds are enrolled nationwide, about half of them in Michigan, Suarez said.Shawn Jasper, the New Hampshire ag commissioner, said last month that farmers are hesitant to test because they are concerned their cooperative will cut them off if the virus is detected in their milk.Since it was diagnosed early this year, the influenza outbreak in dairy has been focused on cows. It’s not clear how other kinds of cattle can be affected.So far, calves have not been found to be sickened by avian influenza. But USDA might not be getting good data from the farms, and many large dairies quickly move young calves to dedicated farms, Suarez said.There’s no evidence that beef cattle are part of the problem, though that industry’s approach appears to be “if you don’t look, you’re not going to find anything,” he said.Still, the virus appears to be harming nonbovine species.Farm cats have died after drinking untreated milk from infected cows. Some farms have brought in feral cats from the city for rodent control after the resident cats died off, Suarez said.Almost all infected dairies that also had poultry observed sick or dead birds.Some of the dairies have found dead wild birds, which probably were infected because of the huge viral load on the farm and were not the source of the virus to cattle, Suarez said.Cows’ mammary glands appear to be fertile ground for the influenza virus to replicate — at volumes that can exceed what poultry produce at their peak of infection.“What really has shocked everyone who’s been working with avian influenza for a long period of time is how much virus is in the milk,” Suarez said.In dairy cows, avian influenza often causes a drop in milk production and problems with milk quality. That milk, with flakes and clots, should never enter the food supply, Suarez said.Inactivated flu virus particles have been found in milk from stores. Federal authorities say there’s no food safety risk because pasteurization breaks down the virus.Some cow mortality has been associated with this year’s flu outbreak. Cows are sometimes culled when they don’t return to full production, Suarez said.Researchers are still trying to understand how dairy cattle get infected in the first place. Breathing in virus particles doesn’t seem likely, and when two udder quarters were inoculated in a study, the virus did not spread to the other two quarters.While influenza is a productivity issue on the farm, public health experts are concerned that the virus’ residency in cows could make it more dangerous to humans.Many of the virus samples from cows have a single marker that is considered a mammalian adaptation, but it’s not clear how much of a role it has played in the current outbreak, Suarez said.So far, the virus does not seem to be getting more adapted to dairy cattle, but over a dozen people have tested positive for avian influenza in the United States.All but one of those people had a connection to infected dairy or poultry farms.The patients had mild symptoms and recovered quickly after they received antivirals, Suarez said.

WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have results later this month that provide more insight into how a Missouri resident, who hadn’t had any contact with infected animals or food, contracted a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said on a call with reporters Friday the agency is working through its investigation of that bird flu case, while providing several more details. “As we previously reported, CDC would be able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample,” Daskalakis said. That process is complex and time-consuming, in part because the patient had rather small amounts of the virus in their system when the test was taken. Another contributing factor, he said, is “that the virus has two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the viruses previously characterized during this event that could affect antigenicity.” Daskalakis explained that antigenicity is when someone is able to produce “a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies.” Both the mutations and small sample size have presented challenges for the CDC, but the agency expects to announce results of the test later this month after completing the complicated lab process, he said. Two cases in California The Missouri case is the only bird flu diagnosis in the United States this year where the person hadn’t had direct contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle. The remainder of the 16 people diagnosed with H5N1 during this calendar year had direct contact with farm animals, with nine of those cases linked to poultry and six related to dairy cows. One of those cases was diagnosed in Texas, two in Michigan, two in California just this week and 10 in Colorado. Public health officials on the call emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low and that several studies undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration show pasteurized dairy products as well as other foods remain safe to eat. Since February, the CDC has tested more than 50,000 samples that would have “detected Influenza A, H5 or other novel influenza viruses,” Daskalakis said. The Missouri case was the first case of bird flu detected through that influenza surveillance system, he said. Public health officials at the state and federal level have been trying to determine how the Missouri patient, who officials are not identifying for their privacy, contracted the virus through a series of “intense interviews,” Daskalakis said. That is how they learned someone living in the same house had been symptomatic with various gastrointestinal issues at the same time the patient had been ill. That simultaneous onset of symptoms implied “a common exposure, rather than human-to-human transmission,” Daskalakis said, before reinforcing that the second person never tested positive for the virus and isn’t considered a case of bird flu. “At the time of the interview, the household contact had also completely recovered and had not been tested for influenza while they were sick,” he said. “To be clear, there is only one case of H5N1 influenza detected in Missouri.” Because the person living in the same house as the Missouri patient had been symptom-free for more than 10 days when they were interviewed by public health officials, Daskalakis said there was “no utility in testing the contact for acute influenza.” Instead, officials in Missouri took blood samples from the two people so the CDC could test for “antibodies against H5 to assess for possible infection with this virus,” he said. A separate investigation was taken at the hospital where the Missouri patient had been diagnosed to see if any health care workers had contracted H5N1. Out of 118 health care workers who interacted with the patient in some way, 18 had higher-risk interactions before the patient was diagnosed and began using what Daskalakis referred to as “droplet precautions.” Six of those health care workers later developed respiratory symptoms, though only one of them had symptoms by the time the public health investigation had begun retroactively, he said. That one person’s PCR test for acute influenza came back negative and the other five health care workers, who had recovered, did not require a PCR test, he said. “Since exposures could only be assessed retrospectively, Missouri has also obtained blood specimens from these individuals for antibody or serology testing at CDC to search for any evidence to support the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient,” Daskalakis said. “Despite the low risk, this testing is important to complete the public health investigation of this case.” The CDC began working on that serology testing in mid-September when it received the samples from Missouri, though the complicated process likely won’t conclude until later in October. “For serology testing to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or there is a risk of a false negative test,” Daskalakis said. “Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough for the Missouri specimen.” The CDC, he explained, has to “create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri, so that we can use it in these serology tests.” “We realize people, including all of us at CDC, are anxious to see results from this testing,” he said. “CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.” Poultry, dairy cases In addition to human cases, bird flu continues to infect poultry flocks and dairy herds within the United States. While the poultry industry has had years of experience supplying its workers with personal protective equipment and culling affected farms, the dairy industry has had to figure out how to address the virus this year. Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said on the call Friday that Colorado’s mandatory testing program of bulk milk tanks, which began in July, offered a hopeful case study for ridding farms throughout the country of H5N1. “Initially, this revealed a significant local prevalence, about 72% of dairies, centered in Weld County,” Deeble said. But following months of hard work by farmers and public health officials, Colorado has just one dairy herd that’s currently affected by H5N1 out of 86 dairy herds within the state, he said. “Mandatory surveillance in the state allows for continuous monitoring of herds and helps detect any instances of non-negative results early on, ensuring timely intervention,” Deeble said. “This decrease in Colorado cases, even in the absence of a vaccine, gives us further confidence that H5N1 can be eliminated in the national herd, even in places where we have seen an initial rapid increase in cases.” Data from the USDA show that during the past month, three dairy herds in Idaho and 53 in California have tested positive for H5N1. XCDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident by Jennifer Shutt, Missouri Independent October 4, 2024 CDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident by Jennifer Shutt, Missouri Independent October 4, 2024 WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have results later this month that provide more insight into how a Missouri resident, who hadn’t had any contact with infected animals or food, contracted a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said on a call with reporters Friday the agency is working through its investigation of that bird flu case, while providing several more details. “As we previously reported, CDC would be able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample,” Daskalakis said. That process is complex and time-consuming, in part because the patient had rather small amounts of the virus in their system when the test was taken. Another contributing factor, he said, is “that the virus has two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the viruses previously characterized during this event that could affect antigenicity.” Daskalakis explained that antigenicity is when someone is able to produce “a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies.” Both the mutations and small sample size have presented challenges for the CDC, but the agency expects to announce results of the test later this month after completing the complicated lab process, he said. Two cases in California The Missouri case is the only bird flu diagnosis in the United States this year where the person hadn’t had direct contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle. The remainder of the 16 people diagnosed with H5N1 during this calendar year had direct contact with farm animals, with nine of those cases linked to poultry and six related to dairy cows. One of those cases was diagnosed in Texas, two in Michigan, two in California just this week and 10 in Colorado. Public health officials on the call emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low and that several studies undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration show pasteurized dairy products as well as other foods remain safe to eat. Since February, the CDC has tested more than 50,000 samples that would have “detected Influenza A, H5 or other novel influenza viruses,” Daskalakis said. The Missouri case was the first case of bird flu detected through that influenza surveillance system, he said. Public health officials at the state and federal level have been trying to determine how the Missouri patient, who officials are not identifying for their privacy, contracted the virus through a series of “intense interviews,” Daskalakis said. That is how they learned someone living in the same house had been symptomatic with various gastrointestinal issues at the same time the patient had been ill. That simultaneous onset of symptoms implied “a common exposure, rather than human-to-human transmission,” Daskalakis said, before reinforcing that the second person never tested positive for the virus and isn’t considered a case of bird flu. “At the time of the interview, the household contact had also completely recovered and had not been tested for influenza while they were sick,” he said. “To be clear, there is only one case of H5N1 influenza detected in Missouri.” Because the person living in the same house as the Missouri patient had been symptom-free for more than 10 days when they were interviewed by public health officials, Daskalakis said there was “no utility in testing the contact for acute influenza.” Instead, officials in Missouri took blood samples from the two people so the CDC could test for “antibodies against H5 to assess for possible infection with this virus,” he said. A separate investigation was taken at the hospital where the Missouri patient had been diagnosed to see if any health care workers had contracted H5N1. Out of 118 health care workers who interacted with the patient in some way, 18 had higher-risk interactions before the patient was diagnosed and began using what Daskalakis referred to as “droplet precautions.” Six of those health care workers later developed respiratory symptoms, though only one of them had symptoms by the time the public health investigation had begun retroactively, he said. That one person’s PCR test for acute influenza came back negative and the other five health care workers, who had recovered, did not require a PCR test, he said. “Since exposures could only be assessed retrospectively, Missouri has also obtained blood specimens from these individuals for antibody or serology testing at CDC to search for any evidence to support the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient,” Daskalakis said. “Despite the low risk, this testing is important to complete the public health investigation of this case.” The CDC began working on that serology testing in mid-September when it received the samples from Missouri, though the complicated process likely won’t conclude until later in October. “For serology testing to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or there is a risk of a false negative test,” Daskalakis said. “Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough for the Missouri specimen.” The CDC, he explained, has to “create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri, so that we can use it in these serology tests.” “We realize people, including all of us at CDC, are anxious to see results from this testing,” he said. “CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.” Poultry, dairy cases In addition to human cases, bird flu continues to infect poultry flocks and dairy herds within the United States.

The outbreak brings the national total since the outbreaks began in March to 243 across 14 states. California, the nation’s largest dairy producer, has now reported 44 outbreaks since late August.The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) today urged residents to take precautions following an increase in diseases caused by mosquitoes. So far, the state has reported 63 human cases of West Nile virus, 6 of them fatal, from many of the state’s regions but especially the Central Valley. Also, it noted four dengue infections reported from Los Angeles County, including three that are part of a cluster from Baldwin Park. The CDPH urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites and get rid of standing water where mosquitoes breed.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, today released a report on its 2023 activities, estimating that the vaccine programs it supported last year will prevent 1.3 million deaths. It said 69 million children were immunized, the second highest in one year. The group said another achievement was a big increase in its human papillomavirus vaccination program, which saw 14 million girls immunized, a number greater than the previous 10 years combined. Study: COVID-19 vaccination protects against serious cardiovascular disease News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 libre de droit / iStock Full vaccination against COVID-19 protects recipients from serious cardiovascular disease linked to COVID-19, according to a new study in the European Heart Journal.The findings come from a review of more than 8 million adults in Sweden who were followed up in national healthcare registers from the end of December 2020—when COVID-19 vaccination began—until the end of 2022.Among the 8,070,674 adults included in the study, 88.5% received at least one dose of vaccine, 86.9% at least two, and 67.9% three or more. There were 1,668,508 new cases of COVID-19; 40.3% occurred before the first dose of vaccination, 3.7% between the first and second dose, 34.3% between the second and third dose, and 21.7% after the third dose.Outcomes included inflammation of the cardiac muscle or the pericardium, cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke.Individual vaccine doses linked to increased risk Overall, vaccination was associated with decreased risks of cardiovascular disease by about 20% to 30% compared to no vaccination. The authors note, however, that some cardiovascular effects have been seen after individual doses of the vaccine, especially among older men.There was a 17% higher risk of extrasystoles, or extra heart beats, after dose one and 22% after dose two. While the overall the risk of stroke was lower in vaccinated people, there was an increased risk of TIA. "It should be noted that for outcomes showing slightly increased risks (myopericarditis, TIA, and extrasystoles), the incidence rates were generally lower than for the other outcomes that showed decreased risks," the authors said.The increases in cardiovascular risk we saw following COVID-19 vaccination are temporary, and do not apply to the more severe conditions"The increases in cardiovascular risk we saw following COVID-19 vaccination are temporary, and do not apply to the more severe conditions," said study author Fredrik Nyberg, PhD, in a press release from the University of Gothenburg. "On the other hand, full vaccination significantly reduced the risk of several more severe cardiovascular outcomes linked to COVID-19, such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. This emphasizes the protective benefits of full vaccination." Study provides novel insights on sepsis in India News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Sepsis Zerbor / iStock A study conducted in southern India found that sepsis disproportionately affects younger and mostly rural groups and that gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and tropical diseases are significant causes, researchers reported today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.To gain insight into the causative agents and characteristics of patients with community-acquired sepsis in India, which accounts for 26% of global sepsis-related deaths, a team of researchers from India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom conducted a prospective observational study in a tertiary-care hospital in South India from December 2018 through September 2022. They enrolled adult patients within 24 hours of intensive care unit admission (ICU) who met international sepsis criteria and collected clinical, microbiologic, demographic, and outcome data.Of the 4,000 patients screened on ICU admission, 1,000 (median age, 55 years; 66% male) met the inclusion criteria. Most patients lived outside of urban areas, with 23.7% living in towns and 46.5% in villages, while roughly half had no formal education, and three-quarters worked in the primary sector. The median length of ICU stay was 4 days, and in-hospital mortality was 24.1%.Study fills important knowledge gapsA causative agent could be identified in 54% of patients, with bacteria causing 38% of cases, viruses 18%, leptospirosis 10.6%, scrub typhus 4.1%, dengue 3.7%, and Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) 1.6%. Sepsis cases caused by leptospirosis, scrub typhus, dengue, and KFDV all showed seasonal variation around the monsoon season.Among patients with bacterial sepsis, 43.9% of isolates were gram-negative; Escherichia coli (52.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.3%) were the most frequently isolated species. Further analysis found high levels of antibiotic resistance, with 75.8% of E coli, 47.7% of K pneumoniae, and 30% of P aeruginosa resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 10.1%, 13.6%, and 10.0% resistant to carbapenems, respectively."This study provides a detailed examination of sepsis in South India and fills important knowledge gaps of the real burden of sepsis in LMICs [low- and middle-income countries]," the study authors wrote. "These findings provide critical groundwork for strengthening capacity, optimizing resource allocation, and formulating evidence-based treatment guidelines specifically tailored to South Asia, underscoring the importance of regional epidemiologic sepsis research in LMICs." UK supermarkets lack robust antibiotic policies, report finds News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship nastya_ph / iStock A new report reveals that UK supermarkets don't have strong enough policies to enforce new national legislation on antibiotic use on farms.The legislation, which was enacted May 17, bans UK farmers from using antibiotics routinely and prohibits the use of antibiotics to "compensate for poor hygiene, inadequate animal husbandry, or poor farm management practices." But in a report released last week, the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics found that 10 leading UK supermarket chains are failing to ensure that their suppliers are fully compliant with the new legislation. For example, the report found that supermarket antibiotic policies still only apply to store-brand products and don't cover branded products or imported meat, fish, dairy, or eggs that may be produced with routine antibiotic use. "The scope of the policies needs to be extended to branded foods and to imported food in order to protect consumers and ensure that British farming standards are not undermined by imports," the report states.Supermarkets need to take 'strong and urgent' actionThe report also found that only five of the chains publish good or acceptable data on the use of antibiotics in their supply chains, and only two have a full ban on the use of the last-resort antibiotic colistin. In addition, most of the chains continue to sell fast-growing breeds of broiler chickens that require more antibiotic use.The group says that while UK supermarkets have made improvements since they published their first assessment in 2017 and have contributed to a 59% reduction in total farm antibiotic use since 2014, the new report indicates they have more work to do."It is no longer legal to use antibiotics to prop up farming methods that are causing animals to fall sick," Coilin Nunan, policy and science manager for the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said in a press release. "So to avoid misusing antibiotics, and to keep animals healthy, supermarkets must now take strong and urgent action to improve animal husbandry and welfare."In a statement, the Food Industry Initiative on Antimicrobials called the report misleading and said UK retailers' support for more responsible antibiotic use in their supply chains has played an integral role in reducing antibiotic sales and antimicrobial resistance on farms.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Six healthcare workers in the US who were in close contact with a patient known to have bird flu developed mild respiratory symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The patient was not known to have had contact with livestock or other animals, raising the possibility of human-to-human spread. Only one healthcare worker was tested for the H5N1 bird flu virus, but the results were negative. All of the healthcare workers provided blood samples to test for bird flu antibodies, but the results of those tests are not known. The CDC characterises the risk to the public at present to be low. Influenza (or flu) is a common respiratory infection caused by a group of viruses called the paramyxoviruses. These types of viruses have a genome that is made of RNA, which is vulnerable to mutation. This matters because changes in genetic material can change the characteristics of a virus, making it, say, more or less transmissible or more or less pathogenic (able to cause harm). There are four types of influenza virus: A, B, C and D. Influenza A is known to infect humans and other animals, including birds. Bird flu is type A. The different strains are denoted by receptor combinations on the viral surface called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) and these are defined by different numbers, such as H1N1 or H2N1. One strain of bird flu, H5N1, has been circulating since 1997, when it was first noted. However, it was particularly active in the UK between October 2021 and September 2022, causing disease in both wild and domestic birds. In 2023, the H5N1 virus was detected in 37 countries with over 50 million birds culled, according to the European Food Standards agency. The virus is continuing to affect birds and has been observed in various mammals, including foxes and otters in the UK. The detection of the H5N1 virus in these mammals is not believed to be directly due to infection, but more likely due to the consumption of dead birds that had succumbed to the infection. There are no reported cases of transmission between mammals in the wild. Although, recently, there have been a handful of H5N1 cases in humans, they have been very mild cases. It should be noted that from 2003 to April 2024 there have been 463 deaths, globally. However, when compared with deaths recorded in humans annually from seasonal flu, the number of deaths caused by H5N1 in human beings is extremely small. Mammals in the UK that died of avian influenza probably caught the disease by eating an infected bird. bardzo photo/Shutterstock Luckily, not adapted to mammals The World Health Organization reports the number of human cases of H5N1 globally (24 countries reporting) from 2003 to July 2024 came to 896 cases. What this data shows is that the virus can cause disease in humans, but is not effective at transmission between humans. For effective human-to-human transmission, genetic reassortment is needed for the virus to adapt to the human host. However, the virus is currently adapted to an avian host, not a mammalian one. However, if a human-adapted influenza virus infected a human host alongside avian H5N1 virus, the viruses potentially could swap RNA in a “reassortment event” that might allow the bird flu virus (H5N1) to become more adapted to the human host. This is similar to what happened with H1N1 (swine flu), in which the virus developed genetic properties that allowed it to infect humans. So what can be done to protect humans? For one, annual flu vaccines should be updated to provide protection against H5N1, too. There also needs to be continued monitoring of how the virus is evolving to inform potential control measures and monitor any genetic changes within the virus that might permit spread into other non-avian hosts. There is no evidence that there are genetic changes in the virus that will allow it to establish an effective presence in humans, but scientists will continue to monitor the virus. The risk of infection developing and being sustained in the human population remains low. However, vigilance is required to ensure this situation remains the same.

September 30, 2024 SHARE COPY LINK link copied to clipboard Colored SEM of an interaction between a CD4+T cell (left) and a macrophage (right), two types of immune cells. (Steve Gschmeissner / Science Photo Library) More than 200 viruses can infect and cause disease in humans; most of us will be infected by several over the course of a lifetime. Does an encounter with one virus influence how your immune system responds to a different one? If so, how? Does it weaken your defenses, boost them, or have some other impact altogether? These are questions Rockefeller University scientists from the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease,headed by Charles M. Rice, and Weill Cornell Medicine’s Laboratory of Epigenetics and Immunity, headed by Steven Z. Josefowicz, teamed up to answer in a new study published in the journal Immunity. By analyzing mice that had been first infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then with influenza A virus, the scientists found that having recovered from COVID had a protective effect against the worst effects of the flu, and that this memory response was coming from an unexpected corner of the immune system. It turned out that epigenetic changes in macrophages—innate immune cells that are among the first responders to a threat—had developed a kind of “memory” following COVID that allowed these cells to mount a better defense against an unrelated virus. Immunological memory has long been thought to be limited to adaptive immune cells, though recent work has challenged this dogma. More intriguingly, what these macrophages were remembering wasn’t unique to any particular virus. The findings increase our understanding of innate immune memory and may enable researchers to exploit the phenomenon in new ways to create therapies that confer widespread protection against multiple viruses. “Immune memory is critical to fending off recurring diseases caused by pathogens. What’s exciting about our study is that we’ve discovered a broadly effective antiviral immune memory in macrophages following SARS-CoV-2 infection that can reduce disease caused by a completely different virus,” says first author Alexander Lercher, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab. “A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms could aid development of new therapeutic strategies that cover a range of respiratory viruses,” says Rice. “It was so exciting to team up with Alex and Charlie and delve into the epigenetic mechanisms encoding this general antiviral memory,” adds Josefowicz. “The implications are profound. If we can walk around with months-long bolstered immunity after a season’s worth of respiratory infections, what are the implications for seasonal trends in these infections? How much human variance—genetic and epigenetic—exists in these pathways?” Cascading effect When a virus invades the body, signaling molecules called cytokines instruct innate immune cells like macrophages to pursue and consume anything that sounds their alarm. This one-size-fits-all approach is followed by a targeted assault by adaptive immune cells such as T cells, which identify a virus-specific antigen, tailor their offense towards it, and remember it long-term to fight future invasions by the same virus. However, discoveries of the past two decades show that innate immune responses can lead to cellular memory. In multiple studies, for example, researchers discovered that people who had received the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin live-attenuated vaccine, which aims to protect against tuberculosis, elicited innate immune memory responses that last for months, and provide protection against unrelated infections. But how this broadly effective immune memory develops is little understood. In 2020, Lercher began investigating the phenomenon using widely circulating viruses: SARS-CoV-2, then the most dominant global pathogen, and influenza A virus, a recurrent scourge plaguing humanity since the 1918 pandemic, when it crossed from birds to humans, spreading globally and killing millions. Flipping the switch on genes Lercher and colleagues set out to investigate long-term consequences of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system. They focused their analysis on cells in the lungs and found that alveolar macrophages, located in the airway, acquired a new epigenetic program after infection. More specifically, they found that the chromatin that packages genes was more accessible around antiviral genes, which rendered them “ready to go” following recovery from COVID. These results weren’t limited to mice. When analyzing samples from people who’d recovered from mild COVID, the researchers found similar epigenetic changes in monocytes in the blood, the progenitor cells of macrophages. The result of this epigenetic reprogramming is memory of previous infections—and an altered immune response to future ones. Sharp memory Because macrophages in the lungs of COVID-recovered mice had acquired antiviral innate immune memory imprinted on their chromatin, they could more successfully fight disease caused by a new viral invader. Compared to naive mice, they had fewer disease symptoms from influenza A, such as significant weight loss or dysregulated inflammatory responses, and lower mortality rates. “The fact that viral RNA alone seems to be able to trigger memory in macrophages lays the foundation of this memory being antigen independent,” Lercher says. “They’re recognizing a pattern that is shared by many viruses, unlike a virus-specific antigen.” The researchers confirmed this by exposing mice to a synthetic mimic of an RNA virus, and found similar memory responses as they had seen following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, when it came to battling the secondary flu infection, memory-attuned macrophages outperformed adaptive T cells. “The macrophages are really the ones driving this response,” Lercher says. Finally, to test how sharp the macrophages’ memory was, the researchers extracted them from recovered mice, transferred them into naive mice and then infected those mice with influenza A virus. So, if the recovered macrophages were up to the task, the recipient mice should develop less severe disease upon influenza A infection. They were. “The naive mice with the implanted recovered macrophages fared better against influenza than mice implanted with naive macrophages,” Lercher says. Pandemic preparedness In the future, the researchers want to identify what the critical factors for establishing innate immune memory are. “In an ideal world, we would find one or a few factors that lead to this memory formation in macrophages and other innate cells, and then exploit it to develop therapies that offer broad protection against many viruses,” Rice says. This approach could be especially useful in the face of a potential pandemic. “If there were a new emerging pathogen on the horizon, for example, it would be nice to have a therapy that boosted your general antiviral immunity for the next month or so,” says Lercher. “That’s still very far away, and a lot more research needs to be done, but I think it could be possible one day.” Research area: Immunology, Virology, and Microbiology; Mechanisms of Human Disease Explore: All latest news Charles M.

Home October Wellness Spotlight October Wellness Spotlight October 1, 2024 Fight the Flu! ‘Tis the (flu) season! Kids are back at school, temperatures are dropping, and cases of the flu are becoming more prevalent. Rates of the flu start to increase in October with the most cases being between December and February. Read more in the October Wellness Spotlight to learn more about measures you and your family can take to reduce the risk of contracting influenza. Prevalence & Risk Factors According to the World Health Organization, 31.91 million cases of the flu were identified in the 2022-2023 season (WHO, 2024). Seasonal influenza, also known as the flu, is an acute respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. All age groups can be affected by the virus, but there are groups of individuals that are more at risk than others including: Pregnant women Children under 5 Older individuals Individuals with chronic medical conditions (i.e. chronic cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, liver, or hematologic diseases) Individuals with immunosuppressive conditions or treatments such as HIV, receiving chemotherapy, steroids, or malignancy Healthcare workers due to increased exposure Symptoms Individuals who have the flu can go through mild to severe illness, and at times lead to death. Symptoms usually come on suddenly. Those who have the flu can feel some or all of these signs and symptoms: Fever or feeling feverish/chills (not everyone with the flu will have a fever) Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults) Typically, people who get the flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but sometimes people develop complications as a result of flu, some of which can be life-threatening. If you are experiencing these symptoms, seek medical care right away: Adults: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, inability to arouse Seizures Not urinating Severe muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improve but then return or worsen Worsening of chronic medical conditions Children: Fast breathing or trouble breathing Bluish lips or face Ribs pulling with each breath Chest pain Severe muscle pain Dehydration (no urine for 8 hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying) Not alert or interacting when awake Seizures Fever above 104 that is not controlled by fever-reducing medicine If younger than 12 weeks, any fever Fever or cough that improve but then return or worsen Worsening of chronic medical conditions Cold VS Flu Signs and Symptoms Cold Influenza (Flu) Symptom onset Gradual Abrupt Fever Rare Common; lasts 3-4 days Aches Slight Common; often severe Chills Uncommon Fairly common Fatigue, weakness Sometimes Usual Sneezing Common Sometimes Chest discomfort, cough Mild to moderate; hacking cough Common; can be severe Stuffy nose Common Sometimes Sore throat Common Sometimes Headache Rare Common Prevention The best way to prevent the flu is getting vaccinated. The vaccine may be less effective in older individuals, but it will make the illness less severe and reduces the chance of complications and death. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at a higher risk (mentioned above). The virus can spread easily between people when they cough or sneeze via infectious droplets. The flu can spread rapidly in crowded areas such as schools and nursing homes. Other ways to prevent the flu: Wash your hands regularly Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing Dispose of tissues correctly Stay home when you are sick Avoid close contact with people who are sick Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth Improve your air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying air, or gathering outdoors Clean frequently touched surfaces, such as countertops, handrails, and doorknobs Get plenty of sleep, exercise, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat healthy foods Preventing the Spread of the Flu at Work Routinely clean frequently touched objects and surfaces including doorknobs, phones, and keyboards Make sure your workplace has an adequate supply of soap, tissues, paper towels, alcohol-based hand wipes, and disposable wipes Train others how to do your job so they can cover for you in case you or your family member gets sick, and you have to stay home If you begin to feel unwell at work, go home as soon as possible Treatment Typically, when individuals have the flu, the best remedy includes rest and consumption of plenty of fluids. However, if you have a severe infection or are at higher risk of complications, your healthcare professional may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat the flu. These medications may shorten the illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications. Lifestyle and Home Remedies Hydrate Drink water, juice, and warm soup to prevent dehydration Rest Get more sleep to help your immune system fight the infection You may need to change your activity levels depending on your symptoms Consider pain relievers to combat fever, headache, or other aches Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) Grand Forks Resources: Make your flu vaccine appointment: Student Health Services (Flu shots for students, faculty, and staff) Call 701-777-4500 to make an appointment CVS Walgreens Altru Grand Forks Public Health References: https://www.who.intews-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal) https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/actions-prevent-flu.htm https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351725 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm Work Well E-Newsletter Archive Related Posts November Wellness Spotlight November 1, 2024 September Wellness Spotlight September 1, 2024 August Wellness Spotlight August 1, 2024 University of North Dakota © 2024 University of North Dakota - Grand Forks, ND - Member of ND University System Accessibility & Website Feedback Terms of Use & Privacy Notice of Nondiscrimination Student Disclosure Information Title IXBioCryst Secures Major US Health Department Influenza Drug Deal News Today's news US Politics World Tech Reviews and deals Audio Computing Gaming Health Home Phones Science TVs Climate change Health Science 2024 election Originals The 360 Newsletters Life Health COVID-19 Fall allergies Health news Mental health Relax Sexual health Studies The Unwind Parenting Family health So mini ways Style and beauty It Figures Unapologetically Horoscopes Shopping Buying guides Food Travel Autos Gift ideas Buying guides Entertainment Celebrity TV Movies Music How to Watch Interviews Videos Finance My Portfolio News Latest News Stock Market Originals The Morning Brief Economics Housing Earnings Tech Crypto Biden Economy Markets Stocks: Most Actives Stocks: Gainers Stocks: Losers Trending Tickers Futures World Indices US Treasury Bonds Rates Currencies Crypto Top ETFs Top Mutual Funds Options: Highest Open Interest Options: Highest Implied Volatility Sectors Basic Materials Communication Services Consumer Cyclical Consumer Defensive Energy Financial Services Healthcare Industrials Real Estate Technology Utilities Research Screeners Screeners Beta Watchlists Calendar Stock Comparison Advanced Chart Currency Converter Personal Finance Credit Cards Balance Transfer Cards Cash-back Cards Rewards Cards Travel Cards Credit Card Offers Banking CD Rates Best HYSA Best Free Checking Student Loans Personal Loans Insurance Car insurance Mortgages Mortgage Refinancing Mortgage Calculator Taxes Videos Invest Latest News Editor's Picks Investing Insights Trending Stocks All Shows Morning Brief Opening Bid Wealth ETF Report Sports Fantasy News Fantasy football Best Ball Pro Pick 'Em College Pick 'Em Fantasy baseball Fantasy hockey Fantasy basketball Download the app Daily fantasy NFL News Scores and schedules Standings Stats Teams Players Drafts Injuries Odds Super Bowl GameChannel Videos MLB News Scores and schedules Standings Stats Teams Players Odds Videos World Baseball Classic NBA News Draft Scores and schedules Standings Stats Teams Players Injuries Videos Odds Playoffs NHL News Scores and schedules Standings Stats Teams Players Odds Playoffs Soccer News Scores and schedules Premier League MLS NWSL Liga MX CONCACAF League Champions League La Liga Serie A Bundesliga Ligue 1 World Cup College football News Scores and schedules Standings Rankings Stats Teams Show all MMA WNBA Sportsbook NCAAF Tennis Golf NASCAR NCAAB NCAAW Boxing USFL Cycling Motorsports Olympics Horse racing GameChannel Rivals Newsletters Podcasts Videos RSS Jobs Help World Cup More news New on Yahoo Creators Games Tech Terms Privacy Privacy Dashboard Feedback © 2024 All rights reserved.

As of this month, California, the nation’s largest dairy-producing state, has reported 41 dairies testing positive for the virus, with expectations that more cases will follow. This new chapter in the outbreak highlights the virus’s capacity to adapt and affect multiple species, making it a pressing concern for epidemiologists and dairy operators alike. Dr. Kay Russo, a veterinarian and founder of RSM Consulting, recently discussed the issue in a webinar, underscoring the urgency for dairy farmers to take proactive measures. According to Russo, the virus initially emerged in cattle in Texas before spreading to states like Michigan and Idaho. Now concentrated in California, epidemiologists are racing to investigate how the virus spreads between and within dairy operations. Dr. Jason Lombard, an epidemiologist from Colorado State University working with the USDA, has been conducting investigations to help uncover the virus’s pathways. While he has made strides in Michigan, he is actively seeking dairy operations in California to further his research. “Getting ahead of this virus is critical,” Russo explained. “The data so far indicates that cattle may be infected well before showing any clinical signs. By the time mastitis or other symptoms appear, it’s often too late.” The risk for dairy herds is compounded by the proximity of dairy farms to poultry operations. While the virus behaves differently in cattle, acting more like a low-pathogenic strain in contrast to its deadly effects on poultry, biosecurity remains paramount. Russo emphasized that many dairy farms lack the biosecurity measures needed to prevent the virus from taking hold, and improving this will be a crucial first step in protecting herds. Biosecurity, she said, covers a range of practices, from controlling worker movement between farms to ensuring clean clothing and equipment. Workers who move between poultry and dairy farms are one potential link in the virus’s spread. Russo recommended that farms institute farm-specific clothing and hygiene protocols to minimize risk.

WHO reports new MERS case in Saudi Arabia News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics MERS-CoV The World Health Organization (WHO) reported today that it has been notified of a human case of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in Saudi Arabia.The case, which was reported by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health, involves a man from the Eastern Region aged between 50 and 55 years with underlying health conditions who developed fever, cough, shortness of breath, and palpitations on August 28. He was admitted to a hospital on August 31, and a nasopharyngeal swab returned a positive result for MERS-CoV on September 4. After being discharged from the hospital and prior to receiving the test result, the man traveled to Pakistan on September 2. He was subsequently located in Pakistan and transferred to a hospital for strict isolation. He was discharged on September 13 after receiving a negative test result.The man had no history of contact with camels and is not a healthcare worker. Follow-up with close contacts of the patient by Saudi and Pakistani health officials found no secondary cases.No change in WHO risk assessmentSaudi Arabia has reported a total of five MERS-CoV cases since the beginning of the year, with four deaths. The last case was reported on May 8. Since the first report of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia in 2012, there have been 2,205 human cases reported in 27 countries, the vast majority of them in Saudi Arabia.The WHO says the case does not change its overall risk assessment, which remains moderate at both the global and regional levels. Long-term trial data boosts case for newer drug-resistant TB regimens News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Tuberculosis Iuliia Mikhalitskaia / iStock Extended follow-up on patients in a phase 3 clinical trial found that two bedaquiline-containing drug regimens for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB) maintained superiority compared with a 9-month injectable-based regimen at 132 weeks, researchers reported yesterday in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine.The STREAM stage 2 trial randomized patients aged 15 years or older with rifampicin-resistant TB in seven countries to receive one of four treatments: the long regimen (the 20-month regimen recommended by the World Health Organization from 2011 to 2018), a control regimen (a 9-month regimen with the second-line injectable kanamycin), an oral regimen (9 months with bedaquiline replacing kanamycin), or a 6-month regimen (containing bedaquiline and supplemented with 8 weeks of kanamycin). Initial analysis at 76 weeks showed that the oral regimen and the 6-month regimen were superior to the control regimen for the primary outcome of favorable status (negative cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The long-regimen arm of the trial was terminated early.Effective and safe treatments for drug-resistant TBIn the follow-up analysis, investigators examined unfavorable status (death or a positive culture from one of two most recent samples) at week 132 in the three remaining groups. Among 517 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population, the proportion with unfavorable status was 19.6% in the oral regimen arm, 29.3% in the control regimen arm, and 9.8% in the 6-month regimen arm. Few serious or severe adverse events were reported after week 76. Treatment-emergent hearing loss was recorded in significantly fewer participants on the oral regimen (3%) than the control regimen (8%), and there was no significant difference in severe hearing loss between the oral regimen and the 6-month regimen.Death rates were low among participants allocated to the two bedaquiline-containing arms (1.01 per 100 person-years) compared with participants on the control regimen (1.52/1oo person-years)."The findings of the STREAM stage 2 trial, combined with results of previous trials, show that shorter bedaquiline-containing regimens are an effective and safe treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis," the investigators wrote. "These data confirm the value of the 9-month regimen recommended in current WHO guidelines and support the use of a 6-month regimen." German health officials probe symptoms in contact of Rwandan Marburg patient News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Marburg Viral Hemorrhagic Fever In related developments, German officials are investigating symptoms in two train travelers, one of them a medical student who had arrived by plane from Rwanda where he had contact with a patient who was later diagnosed with Marburg virus infection, Bild reported today. The man and his girlfriend reportedly experienced flulike symptoms on a train from Frankfurt to Hamburg. Matthias Weinberger/Flickr cc Officials cleared two tracks in Hamburg Central Station and evacuated the area, as emergency responders in protective suits boarded the train. The two people were taken to University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg. Health officials have identified about 200 passengers on the train and are working to determine if they had contact with the two sick passengers. In an outbreak notice earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said one of the contacts of a Marburg patient in Rwanda had traveled to Belgium, but the individual remains healthy, had completed the 21-day monitoring period, and is not a risk to public health.

As the number of affected animals grows, so does the concern for spread to people. In the past, H5N1 has had a high mortality rate in humans, and scientists are monitoring the virus closely to determine whether it poses a pandemic risk. The US government has a stockpile of approved H5N1 vaccines, but today’s awards, which will go to CSL Seqirus, GSK, and Sanofi, will double that number.“We do expect that we will have a total of just over 10 million doses filled and finished by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2025,” said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness and response at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, in a press briefing on Friday.Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK are also working on mRNA vaccines for bird flu, but those need to go through human testing and be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration before they could be used.This year, 16 people in the US have been infected with bird flu. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the latest two cases, both in California, Thursday evening. The individuals are farm workers who had contact with infected dairy cows at two facilities in the Central Valley, the epicenter of the state’s cattle outbreak. Both had mild symptoms, including eye redness, and are being treated with antiviral medication. Neither reported respiratory symptoms or were hospitalized.Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said the new cases do not change the agency’s risk assessment for the general public, which continues to be low. “Finding these two cases was not unexpected,” he said during Friday’s briefing. “As there are more herds that test positive, there are more workers who are exposed, and where there are more workers who are exposed, the chances of human infection increase.”Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanBoth California cases are thought to be instances of animal-to-human spread, with no known link or contact between the two. California health officials are following up with close contacts of the workers, including household members that are also dairy workers.In the coming days, the CDC says it will do additional testing on the virus samples, including genetic sequencing to monitor for any changes in the virus. Scientists are particularly interested in whether the virus is developing new mutations that could make human-to-human transmission more likely. The agency says there is no evidence that the virus can spread from person to person at this time.Of the 16 confirmed human cases, six have been linked to exposure to sick or infected dairy cows, while nine had exposure to infected poultry. The source of infection for a case in Missouri has not been determined.The Missouri case, confirmed in September, was detected through routine flu surveillance and is the first known case of human bird flu in the country with no known exposure to a sick or infected animal. In late August, the person was hospitalized in Missouri due to underlying medical conditions. The patient did not have respiratory symptoms and was not severely ill but tested positive for flu as part of routing screening.The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory determined that the patient’s virus wasn’t a seasonal flu virus and forwarded the sample to the CDC, which confirmed it was a type of bird flu, or H5.Out of an abundance of caution, health officials carried out a retrospective investigation that identified 112 health care workers who had contact with the patient. Of those, six people reported respiratory symptoms around the time the patient was hospitalized. Those symptoms could be due to other viruses, such as seasonal flu or Covid-19. Only one of the health care workers had active symptoms at the time of the investigation and tested negative for flu on a PCR test. The CDC collected blood samples from the health care workers to look for the presence of bird flu antibodies, which would indicate a prior infection.Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says the H5 antibody test is complex to perform and that results may not be available for another two weeks.The CDC is also trying to reconstruct the virus’s genetic sequence from the hospitalized patient’s sample, which could reveal clues about its source. Analyzing the virus has proven difficult, because only a tiny amount of viral genetic material could be isolated from the patient sample.In the absence of vaccines specific to bird flu, health officials are encouraging poultry and dairy workers and other high-risk people to get a seasonal flu vaccine to help protect themselves.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gearA bitcoin mining dream turned into a nightmareThe Big Interview: Marissa Mayer—I am a software girlI made a wholesome OnlyFans to try to make ends meetEvent: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoEmily Mullin is a staff writer at WIRED, covering biotechnology.

RICHMOND, VA – Now is the time for Virginians to get their annual influenza shot to protect against illness as cold, flu, and respiratory virus season approaches. That message was shared by Virginia State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, and other health care leaders during an event today at the Bon Secours Sarah Garland Jones Center for Healthy Living. Through words and deeds, leaders participating in the event encouraged Virginians to receive their seasonal flu shots – several rolled up their sleeves and received a flu shot today as an example to the public. A livestream video of the flu shot event can be viewed online here. “Getting your annual flu shot is one of the simplest things every Virginian can do to protect themselves and others as the fall respiratory illness season draws near,” said Virginia State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton, M.D. “Flu sickens millions of people across the U.S. each year and, in the latest flu season, killed tens of thousands nationally. One quick shot can protect you from the flu and help prevent hospitalization or death. The flu shot is proven safe and effective – get yours as soon as you can for this flu season.” VHHA President and CEO Sean T. Connaughton, Spotty, Bon Secours – Richmond Market President Mike Lutes, and Dr. Karen Shelton remind you to get your flu shot. Each year, the flu affects millions of Americans, resulting in doctor visits, hospitalizations, and in some cases, death. Flu season spans October-March. During the 2023-2024 flu season, preliminary estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate there were at least 31 million flu illnesses, 14 million flu-related medical visits, 350,000 flu hospitalizations, and at least 22,000 flu deaths. This flu season, the CDC projects that the fall and winter respiratory illness period could see a similar number of peak hospitalizations compared to last season. In addition to the physical toll of influenza on patients and health care providers, flu season also has a significant financial impact, with one multi-year study showing more than $11 billion in direct medical and indirect economic costs associated with U.S. adults who contract vaccine-preventable illness such as the flu. According to the Virginia Department of Health, Virginia reported 111,940 emergency department and urgent care visits with diagnosed influenza and an estimated 149 influenza-associated deaths, including three pediatric deaths, during the 2023-2024 flu season. Vaccination can reduce these numbers by providing a layer of defense against severe illness and helping to reduce the spread of illness. Flu season typically runs from the fall through the spring, with peak activity in the winter months. Symptoms of the flu may include fever, chills, coughing, sore throat, congestion, fatigue, and body aches. “Every year I roll-up my sleeve to get my flu shot,” said Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. “I’m grateful to stand with members of the health care community and show our mutual support for vaccinations that help to protect ourselves and our loved ones from infection. Thank you to all our health care professionals who work around the clock to help people stay healthy.” “Bon Secours is focused on improving and ensuring the health of our community,” said Mike Lutes, President, Bon Secours Richmond. “With flu season upon us, it’s important that members of our community know that by getting the influenza vaccine and lessening the likelihood of serious illness for themselves, that also lessens the potential burden on area hospitals as well. We encourage members of the community to talk with their trusted medical providers about protecting themselves against the flu.” “Annual flu shots are a proven, effective way to prevent serious illness and to protect yourself and the people in your household,” added Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association (VHHA) President and CEO Sean T. Connaughton. “Getting a flu shot can also help relieve undue burden on hospitals and health care providers, which often encounter increased patient demand for medical care during flu season. When people get sick, it impacts them, their families, and the broader community. It can cost people lost time at work, lost days at school, or worse. Annual flu shots can help protect against those outcomes. By getting vaccinated, people can do their part to keep communities healthier.” The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for most Americans six months and older. Flu shots are safe, effective, and widely available. They are often covered by private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those looking for more information are encouraged to visit this website and enter their zip code to find a convenient flu shot location. The flu shot and COVID-19 booster can be received at the same time. People who need more information about COVID-19 boosters can visit this link.

Cleared for both individual and care-giver use, the prescription-based nasal spray was cleared just in time for the 2024 flu season with the aim of making access to the vaccine more widely available by circumventing the need for a clinician to administer it. The prescription vaccine has only been cleared for individuals aged two to 49 years of age. The vaccine was cleared for clinical use in 2007, but this new clearance puts the spray in the hands of patients for the first time in a bid to improve vaccine uptake through convenience. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said: “Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families. “Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death. This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA's commitment to advancing public health." FluMist, like most vaccines, works by containing a weakened strain of the virus sprayed directly into the nose. Forecasts made by GlobalData’s Pharmaceutical database estimate that in 2023 FluMist stood at a general market value of approximately $216m, with that figure expected to rise to $280m by the end of 2030. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) claims that flu has resulted in about 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalisations and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Every year across both the US and European markets influenza and the common cold take responsibility for a large portion of increased stress on healthcare systems. Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, many services are keen to find any way to stave off the yearly spike in respiratory conditions.

It affects millions of people each year and can lead to severe complications, especially in vulnerable populations. While the flu might seem like a simple seasonal illness, the truth is that it comes in different strains, each with unique characteristics. Understanding these strains and the importance of annual vaccination is key to preventing widespread illness and protecting public health. Influenza viruses are categorized into four main types: A, B, C, and D. However, it is primarily types A and B that cause seasonal epidemics in humans. Influenza A is the most common and most virulent type of flu virus, responsible for the majority of flu pandemics. Influenza A viruses can infect a variety of hosts, including humans, birds, and other animals, which makes them more likely to mutate and cause pandemics. Unlike influenza A, which is found in many species, influenza B is primarily found in humans. While influenza B can still cause outbreaks and severe illness, it tends to lead to less widespread pandemics than influenza A. Influenza B viruses are classified into two main lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Influenza C is much less common and usually causes mild respiratory illness. It is not typically included in seasonal flu vaccines because it does not pose as significant a public health risk as types A and B. Influenza D primarily affects cattle and is not known to infect or cause illness in humans. One of the main challenges in combating influenza is its ability to change. Influenza viruses constantly evolve. These changes can allow the virus to evade the immune system, even if someone has been previously infected or vaccinated which is why the flu vaccine needs to be updated every year; the virus changes just enough that last year’s vaccine may not provide adequate protection. Because the flu virus changes frequently, getting vaccinated annually is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and others from influenza. While the flu vaccine is not 100% effective, it significantly reduces the risk of contracting influenza. Even if you do catch the flu after vaccination, your symptoms are likely to be less severe. Common symptoms include high fever, chills, dry cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue, runny or stuffy nose and nausea or vomiting. The flu can be especially dangerous for the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes. By getting vaccinated, you help protect those who are more vulnerable to serious complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that flu vaccination prevents thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year. During the 2019-2020 flu season, for example, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.5 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, and 105,000 hospitalizations. Influenza puts a significant strain on healthcare systems every year. Widespread flu vaccination helps prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed, especially during peak flu season. Studies show that flu vaccination lowers the risk of severe outcomes, such as ICU admission or death, even among those who do get sick with the flu. The flu vaccine is updated based on research and predictions about which strains will be most prevalent during the upcoming flu season. Scientists track influenza strains worldwide, analyzing how the viruses are changing, and which strains are circulating the most. The vaccine usually includes protection against three or four different flu viruses (trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines), typically covering two influenza A subtypes and one or two influenza B lineages. The flu vaccine can be administered as a shot (inactivated or recombinant vaccine) or as a nasal spray (live attenuated vaccine). It’s recommended for nearly everyone aged six months and older, barring certain medical conditions. Recommendations for treatment should you get influenza include rest and hydration, treating the symptoms of fever and body aches, treating the cough and congestion, eating nutritious foods, avoid spreading the flu by staying home, practicing good hand hygiene and regularly disinfecting surfaces. Considering antiviral medications and monitoring complications for severe cases are other options you and your healthcare provider should discuss. If you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, severe and persistent vomiting, confusion or dizziness, or a fever that does not reduce after medications it may be time to seek medical attention immediately. Influenza remains a significant public health threat due to its ability to rapidly evolve and spread. Given the virus’s changing nature, annual vaccination is essential for individual and community protection. The flu vaccine is a safe and effective tool for reducing illness, preventing severe complications, and saving lives. Whether you’re in a high-risk group or not, getting vaccinated each year is a simple but powerful way to contribute to public health. By staying informed about flu strains and the importance of vaccination, we can all play a role in preventing the spread of this common but potentially dangerous virus. Alta Vista cares about the wellness of the community and encourages each member of the community to reach out to their primary care office or clinic and make an appointment to receive your annual vaccine. Additionally, our emergency services are available should you experience symptoms that require immediate medical attention. May you stay healthy and well this flu season.

Experts say that's unlikely but argue the case raises other concerns. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This year marked the first time bird flu has been known to jump from cows to people. (Image credit: Stefano Guidi/Getty Images) Over a dozen cases of H5N1 have been reported among people in the United States this year. Current evidence suggests this bird flu virus spreads to humans only from infected animals, such as dairy cows and poultry, and not from person to person.However, the latest case of human infection — reported Sept. 6 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — occurred in a person in Missouri who'd had no known exposure to relevant animals.The CDC has previously stated that there is no evidence of the person passing the virus to close contacts, and says "the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low." The agency maintained that the risk is low even after two health care workers got sick after interacting with the patient — one tested negative for flu and one has yet to be tested for H5N1 or antibodies.In an update on Sept. 27, the CDC noted that four more health care workers tending to the Missouri case fell ill with mild respiratory symptoms. Antibody blood tests are currently underway to determine if any of them have H5N1, which would suggest transmission between humans."I agree with the CDC that it remains low-risk," said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, founding director of the Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases at Boston University. "The good news is you haven't seen an uptick in influenza cases," as that would show up in surveillance for seasonal flu, she added. For the moment, that should help quell public concern that this could turn into an outbreak.Nonetheless, Bhadelia and another expert told Live Science that the Missouri case raises other concerns — namely, that the U.S. is not tracking the spread of H5N1 closely enough to head off a potential epidemic. Related: H5N1: What to know about the bird flu cases in cows, goats and people The Missouri caseThe Missouri patient was hospitalized in August, marking the country's 14th H5N1 case overall and its first without any connection to sick animals at the person's workplace. The patient, who had underlying medical conditions, experienced chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and weakness. They were not severely ill during their hospital stay and have recovered.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The patient initially tested positive for influenza A, the broad group of viruses to which H5N1 belongs. This group also includes seasonal flu viruses, like H1N1, but the patient tested negative for those subtypes. Further testing then revealed H5N1. In a Sept. 13 update, the CDC reported that it had partially analyzed the genome of the virus; there was not enough genetic material for a complete sequence. The results showed that the virus that infected the Missouri patient bears high similarity to those circulating in cattle and hasn't mutated enough to be well adapted for infecting human lungs. Such mutations could pave the way for human-to-human transmission.H5N1 belongs to a very broad group of flu viruses known as "influenza A." Some influenza A viruses spread seasonally, but H5N1 does not. (Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)Despite these reassuring findings, Bhadelia argues that stakeholders involved in preparing for possible pandemics should find the Missouri case alarming.H5N1 has been circulating among birds in the U.S. since 2022, jumping into various mammals — including cows — since its introduction. The Missouri patient's infection likely came from infected cows but happened in a state that has not detected the virus in cattle, Bhadelia noted, even though Missouri has historically detected 600,000 infections in poultry. Infected herds may have slipped under the radar.Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology at Emory University who researches H5N1, said not enough cattle are undergoing tests to chart the virus's geographic distribution."The USDA [Department of Agriculture] is not doing enough testing — full stop," she told Live Science. "We do not have a good handle on how many cows are actually infected because there is no universal testing of dairy farms." As of July 12, Missouri had only tested 17 of their approximately 60,000 dairy cows, The Missouri Independent reported.Related: 'Increased evidence that we should be alert': H5N1 bird flu is adapting to mammals in 'new ways'Remaining unknownsThe CDC has not identified the source of transmission in the Missouri case. One possible source involves consuming raw (unpasteurized) cow milk, which the CDC warns against."An infected cow can have ten to hundreds of millions of particles of infectious virus per milliliter [of milk], and these animals are producing gallons of this," Lakdawala said. It's not known whether someone could catch bird flu from drinking raw milk, but the product can spread other germs. Raw milk left on milking equipment may be a way dairy workers get exposed.Raw milk could be a potential source of bird flu infection. Raw milk is not part of the commercial milk supply but can be bought from select suppliers within various states. (Image credit: RyanJLane/Getty Images)Humans could be another theoretical source of H5N1 infections — but as far as experts know, the virus has never spread between people. "One way I think we can clarify it is to rule out the human component by doing serologies [antibody tests] on everybody around the patient," Bhadelia said.One household contact of the Missouri patient developed "similar symptoms" the same day but was not tested for flu. Blood from that individual is now being tested for antibodies. Based on the timing of their illnesses, it's likely that the patient and household contact were simultaneously exposed to the same source of infection, rather than spreading the virus to one another, Lakdawala said. The CDC has said the same.Public health laboratories mostly test for H5N1 in people exposed to animals suspected of carrying the virus. If they detect H5N1, they ship the samples to the CDC for confirmatory testing. The CDC said it's partnering with biotechnology companies to enable earlier and more widespread testing.RELATED STORIES—1st polar bear death from bird flu spells trouble for species —H5N1 bird flu can remain infectious in raw milk for at least an hour, study finds—21-year-old student dies of H5N1 bird flu in VietnamThe CDC has also scaled up surveillance of the virus among people who interact with farm animals. Last week, it worked with the Ohio health officials to test veterinarians for antibodies while they'd congregated for a conference. Positive tests would help reveal which vets have previously been infected.Lakdawala argues that the USDA still needs to do more to understand how the virus spreads among cattle. "What the USDA needs to be doing right now, in my opinion, is working with all the state veterinarians and state agricultural departments," she said. They should go into every farm and bulk-test milk tankers, she proposed. Only 50 herds from 14 states have been enrolled in the USDA's voluntary Dairy Herd Status Program, which bulk tests milk tanks each week. Missouri has not participated.Editor's Note: This story was updated on Monday, Sept. 30 at 3:00 p.m. EDT to note that four more health care workers showed respiratory symptoms after caring for the Missouri case, and that antibody testing will help determine if person-to-person transmission of H5N1 is occurring.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Are you or a loved one feeling a bit under the weather? There are many different respiratory viruses out there, and symptoms can often overlap. Protect yourself and those around you by making note of your symptoms and taking proper precautions. Learn about the similarities and differences between COVID, flu, RSV, and allergies. COVID symptoms often appear very similar to the flu, but there are some notable differences. The symptoms of COVID often take longer to develop and can be more severe. Loss of taste or smell may be an early indicator that you have COVID. Don't take the flu lightly, though. Symptoms can often develop quickly and can be serious. Most children get RSV by the time they turn two, but you can get the virus at any age. While symptoms are mild for many, it can be very serious for high-risk individuals, especially infants who are born premature. Allergies can come in many different forms, and symptoms often occur after exposure to the allergen. These are only a few of the many respiratory viruses out there. So how can you keep up and stay safe? Stay up to date on your recommended vaccinations, stay home and isolate yourself when you're symptomatic, practice proper hand hygiene and disinfect surfaces, and as always, contact your doctor if you are feeling sick or symptoms worsen. [MUSIC PLAYING]How can you tell if you have the flu, COVID-19, seasonal allergies or a different virus? The best way to tell what kind of respiratory virus you have is to get tested. Symptoms can be nearly impossible to tell apart. This is especially true between COVID-19 and the flu, with the notable exception that some people with COVID-19 lose their sense of taste and smell. Add in the fact that people can have one of these two viruses without symptoms, and it’s basically impossible to tell one from the other on your own. Testing determines the best treatment for your symptoms and how long you should stay home from work or school. The good news is that many health care providers who are doing coronavirus tests should be able to test you for the flu at the same time. There are many other viruses that can cause respiratory symptoms, so even if you test negative for COVID and flu, you should practice good respiratory hygiene: cover your cough, throw tissues away after use, wash your hands frequently. Are there new RSV vaccines available for adults? Since 2023, there have been ways to protect infants and loved ones from RSV during virus season. Nirsevimab is a one-time injection that provides immediate protection to infants 0 to 8 months old and reduces risk of RSV-related hospitalization significantly. All infants born at Comer Children’s and Ingalls Memorial during RSV season will be offered this injection. Infants less than 8 months old at the start of RSV season can receive nirsevimab from their pediatrician, and it can be given along with other routine immunizations. UChicago Medicine is also offering two RSV vaccinations to eligible adults. A vaccine known as Abrysvo is available to pregnant individuals between their 32nd and 36th weeks. UChicago Medicine patients over 75 and those 60 to 74 at risk for severe RSV disease can also receive an RSV vaccine known as Arexvy, if they have not received one before. Does COVID-19 or influenza pose a greater risk for people this season? Either virus can make you very sick or lead to death, which is why it’s essential to get vaccinated and also to avoid close contact with others when sick. There are definitely populations that are more at risk for severe complications from each infection. Older adults and people with chronic underlying health conditions seem to be much more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19. And kids, especially infants under 1, and pregnant women are more likely to have severe infections with influenza. Does having COVID-19 give you any antibodies against a respiratory virus like the flu? Unfortunately not. Having one virus does not protect you from the other. What steps can you take to avoid getting COVID-19 and the flu? Many of the steps we take to protect ourselves from the coronavirus are the same things we need to do to keep us safe from influenza. The most important thing you can do to keep yourself and those around you safe from both viruses is to stay up-to-date on your COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. You should get a flu shot even if you’ve already had the flu this season. The vaccine prevents against three different strains of the virus. Practicing these good habits is also a great way to stay healthy: If you’re feeling ill, keep your distance from others and avoid close contact with those who may have COVID-19 or the flu. Wash your hands often to prevent the spread of the virus. Cover your mouth when sneezing and keep from rubbing your eyes, mouth and nose. Will the flu shot protect me against the coronavirus? The flu shot can help prevent people from becoming sick from influenza but won’t provide specific protection against COVID-19. And the COVID-19 vaccine alone will not prevent you from getting the flu. It is strongly recommended that you receive both vaccines for maximum protection. Can Tamiflu or the flu shot treat COVID-19? Tamiflu or a flu shot will not directly treat or lessen the symptoms of COVID-19. But you can get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, which can help prevent an infection and lessen severity. And if you get sick with influenza or have been exposed to it, you can take antiviral medication like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to prevent getting sick. COVID-19 treatment options are available and vary depending on the severity of your symptoms and health history. Antiviral treatments can help prevent the virus from spreading and avoid serious illness. What should you do if you develop influenza or COVID-19 symptoms? If you have any symptoms, stay home, stay away from other people and try to isolate yourself to prevent the spread to others. Try to get tested within 48 hours of the start of your symptoms. If it’s influenza, your health care provider can prescribe medication to help your symptoms improve faster. If it’s COVID-19, your health care provider may recommend one of the treatment options referenced above. Will the pneumonia vaccine protect me against the flu or COVID-19? The pneumonia vaccine helps protect against a variety of bacteria that can cause bacterial pneumonia. The pneumonia vaccine won’t prevent flu or COVID-19, but it can help prevent complications that may come after. Can I boost my immune systems to protect against flu or COVID-19? We wish there were a list of things we could do to help our immune systems prevent us from getting sick with the flu or the coronavirus. But there’s no magic immune-boosting drug — only vaccination. Instead, focus on eating a healthy, varied diet and getting enough sleep. Also, make sure you’ve got any chronic medical conditions under control. Can I do anything to decrease my chance of getting very sick if I’ve been exposed? Once an exposure to COVID-19 has happened, there’s not a lot we can do to modify who gets sick from it. If you have been exposed to influenza, your physician may give you some medication like Relenza (zanamivir), Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Rapivab (peramivir) within 48 hours of exposure. However, the best thing you can do is focus on avoiding exposure.Allison Bartlett, MD, MSAllison Bartlett, MD, MS, specializes in the medical management of acute and chronic infectious diseases.

The cases bring total US bird flu infections among people in contact with dairy cows and poultry to 15 this year. Another person in Missouri who had no immediate known contact with animals has also tested positive. The virus' jump to cattle in 14 states and infections of farm workers have concerned scientists and federal officials about the risks to humans from further spread. There is no known link or contact between the two human cases in California, suggesting only animal-to-human spread of the virus in the state, the California Department of Public Health said in a statement. One infected person, identified as a dairy worker, only suffered conjunctivitis, or pink eye, the department said. The person is being treated with antiviral medication and staying home, it added. The person works at a Central Valley dairy facility suffering an outbreak of bird flu in cattle, according to the statement. The second person also was described as a Central Valley individual and experienced mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis, the department said. It said neither person reported respiratory symptoms nor was hospitalized. Cows at dairy farms in California began testing positive for bird flu in late August. Pasteurized milk and dairy products continue to be safe to consume, the department said. "The risk to the general public remains low, although people who interact with infected animals are at higher risk of getting bird flu," the department said. Missouri last month confirmed bird flu in a person with underlying medical conditions who had no immediate known animal exposure. Six healthcare workers who cared for the Missouri patient developed respiratory symptoms, but the virus was not confirmed in any of them. Scientists are watching closely for signs that the virus has begun to spread more easily in people. The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said it would begin testing raw cow's milk intended for pasteurization at dairy plants to better understand the prevalence of the bird flu virus in milk. Participation in the study, set to begin Oct. 28, is voluntary and pasteurized dairy products remain safe to consume, the agency said. Prior FDA testing of retail dairy samples came back negative, and more such testing is underway.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News You Can Soon Give Yourself a Flu Nasal Spray Vaccine at Home By Korin Miller Published on September 30, 2024 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Joe Raedle / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways The FDA has approved FluMist, a nasal spray flu vaccine, for self-administration.Healthy individuals aged 2 to 49 can use FluMist, but people with specific medical conditions or health concerns should consult a healthcare provider before use.The effectiveness of FluMist is similar to the traditional flu shot and protects against severe flu complications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first-ever influenza vaccine that can be administered at home. It’s a nasal spray vaccine called FluMist, and it’s been available in doctor’s offices and pharmacies for years. The approval “provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility, and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Here’s what you need to know about administering FluMist at home. What Is FluMist and Who Can Use It?? FluMist is a live attenuated flu vaccine. Meaning, it uses a weakened version of the flu to encourage your body to mount an immune response. The flu shot does not use a live version of the influenza virus. FluMist is approved for use in healthy people between the ages of 2 to 49. Aside from age, people who should not get the FluMist vaccine include: People with a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredient of the vaccine (except for egg protein) or to a previous dose of any flu vaccine.People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccinations.Children aged 2 through 17 who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications. People in certain categories or parents of children or teens with any of the following conditions should check with their healthcare provider about whether it's safe to get FluMist: Children under age 5 who have asthma or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months.People who are currently wheezingPeople who have asthmaPeople who have had Guillain-Barré syndromePeople who have a weakened immune system or live with someone who has a severely weakened immune systemPeople who have problems with their heart, kidneys, or lungsPeople who have diabetesPeople who are pregnant or nursingPeople who have taking antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza Understanding Flu Vaccine Effectiveness How Effective Is FluMist Compared to a Flu Shot? The effectiveness of FluMist has varied over time. Previous research found that the vaccine was not as effective as the flu shot against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses, leading federal health officials to recommend against using FluMist for the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 seasons. But the nasal spray vaccine has since been updated with new influenza A(H1N1) vaccine virus ingredients, giving it similar protection as the flu shot. “The efficacy is considered to be comparable,” said Amesh A. Adalja, MD, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. As a result, it’s been recommended for use to prevent the flu and protect against serious complications of influenza since the 2018-2019 flu season. As for how effective FluMist is, it’s lumped in with data for the flu shot from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Based on that data, the flu vaccines were 42% effective at preventing the flu during the 2023-2024 season and 30% effective during the 2022-2023 season. It’s important to note that these numbers only reflect how many people actually got the flu who were vaccinated against it, said John Sellick, DO, an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo. The vaccine is still “highly protective” against severe complications of the flu, he added. How to Take an At-Home Flu Test How Do You Administer FluMist at Home? FluMist is given with a spray in each nostril. “The process is not too complicated,” Sellick said. The sprayer comes with a dose divider to let users know how much to give in each nostril. To use it, spray half of the contents in one nostril and then the other half in the other nostril. What Are the Risks of FluMist? The FluMist vaccine comes with several potential side effects. Those include: Runny noseNasal congestionFever over 100 degreesSore throat How Much Does FluMist Cost? Currently, private health insurance companies are required to cover the cost of FluMist when it’s given by a healthcare provider. But it’s not clear how much the at-home version of FluMist will cost or if it will be covered by insurance. “I suspected insurance will cover it, but that may vary depending on the plan,” Adalja said. Sellick also stresses that cost is uncertain at this point. “The key thing that usually drives all of this is what Medicare says, and the vaccine is not indicated in that group,” he said. (Medicare is designed for people aged 65 and up.) How Deadly Is the Flu? Where Can You Get FluMist? The home version of FluMist will not be available until next flu season. However, for the current flu season, FluMist is available from local pharmacies and healthcare providers. FluMist manufacturer AstraZeneca plans to provide the home version of the vaccine through a third-party online pharmacy. To receive it, you’ll need to go through a screening and eligibility assessment before the pharmacy will write a prescription and send the vaccine to you. Doctors are uncertain how much this will impact flu vaccination rates in the future. “I suspect that this will have a marginal effect on flu vaccine uptake rates in the near term, but it may become a pular for certain people to get their flu vaccine,” Adalja said.

For now, though, you’ll still need to see a healthcare provider to get vaccinated. 5 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

What High-Risk Patients Should Know 9/30/2024 facebooktwitterlinkedInemail Influenza remains a serious public health threat. As of June 15, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated there were between 35-65 million flu illnesses, 390,000-830,000 flu hospitalizations and 25,000-72,000 flu deaths during the 2023-2024 flu season in the United States.1The concern intensifies when we consider that certain conditions can result in a higher risk of complications from the flu, including:2Heart Disease: Among adults hospitalized with flu during recent flu seasons, heart disease was one of the most common chronic conditionsâabout 50% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to CDC had heart disease.3 Studies have also shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke.3Asthma: Even if the asthma is mild or symptoms are well-controlled by medication, people with asthma are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications.4 People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs.4 Flu can also trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms, and in some cases, even lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases.4 Diabetes: People with diabetes (type 1, 2 or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization and sometimes, even death.5 In recent seasons, about 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to CDC had diabetes.5 Acute illnesses like flu can make it harder to control blood sugar levels too.5 Flu may raise a patientâs blood sugar levels, however illness may result in reduced appetite, and a reduced appetite can cause blood sugar levels to fall.5 Older Adults: People 65 years and older are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications compared with young, healthy adults, due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age.6 Though flu can vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu.6 In recent years, itâs estimated that between 70â85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and between 50â70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group.6In fact, it's estimated 90% of flu hospitalizations are of people living with at least one chronic medical condition.7 Sanofiâs Commitment to Flu Protection As one of the first worldwide suppliers of the influenza vaccines, and now, with over 70 years of innovation in influenza vaccines, Sanofi remains committed to protecting populations against the flu, and especially those at risk.8 Vaccination is especially important for those who are at an increased risk of serious complications from the flu and flu vaccines remain one of the best defenses against the respiratory virus, but not all flu vaccines are the same.2FluzoneÂ® High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) is the #1 administered flu vaccine over 659Fluzone High-Dose is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B virus contained in the vaccine.10 Fluzone High-Dose vaccine is given to people 65 years of age and older.10 Fluzone High-Dose should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including eggs or egg products, or after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.10 Please see additional Important Safety Information below.Fluzone High-Dose is the #1 administered flu vaccine for those over 65 (Internal calculations by Sanofi based on IQVIA database of total flu vaccines administered from 7/23 to 4/24 in people 65+. Not inclusive of all federal payers. Study details and information maintained by Sanofi).9 Fluzone High-Dose is the first and only high-dose flu vaccine clinically proven to provide superior flu protection in people 65+ compared to a standard-dose flu vaccine.10,11 In a randomized, controlled trial conducted in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 in approximately 32,000 adults 65+, Fluzone High-Dose was 24% (95% CI: 10,37) more effective (rVE) against influenza due to ANY lab- confirmed circulating strains than standard-dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine).11 The prespecified statistical superiority criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of 2-sided 95% CI of the vaccine efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose relative to Fluzone >9.1%) was met.11 Solicited systemic adverse reactions and solicited injection-site reactions were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose as compared with a standard dose vaccine in a phase 3 safety study conducted during the 2006-2007 season.12A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies to evaluate the relative vaccine effectiveness of Fluzone High-Dose vs standard-dose influenza vaccines against influenza-associated outcomes in more than 45 million adults aged 65+ was conducted over 12 influenza seasons (2009-2010 to 2019-2020 and 2021-2022).13âItâs incredibly important to remember that not all flu vaccines are created the same, and itâs important for older adults to consider higher dose flu vaccines like Fluzone High-Dose. As we know, flu-related complications can become severe, particularly in at-risk patient populations, and the type of protection they get matters. Member pharmacies of the VMC Pharmacy Program, an independent community pharmacy buying group, stock and are able to provide these and other higher-dose vaccines to their patients.â â Adam Salus, VMC Pharmacy Operations Manager VMC.With four times the antigen,11 Fluzone High-Dose was designated as one of the preferred, recommended options for adults over 65 beginning in 2022 by the CDCâs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).14Considering the amount of severe flu cases each year, understanding expert recommendations and the latest options for flu vaccines is critical, especially for healthcare professionals counseling the most at-risk groups. While every flu season is unpredictable, getting a flu vaccine doesnât have to be. Itâs important for healthcare providers to communicate to patients that the vaccine they take matters and prioritize finding the most appropriate vaccine option tailored to them.

Ebola. Influenza. There are, as American Public Health Association Executive Director Dr. Georges Benjamin puts it, “a lot of bad bugs out there.” And as a nation still reeling from a deadly pandemic that killed more than 1 million Americans, those in the infectious disease realm are contemplating what the next pandemic might be. Experts differ on which pathogen might cause the next global outbreak. But they agree there will be one – and probably sooner than later. A recent survey of 187 infectious disease experts from around the world ranks influenza as the most likely bug to cause another pandemic. Disease X – described as an illness caused by an as-yet-unknown pathogen – came in second, followed by Covid, according to the survey published in the January-February 2024 issue of the Elsevier Journal ScienceDirect. While there are dozens of possibilities, Benjamin says influenza is still probably the best bet for the next pandemic. “Influenza sticks around. It circulates. It mutates. It’s easy to catch. And on a periodic basis, the genetic structure of this virus makes a major shift and becomes a lot more lethal or infectious – or sometimes both,” he said. “There are lots of other infectious agents out there,” he added, “but none have been as durable as influenza.” Influenza is also at the top of the list for Dr. Michael Sweat, faculty director at the Medical University of South Carolina Center for Global Health. “Of particular note right now is bird flu,” said Sweat, also director of the Division of Global and Community Health in the Department of Psychiatry. Indeed, the World Health Organization says avian flu viruses are “a significant public health risk due to their widespread circulation in animals and potential to cause a future pandemic.” Avian flu has had a terrible impact on the bird population, resulting in the deaths of millions of birds, Sweat said. “But it’s begun to leap over into mammals, and most recently dairy production cattle have been infected, and that’s led to some infections in humans,” he added. “It’s been quite limited. But it’s concerning because as it spreads, influenza virus is known to mutate heavily.” And the more it mutates, he said, the more likely it is that it could evolve into a strain that is transmissible between humans. But Dr. Helmut Albrecht, medical director of the Center of Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at Prisma Health, has another take on what might cause the next pandemic. “I would go with Disease X,” he said. “Influenza is so much more manageable. We have the tools to stop the flu much quicker.” Disease X typically originates in bats or some other animal and crosses over to humans, who have no natural immunity to it, he said. And the rate and volume of worldwide travel can cause it to spread quickly, he said. “You can now get around the globe in hours,” he said. “And how many planes land in the U.S. every day?” “We have a hugely integrated jet-based lifestyle with much more migration and leisure travel to remote parts of the world,” Sweat agrees. “That allows things to transmit much faster than in the past.” Still, he added, while a Disease X is always a worry, they don’t tend to emerge that frequently. All the doctors agree that if the next pandemic is caused by influenza, the world will be better able to tackle it than a Disease X. As a result, they say, it would never result in an outbreak like the one in 1918, which caused 50 million deaths worldwide, according to the National Archives. “The difference is that then they didn’t know what they had, they didn’t know about viruses,” said Benjamin. “We have antiviral agents, and we have vaccines against influenza which we did not have then. And while we have had outbreaks of influenza since, we have been able to control them because we have these therapeutic agents.” In addition to vaccines, antivirals, and increased knowledge, Sweat said, there is a well-established surveillance system for influenza that could pick up a particularly virulent strain early. “There’s a lot of (avian flu) monitoring going on,” he said. “And it’s not currently a major threat to human health.” Albrecht agrees that there are helpful interventions for the flu, even avian flu, that mean medicine is much more prepared to react than if something like Ebola becomes more transmissible. So far, at least, the few cases of avian influenza in humans have been through occupational exposures among people who worked in poultry factories or around cows, Benjamin said, adding that so far it’s not spread by respiratory routes. The challenge is when these viruses spread to other species, the doctors said. “It’s a sign that that virus is adapting to other animals, and that enhances its ability to mutate,” Benjamin said. “And a big concern with avian influenza – just like human flu we see every year – is as it goes through various species it affects, it’s only a few mutations away from being more infectious or more lethal.” While there is some concern about avian flu spreading through milk, he said studies show that routine pasteurization done in the U.S. reduces infectivity. And to limit the spread between cows, he said, dairy farmers may have to sterilize the milking equipment as opposed to the cleaning process they use now. When a flock of chickens is infected, historically farmers cull the herd to try to control the spread, which is a big economic loss, Benjamin said. But while there are ways to vaccinate flocks, it’s expensive, he added. Another concern, he said, is that flu vaccine is made by incubating it in eggs, and healthy flocks are needed for that. It’s a time-consuming process that has failed in the past requiring restarts, sometimes delaying vaccine production, he said. Covid-19, its precursor SARS-CoV-1 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, are all coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks that occurred roughly nine years apart, Sweat said. A SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in Hong Kong and Toronto had a mortality rate of about 20 percent, he said. MERS, which is spread by camels and is circulating at a low level, has a mortality rate of about 60 percent, he said. “We’ve been having a serious outbreak almost every decade of a coronavirus,” Sweat said. “So, I would rank another coronavirus high on that list.” With all the advances made with Covid, though, such as the development of the mRNA vaccines, which he called a real breakthrough, the world should be much better prepared for another coronavirus, he said. But vaccine uptake is always key in controlling outbreaks, Benjamin said, noting that some years only 40 percent to 50 percent of the population gets a flu shot. “We are still dealing with convincing people that mRNA vaccine is safe and effective,” he said. “And there is still some pushback from people who don’t want to use mRNA vaccine for some reason.” “It’s a major concern in public health,” he said. “Vaccines are pretty carefully vetted … and on balance, the risk benefit ratio is enormously beneficial.” It’s a tough problem, fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories, Sweat said. “It’s a shame because if we do have a major outbreak, vaccination is our most potent aspect,” he said. “The alternative is people will get infected, and suffer the consequences.” A study from The Commonwealth Fund concluded that the Covid vaccines “prevented more than 18.5 million U.S. hospitalizations and 3.2 million deaths, and saved the nation $1.15 trillion” by the end of November 2022. The doctors say that effective mRNA vaccines are being developed for influenza as well. “That is really important not only for influenza, but all sorts of other pathogens,” Sweat said, noting that warming global temperatures also have been linked to large outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases like Zika and Dengue in South Asia and Brazil. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is looking to accelerate the development and accessibility of an mRNA vaccine for human avian influenza. “This initiative exemplifies why WHO established the mRNA Technology Transfer Programme – to foster greater research, development and production in low- and middle-income countries, so that when the next pandemic arrives, the world will be better prepared to mount a more effective and more equitable response," Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said in a release. The doctors say there’s no way to know how deadly a new pandemic would be or when it would occur. “The risk of a pandemic can be months away or a few years away. It depends on the virus,” said Benjamin. “The ideal virus that causes a pandemic is one that makes a lot of people sick and is easily transmissible before you have a lot of symptoms,” he said. “About 50 percent of people were asymptomatic (during the Covid pandemic) and were able to spread it.” “It’s always hard to know,” Sweat said, “but these are certainly things we worry about.” “It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when,” said Albrecht. “And I think it’ll happen sooner because of our mobility and accessibility to remote regions.” But the key, the doctors all agree, is being vigilant and prepared for whatever comes next. “We need to keep stockpiles of important vaccines available and have a supply of masks and respirators,” Sweat said, adding that was not the case for Covid. “My pet peeve is that you have to make public health a first responder,” said Albrecht, who is also the Heyward Gibbes Distinguished Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of South Carolina. The U.S. is one of the few countries that starts revving up for a public health crisis when it happens rather than maintaining a baseline of readiness, he said. He compares it to selling off fire trucks after putting out a blaze only to have to buy them again when the next fire breaks out. “When we have a disease 90 percent on its knees, we stop funding (public health),” he said. “And if you react to an outbreak when it’s happening, it will kill people. Then, it’s a little late.” Public health needs to maintain software and hardware, monitor waste water for pathogens, and continue surveillance around the world, among other things, he said. “For a country like ours, with our ability and financial power, to have over a million dead from Covid … is a horrible result,” he said. “If you can find it early where you can stop it, it will cost a lot less than on the backend – and fewer lives too.” To read the survey, go to Predicting the next pandemic: VACCELERATE ranking of the World Health Organization's Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics - ScienceDirect Health Care pandemic Medical University of South Carolina Center for Global Health Upcoming Events Near You 13 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 14 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 15 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 20 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 21 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 22 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center 27 "The Word Made Visible" & "Piercing the Veil" art exhibits 10:00am · The Bowie Arts Center View All Add Your Event Greenville Business Magazine News Viewpoints The Business Narrative Money Technology Economic Development Health Care Government/Politics Start-Ups Education Real Estate New Hires and Promotions Directory Awards Calendar Nominate SC Women in History The Rippling Effect Sponsored Content 2024 | Powered by Locable | Terms of Service Submit an Event List Your Business Login/JoinCDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident • North Dakota Monitor HOME NEWS Government & Politics Energy & Environment Agriculture Education Justice Decision 2024 Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Government & Politics Energy & Environment Agriculture Education Justice Decision 2024 15:36 News Story AgricultureD.C. Bureau CDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident By: Jennifer Shutt - October 4, 2024 3:36 pm A case of bird flu in a Missouri resident is the only diagnosis in the United States this year where the person did not have contact with infected dairy cattle or poultry. (Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Animal Research Services, USDA) WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have results later this month that provide more insight into how a Missouri resident, who hadn’t had any contact with infected animals or food, contracted a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said on a call with reporters Friday the agency is working through its investigation of that bird flu case, while providing several more details. “As we previously reported, CDC would be able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample,” Daskalakis said. That process is complex and time-consuming, in part because the patient had rather small amounts of the virus in their system when the test was taken. Another contributing factor, he said, is “that the virus has two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the viruses previously characterized during this event that could affect antigenicity.” Daskalakis explained that antigenicity is when someone is able to produce “a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies.” Both the mutations and small sample size have presented challenges for the CDC, but the agency expects to announce results of the test later this month after completing the complicated lab process, he said. Two cases in California The Missouri case is the only bird flu diagnosis in the United States this year where the person hadn’t had direct contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle. The remainder of the 16 people diagnosed with H5N1 during this calendar year had direct contact with farm animals, with nine of those cases linked to poultry and six related to dairy cows. One of those cases was diagnosed in Texas, two in Michigan, two in California just this week and 10 in Colorado. Public health officials on the call emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low and that several studies undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration show pasteurized dairy products as well as other foods remain safe to eat. Since February, the CDC has tested more than 50,000 samples that would have “detected Influenza A, H5 or other novel influenza viruses,” Daskalakis said. The Missouri case was the first case of bird flu detected through that influenza surveillance system, he said. Public health officials at the state and federal level have been trying to determine how the Missouri patient, who officials are not identifying for their privacy, contracted the virus through a series of “intense interviews,” Daskalakis said. That is how they learned someone living in the same house had been symptomatic with various gastrointestinal issues at the same time the patient had been ill. That simultaneous onset of symptoms implied “a common exposure, rather than human-to-human transmission,” Daskalakis said, before reinforcing that the second person never tested positive for the virus and isn’t considered a case of bird flu. “At the time of the interview, the household contact had also completely recovered and had not been tested for influenza while they were sick,” he said. “To be clear, there is only one case of H5N1 influenza detected in Missouri.” Because the person living in the same house as the Missouri patient had been symptom-free for more than 10 days when they were interviewed by public health officials, Daskalakis said there was “no utility in testing the contact for acute influenza.” Instead, officials in Missouri took blood samples from the two people so the CDC could test for “antibodies against H5 to assess for possible infection with this virus,” he said. A separate investigation was taken at the hospital where the Missouri patient had been diagnosed to see if any health care workers had contracted H5N1. Out of 118 health care workers who interacted with the patient in some way, 18 had higher-risk interactions before the patient was diagnosed and began using what Daskalakis referred to as “droplet precautions.” Six of those health care workers later developed respiratory symptoms, though only one of them had symptoms by the time the public health investigation had begun retroactively, he said. That one person’s PCR test for acute influenza came back negative and the other five health care workers, who had recovered, did not require a PCR test, he said. “Since exposures could only be assessed retrospectively, Missouri has also obtained blood specimens from these individuals for antibody or serology testing at CDC to search for any evidence to support the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient,” Daskalakis said. “Despite the low risk, this testing is important to complete the public health investigation of this case.” The CDC began working on that serology testing in mid-September when it received the samples from Missouri, though the complicated process likely won’t conclude until later in October. “For serology testing to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or there is a risk of a false negative test,” Daskalakis said. “Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough for the Missouri specimen.” The CDC, he explained, has to “create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri, so that we can use it in these serology tests.” “We realize people, including all of us at CDC, are anxious to see results from this testing,” he said. “CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.” Poultry, dairy cases In addition to human cases, bird flu continues to infect poultry flocks and dairy herds within the United States. While the poultry industry has had years of experience supplying its workers with personal protective equipment and culling affected farms, the dairy industry has had to figure out how to address the virus this year. Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said on the call Friday that Colorado’s mandatory testing program of bulk milk tanks, which began in July, offered a hopeful case study for ridding farms throughout the country of H5N1. “Initially, this revealed a significant local prevalence, about 72% of dairies, centered in Weld County,” Deeble said. But following months of hard work by farmers and public health officials, Colorado has just one dairy herd that’s currently affected by H5N1 out of 86 dairy herds within the state, he said. “Mandatory surveillance in the state allows for continuous monitoring of herds and helps detect any instances of non-negative results early on, ensuring timely intervention,” Deeble said. “This decrease in Colorado cases, even in the absence of a vaccine, gives us further confidence that H5N1 can be eliminated in the national herd, even in places where we have seen an initial rapid increase in cases.” Data from the USDA show that during the past month, three dairy herds in Idaho and 53 in California have tested positive for H5N1. XCDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident by Jennifer Shutt, North Dakota Monitor October 4, 2024 CDC conducting extensive probe into bird flu contracted by Missouri resident by Jennifer Shutt, North Dakota Monitor October 4, 2024 WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have results later this month that provide more insight into how a Missouri resident, who hadn’t had any contact with infected animals or food, contracted a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said on a call with reporters Friday the agency is working through its investigation of that bird flu case, while providing several more details. “As we previously reported, CDC would be able to perform partial sequencing of the avian influenza H5 virus from the case in Missouri, despite a nearly undetectable level of viral RNA in the patient sample,” Daskalakis said. That process is complex and time-consuming, in part because the patient had rather small amounts of the virus in their system when the test was taken. Another contributing factor, he said, is “that the virus has two potentially important mutations, meaning two amino acid differences, in comparison with the viruses previously characterized during this event that could affect antigenicity.” Daskalakis explained that antigenicity is when someone is able to produce “a specific immune response, such as creation of specific antibodies.” Both the mutations and small sample size have presented challenges for the CDC, but the agency expects to announce results of the test later this month after completing the complicated lab process, he said. Two cases in California The Missouri case is the only bird flu diagnosis in the United States this year where the person hadn’t had direct contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle. The remainder of the 16 people diagnosed with H5N1 during this calendar year had direct contact with farm animals, with nine of those cases linked to poultry and six related to dairy cows. One of those cases was diagnosed in Texas, two in Michigan, two in California just this week and 10 in Colorado. Public health officials on the call emphasized that the risk to the general public remains low and that several studies undertaken by the Food and Drug Administration show pasteurized dairy products as well as other foods remain safe to eat. Since February, the CDC has tested more than 50,000 samples that would have “detected Influenza A, H5 or other novel influenza viruses,” Daskalakis said. The Missouri case was the first case of bird flu detected through that influenza surveillance system, he said. Public health officials at the state and federal level have been trying to determine how the Missouri patient, who officials are not identifying for their privacy, contracted the virus through a series of “intense interviews,” Daskalakis said. That is how they learned someone living in the same house had been symptomatic with various gastrointestinal issues at the same time the patient had been ill. That simultaneous onset of symptoms implied “a common exposure, rather than human-to-human transmission,” Daskalakis said, before reinforcing that the second person never tested positive for the virus and isn’t considered a case of bird flu. “At the time of the interview, the household contact had also completely recovered and had not been tested for influenza while they were sick,” he said. “To be clear, there is only one case of H5N1 influenza detected in Missouri.” Because the person living in the same house as the Missouri patient had been symptom-free for more than 10 days when they were interviewed by public health officials, Daskalakis said there was “no utility in testing the contact for acute influenza.” Instead, officials in Missouri took blood samples from the two people so the CDC could test for “antibodies against H5 to assess for possible infection with this virus,” he said. A separate investigation was taken at the hospital where the Missouri patient had been diagnosed to see if any health care workers had contracted H5N1. Out of 118 health care workers who interacted with the patient in some way, 18 had higher-risk interactions before the patient was diagnosed and began using what Daskalakis referred to as “droplet precautions.” Six of those health care workers later developed respiratory symptoms, though only one of them had symptoms by the time the public health investigation had begun retroactively, he said. That one person’s PCR test for acute influenza came back negative and the other five health care workers, who had recovered, did not require a PCR test, he said. “Since exposures could only be assessed retrospectively, Missouri has also obtained blood specimens from these individuals for antibody or serology testing at CDC to search for any evidence to support the unlikely possibility that their symptoms were related to H5 infection resulting from their interaction with the patient,” Daskalakis said. “Despite the low risk, this testing is important to complete the public health investigation of this case.” The CDC began working on that serology testing in mid-September when it received the samples from Missouri, though the complicated process likely won’t conclude until later in October. “For serology testing to be conclusive, it needs to be done using a virus that is genetically identical to the one obtained from the human case from Missouri or there is a risk of a false negative test,” Daskalakis said. “Since this H5 virus was not recoverable, we could not grow it because there was not enough for the Missouri specimen.” The CDC, he explained, has to “create the right virus for the test using reverse genetics to match the one from Missouri, so that we can use it in these serology tests.” “We realize people, including all of us at CDC, are anxious to see results from this testing,” he said. “CDC is moving at a very accelerated pace while conducting rigorous science to assure the validity of these results.” Poultry, dairy cases In addition to human cases, bird flu continues to infect poultry flocks and dairy herds within the United States.

Meet the chief investigators and learn about how their five year, $5 million projects will tackle big scientific questions with innovative and collaborative approaches. Beating cancer with our immune system and new vaccines Professor Marie-Liesse Asselin-Labat’s team will investigate how cancer evades our immune system to uncover how immunotherapies and vaccines can be made more effective. Immunotherapies have revolutionised cancer treatment. Why do only some patients respond positively to these treatments? This is the big question in the field and what we are hoping to help address in this grant. There are multiple factors necessary to have a good immune response against cancer cells during treatment with immunotherapy. For example, immune cells need to be able to both get into the tumour and recognise tumour cells as ‘bad cells’ to be eliminated. Tumour cells utilise a number of ways to avoid being targeted and destroyed by the immune system, and we are hoping to understand what those are and how we can develop therapies to improve immune response against cancer. What is your team hoping to understand about T cells, that will help improve immunotherapies for cancer? T cells are a type of immune cell that orchestrates the body’s immune response, helping fight infection and disease. We hope to understand how to activate T cells that attack tumour cells, but also how we can inactivate a subset of T cells, called regulatory T cells, that prevent other T cells being active against the tumour. One of the big challenges is that T cells activated by immunotherapy become ‘exhausted’. We need to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for this exhaustion, so we can prevent or revert it. What role could mRNA vaccines play in future cancer treatments? There is a lot of excitement around mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment. There are some studies in melanoma showing a positive response to cancer vaccines and ongoing clinical trials by BioNtech and AstraZeneca in lung cancer. These are therapeutic vaccines, not prophylactic vaccines like the ones we have for flu or COVID-19. However we have little understanding of how the immune system and cancer cells will respond and adapt to cancer vaccines. By understanding in detail the cellular response to cancer vaccines we hope to be able to develop a more efficacious and long-lasting vaccine. Our team will also work on developing a better formulation for vaccines so they are more effective and less toxic. Looking forward five years to the end of this project, what do you hope to have found? By the end of the five years, we hope to have a deep understanding of tumour and immune cell behaviours in response to immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines. We hope the research will identify novel therapeutic targets to boost the immune system against cancer cells and facilitate the access of immune cells inside the tumour to induce tumour cell killing. ‘Identifying and overcoming mechanisms of immune evasion in cancer’ is led by WEHI in partnership with the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Monash University, Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute and Austin Health. Towards ‘game-changing’ universal vaccines for coronaviruses and influenza Associate Professor Joanna Groom and her team will try to crack the code on how to make vaccines for respiratory viral infections more effective and long-lasting. Why is it a challenge to create vaccines for viruses like influenza and coronavirus? To combat emerging and mutagenic viruses (ones that mutate to generate new variants), there is an urgent need to develop vaccines that provide broad and long-lived protection against complete classes of viruses, such as coronaviruses and influenza. Development of these universal vaccines would be a game-changer for the prevention of infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness. However, we don’t currently understand how to develop vaccines that consistently establish long-lived protection to make this a reality. How do you think your team can change this? We will test how different vaccine designs alter the breadth of vaccine responses that lead to protection in both humans and pre-clinical models. Our multidisciplinary approach will deliver a “rulebook” that guides vaccine design, identify biomarkers of protection and accelerate vaccine development. What is the power of working with a multidisciplinary team across a number of different organisations? The power of our team lies in our diverse training that synergises to address this complex, urgent need. We have diverse expertise in immunology and infectious disease, drug delivery and pharmacokinetics, mathematical modelling, vaccine design and policy, as well support from clinical, policy and industry partners. Linking previously unassociated disciplines will allow us to establish the underlying mechanisms of long-lived vaccine protection, and speed up the development of universal vaccines. What do you hope will be the legacy of this five-year project? Our program will develop the first unified model of responses to novel mRNA and protein-based subunit vaccines. This will identify early biomarkers for clinical trials and improve vaccine formulations to expedite a new generation of vaccines that elicit long-lived protection. This project will fast-track vaccine clinical trials and provide insight into why particular vaccine platforms pass or fail development hurdles. Combined, this multidisciplinary approach will change the landscape of vaccine design, assessment, regulatory approval and improvement. ‘A mechanistic approach to next-generation vaccine design’ is led by WEHI and Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences in partnership with the University of Melbourne and the University of New South Wales. – Header image: Professor Marie-Liesse Asselin-Labat (left) and Associate Professor Joanna Groom (right) Share this article Link copied Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Related topics Immunology Immunotherapy Vaccine development News and features Key Researchers A/Prof Joanna Groom Laboratory Head Prof Marie-Liesse Labat Division Head Media Enquiries +61 475 751 811 communications@wehi.edu.au Share this article Link copied Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter Sections in this article Beating cancer with our immune system and new vaccines Towards ‘game-changing’ universal vaccines for coronaviruses and influenza Related articles News and features Collaborating for change: WEHI and DeadlyScience empower future scientists 24 October 2024 Parkinson’s disease Malaria News and features Celebrated ‘gene hunter’ joins remarkable women in honour roll 17 October 2024 News and features Masterpieces in groundbreaking medical research unveiled 15 October 2024 Brain cancer Cancer News and features Brain cancer trailblazer recognised as 2024 ATSE Fellow 02 October 2024 News and features Major $21m Colonial Foundation philanthropic investment to bring future science into disease diagnosis 19 September 2024 Cancer News and features Patients at heart for clinician-scientist 16 September 2024 View all news Support us Together we can create a brighter future Your support will help WEHI’s researchers make discoveries and find treatments to ensure healthier, longer lives for you and your loved ones.

Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MedImmune has received the Food and Drug Administration’s approval for self- or caregiver-administration of its FluMist nasal spray flu vaccine, meaning no physician needed. It is expected to be available through online pharmacies beginning next year. FluMist still needs a prescription and is approved for home administration for individuals 2 to 49 years old. Those administering the vaccine, either to themselves or someone else, must be at least 18 years old, and be required to complete a screening and eligibility assessment. Once approved, the vaccine will be shipped to the address provided with the order. For children 2 to 17 years old, the FDA said it should be administered by an adult caregiver. “(This) approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. MedImmune was acquired by AstraZeneca for $15.6 billion in 2007. FluMist was originally approved as an alternative to traditional influenza vaccine shots in 2003. It is sprayed directly into the nose. FluMist is a live attenuated influenza vaccine, meaning it contains a weakened version of the flu virus. Between 2010 and 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the flu resulted in 9.3 to 41 million illnesses annually, as many as 710,000 hospitalizations and 51,000 deaths annually.

With seasonal viruses approaching, UNMC Interim Chancellor Dele Davies, MD, and Jim Linder, MD, CEO of Nebraska Medicine, are sending out this joint message to the med center on vaccinations. Fall respiratory virus season is right around the corner. Since we are health care experts in our community, the public and our patients are looking to us to set the example by getting vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19. We know vaccination minimizes the spread of illness. It protects everyone – our community, families, colleagues, trainees and patients. It aligns with our mission to lead the world and create a healthy future for individuals and communities. It is also an important part of our commitment to Zero Harm. Additionally, we are required to report our vaccination rates to The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) every year. Here are the four things Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC faculty, staff and students should know about this year’s influenza and COVID-19 vaccines: Our goal is for at least 90% of Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC faculty, staff and students to receive the influenza vaccine. Nebraska Medicine colleagues and UNMC faculty, staff and students are expected to document their influenza and COVID-19 vaccination status in the Health Tracking System. If you receive the vaccine from an on-site clinic or through your clinical area, it will automatically be recorded for you. Log in to the Health Tracking System to record if you received the vaccination elsewhere (pharmacy, physician’s office, etc.) or declined the vaccination and provide a reason for declination. Drop-in vaccine clinics will be held at various locations across the system from Oct. 2 through Nov. 14. Remember to fill out your influenza questionnaire on the Health Tracking System before you arrive. To access the online Health Tracking System from off-network, follow these step-by-step instructions. Everyone is strongly encouraged to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines, but vaccination is not required. Due to supply chain issues, Nebraska Medicine has received a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines for colleague administration. Vaccines may not be available at all drop-in clinics. Read this UNMC Today article for more information. All Nebraska Medicine colleagues and any UNMC students or staff who are fitted to wear an N95 respirator are also expected to fill out their annual symptom review form for tuberculosis (TB). Beginning Wednesday, Oct. 2, you can log into the Health Tracking System to complete this brief questionnaire. Our ITEACH value of Accountability requires us to take ownership and do the right thing. We do not mandate vaccines or require them for employment, but we are confident most of our students and workforce will be vaccinated because it is simply the right thing to do. It is part of our responsibility to our patients and one another. We also encourage you to be an advocate for patients. Influenza vaccines are now available for patients. All inpatient nursing staff should screen and vaccinate them for influenza before discharge. Similarly, the influenza vaccine will be available in outpatient clinics. It should be given to all patients over the age of 6 months who do not have a contraindication. Consult the Health Tracking System for additional influenza and COVID-19 vaccine resources.

Reply Jeffrey Robb says: October 3, 2024 at 9:36 am Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. This link has a flyer that outlines the vaccine information for employees under our health coverage. https://www.unmc.eduewsroom/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vaccination-Coverage100324.pdf Reply kelly sneed says: October 10, 2024 at 9:42 am The COD has cancelled the flu shots given here in the building due to lack of space. The newly renovated student lounge is plenty big and would suffice. Any way to get it with the nursing students to give them here, in that space, in the near future? I’m sure they would love and appreciate the experience as in past years. Thank you. Reply Leave a comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Through partnerships with local and national mainstream media outlets, FERN seeks to tell stories that will inspire, inform, and have lasting impact. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Updated on September 30, 2024 Close Photo: Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Blood samples from five healthcare workers in Missouri will be tested for exposure to the avian flu virus, said the Centers for Disease Control in a weekly update on bird flu. The workers developed mild respiratory symptoms while involved in treatment of a patient infected with the H5N1 virus but who had no known contact with animals. Development of the symptoms raised the possibility of the first known person-to-person spread of the H5N1 virus. Public health officials in Missouri have not identified the patient or where in the state the illness occurred. The patient was treated with antiviral medications and recovered early this month. Nationwide, 14 human infections with the bird flu virus have been confirmed since last March, all but the Missouri case were among livestock workers. “To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1),” said the CDC. Influenza A is the designation for avian flu viruses. H5N1 is the virus that causes highly pathogenic avian influenza, also called bird flu. U.S. Farmers Call for Vaccine Option to Fight Bird Flu as Wildfowl Migration Begins One healthcare worker in Missouri tested negative for bird flu. “The five remaining exposed healthcare workers had only mild symptoms,” said the weekly update. “Blood specimens for those who became symptomatic have been collected for H5 antibody testing at CDC.” Previously, the CDC said a member of the household became ill with similar symptoms on the same day as the Missouri patient, but was not tested and had recovered. The CDC said the incident suggested “a common exposure,” rather than person-to-person spread. Latest Developments on Avian Flu Virus in Dairy Cattle Influenza surveillance systems have given “no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in Missouri,” said the agency. More than 5,000 people have been monitored because of exposure to infected or potentially infected animals and at least 240 were tested for bird flu after developing flu-like symptoms. Bird flu was identified in dairy cattle for the first time in late March, a worrisome development because of the potential for the virus to jump to humans. Was this page helpful?

Quest for answers faces testing delay The additional wait will likely fuel concerns about the possibility of human-to-human transmission Manage alerts for this article Email this article Share this article Three H5N1 bird flu virions.NIAID By Helen Branswell Oct. 2, 2024 Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases U.S. health officials have run into obstacles in their efforts to determine whether a Missouri person infected with H5N1 bird flu passed the virus on to others, causing a delay that will likely fuel concerns about the possibility that there has been human-to-human transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has blood samples from several health workers and a household contact of the Missouri case that it plans to test for antibodies that would indicate whether they too had been infected with the virus, an agency official told STAT.advertisement But the CDC has had to develop a new test to look for those antibodies because key genetic changes to the main protein on the exterior of the virus found in the Missouri case meant the agency’s existing tests might not have been reliable, Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center on Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an interview. He suggested it will be mid-October before the work can be completed. “The antibodies that would grow in the person exposed to that virus would then be different then the antibodies that would grow in a person who had a virus without those mutations,” Daskalakis said. Developing the new test has been challenging because the sample from the patient contained so little viral material that the CDC was not able to grow whole viruses from it. Instead its scientists have had to reverse engineer H5N1 viruses that contain the changes to use them as the basis for the new serology test, he said.advertisement There is still no explanation of how the individual contracted the virus. The unidentified individual was hospitalized for other health problems on Aug. 22, and was released three days later. While in hospital the person was tested for a panel of respiratory viruses and tested positive for influenza. The state’s ongoing investigation into the case has retrospectively turned up six health workers who cared for the patient who went on to experience respiratory symptoms. One tested negative for flu at the time she or he was ill but the other five were not tested when they were sick. Neither was the household contact. Blood from those six individuals will be tested for H5N1 antibodies. Related Story Q&A: NIAID’s Jeanne Marrazzo speaks on bird flu, mpox, and succeeding Anthony Fauci There are fears in some quarters that this represents a cluster of cases, which infectious disease experts agree would be concerning. Although there have been a few times where person-to-person spread of the virus probably took place outside the U.S., in the main H5N1 is a virus that can’t easily infect humans or spread from one person to another. Were that to change, the risk of a pandemic would be dramatically higher. That possibility has sparked an understandable desire for answers about the Missouri case, fast. But that isn’t possible in this case, Daskalakis said. “Biology takes time,” he said. Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, recently commented on the mutations of the Missouri virus on the social media site X, noting that one is sufficiently important that it might erode the effectiveness of some of the candidate vaccine viruses that have been create to be the starting material for H5 vaccines, if mass production is needed. Bloom told STAT the mutation is not present in the candidate virus that was used to produce 4.8 million doses of vaccine that are currently held in the Department of Health and Human Services’ National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile. The mutation in the Missouri virus could also affect a serology test’s ability to detect antibodies in blood samples, if the test did not look for antibodies that recognize it, Bloom said. The result could be a false negative test, or test results that are hard to read.advertisement “If you’re getting serology that’s kind of at this ambiguous level, where it’s a little bit hard to be super confident whether it’s positive or negative, certainly this type of mutation could make you want to then redo the assays with a virus that contained that mutation,” Bloom said. The CDC is also concerned about the possibility that antibodies to seasonal flu strains — which virtually every adult alive would have — could trigger a false positive result when the H5N1 serology test is run. So the agency’s labs will also take the additional step of depleting each sample of antibodies to H1N1, one of the human flu strains, before it tests the Missouri blood samples for H5N1 antibodies, Daskalakis said. All this work adds to the time it is taking to reach answers. But Bloom saw it as defensible, though he stressed he did not have details of the approaches the CDC is taking to test the Missouri samples. “As someone who’s very interested, I hope they’re able to do it as quickly as possible,” he said. But he noted that in a case such as this, “serology can be a little bit more tricky if you’re trying to reach a really highly confident conclusion.” “I’m sure they don’t want to put out something prematurely that’s inaccurate. So if they’re not getting a super clear answer they may want to spend more time working on positive and negative controls and really making sure they’re correct in terms of whatever they end up saying,” Bloom said. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, also said he can understand the delay, though he expressed concern that some people have already concluded that transmission did occur in Missouri. While it is possible that serology testing will show some of the patient’s contacts were infected, it’s also possible that those individuals had Covid-19 or another respiratory bug, he said. “We are all just going to have to wait and see,” said Osterholm.advertisement Meanwhile the CDC continues to monitor multiple data streams for any evidence of unusual flu activity in Missouri, Daskalakis said. To date, there has been nothing that has triggered any alarms. “We’re not seeing anything that looks like any flu signal,” he said. “All of the systems are firing at full steam to make sure that we see [it] if there’s anything going on.” Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly suggested the mutation in the Missouri patient’s virus might have eroded the effectiveness of all H5 vaccines the U.S. government has stockpiled.

The CDC recommends that folks get the flu vaccine in October so that it will cover you through March, which Is the typically the end of flu season. Julie Tutt, infection preventionist at AR Gould says there are a number of places for you to receive your vaccine. “You can go to your primary care provider. We also have some community flu clinics that we offer through AR Gould, and you can visit pharmacies such as Walmart or Walgreens and they can get you your flu shot as well.”Tutt says some people are more susceptible to the influenza virus but that everybody should still get the flu vaccine. “It doesn’t necessarily prevent you from getting the flu, but it definitely will decrease the severity of the symptoms, reduce your risk of hospitalization and everything. Children and those that are immunocompromised and patients that are in our elderly population are really at an increased risk for severe side effects and hospitalization from influenza. The high dose is really formulated for those individuals 65 and older just to make sure that they got the protection that they need.”If you do get the flu, there are some measures you can take to help prevent the spread of the virus. Tutt, “The best way to prevent others from getting sick is make sure you stay home when you’re sick. Don’t come out until you’ve been fever free for 24 hours, your symptoms are improving. If you still have those symptoms, it’s probably best to mask when you are out in public until those symptoms have resolved. Make sure you cough into the crook of your arm and always good hand hygiene.” Tutt says that if you are looking to receive your flu vaccine from AR Gould, they will be hosting several flu clinics throughout the month of October.

State Veterinarian Nora Wineland said “Even though the rate of HPAI detections have decreased across Michigan and the United States, this does not mean the threat posed by the virus is gone. The disease continues to circulate in wild birds and fall migration can cause the virus to spread again. It is just as important now as it was earlier this year for owners to take measures to protect their poultry and dairy cattle from this virus. Keeping Michigan’s domestic animals healthy remains a team effort.” HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways from animal to animal, including through wild birds, contact with infected animals, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The disease can affect both animals and people. The CDC advises that the public health risk associated with the disease remains low. In 2024, Michigan experienced the largest outbreak of HPAI in the state’s history. Beginning with a detection in a dairy herd in late March, the virus has impacted 29 dairies, seven commercial poultry flocks, and one backyard poultry flock across 13 Michigan counties this year. There were also two cases of the disease in Michigan farm workers who were working with infected dairy cattle. More information is available in the provided link.

(WJFW)- While the burden of the flu can vary each year, the flu places an overwhelming amount of people in the hospital throughout the United States every season. The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the flu has resulted in 9.3 million and 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Wisconsin has recorded 3,853 hospitalizations for influenza this season.“People that are really susceptible to the flu are the young, so under five years of age and people 65 and up, also if you have any chronic diseases, have a weak immune system, are pregnant, you’re more likely to get the flu and have complications,” said Lisa Meza, a Physician Assistant at Aspirus. The flu generally peaks in December due to weather changes and closer contact amongst people especially children in schools. Meza said that washing your hands often and cleaning surfaces are some of the best ways to prevent the spread.“The flu vaccine is number one, that’s really important to help prevent the flu," said Meza. "Other things you can do is keep your hands well washed, washing your hands throughout the day, don’t touch your eyes, your nose or your mouth, if you’re sick stay home and try to stay away from other people that are sick.”The symptoms can vary from person to person but some are more common than others.“Symptoms are generally fever, chills, headache, all over body aches, feeling really tired, sore throat, running nose, occasionally there is some vomiting and diarrhea but that is usually more common in kids," said Meza.If you do become sick Meza said that there are many methods to overcome the illness.“There are anti-viral treatments especially if taken early it can reduce the severity or duration of the illness, otherwise conservative measures, resting, getting plenty of fluids, using over the counter medications to help with those symptoms,” said Meza.If you start to feel symptoms of the flu it is best to reach out to your health care provider immediately.Submit story ideas to akurisu@wjfw.com.

It noted that the case isn't related to a local dengue cluster in Baldwin Park. Panorama City is about 40 miles west of Baldwin Park. Local dengue cases are extremely rare in Los Angeles County, and health officials urged area residents to take precautions such as wearing mosquito repellent and removing mosquito-breeding sites. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed three more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy herds, two in California and one in Idaho. The latest outbreaks push the national total to 242 across 14 states. Also, APHIS confirmed one more H5N1 outbreak in poultry, this time at a farm in Idaho’s Lincoln County that has 700 birds.The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced that it is investigating a fatal rabies case involving a person older than 65 years who was exposed to a bat in July in the western part of the state. The latest case is Minnesota’s fourth since 2000. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed on September 20 based on testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The MDH said it is working with the patient's family and healthcare facilities where the patient was treated to assess if any others were potentially exposed and may need treatment. Unitaid calls for more rapid gonorrhea diagnostic tests News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Gonorrhea CDC / Alissa Eckert Global health organization Unitaid last week called for a "concerted global effort" to introduce accurate and affordable diagnostic tests in low-resource countries to address the rising number of gonorrhea infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).In a report released ahead of the United Nations High-Level Meeting on AMR, Unitaid highlights the diagnostic access gaps that results in both undertreatment and overtreatment of gonorrhea infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with a high burden of gonorrhea. Because of the lack of affordable, rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests in these settings, treatment decisions are based on observed signs and reported symptoms. Yet more than half of gonorrhea cases are asymptomatic, resulting in a high number of untreated, missed infections. Conversely, lack of gonorrhea-specific diagnostics means patients with symptoms often receive several treatments.Tests are in development, but may remain inaccessibleThe report provides an overview of the 75 POC and near-POC tests currently in development that have the potential to turn test results around in less than 30 minutes and improve antibiotic selection, including three that have already been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. It also lays out the barriers in LMICs that are preventing these tests from reaching those who need them, such as affordability, limited resources and healthcare infrastructure, and prioritization of higher mortality diseases by policymakers."Despite the need and the promise of new technologies, significant market challenges impede test accessibility in LMICs," the report states. "There is a high risk that products will become readily available in well-resourced settings and remain largely inaccessible in LMICs."To address these barriers, the report highlights opportunities for intervention, including market-shaping strategies, product development support, and integrating gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infection testing into reproductive, maternal, and HIV healthcare services. “Early work to implement testing will provide valuable evidence and experience to build demand and guide countries on feasible and cost-effective ways to introduce gonorrhea testing and improve health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations," Kelsey Barrett, Unitaid’s Technical Manager for Maternal and Child Health, said in a press release. HHS funds AI-enhanced antibiotic discovery project News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) last week announced funding for a project that will use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the discovery and development of new antibiotics.To speed up the lengthy and laborious process of screening and testing molecular compounds for antibacterial activity, the Transforming Antibiotic R&D with Generative AI to stop Emerging Threats (TARGET) project will use generative AI to broaden the pool of candidate molecules for screening and deep learning to assess each candidate's effectiveness as an antibiotic. The aim of the project, which is being funded through the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), is to identify 15 promising leads for new antibiotics."The rise of antibiotic resistance threatens to turn once-treatable infections into life-threatening ones, but with AI, we can accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics to address this threat like never before," ARPA-H Director Renee Wegrzyn, PhD, said in a press release. "With TARGET, ARPA-H is bringing together experts across antibiotic discovery, AI, and clinical testing to ensure we can refill the global pipeline of antibiotics and stop people from becoming seriously ill due to treatable infections."The project will be led by Phare Bio, in collaboration with the Collins Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University's Wyss Institute, with a budget of up to $27 million. Fidaxomicin underused for C diff infections, study finds News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Clostridium difficile CDC / Jennifer Oosthuizen The use of fidaxomicin for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has increased significantly since 2021 but it remains underutilized, researchers reported today in Clinical Infectious Diseases.Using the PINC AI Healthcare database, researchers from Washington University School of Medicine and Merck examined records on adults who received CDI treatment before and after 2021, when updated guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommended fidaxomicin as the only first-line agent for CDI, with vancomycin as an alternative option. Prior to 2021 vancomycin and metronidazole had been the recommended first-line agents for CDI, which is the most common healthcare-associated infection in adults and affects an estimated 460,000 US patients each year. Evidence on how CDI treatment patterns have changed since the 2021 guidelines has been limited.Fidaxomicin use more than doublesA total of 45,049 patients from 779 US hospitals were included in the study, with 29,520 in the pre-period (January 2020 to June 2021) and 15,529 in the post-period (October 2021 to September 2022). From the pre-period to the post-period, fidaxomicin use increased from 5.9% to 13.7%, while vancomycin used declined from 87.9% to 82.9% and metronidazole from 21.6% to 17.2%. Among census regions, increases in fidaxomicin use were smallest in the northeast, and greatest in the south.In a secondary analysis that compared clinical and cost outcomes among patients treated exclusively with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, fidaxomicin was associated with lower CDI recurrence (6.1% vs 10.2%) and higher sustained clinical response (91.7% vs 87.9%), while 90-day post-discharge costs were similar. The study authors note that these findings are consistent with prior research."While fidaxomicin use for CDI increased (and more than doubled) since the publication of the updated IDSA guidelines, it remained low relative to vancomycin and metronidazole use," the study authors wrote. "These novel findings imply that a substantial number of patients could have received the benefits of fidaxomicin if more hospitals had followed the ISDA 2021 guidelines."
