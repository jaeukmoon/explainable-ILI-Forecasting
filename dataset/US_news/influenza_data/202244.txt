It is important for people to continue taking precautions around infected and potentially infected birds/poultry to help reduce the risk of bird flu virus infections in people. CDC Update November 3, 2022—As bird flu outbreaks in wild birds and poultry continue across the U.S., the country approaches a record number of birds affected compared to previous bird flu outbreaks. Since early 2022, more than 49 million birds in 46 states have either died as a result of bird flu virus infection or have been culled (killed) due to exposure to infected birds. This number is nearing the 50.5 million birds in 21 states that were affected by the largest bird flu outbreak that occurred in 2015. Even so, the number of states affected in 2022 is already more than double the number of states that were affected in 2015. Although the overall risk to the general public from the current bird flu outbreaks remains low, it is important that people take preventive measures around infected or potentially infected birds/poultry to prevent the spread of bird flu viruses to themselves or to other birds/poultry and other animals, including pets. This applies not just to workplace or wildlife settings but potentially to household settings where people have backyard flocks or pet birds with potential exposures to wild or domestic infected birds. To prevent infection, people should avoid unprotected contact with wild or domestic birds and poultry that look sick or have died. Bird flu infections in people happen most often after close, prolonged, and unprotected (no gloves or other protective wear) contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with bird flu viruses. If contact cannot be avoided, people should minimize contact with wild birds or sick or dead poultry by taking the following precautions: Wear personal protective equipment (PPE), like disposable gloves, boots, an N95 respirator if available, or if not available, a well-fitting facemask (e.g., a surgical mask), and eye protection. Specific CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) PPE recommendations are available at Backyard Flock Owners: Take Steps to Protect Yourself from Avian Influenza (Bird Flu). Avoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes during and after contact with birds or surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous or feces from wild or domestic birds/poultry. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds/poultry. Change your clothes before contact with healthy domestic poultry and after handling wild birds, captive wild birds, farmed birds, and other pet birds. Then, throw away the gloves and facemask, and wash your hands with soap and water. CDC has more information for specific groups who may come in contact with potentially infected birds/poultry. For backyard poultry or bird owners, take measures to keep your bird(s) from becoming infected with bird flu virus, which can be deadly. Infected birds shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds. This can happen through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with virus. Avian influenza A viruses are very contagious among birds, and some of these viruses can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species, including chickens, ducks and turkeys. CDC has been monitoring for illness among people exposed to bird flu virus-infected birds since these outbreaks were first detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in late 2021. To date, bird flu viruses have been found in U.S. commercial and backyard poultry in 44 states and in wild birds in 46 states since early 2022. CDC has tracked the health of more than 5,190 people with exposures to bird flu virus-infected birds with one case reported. Information on the person in the U.S. who tested positive for bird flu earlier this year can be found in the associated spotlight and press release. CDC continues to monitor the current situation and risk to the general public. Sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses in the U.S. resulting from close contact with infected birds/poultry would not be surprising given past human infections that have occurred in other countries after exposure to infected birds. This would not significantly change CDC's risk assessment. However, if person-to-person spread with this virus were to occur, that would raise the public health threat. Note that sustained person-to-person spread is needed for a pandemic to occur. It is important for people to continue taking precautions around infected and potentially infected birds/poultry to help reduce the risk of bird flu virus infections in people.

The viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is a primary target for the development of universal influenza vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. The other major surface antigen, neuraminidase (NA), has been less well studied as a potential target and fewer broadly reactive anti-NA antibodies have been identified. In this study, we isolate three human monoclonal antibodies that recognize NA from A/H1N1 subtypes, and find that one of them, clone DA03E17, binds to the NA of A/H3N2, A/H5N1, A/H7N9, B/Ancestral-lineage, B/Yamagata-lineage, and B/Victoria-lineage viruses. DA03E17 inhibits the neuraminidase activity by direct binding to the enzyme active site, and provides in vitro and in vivo protection against infection with several types of influenza virus. This clone could, therefore, be useful as a broadly protective therapeutic agent. Moreover, the neutralizing epitope of DA03E17 could be useful in the development of an NA-based universal influenza vaccine.

In addition, a pandemic of an emerging influenza A virus (e.g., A/H5N1 or A/H7N9) could occur, potentially claiming millions of lives. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop vaccines or therapeutics that protect against a wide range of influenza subtypes or lineages1. Current seasonal influenza vaccines induce antibody responses against the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA)2. Antibodies against the immunodominant globular head domain of HA are mainly elicited by these vaccines and inhibit virion binding to the cellular receptor, sialic acid. Because the antigenicity of the HA head differs among the HA subtypes and lineages, the vaccines induce a narrow range of strain-specific immune responses, resulting in their having little effect on emerging pandemic viruses3. Furthermore, the major antigenic sites in the HA head mutate at a high rate due to immunological pressure and high plasticity4, leading to a decrease in vaccine effectiveness.Although antibodies against HA are typically considered as a correlate of protection from influenza virus infection, some studies suggest that antibodies against neuraminidase (NA), the other major glycoprotein on the viral surface, contribute to protection5,6,7,8,9. NA cleaves terminal sialic acids from N-linked glycans and this sialidase activity is essential for the release of progeny viruses from infected cells8,9,10. NA-specific antibody titers have been shown to correlate with protection against infection with various viruses, including A/H1N111,12 and A/H3N213,14,15 viruses. The main mechanism by which anti-NA antibodies inhibit virus propagation is through neuraminidase-inhibiting (NI) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These antibodies interfere with sialidase activity and restrict virus release, resulting in aggregation of progeny virions on the cell surface3. The NI antibodies reduce viral load and symptoms in infected mice, ferrets, and humans5,6,15,16,17,18. Although NI activity is a major mechanism of the antiviral activity of anti-NA antibodies, recent studies have reported that some NI mAbs requires Fc–FcγR interactions, which activate effector cells, such as natural killer cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, for in vivo protection19,20.Although influenza NAs are divided into three phylogenic groups–influenza A group 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8 subtypes), influenza A group 2 (N2, N3, N6 N7, and N9 subtypes), and influenza B (Ancestral-, Yamagata-, and Victoria-lineages) (Fig. S1)–most of the amino acids in the active site of NA are highly conserved across all three groups21. Therefore, NA should be an attractive target for the development of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Although vaccine development guided by cross-reactive NI mAbs is a promising approach, a limited number of cross-reactive anti-NA mAbs have been reported to date. Of note, one paper reported three NI mAbs with cross-reactivities against both influenza A viruses (IAVs) and influenza B viruses (IBVs)22. One of three NI mAbs, clone 1G01, derived from A/H3N2-infected patients, directly targeted the active site of NA and inhibited several kinds of influenza A and B viruses in vitro and in vivo. Epitope footprints of such protective cross-reacting anti-NA mAbs have helped boost the development of universal NA vaccines, but there is still much work to be done.In this study, we established a novel human mAb (DA03E17) with broad heterosubtypic binding to NAs from IAV group 1 (N1, N4, N5, N8), group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9), and IBVs. We found that this mAb recognized an epitope that differed from that recognized by clone 1G01. These results suggest that DA03E17 may be useful as a therapeutic agent and that its epitope is a potential target for a universal vaccine.ResultsEstablishment of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize the NA of A/H1N1pdm09We previously generated anti-NA mAbs from patients who were infected with A/H1N1pdm09 virus by using the hybridoma method20. In this study, we looked for novel cross-reactive anti-NA mAbs by re-screening. Briefly, the hybridomas were generated by fusing SPYMEG cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were obtained from human volunteers who were infected with A/H1N1pdm09 virus in the 2015–2016 influenza season. After several rounds of screening by ELISA using purified A/Yokohama/94/2015 virus (A/H1N1pdm09) that was isolated in the 2015–2016 season, hybridomas in the positive wells were biologically cloned. Of 701 hybridomas screened, we obtained three monoclonal antibodies (HP02A67, DA03E17, and DA05A30) that recognized the NA of A/Yokohama/94/2015 virus. We analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of each antibody and found that the three mAbs used different VH and VL genes (Table S1).Binding breadth of the three anti-NA mAbsTo determine the breadth of mAb recognition, we performed an ELISA using NA-displaying virus-like particles (NA-VLPs), which were produced by expressing Ebola virus VP40 with NA derived from IAV group 1 (A/H1N1pre2009, A/H1N1pdm09, A/H5N1, A/H8N4, A/H12N5, A/H15N5, A/H5N8, A/H10N8), group 2 (A/H3N2, A/H7N2, A/H9N2, A/H6N3, A/H4N6, A/H5N6, A/H7N7, A/H10N7, A/H7N9), or IBV (B/Ancestral-lineage, B/Yamagata-lineage, B/Victoria-lineage) (blue in Fig. 1A and B, and Table S2). HP02A67 and DA05A30 are bound to NA-VLPs of A/H1N1pre2009 or A/H1N1pdm09, but not to those of other NAs. DA03E17 displayed broad binding to NA-VLPs of all IAVs and IBVs tested. The broadly reactive anti-NA mAb 1G0122 showed broad binding to NA-VLPs of IAVs except for A/Puerto Rico/8/34, and relatively weak binding to NA-VLPs of IBVs. A negative control, anti-B-HA mAb 1430E3/920, did not bind to any NA-VLPs (Table S2). These results indicate that DA03E17 is a broadly reactive human anti-NA mAb with a different binding pattern from that previously reported for the broadly reactive clone 1G01.Fig. 1: Cross-reactivity of the three mAbs.Heat maps of antibody binding to NA-displaying VLPs in ELISA, NI activity in ELLA, and neutralization potencies in an MN assay are shown in blue, red, and green, respectively. NAs are derived from A circulating human influenza subtypes or highly pathogenic viruses (A/H5N1 or A/H7N9) or B recent A/H3N2 human isolates or animal influenza viruses. The exact minimal binding concentration, 50% inhibition concentration for sialidase activity (IC50), and 50% neutralization concentration are listed in Tables S2–S4. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageNI activity and in vitro neutralizing potency of the three mAbsWe next examined the functional capacity of the three anti-NA mAbs. NI activity is caused by direct binding to the enzyme’s active site or through steric hindrance due to antibody binding at a location other than the active site. An enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) can measure NI activity via either mechanism; therefore, we conducted an ELLA using NA-VLPs of IAVs and IBVs (red in Fig. 1A and B, and Table S3). HP02A67, DA05A30, and 1430E3/9 did not inhibit the sialidase activity of any of the NA-VLPs tested. In contrast, DA03E17 inhibited the sialidase activity of NA-VLPs of IAVs and IBVs except for A/mallard/Sweden/24/2002 (A/H8N4) at IC50 values of between 0.002 and 47.1 μg/ml. 1G01 inhibited the sialidase activity of NA-VLPs of IAVs and IBVs at IC50 values of 0.012–40.3 μg/ml, except for A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/H1N1), A/mallard/Interior Alaska/7MP0167/2007 (A/H12N5), A/mallard duck/Sweden/139579/2012 (A/H15N5), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata-lineage), and B/Texas/02/2013 (B/Victoria-lineage).Next, to determine whether the NI activity of DA03E17 is caused by direct inhibition, we performed an NA-Star assay, which utilizes small molecules as a substrate (Table 1). DA03E17 inhibited the sialidase activity of all of the NA-VLPs tested (IC50 = 0.87–20.7 μg/ml), whereas 1G01 failed to inhibit the sialidase activity of NA-VLP of B/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/Texas/02/2013 (Table 1). These results suggest that DA03E17 directly recognizes the enzymatic active site of NA.Table 1 IC50 value (μg/ml) of neuraminidase inhibition activity by mAbs in a small substrate NA-Star assayFull size tableTo further confirm the NI activity of the three mAbs in vitro, we investigated whether these mAbs had in vitro neutralizing potency in a microneutralization (MN) assay using authentic viruses (green in Fig. 1 and Table S4). HP02A67 and DA05A30 failed to neutralize any viruses tested even at the highest concentration (50 μg/ml). DA03E17 neutralized both IAVs and IBVs except for A/England/261/91, B/Lee/40, and B/Wisconsin/01/2010. 1G01 neutralized IAVs except for A/Puerto Rico/8/34; weakly neutralized B/Lee/40, B/Yamagata/1/73, and B/Colorado/06/2017; and did not inhibit the other four IBVs tested. 1430E3/9 and anti-A/H1N1-HA mAb F3A1923, which served as negative controls for IAVs and IBVs, respectively, did not inhibit virus propagation. Taken together, these results show that DA03E17 possesses more broad reactivity and inhibition potency than 1G01.In vivo protective efficacy of DA03E17 against lethal challenge infectionTo evaluate the in vivo protective efficacy of DA03E17, we examined whether this mAb protected mice from lethal challenge with A/H1N1pdm09, A/H5N1, A/H3N2, A/H7N9, or B/Yamagata virus. Four mice per group were intraperitoneally inoculated with DA03E17, 1G01, the negative control mAb (1430E3/9 or F3A19 for IAVs or an IBV, respectively) at 10, 2, or 0.4 mg/kg before lethal challenge infection and their body weight changes and survival were monitored for 14 days. When mice received each mAb at 10 mg/kg, DA03E17 completely or partially protected mice from A/H1N1pdm09, A/H5N1, A/H3N2, A/H7N9, or B/Yamagata lethal challenge infection (red line in Fig. 2A). 1G01 also protected mice from A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, A/H5N1, or B/Yamagata challenge, but failed to protect any mice from A/H7N9 challenge (blue line in Fig. 2A). All mice that received 10 mg/kg of 1430E3/9 or F3A19 died within 10 days of inoculation (gray line in Fig. 2A). At the 2 mg/kg dose, DA03E17 conferred full or partial protection against A/H1N1pdm09, A/H5N1, A/H3N2, and B/Yamagata virus infection with severe or moderate body weight loss, but no mice that were challenged with A/H7N9 virus survived (red line in Fig. S2A). At the 0.4 mg/kg dose, DA03E17 protected one mouse from the H5N1 virus challenge (red line in Fig. S2B). These results indicate that DA03E17 possesses in vivo antiviral activity against several subtypes of influenza virus.Fig. 2: In vivo protective efficacy of DA03E17.A Four mice per group were intraperitoneally inoculated with DA03E17 (red line), 1G01 (blue line), or the negative control mAb (gray line) at 10 mg/kg; 1430E3/9 and F3A19 were used as negative controls for IAVs and an IBV, respectively. One day later, the mice were challenged with 10 MLD50 of the indicated challenge viruses. Body weight changes and survival were monitored daily for 14 days. Body weight changes are shown as the mean ± SDs. B Four mice per group were intraperitoneally injected with the indicated antibodies at 10 mg/kg. One day later, the mice were challenged with 10 MLD50 of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus. On days 2 and 4 post-infection, virus titers in the lungs were determined. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. *P < 0.01 (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s tests).Full size imageWe also assessed virus titers at 2 and 4 days post-infection in the lungs of infected mice that received each mAb at 10 mg/kg (Fig. 2B). On day 2 post-infection, virus titers were not affected by the administration of any mAb. On day 4 post-infection, virus titers in the lungs of infected mice that received DA03E17 or 1G01 were significantly lower than those in the lungs of mice that received the negative control 1430E3/9. These results demonstrate that DA03E17 directly suppresses virus propagation following lethal infection.Mutations that permit escape from DA03E17To identify the epitope of DA03E17, we attempted to select escape mutant viruses in triplicate (designated lines 1, 2, and 3) by passaging A/H3N2 virus (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014) in the presence of two-fold serially diluted DA03E17 (50–0.78 μg/ml). Mutant viruses that escaped from DA03E17 emerged by 4–6 passages (Table 2). To identify the escape mutation, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of the HA, NA, and six other segments by direct sequencing. We found that escape mutant line 1 possessed the D151G substitution in NA, line 2 possessed the D151N and T439A substitutions in NA, and line 3 possessed the V50L and D151G substitutions in NA (Table 2). In the HA segment, the S110L and P221H substitutions were found in lines 1–3, respectively. No amino acid substitutions occurred in the other six segments.Table 2 Amino acid substitutions of viruses passaged in the presence of DA03E17Full size tableTo identify the key substitution for escape from DA03E17, we generated viruses possessing the D151G, D151N, and T439A, or V50L and D151G substitutions in NA by use of reverse genetics and performed the microneutralization assay. Mutant viruses possessing the D151G (found in line 1), D151N + T439A (line 2), or V50L + D151G (line 3) substitutions in NA grew well even in the presence of DA03E17 at 50 μg/ml (Table 3), indicating that these mutations were important for escape from the mAb. To pin down the amino acid substitution for DA03E17 escape, we prepared viruses possessing single amino acid substitutions (D151N, T439A, or V50L) and examined the neutralization by DA03E17. DA03E17 failed to neutralize the virus possessing the D151N substitution in NA (Table 3). The IC50 value of DA03E17 against the virus possessing the T439A substitution was approximately twice as high as that of the wild-type virus (Table 3). These results demonstrate that amino acid substitutions at positions 151 and 439 play a central role in escape from DA03E17. Of note, the IC50 values of 1G01 for variants containing the D151N or D151G substitution were slightly higher than those for the wild-type virus, whereas the IC50 value for the T439A variant was comparable to that for the wild-type virus. These results suggest that the footprint of DA03E17 on the NA enzymatic site slightly differs from that of 1G01.Table 3 Neutralization activity against mutant viruses possessing amino acid substitutions in NAFull size tableTo evaluate whether the epitope of DA03E17 overlaps with that of 1G01, we performed a competitive binding assay. To avoid recognition by the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, the Fc region of 1G01 or DA03E17 was replaced with that of mouse IgG2a. Dilutions (0.006–100 μg/ml) of 1G01 with the mouse Fc domain (Fig. S3, left panel) or DA03E17 with the mouse Fc domain (right panel) were reacted with VLPs displaying NA of A/California/04/2009 (A/H1N1pdm09) and then mixed with DA03E17, 1G01, or DA05A30 (at concentrations adjusted to achieve OD450 value = 1.5). The OD450 value of the human Fc antibody in the presence of each concentration of mouse Fc antibody was then measured. We found that both mouse Fc antibodies showed moderate inhibition of the binding of human DA05A30, which does not possess NI activity. The mouse Fc 1G01 significantly inhibited the antibody binding of DA03E17, and this inhibition was comparable to the homologous competition (i.e., human Fc 1G01 vs. mouse Fc 1G01) (Fig. S3 left). However, in the presence of mouse Fc DA03E17 (Fig. S3 right), the mouse Fc DA03E17 inhibited binding of 1G01 but this inhibition was significantly milder than the homologous competition (i.e., human DA03E17 vs. mouse DA03E17). These results suggest that the epitopes of DA03E17 and 1G01 mostly overlap, but not completely.To visualize the antibody recognition site, we mapped these residues on the NA molecule. The amino acids at positions 151 and 439 are located in the 150-loop and the 430-loop of the enzymatic active site, respectively (Fig. 3A). D151 is conserved among all of the viruses tested and T439 is found in all of the IAVs tested (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that DA03E17 targets the highly conserved residues in the enzymatic active site of NA.Fig. 3: Positions and conservation of key residues for escape from DA03E17.A Amino acid positions that are important for escape from DA03E17 are shown on the NA structure of A/Minnesota/11/2010 (A/H3N2; PDB accession code 6N6B) virus.

Key residues for escape are indicated in dotted boxes in magenta and red. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageGrowth kinetics of the escape mutant viruses in vitroTo examine the fitness of the viruses possessing mutations that allowed them to escape from DA03E17, we compared the growth kinetics of mutant viruses possessing the escape mutations (i.e., D151G or D151N) in hCK cells with those of the wild-type virus. All mutant viruses tested replicated to significantly lower titers than the wild-type virus (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the fitness of the escape mutants was reduced.Fig. 4: Growth kinetics of wild-type and escape mutant viruses in vitro.The growth kinetics of the wild-type virus and the indicated escape mutant viruses in hCK cells were compared. Cell culture supernatants of hCK cells infected at an MOI of 0.0001 were collected at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. Virus titers are presented as the mean ± SD (n = three independent experiments). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. *P < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s tests).Full size imageCharacterization of the germline antibody of DA03E17We prepared the germline mAb of DA03E17 to investigate the changes in the binding properties to NA-VLPs due to somatic hypermutation. The ELISA using NA-VLPs revealed that the germline mAb of DA03E17 recognized NA-VLPs of IAVs and IBVs, but its binding affinity was clearly lower than that of DA03E17 (Table 4). The ELLA showed that the NI activity of the germline DA03E17 was lower than that of DA03E17 and it did not cross-react with the NA of IBVs. These results suggest that affinity maturation through somatic hypermutations in the VH and VL genes plays an essential role in the high binding affinity and broad reactivity of DA03E17.Table 4 In vitro properties of DA03E17 germline mAbFull size tableDiscussionNovel vaccines against influenza A and B viruses should provide broad protection against diverse strains and subtypes. The development of such vaccines is aided by the identification of novel broadly neutralizing epitopes targeted by cross-reactive antibodies. Although previous studies have reported monoclonal antibodies that possess cross-reactivity against viruses belonging to the same type (IAV or IBV)8,9,24,25,26, there has been only one previous report of broadly reactive antibodies against both IAV-NAs and IBV-NAs22. In this study, we characterized three human monoclonal antibodies derived from influenza patients. DA03E17 showed broad reactivities against NAs derived from antigenically distinct subtypes of IAVs and lineages of IBVs, whereas the other two clones (HA02A67 and DA05A30) specifically recognized the NA of A/H1N1pre2009 and A/H1N1pdm09 viruses. DA03E17 efficiently inhibited the sialidase activity of NA, whereas both HA02A67 and DA05A30 did not. Furthermore, DA03E17 showed broader cross-reactivity and better neutralization capability than 1G01, an NI mAb previously reported to have cross-reactivity against IAVs and IBVs. Moreover, our antibody protected mice from lethal challenges with several subtypes of IAVs or IBVs, suggesting that DA03E17 has potential as a therapeutic agent against both IAVs and IBVs. Although escape mutant viruses emerged in in vitro experiments, these escape mutant viruses replicated significantly less efficiently in vitro, indicating that mutant viruses that are able to escape from DA03E17 would be unlikely to dominate the parental viruses. Given that the potential emergence of escape mutant viruses is one of the main disadvantages of mAbs as antiviral treatments, DA03E17 should be useful as a protective antibody. Furthermore, fortunately, amino acid mutations that reduced the neutralizing activity of DA03E17 had little effect on the neutralizing capability of 1G01, meaning that combination therapy of DA03E17 and 1G01 would likely suppress the emergence of escape mutants. Further studies on such combination therapy are required to develop effective, long-lasting therapies.Currently licensed influenza vaccines, such as inactivated vaccines and live-attenuated vaccines, elicit limited anti-NA immunity10. Recombinant NA and NA-VLPs have been shown to induce high titers of anti-NA antibodies that protect mice and ferrets from challenge infections27,28,29. Furthermore, recombinant NA-based vaccines have been shown to inhibit influenza virus transmission in the guinea pig model30. In these studies, heterosubtypic immunity was not detected, although cross-protection against viruses belonging to the same subtype was observed27. To add heterosubtypic immunity to NA-based vaccines, antibody-targeting to conserved neutralizing epitopes is a valid approach. Therefore, the conserved epitope identified in this study might be of value in the development of NA-based universal vaccines. Furthermore, since the germline sequence of DA03E17 showed broad cross-reactivity, the epitope of this mAb could be a universal vaccine antigen that activates specific germline-precursor B cells showing broad and potent activity.NA is a valid drug target because several small molecules that inhibit its sialidase activity (NA inhibitors) are widely approved as therapeutic agents for influenza virus infection31. However, several in vitro studies have shown that IBVs are less sensitive than IAVs to FDA-approved NA inhibitors and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors32,33. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents are needed. In addition to seasonal influenza viruses, A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses with an amino acid substitution in NA that confers high-level resistance to NA inhibitors have been isolated from patients who were treated with NA inhibitors34,35. Furthermore, such NA inhibitor-resistant mutations were found in A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses that were detected in poultry and the environment36,37. Since DA03E17 showed both broad reactivity and strong in vivo protective activity, it has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent against seasonal and emerging influenza viruses. Further studies to develop this mAb as a therapeutic agent are warranted.Amino acid substitution at position 151 of NA, which is involved in the escape from DA03E17, is known to confer binding to sialic acid to NA and reduce sensitivities to NA inhibitors38,39,40,41,42. Although the amino acid at position 151 frequently changed after passages in culture cells43, aspartic acid at position 151 and threonine at position 439 are highly conserved in the NA of human isolates available in the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Table S5). These data suggest that the amino acids at positions 151 and 439 have functional and/or structural importance for virus replication in the human upper respiratory tract, signifying that DA03E17 has the potential to be an anti-influenza agent with a low propensity for the development of resistant viruses in humans.The NA of the circulating human A/H3N2 viruses has undergone appreciable antigenic drift since 2016. This antigenic drift, which was caused by the addition of an N-linked glycosylation site near the enzymatic site, abolished the binding activity of some anti-N2-NA broadly reactive mAbs (e.g., clone B10)44. However, our experiments showed that DA03E17 and 1G01 maintained inhibitory activity against the NAs of recently circulating A/H3N2 viruses (Fig. 1B). This might be due to differences in the assays or cells used for the experiments because N-linked glycosylation varies among the cell lines and animal species used for virus and VLP preparation. DA03E17 and 1G01 may inhibit the NA activity of recent A/H3N2 viruses due to their structural features; we note that DA03E17 and 1G01 have longer than average CDR-H3. The average CDR-H3 length is 16 amino acids (11 amino acids for clone B10), whereas the CDR-H3 length for DA03E17 and 1G01 is 19 and 23 amino acids, respectively45,46. The long CDR-H3 protrudes deeper into the active pocket and forms a more extensive polar interaction network with NA, allowing its higher binding affinity25. Therefore, the long CDR-H3 may be a factor in allowing DA03E17 and 1G01 to bind to the NAs of recent A/H3N2 viruses, and an important feature of mAbs that broadly block NA enzymatic activity.DA03E17 inhibited the enzymatic activity of NA derived from IAVs or IBVs, making this mAb a promising candidate for therapeutic development. Our study suggests that DA03E17 is a potent inhibitor of NA activity in vitro and provides broad protection from mortality and morbidity in vivo. Knowledge of its epitope will be useful in the development of NA-based universal influenza virus vaccines.MethodsEthicsHuman blood was collected from three volunteers by following a protocol approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. All experiments with mice were performed in accordance with the University of Tokyo’s Regulations for Animal Care and Use and were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo.CellsHumanized Madin–Darby canine kidney (hCK) cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% newborn calf serum (NCS)43. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). SPYMEG cells (MBL) were maintained in DMEM containing 15% FCS47. These cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C under 8% CO2.AnimalsSix-week-old female BALB/c or DBA2 mice (Japan SLC) were used in the study. The relative humidity was kept at 45–65%. Mouse rooms and cages were kept at a temperature range of 20–24 °C, and were set at a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle.VirusesWe used two A/H1N1pre2009 viruses (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and A/Brisbane/59/2007), four A/H1N1pdm09 viruses [A/California/04/2009, A/Yokohama/94/2015, A/Isumi/UT-KK001-1/2018, and mouse-adapted A/California/04/200948], an A/H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), five A/H3N2 viruses [A/Hong Kong/1/68, A/England/261/91, A/Fujian/411/2002, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, and mouse-adapted A/Aichi/2/6849], an A/H7N9 virus (A/Anhui/1/2013), two B/Ancestral-lineage viruses (B/Lee/40 and B/Yamagata/1/73), two B/Yamagata-lineage viruses (B/Wisconsin/01/2010 and B/Phuket/3073/2013), and three B/Victoria-lineage viruses (B/Brisbane/60/2008, B/Texas/02/2013, and B/Colorado/06/2017). All of these viruses were propagated in hCK cells. Mutant viruses were generated by the use of reverse genetics as described below.Plasmid-based reverse geneticsThe NA mutant viruses were generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics, as described previously50. The pPol I plasmids encoding HA and wild-type or mutated NA derived from A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, and six pPol I plasmids encoding the remaining six segments of high-yield A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus51 were used. These eight pPol I plasmids along with protein expression plasmids for PB2, PB1, PA, and NP derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 were transfected into 293T cells by use of TransIT 293 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, the supernatants were harvested and inoculated into hCK cells. The rescued viruses were sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations. Primer sequences are available upon request.Hybridoma generationPBMCs were isolated from blood (30 ml) obtained from three volunteers, who were infected with the A/H1N1pdm09 virus in the 2015–2016 influenza season, by using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). The hybridomas that were generated by a fusion of PBMCs with SPYMEG cells were cultured and biologically cloned, as described previously52. For the screening, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the culture media of hybridomas and purified A/Yokohama/94/2015 as an antigen, as described below.Construction of NA expression plasmidsFull-length NA was PCR amplified from viral cDNA or synthesized DNA and was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted mutations.Preparation of NA-VLPs293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS encoding ebolavirus matrix protein VP40 with or without pCAGGS encoding the indicated NA by using TransIT 293. After 2 days, the supernatant of the transfected cells was harvested and ultra-centrifuged at 28,000 rpm with a 20% sucrose cushion. The pellet containing VP40-induced VLPs displaying NA (NA-VLPs) was resuspended in PBS and stored at −80 °C.ELISAELISA plates (96-well) were coated with 10 μg/ml of the purified virus or the NA-VLPs at 4 °C. After being blocked with five times-diluted Blocking One (Nakarai), these plates were incubated with the culture medium of the hybridomas or four-fold diluted mAb (50–0.003 μg/ml). A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fcγ Fragment-specific antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research) was used as the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution), and the signal was developed using 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as the substrate. The reaction was stopped with 2 N sulfuric acid, and OD450 values were then measured by using Softmax Pro, v5.4.5 (Molecular Devices). The mean OD450 at each dilution was obtained by subtracting the OD450 value for the control well (coated with VLP, not including NA). The minimal binding concentrations of the mAbs were determined as the lowest concentration providing an OD450 value of >0.1.Expression and purification of monoclonal human or mouse IgGTotal RNA was extracted from the hybridomas by using an ISOGEN (Nippon gene). The VH and VL sequences of the antibodies were cloned into the expression vector Mammalian PowerExpress System (TOYOBO), together with the human or mouse constant gamma heavy (IgG1 or IgG2a) and kappa light chain coding sequences. Monoclonal antibodies were expressed by Expi293F cells and purified by using a protein A column and the automated chromatography system ÄKTA pure 25 (GE Healthcare)53. The germline reverted antibody was produced based on the germline sequence estimated in IgBlast software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) with intact CDR H3 and L3 sequences.ELLAThe inhibition of NA activity was measured by using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), as described previously54. Briefly, four-fold diluted antibodies (50–0.01 μg/ml) were mixed with a predetermined amount of NA-VLPs diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The concentrations of NA-VLPs were determined based on the NA activity of each NA-VLP. The mixture was transferred to 96-well plates coated with fetuin (Sigma) and then incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed with PBS-T and then peroxidase-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA; Sigma) was added to detect galactose exposed by removal of the sialic acids on fetuin. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in the dark and then washed with PBS-T before the addition of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 N sulfuric acid and OD490 values were read by using Softmax Pro, v5.4.5 (Molecular Devices). The relative NA inhibition (NI) activity was calculated by dividing the OD490 value of the test well by the OD490 value of the “VLP only” well and multiplying by 100. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software).NA-Star assayThe NA-Star Influenza Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to measure the ability of the anti-NA mAbs to inhibit the ability of viral NA to cleave a small, soluble chemiluminescent substrate. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 25 μl of four-fold diluted antibodies (50–0.01 μg/ml) was transferred to a white, flat bottom 96-well plate. Then, 25 μl of NA-displaying VLPs was added to each well and the plate was shaken and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The NA-Star substrate was prepared shortly before use and 10 μl of the substrate was added to all wells. The plate was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and 60 μl of NA-Star accelerator solution was added to all wells immediately before the plate was read by using a microtiter plate reader (Turner BioSystems). The IC50 value was determined by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software).In vitro microneutralization (MN) assayTo assess the neutralization potency of the mAbs, 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of each indicated virus in MEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA-MEM) was incubated with two-fold diluted antibodies (50–0.78 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. hCK cells were washed with BSA-MEM and then incubated with the antibody–virus mixture in quadruplicate at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, BSA-MEM containing 1 μg/ml l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin was added to cells, and the plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C before the cytopathic effect (CPE) was examined. Antibody titers required to reduce virus replication by 50% (IC50) were calculated by using the Reed and Muench method.In vivo protection testSix-week-old female BALB/c or DBA2 mice (Japan SLC) for type A or type B were intraperitoneally inoculated with each indicated mAb at 10, 2, or 0.4 mg/kg in 250 μl of PBS. After 24 h, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally challenged with 10 MLD50 (50% mouse lethal dose) of A/H1N1pdm09 virus (mouse-adapted A/California/04/2009), A/H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), A/H3N2 virus (mouse-adapted A/Aichi/2/68), A/H7N9 virus (A/Anhui/1/2013), or B/Yamagata virus (B/Massachusetts/02/2012) in 50 μl of PBS. The body weights of four mice per group were monitored daily for 14 days. Mice that lost 25% or more of their initial body weight were scored as dead and euthanized according to institutional guidelines.Virus titers in lungFour mice per group were intraperitoneally injected with the indicated antibodies at 10 mg/kg. One day later, the mice were challenged with 10 MLD50 of the A/H1N1pdm09 virus. On days 2 and 4 post-infection, the mice were euthanized and the virus titers in the lungs were determined by using plaque assays in hCK cells.Selection of escape mutantsEscape mutants were selected by passaging A/H3N2 virus (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014) in the presence of DA03E17. Two-fold diluted antibodies (50–0.78 μg/ml) were incubated with 100- or 1000-fold diluted virus for 30 min at 37 °C. MDCK cells were washed with BSA-MEM and then incubated with the antibody–virus mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. After this incubation, BSA-MEM containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin was added to the cells and the plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested from the CPE-positive well that contained the highest antibody concentration and was used for the next passage. We regarded a virus to be an escape mutant when it replicated well in the presence of mAb at 50 μg/ml.Competitive binding assayELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of the VLPs. After being blocked with five times-diluted Blocking One, these plates were incubated for 1 h with four-fold diluted DA03E17 or 1G01 (100–0.006 μg/ml) that possessed the Fc region of mouse IgG2a. The plates were then washed with PBS-T, followed by the addition of individual human IgG1 antibodies (DA03E27, 1G01, or DA05A30) at concentrations adjusted to achieve an OD450 value of 1.5. After 1 h, an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fcγ Fragment-specific antibody (Jackson Immuno-Research) was used as the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution). The plates were incubated for 1 h and then washed with PBS-T before the addition of the TMB substrate. The reaction was stopped with 2 N sulfuric acid, and OD450 values were then measured. **P < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s tests).Viral growth kineticsTriplicate wells of confluent hCK cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0001 and incubated with BSA-MEM containing 1 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C. Supernatants were harvested at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. Virus titers were determined by the use of plaque assays with hCK cells.Structural analysisAmino acid positions were plotted on the crystal structure of the NA protein of A/Minnesota/11/2010 (A/H3N2) (PDB accession code: 6N6B) by using the PyMOL molecular graphics system.Statistical analysisTwo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test and the log-rank test were performed using GraphPad Prism software.

This year’s flu strain has already begun spreading across the United States, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been at least 880,000 cases of influenza, nearly 7,000 hospitalizations and, tragically, 360 deaths from the flu this fall, including one pediatric death. Not since 2009, during the height of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, have there been this many cases of influenza so early in the season. Despite these numbers, many people wonder if the flu is really that serious of an illness. What’s the benefit of the vaccine, especially if some people may still get the flu despite being vaccinated? Could you get the flu from the vaccine? If you get the Covid vaccine, do you still need the flu vaccine? To guide us through these questions and more, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also the author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.” The flu vaccine reduces your chance of severe illness and can reduce the likelihood of contracting the flu at all, Dr. Leana Wen said. SDI Productions/Getty Images CNN: Is the flu a serious illness? What symptoms do people experience? Dr. Leana Wen: It certainly can be serious. The CDC estimates that flu resulted between 9 million and 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths annually across the US between 2010 and 2020. Symptoms of the flu include fever, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue, coughing and a runny nose. A lot of people recover within several days, but some may still be feeling unwell as long as 10 days to two weeks after the onset of their symptoms. Some will develop complications, including sinus and ear infections, pneumonia, and inflammation of the brain. The flu can also exacerbate underlying medical conditions — for example, people with chronic lung and heart diseases can see their conditions worsen due to the flu. Even generally healthy people can become very ill due to the flu. However, those particularly susceptible to severe outcomes include those 65 and older, young children under 2, pregnant people and people with underlying medical conditions. CNN: What’s the benefit of the vaccine, especially if some people may get the flu despite being vaccinated? Wen: The flu vaccine does two things. First and most importantly, it reduces your chance of severe illness — that is, of being hospitalized or dying. Second, it can also reduce your likelihood of getting sick from the flu at all. Young woman looking sad depressed and alone in bed Lambert And Young/Digital Vision/Getty Images People experienced some key personality changes during the pandemic, study finds In a sense, this is not too different from the Covid-19 vaccine. The most important reason to get vaccinated against both the flu and the coronavirus is to prevent severe illness. New data released in the CDC’s latest morbidity and mortality report shows this year’s flu vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization by about 50%. A 2018 study found that people vaccinated against the flu were 59% less likely to be admitted to the ICU due to influenza when compared with those who were unvaccinated. The vaccine’s effectiveness can vary depending on how well matched the vaccine is to circulating influenza strains. The CDC cites vaccine effectiveness against “medically attended illness” anywhere from 23% to 61% depending on the year and vaccine-to-strain match. It’s true, then, that you could get the flu vaccine and still contract the flu. But the vaccine does reduce your chance thereof — and, crucially, it reduces the likelihood that you could end up very ill. Another thing to consider is that there are a lot of other viruses that can cause flu-like symptoms. The flu vaccine helps protect against viral infections caused by influenza, but there are a lot of other causes of viral syndromes, including adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza and others. These other viruses spread easily, too, and there aren’t vaccines against them. I often hear patients say they once got the flu the same year they had a flu vaccine, and that’s why they don’t want to get vaccinated again. But when I ask them whether they were actually diagnosed with the flu or just had flu-like symptoms, they would say the latter. CNN: Should children and pregnant people also get the flu vaccine? Wen: Absolutely. These are groups particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes, so it’s very important they receive the flu vaccine. Dr. Clair Vandersteen, left, uses a miniature camera at his hospital in Nice, France, on Monday, Feb. 8, 2021, to check inside the nasal passages of a patient, Gabriella Forgione, who says she has been unable to smell or taste since she contracted COVID-19 in November 2020. A year into the coronavirus pandemic, doctors and researchers are still striving to better understand and treat the accompanying epidemic of COVID-19-related anosmia — loss of smell — draining much of the joy of life from an increasing number of sensorially frustrated longer-term sufferers like Forgione. (AP Photo/John Leicester) John Leicester/AP/FILE Long Covid and smell: How to get the treatment you need One study found the flu vaccine reduces children’s risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75%. Another found it reduced flu-related emergency department visits in children by half. Similar results are found in people who are pregnant. Not only does the flu vaccine protect the pregnant person, if the vaccine is given during pregnancy it also helps protect their baby from the flu for the first few months of its life. That’s important, because the flu vaccine is not available to babies until they are 6 months or older. CNN: Could you get the flu from the vaccine? Wen: No. The flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, which means it does not contain the live virus and therefore cannot cause the flu. It is also a very well-tolerated vaccine, with the most common side effect being discomfort at the injection site that is gone after a day. CNN: If you got the Covid-19 vaccine, do you still need the flu vaccine? Wen: Yes. Different vaccines target different viruses. The Covid vaccine helps to protect against Covid, but does not protect against the flu, and vice versa. You can receive the Covid vaccine (or bivalent booster) at the same time as you receive the flu vaccine, just in a different injection site. CNN: Some people have been waiting until later in the flu season to get the flu vaccine. Is this a good idea? Wen: At this point, no, because it’s now clear this flu season is starting earlier than usual. Cases are already high, and it takes about two weeks to reach optimal immune protection after vaccination. I’d encourage people who have not yet received the flu vaccine to get it now. CNN: What should people know about treatments for the flu? Doctor giving vaccine, flu or influenza shot to patient with injection needle. Close up of arm and medical professional. Nurse or physician with syringe. Immunity, HPV or health care concept. Terovesalainen/Adobe Stock What to know about getting updated Covid-19 booster, flu shot at the same time Wen: Most cases of the flu can be treated symptomatically, meaning patients get rest, hydration and treatment for symptoms that come up — such as fever-reducing medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. There are also antiviral treatments available. These are really important for people at high risk for severe influenza complications and/or who are very ill. The earlier such treatments are started, the better. An oral medication, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), can also be given to non-high-risk patients, too, within 48 hours of the start of their illness. I’d encourage everyone to have an influenza plan, the same way they should have a Covid plan. Ask your doctor in advance if you should receive Tamiflu or another antiviral treatment. Know how you can get testing and where you can access treatment, including after hours and on weekends. CNN: How can people prevent catching the flu? Wen: The flu is primarily spread through droplets — if an infected person coughs or sneezes, these droplets can land on someone else nearby. It’s also possible that the droplets land on a surface, from which someone gets infected after touching it and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes.

We can help to reduce flu transmission by staying away from others while symptomatic. We should all cough or sneeze into our elbow or a tissue, and wash our hands frequently, including after touching high-contact surfaces. Individuals particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes should consider wearing a mask to reduce their chance of contracting viral illnesses like the flu. And, of course, get vaccinated!

It can cause mild to severe illness, and serious outcomes can sometimes result in hospitalization or even death. On average, about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick with the flu each year.Flu is caused by influenza viruses Type A and B, which lead to seasonal flu epidemics. Most times, flu virus is spread from person to person when infected people cough, sneeze or talk and tiny droplets land in the nose or mouth of someone nearby. It may be spread before a person knows they are sick, while they are sick, and 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. When exposed, it may take up to 4 days before you are infected.SymptomsThe flu usually comes on suddenly. Flu symptoms may include:Fever (not everyone with flu will have a fever)ChillsCoughSore throatRunny nose or congestionMuscle or body achesHeadacheFatigueIt is easy to confuse signs of the flu with a common cold. But flu symptoms are more severe and may result in serious health problems. Older people, young children, and people with certain health conditions are at a high risk of serious flu complications.TreatmentWhen a person is diagnosed with the flu, their health care provider may prescribe antiviral drugs to lessen the symptoms and length of their condition. Antivirals can also prevent the development of serious flu complications, such as pneumonia, sinus and ear infections, and inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissue.If you have the flu, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people (except to get medical care). Most people will recover in a few days, but the infection may last up to two weeks. After recovery, stay home for at least 24 hours after the fever is gone.PreventionEveryone should get a flu vaccine each year. A yearly flu vaccine is the first and most important step in preventing influenza. The flu vaccine causes antibodies that protect against infection. It is proven to reduce flu-related illnesses and the associated complications.Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk for complications from flu, such as pregnant women, children younger than 5, people with certain chronic medical conditions, and people who live or work in long-term care facilities.A reminder for parents—children under 8 years old who are getting vaccinated for the first time will need two doses of flu vaccine to be fully protected.Other preventative measures to reduce your risk of infection include:Avoiding close contact with people who are sickStay home when you are sickCover coughs and sneezesWash your hands frequentlyAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouthPractice other healthy habitsServicesFlu vaccinations are available at all District 4 Clinics by appointment.PCR test kits for COVID-19 and influenza (type A and B) are available at TestAndGo kiosks (open 24-7) in Butts, Henry and Lamar counties.The specimens are picked up daily and sent to an accredited lab for PCR testing.

Photo Details / Download Hi-Res Fight the Flu –It starts with you! Published Nov. 1, 2022 By Greg Chadwick Air Force Materiel Command Health & Wellness Team WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio -- Concerned about catching the flu? We are all at risk for getting and spreading the flu. Learn how to fight the flu – it starts with you! What is the flu? Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system – your nose, throat, and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it’s not the same as the stomach “flu” viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. How does the flu spread? Influenza viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes, or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object- such as a doorknob or table - and then transfer the viruses to your eyes, nose, or mouth. Flu germs can linger on surfaces for up to 8 hours. What are symptoms of the flu? Common signs and symptoms of the flu include: -Fever -Body aches -Chills and sweats -Headache -Sore throat -Coughing -Runny or stuffy nose -Extreme fatigue -Eye pain Most people who get the flu recover completely in one to two weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threating medical complications, such as pneumonia. What’s the difference between a cold and flu? The common cold and flu are both contagious viral infections of the respiratory tract. Although the symptoms can be similar, flu is much worse. Colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. With the flu, you are likely to run a fever for several days and have body aches, fatigue, and exhaustion, symptoms that are rarely caused by simple colds. Why should I get vaccinated against the flu? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older as the best way to protect against the flu. “A flu vaccine will not provide 100% protection from getting the flu but can reduce the amount of time you’re sick and the severity of your illness or the potential for hospitalizations,” said Lt. Col. Michael Renkas, AFMC Command Public Health Officer. “To be truly effective, it can take several days to a couple weeks for your body to elicit a more extensive immune response from a flu vaccine.” Renkas advises individuals to get a flu vaccination well in advance of the upcoming Thanksgiving Holiday to protect themselves, their family and peers upon returning to the workplace. Can flu shots cause the flu? The flu shot is made from dead viruses and cannot “give” you the flu. However, the vaccine can trigger an immune response from your body, so you may have a few mild symptoms, like achy muscles or a low-grade fever. Where can I get a flu vaccine? Influenza vaccinations for all military members are a mandatory requirement, and available through each installation’s Medical Group or at any participating TRICARE eligible pharmacies. TRICARE beneficiaries are also eligible for flu shots through immunization clinics on base, or at no cost at TRICARE eligible pharmacies. For the civilian workforce, all Federal Employee Health Benefit plans cover flu shots at no cost for members and are available at local retail pharmacies. You can find a flu vaccine location through vaccines.gov. Go to: https://www.vaccines.gov/ -Select "Find Flu Vaccines" at the top of the page -Enter your 5-digit zip code -Check your "Vaccine Options" -Select "Search for Flu Vaccines" to find a preferred location [Click on the location for further details and contact information] What are everyday healthy habits to help protect against the flu? 1. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based rub. 2. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. Germs can be spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and touches his/her eyes, nose, or mouth. 3. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk. 4. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. 5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses that cause the flu at home and work. 6. Avoid large crowds. If you’re able to limit contact with people during flu season, you can reduce your risk of getting an infection. 7. Strengthen your immune system. A strong immune system helps your body fight off infections. To build your immunity, sleep at least 7-9 hours per night. Also, maintain a regular physical activity routine-at least 30 minutes, three times a week. In addition, follow a healthy, nutrient-rich eating plan. Limit sugar, junk foods, and fatty foods. Instead, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamins and antioxidants, to promote good health.

Timely surveillance of AIVs is the basis for preparedness of the virus. This study reported the long-term surveillance of AIVs in the live bird market (LBM) of 16 cities in Shandong province from 2013 to 2019. A total of 29,895 samples were obtained and the overall positive rate of AIVs was 9.7%. The H9 was found to be the most predominant subtype in most of the time and contributed most to the monthly positve rate of AIVs as supported by the univariate and multivariate analysis, while H5 and H7 only circulated in some short periods. Then, the whole-genome sequences of 62 representative H9N2 viruses including one human isolate from a 7-year-old boy in were determined and they were genetically similar to each other with the median pairwise sequence identities ranging from 0.96 to 0.98 for all segments. The newly sequenced viruses were most similar to viruses isolated in chickens in mainland China, especially the provinces in Eastern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these newly sequenced H9N2 viruses belonged to the same clade for all segments except PB1. Nearly all of these viruses belonged to the G57 genotype which has dominated in China since 2010. Finally, several molecular markers associated with human adaptation, mammalian virulence, and drug resistance were identified in the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of the epidemic and evolution of AIVs and provides a basis for effective control of AIVs in China. Introduction The influenza A virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and contains a negative-sense RNA genome with eight segments. The influenza A virus is classified into different subtypes based on the surface proteins of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), such as H7N9, H5N1, or H9N2. The natural hosts of the influenza A virus are wild birds including both the wild waterfowl and sea birds (Webster et al., 1992). The avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are influenza A viruses that mainly infect the avians including both wild birds and poultry. The AIVs have caused numerous epidemics in poultry globally and have seriously affected the poultry industry (Su et al., 2015). Besides, they can occasionally cause human infections (Mostafa et al., 2018). Lots of subtypes of AIVs have been reported to infect humans in recent years, such as H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, H9N2, H10N8, H5N8, H3N8, and so on (Mostafa et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b). How to effectively control AIVs is a great challenge for humans. China is among the countries with the most diverse AIVs as the country has a large number of wild bird species and maintains the largest number of poultry in the world (Liu S. et al., 2020). Multiple subtypes of AIVs have circulated extensively in China in the last 20 years. Among them, the subtypes of H5, H7, and H9 are most predominant in China (Su et al., 2015; Liu S. et al., 2020). The subtype H5 has circulated in China for more than 20 years since several large-scale outbreaks occurred in 2001 which were caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus (Peng et al., 2017). The HPAI H5N1 virus has ever been considered to be most likely to cause global pandemics before 2009 when the H1N1 pandemic happened. It was almost the exclusive subtype among H5 subtypes which circulated in China before 2012 (Liu S. et al., 2020). Then, the subtypes of H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 emerged and replaced the HPAI H5N1 virus in China. The subtype H7 has been widely circulating in China since 2013 when the H7N9 virus caused human infections (Jiang et al., 2019). Until now, the H7N9 virus has caused more than 1,500 confirmed human infections and more than 500 human deaths in China (Quan et al., 2018). The virus has caused multiple outbreaks in chickens since it evolved into the HPAI virus in 2016. Fortunately, the virus is now rarely detected in China because of the simultaneous immunization of the H5 + H7 vaccine among poultry since 2017 (Li and Chen, 2021). Compared to subtypes of H5 and H7, the H9 subtype was the first AIV subtype that caused widespread infections in poultry in China (Peacock et al., 2019; Liu S. et al., 2020). The H9N2 virus has been circulating in China since the 1990s. Several large-scale surveillance studies have shown that the H9N2 virus was the most prevalent subtype in poultry in China (Bi et al., 2020). The virus also caused sporadic human infections, most of which happened in poultry workers. The H9N2 virus in China could be classified into three large clades, i.e., BJ/94, G1, and F/98 based on epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis. Li et al. further classified the H9N2 virus in China into at least 117 genotypes by evolutionary analysis (Li et al., 2017). Among them, the G57 genotype has become dominant in China since 2010 (Peacock et al., 2019). Due to the large diversity and high prevalence in birds, the H9N2 virus plays an important role in the evolution of AIVs by providing internal genes to other AIVs, which lead to novel AIVs (Peacock et al., 2019). For example, the H7N9 virus which has caused human infections since 2013 was reported to obtain all its internal genes from H9N2 viruses by re-assortment (Wu et al., 2013). Shandong is a big agricultural province of China and has a developed poultry industry which poses a high risk of AIV outbreaks. Timely surveillance of AIV is the basis for better preparedness of the virus. However, there was little data about the epidemiology and evolution of AIVs in the province in recent years. This study reported the long-term surveillance of AIVs in the live bird market (LBM) of 16 cities in Shandong province from 2013 to 2019. The H9 was found to be the most predominant subtype during the period. Thus, the whole-genome sequences of 62 representative H9N2 viruses including 61 environmental isolates and one human isolates were determined by the next-generation-sequencing method. The evolution of these viruses and the molecular markers they contained were further analyzed. The study deepens our understanding of the epidemic and evolution of AIVs and provides a basis for effective control of AIVs in China. Materials and methods Virus sampling and isolation A total of 29,895 samples were obtained from the environments including the surface wipe of poultry cages, chopping boards, poultry drinking water and feces, of LBMs in 16 cities of Shandong province, China, from 2013 to 2019. The samples were placed in the 3 ml of Viral Transport Medium (VTM), and then were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min. The supernatants were used to extract RNA with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Lot. 74,104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The real-time RT-PCR was used to detect AIVs. If the sample was positive for AIVs, the sample was further subtyped for H5, H7 and H9. The positive samples of H9 subtype were inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and incubated for 72 h at 37°C and chilled at 4°C overnight. The allantoic fluids were harvested and the influenza A(H9N2) virus strains were identified with a combination of hemagglutination assay with horse erythrocytes and real-time RT-PCR of H9N2 detection. Human H9N2 case finding and isolation On April 28th, 2020, a 7-year-old boy living in Weihai, a city in Shandong province, was taken to Weihai Municipal Hospital for influenza-like illness. A nasopharyngeal sample obtained was tested positive for influenza A and H9N2 at the Weihai Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The sample was then sent to the Shandong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention,and the virus (A/human/shandong/01/2020) was successfully isolated in embryonated chicken eggs and confirmed as H9N2. Genome sequencing A total of 62 H9N2 strains including 61 environmental strains isolated in the surveillance efforts and one human isolate mentioned above were sequenced by the next-generation-sequencing method (Supplementary Table S1). The total viral RNA of these strains was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Lot. 74,104). The RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using the SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum™ Taq High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (cat#: 12574035, Invitrogen). The DNA library was prepared using Nextera XT DNA Preparation Kits (cat#FC-131-1,096, Illumina). Whole-genome sequencing was then performed on MiSeq high-throughput sequencing platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States), and the data were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench software. Phylogenetic analysis Except for newly sequenced H9N2 viruses, we also collected other H9N2 viruses from the public database for phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequences of H9N2 viruses were downloaded from the database of Influenza Virus Resource on October 25th, 2021 (Bao et al., 2008), and were clustered using CD-HIT to create the reference sequence database (Li and Godzik, 2006). The representative viruses together with the newly sequenced viruses were used to build phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees for all eight segments of H9N2 viruses were generated by the maximum likelihood method using MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). The neighbor virus of the newly sequenced virus on each segment was identified by querying against the reference sequence database using BLASTN (version 2.13.0) (Altschul et al., 1997). The virus strain with the highest bit score was selected as the neighbor virus of the query sequence. Genotype determination The genotypes of newly sequenced H9N2 viruses were determined based on the phylogenetic analysis according to previous studies (Pu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2020). Identification of molecular markers in H9N2 viruses The human-adaptation, mammalian virulence and drug-resistance associated molecular markers in newly sequenced H9N2 viruses were identified with FluPhenotype on July 12th, 2022 (Lu et al., 2020). Statistical analysis The univariate and multivariate analysis of the monthly positive rate of influenza viruses by subtype was conducted using the “lm” function in R (version 3.6.1). Results Surveillance of AIVs in LBMs of Shandong province A total of 29,895 samples from the environments such as the surface wipe of poultry cages, poultry drinking water and feces in LBMs of 16 cities in Shandong province, China, were obtained from January 2013 to April 2019 (Figure 1A). Among them, 2,903 samples were positive for AIVs and the overall positive rate was 9.7%. When analyzed by city, the number of samples surveyed ranged from 150 to 4,977 in 16 cities. The positive rate ranged from 1 to 22% in these cities, with Binzhou, Heze and Weifang having the highest positive rates (Figure 1A). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Surveillance of AIVs in LBMs of Shandong province from 2013 to 2019. (A) The number of samples and positive rates of AIVs by city in Shandong province. The cities were colored by the positive rate. The numbers in parentheses referred to the number of samples surveyed in the city. (B) The monthly positive rate of different HA subtypes or subtype combinations of influenza A viruses. The overall monthly positive rate of AIVs ranged from 0 to 0.485 with a median of 0.052 from January 2013 to April 2019 (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S2). When analyzed by HA subtype, the monthly positive rates of H5, H7 and H9 were calculated from 2013 to 2019. Attention to note, the positive rate during the period of 2013–2015 may be underestimated as a large portion of samples was un-subtyped during the period. Both the univariate and multivariate analysis showed that the H9 subtype contributed most to the monthly positive rate (Table 1), while other HA subtypes or subtype combinations contributed little. The year and month had minor positive and negative effects, respectively, on the monthly positive rate in the univariate analysis, although both had no statistical significance. Interestingly, they became statistically significant in the multivariate analysis, suggesting complex interactions between subtype, year and month. TABLE 1 Table 1. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the monthly positive rate by subtype. As shown in Figure 1B, H9 was the main subtype in most of the time (Figure 1B), which was consistent with the univariate and multivariate analysis. It persisted circulating throughout the year from 2013 to 2019. In general, the H9 peaked in the winters and maintained a low level of circulation in the summers. H5 mainly circulated during the season of 2015–2016. It caused sporadic infections in some months. H7 circulated least compared to H5 and H9. It only dominated in the April of 2017 when 20 cases of human infections of the H7N9 virus were reported in Shandong province in the same year (Zhang et al., 2020), and maintained a very low level of activity in most of the time. Besides the positive rates of individual HA subtypes, we also surveyed the co-occurrence of H5, H7, and H9 during the period. As expected, most co-occurrences happened between H9 and H5 or H7, and the co-occurrences were observed when both HA subtypes had high positive rates such as the co-occurrence of H9 and H5 observed in early 2016. Only a few co-occurrences of H5 and H7 were observed from 2013 to 2019 (Figure 1B). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of representative H9N2 viruses Since the H9 was the most dominant subtype in our surveillance, the whole genome sequences of 62 representative H9N2 strains including 61 environment strains and one human isolate were obtained using the next-generation-sequencing method for better understanding the genetic evolution of H9N2 viruses in Shandong province (Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Figure 2, for all segments, the median pairwise sequence identities ranged from 0.96 to 0.98. The gene M had the highest pairwise sequence identities, while the NA gene had the lowest pairwise sequence identities. The HA gene had pairwise sequence identities ranging from 0.93 to 1, with a median of 0.97. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Pairwise sequence identities of each segment between newly sequenced H9N2 viruses. These viruses were further genetically characterized by the phylogenetic analysis. For each segment of H9N2 viruses, several reference viruses of influenza H9N2 viruses were selected from the Influenza Virus Resource database and were used in phylogenetic analysis with the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure 3, for all segments except PB1, all newly sequenced H9N2 strains (colored in red) belonged to the same clade (marked with a dashed box). For PB1, all viruses belong to clade 5 except the viral isolate A/Environment/shandong-dongying/08/2015 which belonged to clade 2 and was clustered with sequences isolated from wild birds (Supplementary Figure S1). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. The phylogeny of H9N2 viruses on each segment. The newly sequenced H9N2 viruses were colored in red in the trees. The human isolate was marked with blue stars. The details of these trees were shown in Supplementary Figure S1. We then investigated the possible source of the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses since all of them except the human isolate were isolated from the environment. For each segment of each virus, the neighbor of the virus (defined as the most similar virus) was obtained (see Materials and Methods), and the composition of the host, isolation location and year of the neighbors were analyzed (Figure 4). In terms of host, for all segments, most neighbors were isolated from the poultry including chicken and ducks, especially the chicken. In terms of isolation location, nearly all neighbors were isolated from mainland China, especially the Shandong province and its neighboring provinces in Eastern China such as Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. In terms of isolation time, most neighbors were isolated in the same year with, or 1 year before or after the year when the virus was isolated. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. The host, isolation location and year composition of the neighbors of newly sequenced H9N2 viruses isolated in the environment. The neighbors of the human isolate A/human/shandong/01/2020 were analyzed individually. In terms of host, the neighbors of the human isolate were isolated from chicken for all segments; in terms of isolation location, for five segments (HA, NA, MP, PA and PB2), the neighbors were isolated in Anhui province, while for NP, NS and PB1, the neighbors were isolated in Fujian, Jiangxi and Shanxi province, respectively; in terms of isolation time, the neighbors of the human isolate were isolated in 2018 for all segments except NA of which the neighbor was isolated in 2019. Genotyping of newly sequenced H9N2 viruses The genotypes of newly sequenced H9N2 viruses were determined based on the phylogenetic analysis according to Li’s study (Supplementary Table S3) (Materials and Methods). All viruses except A/Environment/shandong-dongying/08/2015 belonged to the G57 genotype which was first found in Eastern China in 2007 and has been the predominant genotype in China since 2010 (Li et al., 2017). The A/Environment/shandong-dongying/08/2015 belonged to G69 genotype which has a different PB1 clade compared to G57 and was rarely reported in China. Molecular markers of H9N2 viruses Finally, we investigated the molecular markers associated with human adaptation, mammalian virulence, and drug resistance in the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses using FluPhenotype (Lu et al., 2020) (Materials and Methods). In terms of human adaptation, 11 molecular markers that were located in 7 proteins were observed, and 7 of them happened in more than 50 viruses (Table 2). For example, Threonine on 180 of the HA protein that was reported to be associated with an increase in binding to the human-like receptor was observed in 51 of 62 newly sequenced H9N2 viruses. The human isolate A/human/shandong/01/2020 had 6 human-adaptation associated molecular markers including HA-180 T, HA2-46E, PA-356R, PB1-368 V, PB1-F2-47S and PB2-66 M. TABLE 2 Table 2. The human-adaptation-related molecular markers identified in the newly sequenced H9N2 virus strains. In terms of mammalian virulence, 30 molecular markers that were located in 6 proteins were observed and 18 of them happened in more than 50 viruses (Table 3). For example, three markers in the MP1 protein including 30D, 43 M and 215A which were reported to increase virulence in mammals were observed in all 62 newly sequenced H9N2 viruses. The human isolate A/human/shandong/01/2020 had 6 molecular markers associated with mammalian virulence including MP1-30D, MP1-43 M, MP1-215A, NS1-42S, PA-224S and PB2-431 M. TABLE 3 Table 3. The mammalian-virulence-related molecular markers identified in the newly sequenced H9N2 strains. In terms of drug resistance, 4 molecular markers which were located in NA and MP2 proteins were observed (Supplementary Table S4). The molecular marker NA-151D which was reported to be associated with resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, and molecular markers of MP2-21G and MP2-31 N which were reported to be associated with resistance to amantadine were observed in more than 60 newly sequenced H9N2 strains. Discussion The LBM has been reported to play an important role in the spreading of AIVs because numerous poultry are transported in and out of LBMs (Cardona et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018). Studies have shown that closing the LBM had a large impact on the human infection of AIVs such as H7N9 viruses (Yu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018). Besides, the LBM was also considered to be a vessel for mixing AIVs (Cardona et al., 2009). Lots of novel viruses can be generated in the LBM by re-assortment such as the H7N9 virus which has caused human infections since 2013 (Wu et al., 2013). In this study, we surveyed the AIV in LBMs of Shandong province from 2013 to 2019 and found persistent circulations of AIVs in the province. The H9 was found to be the main subtype in most of the time, while the H5 and H7 only dominated in some short periods. These were consistent with previous studies which showed the predominant role of H9 in China (Peacock et al., 2019; Liu S. et al., 2020). Our analysis also found significant co-occurrence of H5, H7 and H9, suggesting the high risk of re-assortment of AIVs in the LBM. Therefore, continual surveillance of AIVs in the LBM is required for the timely identification of novel flu viruses. Vaccination is the best way for controlling the avian influenza virus. Large scale vaccination of poultry has been conducted in China for prevention and control of the avian influenza viruses including H5, H9 and H7 (Liu S. et al., 2020). On one hand, vaccination can greatly stop the spreading of avian influenza virus. For example, massive vaccination of chickens with an H5/H7 bivalent avian influenza vaccine since September 2017 has successfully controlled H7N9 avian influenza infections in poultry (Li and Chen, 2021). Our surveillance also showed that few H5 or H7 epidemics were found in Shandong provinces since 2018. One the other hand, vaccination pressure can drive the antigenic evolution of avian influenza viruses such as H5 virus (Peng et al., 2017). More surveillance of the antigenic variation of both H5 and H7 viruses are needed to capture the antigenic variant in time. A total of 62 H9N2 viruses were sequenced in the study. They were found to be highly similar to each other in all segments. All of these viruses except one isolate belonged to the G57 genotype which has been the dominant genotype of H9N2 viruses circulating in China since 2010. This is consistent with Li’s study which showed that all nine strains of H9N2 viruses isolated in chicken flocks in Shandong province in 2018 belonged to the G57 genotype (Li et al., 2019a). This suggested the great advantage of G57 compared to other genotypes in China. Most newly sequenced H9N2 viruses were similar to those isolated in chickens in mainland China, suggesting the prevalence of H9N2 viruses in chickens. Molecular markers play important roles in surveillance of emerging influenza viruses, such as monitoring the antigenic variation, drug resistance and host adaptation of the virus (Chen et al., 2006; Liu W. J. et al., 2020). Lots of molecular markers of antigen, host, pathogenicity and drug-resistance have been identified for influenza viruses (Lu et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020). In the study, all newly sequenced H9N2 viruses harbored several molecular markers associated with human adaptation, mammalian virulence and drug resistance. Although most molecular markers have been experimentally-validated, the role of them in the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses may be changed due to the epistasis (Lyons and Lauring, 2018). Further experiments are needed to validate their role in the newly sequenced H9N2 viruses. Interestingly, the human H9N2 isolate did not have more molecular markers than other viruses, suggesting that the isolate may infect humans accidentally. Nevertheless, more strict protective measures against the H9N2 infection are needed for high-risk people such as poultry worker. Overall, this study systematically surveyed the AIVs in the LBM of Shandong province from 2013 to 2019 and further revealed the diversity and evolution of H9N2 viruses in the province. It deepens our understanding of the epidemic and evolution of AIVs, and would greatly facilitate the prevention and control of AIVs in China.

It seems there’s no shortage of reasons people offer to avoid getting an annual flu shot. (And let’s be realistic, most folks are not exactly eager for a needle poke.)AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyBut there’s a valid reason why flu shot campaigns ramp up every fall. To put it simply: The vaccine works. It’s a safe and effective way to prevent or limit influenza.And it’s not hyperbole to call the flu shot lifesaving.But we understand that there are myths out there about the shot — and that many people naturally worry about vaccines. So, let’s talk about them and separate fact from fiction to put your mind at ease.Myth #1: The flu shot can give you the fluThis may be the most common misperception out there. So, let’s get straight to the point: The flu vaccine CANNOT give you the flu virus.The reason why is simple. Flu vaccines given through a shot in the arm are made either with dead strains of an influenza virus or with only a single protein from a flu virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The nasal spray vaccine includes a live-yet-weakened flu virus. This form of vaccination is more limited than the traditional flu shot and has recommended restrictions.Bottom line, though: Neither form of vaccination will give you the flu.Myth #2: You don’t need a flu shot every yearIf last year’s shot kept you flu-free, why get another one? What worked then should just keep working, right?Well, not exactly. For one, “the flu” isn’t a singular entity that never changes. The virus is continually evolving and different strains circulate. (The CDC explains it by using the terms “drift” and “shift.”)AdvertisementThe annual flu vaccines are made specifically for the upcoming season’s expected flu strain. The effectiveness doesn’t carry over from year to year.Myth #3: Healthy people don’t need a flu shotFlu shots are only for unhealthy folks who usually get sick, right? And since you eat smart, workout five days a week and can’t remember the last time you had so much as the sniffles, you’re all good.Well, first of all, kudos for taking such good care of yourself and building a strong foundation for your immune system.But that doesn’t mean that you can’t get sick. On average, somewhere between 10% and 20% of the U.S. population gets influenza — and there some are very healthy people that will be in that group.Getting a flu shot lowers your risk of getting the flu by 40% to 60%, according to the CDC.And even if you do get the flu, vaccination can help reduce its severity of it.So, if you’re truly focused on your health, getting a flu shot should be at the top of your to-do list.Myth #4: The flu is just a bad coldThe flu isn’t “just a cold.” It’s a potentially deadly illness.In the United States, annual deaths connected to influenza ranged from 12,000 to 52,000 between 2010 and 2020, reports the CDC. Yearly hospitalizations from the virus fluctuated between 140,000 and 710,000 over the same timeframe.Myth #5: It’s not safe to get a flu shot while pregnantIt’s actually not safe to avoid a flu shot during pregnancy. Given all that your body is going through growing a fetus, pregnancy increases your risk of severe flu complications should you get sick.Research shows that people who get vaccinated and avoid the flu have healthier pregnancies and are less likely to have a baby with birth defects or other issues.An added bonus? The flu vaccine doesn’t just offer your fetus immune protection in the uterus. It also provides protection the first several months of your baby’s life after birth, when they’re too young to get vaccinated.And the CDC recommends that people who are pregnant get a flu shot as opposed to the nasal spray vaccine.Myth #6: You can’t get a flu shot with an egg allergySevere allergic reactions to flu shots are very rare — and researchers found that having an egg allergy does not increase your risk despite most vaccines containing egg protein from the production process.Still concerned? Well, you’ve got options. There are two vaccines (Flublok® Quadrivalent and Flucelvax® Quadrivalent) manufactured without the use of eggs.Bottom line?The CDC recommends that just about everyone age 6 months or older get an annual flu vaccination. (There are a few, rare health-related exceptions.)So, find a vaccination site today. There really isn’t a good excuse not to.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

However, the underlying mechanism by which H7N9 virus causes human infection remains elusive.MethodsHerein, we infected A549 cells with H7N9 virus for different times and assessed tripartite motif-containing protein 46 (TRIM46) expression. To determine the role of TRIM46 in H7N9 infection, we applied lentivirus-based TRIM46 short hairpin RNA sequences and overexpression plasmids to explore virus replication, and changes in type I interferons and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation levels in response to silencing and overexpression of TRIM46. Finally, we used Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays to examine the mechanism by which TRIM46 mediated the activity of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1).ResultsType I interferons play an important role in defending virus infection. Here, we found that TRIM46 levels were significantly increased during H7N9 virus infection. Furthermore, TRIM46 knockdown inhibited H7N9 virus replication compared to that in the control group, while the production of type I interferons increased. Meanwhile, overexpression of TRIM46 promoted H7N9 virus replication and decrease the production of type I interferons. In addition, the level of phosphorylated IRF3, an important interferon regulatory factor, was increased in TRIM46-silenced cells, but decreased in TRIM46 overexpressing cells. Mechanistically, we observed that TRIM46 could interact with TBK1 to induce its K48-linked ubiquitination, which promoted H7N9 virus infection.ConclusionOur results suggest that TRIM46 negatively regulates the human innate immune response against H7N9 virus infection. BackgroundThe influenza A virus, avian influenza H7N9 virus, belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 and posed a threat to public health [1,2,3]. As we all know, the H7N9 influenza viruses have caused over 1500 human infections, with a mortality rate of nearly 40%. A number of previous studies have offered valuable information on the pathogenesis, prevention and control of the H7N9 virus. [4,5,6,7]. Most patients infected with H7N9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe lung pneumonia, which was caused by a fierce increase in the expression levels of cytokines and chemokines [2, 8]. Wan et al. [9] found that a ‘cytokine storm’ in the lungs of H7N9-infected patients was associated with activation of gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. However, the host factors involved in viral replication remains elusive. Thus, a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of H7N9 infection would be useful to combat future H7N9 virus outbreaks.The first line of defense against invading pathogens is the innate immune response. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which subsequently activates the downstream innate immune response [10, 11]. During influenza virus infection, the RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I) receptor senses influenza genomic RNA and recruits the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to induce the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which finally induces the production of type I interferons [12,13,14].The tripartite motif family (TRIM) of proteins have been intensively studied in virus infection. One member, TRIM46, could regulate cancer cell viability, apoptosis, and the cell cycle [15,16,17]. However, the function of TRIM46 in H7N9 infection and its underlying mechanism remain to be determined. In this study, we aimed to identify the function of TRIM46 in H7N9 virus infection and the underlying mechanism between TRIM46 and the production of host RLR-dependent type I interferons. The results showed that, during H7N9 virus infection, TRIM46 acts as a negative regulator of the host innate immune response. Upon H7N9 virus infection, TRIM46 expression gradually increased over time. Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM46 resulted in increased production of type I interferons and phosphorylation of IRF3, whereas its overexpression had the opposite effects. Finally, we observed that TRIM46-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 resulted in the inhibition of host innate immunity. Thus, this study revealed novel activities of TRIM46 in innate immunity, which potentiates the study of innate immunity against virus infection.MethodsCell culture and virus strainThe American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) provided the A549, HEK293T, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/mL). All cell lines were cultured in a 37 °C incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ten-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen free chicken eggs were used to isolate and propagate Influenza A Virus strain A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9). The allantoic fluid from the infected chicken eggs was collected and preserved at − 80 °C. The median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) method was used to determine the virus titer, which was calculated using the Reed-Muench method. All the live H7N9 virus experiments were performed in a bio-safety level 3 laboratory at the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Registration No. CNAS BL0022).Lentivirus-mediated plasmid transfectionFor TRIM46 knockdown, two short hairpin interfering (shRNA) sequences were designed against two different regions of TRIM46 (the target sequence of TRIM46#1 was 5’- GCTGCTGACAGAGCTTAACTT -3’, the target sequence of TRIM46#2 was 5’- CTGGCACTATACCGTTGAGTT -3’) and cloned and packed into lentiviruses. A TRIM46 overexpression construct was also created and cloned and packed into lentiviruses. The TRIM46 shRNA and overexpression lentiviruses were transfected separately into A549 cells for 72 h. The transfection efficiency was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Western blotting analysisCells were harvested and lysed for 30 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysed cells were then subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × rpm and 4 °C. We retained the supernatants and determined their protein contents using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation. The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane. Non-specific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then added with the appropriate primary antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Next day, three washes with TBST carried out and then the membranes were incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent was used to visualize the immune-reactive proteins. Primary antibodies against TRIM46 (ab169044), Influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) (ab128193), Myc tag (ab9106), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (ab8245) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Primary antibodies against phosphorylated (p)-IRF3 (#4947) and IRF3 (#4302) were provided by Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany) provided the anti-FLAG Tag antibody.Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)The TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to extract total RNA from cells. Reverse transcription was then used to produce cDNA from the total RNA.For influenza virus replication, NP RNAs were reverse-transcribed with primers as following: NP mRNA using oligo (dT), NP cRNA using 5’- AGTAGAAACAAGG -3’, NP vRNA using 5’- AGCGAAAGCAGG -3’. The cDNA was then quantified using quantitative real-time PCR with gene-specific primers. GAPDH mRNA was quantified as an internal control and the 2−ΔΔCt method was used to analyze the relative quantity of the target genes. The primers used in this study were as follows: TRIM46 Forward primer: 5ʹ-GATTGCCCGAGCCACTGAA-3ʹ,Reverse primer: 5ʹ-AGGCACTCGCAGGAAGTTAAG-3ʹ; NP Forward primer: 5ʹ-ATCAGACCGAACGAGAATCCAGC-3ʹ,Reverse primer: 5ʹ-GGAGGCCCTCTGTTGATTAGTGT-3ʹ; IFNA (encoding interferon alpha) Forward primer: 5ʹ-GCCTCGCCCTTTGCTTTACT-3ʹ,Reverse primer: 5ʹ-CTGTGGGTCTCAGGGAGATCA-3ʹ; IFNB1 (encoding interferon B1) Forward primer: 5ʹ-AAAGAAGCAGCAATTTTCAGC-3ʹ,Reverse primer: 5ʹ-CCTTGGCCTTCAGGTAATGCA-3ʹ; GAPDH Forward primer: 5ʹ-AGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA-3ʹ,Reverse primer: 5ʹ-GGTCATTGATGGCAACAA-3ʹ.Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)The indicated plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. The cells were collected and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min in IP lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 0.025 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitor/PMSF, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × rpm under 4 °C. We retained the supernatants, one third of which was used for input analysis and the other two thirds were incubated with Anti-Myc Magnetic beads (Pierce #88842, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), or IgG control, overnight at 4 °C for IP analysis. IP lysis buffer was then used to wash the precipitates three times, followed by boiling the samples in 2 × loading buffer. Western blotting was then used to analyze the precipitates using the indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (conformation specific) (#5127, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-mouse IgG (Light Chain Specific) (#58,802, Cell Signaling Technology) secondary antibodies. The immune-reactive proteins were visualized using the ECL reagent.Ubiquitination assayWe transfected HEK293T cells with a TBK1-Flag plasmid (overexpressing FLAG-tagged TBK1) together with the TRIM46-Myc plasmid (overexpressing Myc-tagged TRIM46) or not. The cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection and lysed in 1% SDS buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.1), 1% SDS, sodium pyrophosphate, EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell extracts were then subjected to IP using anti-Flag magnetic beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times and then subjected to western blotting using antibodies recognizing wild-type (WT) Ubiquitin (ab134953), K48-linked Ubiquitin (ab140601), and K63-linked Ubiquitin (ab179434) (all from Abcam).Statistical analysisData analysis and processing were carried out using GraphPad Prism software version 7 (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The statistical difference between two groups was analyzed using an unpaired Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to analyze the differences among multiple groups. Statistical significance was indicated by p < 0.05. In all figures, * indicates p < 0.05, ** indicates p < 0.01, and *** indicates p < 0.001.ResultsTRIM46 expression is upregulated in H7N9 virus-infected A549 cells.First, to determine the relationship between H7N9 virus infection and TRIM46 expression, we infected the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 with H7N9 virus for different times and detected the TRIM46 protein level using western blotting and the TRIM46 mRNA expression level using qRT-PCR. The results showed that H7N9 virus induced the TRIM46 protein at different times, reaching a peak at 48 h post infection (h.p.i) (Fig. 1A). The mRNA level increased gradually, also peaked at 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 1B). These results indicated the H7N9 virus infection could induce TRIM46 expression.Fig. 1H7N9/ZJU-1 increases TRIM46 expression. A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plate and infected with H7N9/ZJU-1 for indicated times, cells were harvested. The protein expression levels of TRIM46, H7N9/ZJU-1 NP were measured by western blotting and GAPDH was used as an internal control (A), and the relative mRNA of TRIM46 at indicated times were analyzed by RT-qPCR (B)Full size imageTRIM46 knockdown inhibits H7N9 virus infectionTo explore whether TRIM46 expression could regulate H7N9 virus infection, we used lentivirus-packaged TRIM46 shRNA#1 and TRIM46 shRNA#2 sequences to generate A549 TRIM46 knockdown cells. We then detected the protein and mRNA levels of TRIM46. The results showed that TRIM46 shRNA#1and #2 both worked well to reduce the protein and mRNA levels of TRIM46 in A549 cells (Fig. 2A, B). A549 cells transfected with negative control or TRIM46 knockdown cells were infected with H7N9 virus for 12 h and A549 mock group cells were used as a control group. The results showed that TRIM46 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of the H7N9 virus NP protein (Fig. 2C). The qRT-PCR showed decreased NP mRNA, cRNA and vRNA expression (Fig. 2D) and the TICD50 detection of the virus titer showed that TRIM46 knockdown decreased the H7N9 virus titer compared with that in the negative control group (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the results showed that knockdown of TRIM46 reduced H7N9 virus replication.Fig. 2Knockdown of TRIM46 inhibits H7N9/ZJU-1 replication. A549 cells were transfected with negative control sequences and TRIM46 knockdown sequences, TRIM46#1 and TRIM46#2, for 72 h, cells were harvested, the protein levels of TRIM46 were measured by western blotting (A) and the mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR (B). C. A549 cells were transfected with TRIM46 shRNA sequence or negative control sequences for 72 h, infected with H7N9/ZJU-1 for 12 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to western blotting with indicated antibodies. TRIM46 Knockdown cells and negative control cells were infected with H7N9/ZJU-1 for 12 h, the relative levels of NP mRNA, cRNA and vRNA were measured by RT-qPCR (D). The supernatant of TRIM46 knockdown cells and negative control cells was collected and viral titers were determined by TCID50 method (E)Full size imageTRIM46 overexpression promoted H7N9 virus replicationWe further determined whether overexpression of TRIM46 could promote H7N9 virus replication. We transfected A549 cells with lentivirus-packaged empty vector or TRIM46 overexpression plasmids for 48 h, and then used western blotting and qRT-PCR to detect the protein and mRNA levels of TRIM46. The results showed successful overexpression of TRIM46 in A549 cells (Fig. 3A, B). Subsequently, we infected the A549 empty vector group and TRIM46 overexpression group with H7N9 virus for 12 h, and then detected the NP protein and mRNA, cRNA and vRNA expression levels and the H7N9 virus titer. The results showed that overexpression of TRIM46 increased the H7N9 virus NP protein and RNA levels and increased the H7N9 virus titer compared with that of the empty vector group (Fig. 3C–E).Fig. 3Overexpression of TRIM46 promotes H7N9/ZJU-1 infection. A.

The analysis results were presented with mean ± SD, in all situations, a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001Full size imageTRIM46 negatively regulates type I IFNs and the activation of IRF3Type I IFNs plays an important role in defending against virus infection. To examine the role of TRIM46 in the context of viral infection, we examined the expression levels of IFNA and IFNB1. Knockdown of TRIM46 increased IFNA and IFNB1 mRNA expression levels during influenza H7N9 infection (Fig. 4A, B), meanwhile, ectopic expression of TRIM46 decreased IFNA and IFNB1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4D, E). IRF3 activation is essential for the production of type I IFNs during virus infection. Therefore, we determined the level of phosphorylated IRF3 in influenza H7N9-infected cells. The results showed that TRIM46 knockdown increased the level of phosphorylated IRF3 and overexpression of TRIM46 decreased the level of phosphorylated IRF3 (Fig. 4C, F).Fig. 4A–C Knockdown of TRIM46 accelerates H7N9/ZJU-1-induced type I interferon expression. A549 cells were transfected with lentivirus-mediated TRIM46 knockdown sequences or negative control sequences, after 72 h, the cells were infected with H7N9/ZJU-1 or mock-treated for 12 h, the cells were harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR for analysis of IFNA mRNA (A) and IFNB1 mRNA (B). A549 cells were transfected with lentivirus-mediated TRIM46 shRNA sequence for 72 h, infected with H7N9/ZJU-1 (MOI = 1) for another 12 h. The cells were lysed and pho-IRF3, IRF3 and GAPDH were measured by western blotting (C). D–F Overexpression of TRIM46 inhibits H7N9/ZJU-1-induced type I interferon expression.

Cells lysates were collected and subjected to western blotting with anti-pho-IRF3, IRF3 and GAPDH antibodies (F). The results were shown as mean ± SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001Full size imageTRIM46 interacts with TBK1To investigate the interaction between TRIM46 and TBK1, TRIM46-Myc overexpression plasmids, together with TBK1-Flag or empty vector were transfected into HEK293T cells for 24 h, followed by a Co-IP. As expected, the results showed that TRIM46-Myc interacted with TBK1-Flag (Fig. 5, Additional file 1: Fig. 1A). The above results suggested that TRIM46 interacts with TBK1 to regulate innate immune response.Fig. 5TRIM46 interacts with TBK1. A. HEK293T cells were transfected with TRIM46-Myc plasmids with or not with TBK1-FLAG plasmids. After 24 h transfection, the cells were lysed and immuno-precipitated with anti-Myc antibody and subjected to western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies. The input cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies, and GAPDH was used as an internal control. B. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector plasmids or TRIM46-Myc expression plasmids for 24 h, the cells were lysed and immuno-precipitated with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-Flag antibodies. Whole cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-Flag antibodies and GAPDH was used as an internal control. All data were repeated for three independent experiments and the data shown as one representative of the triplicate experimentsFull size imageTRIM46 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1To identify how TRIM46 regulates TBK1 expression, HEK293T cells were transfected with TBK1 together different doses of TRIM46 plasmids for 24 h transfection. The results showed that TRIM46 degraded TBK1 expression gradually (Additional file 1: Fig. S1B). Moreover, to investigate whether TRIM46 ubiquitinates TBK1, we transfected HEK293T cells with TBK1-Flag plasmids together with TRIM46-Myc or the empty vector for 24 h. The results demonstrated that overexpression of TRIM46 promoted TBK1 ubiquitination (Fig. 6A), suggesting TRIM46 promotes H7N9 replication by regulating TBK1-dependent innate immunity. To further determine whether TRIM46 ubiquitinates TBK1 via K48- or K63-linked ubiquitination, we determined K48-linked or K63-linked ubiquitination levels. The results demonstrated K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 mediated by TRIM46 (Fig. 6B), rather than K63-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 6C).Fig. 6TRIM46 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1. HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids for 24 h, after transfection, the cells were lysed and immune-precipitated with anti-Flag antibody and subjected to western blotting for detection of WT-linked (A), K48-linked (B), K63-linked (C) ubiquitination. Anti-Myc, anti-Flag and GAPDH were used for the inputFull size imageDiscussionA number of studies have proposed that influenza virus could use multiple host cellular components to replicate and infect host cells. Besides, influenza has evolved to utilize host factors to inhibit the host innate immune response to evade immune surveillance and eradication [18,19,20,21,22]. For example, the influenza virus NS1 protein, which plays multiple roles between influenza virus and host innate immune responses, inhibits MAVS/IKK-mediated interferon production [23, 24]. Type I interferons play important roles in defending against virus replication, and virus infection induces a series of cellular antiviral signals to produce type I interferons [25, 26]. To screen and identify the host protein regulators involved in regulating the innate immune response against viruses would be helpful to identify therapeutic targets that manipulate the cellular antivirus responses. In the present study, we found that H7N9 virus-induced TRIM46 negatively regulated the production of type I IFNs by regulating the phosphorylation of IRF3. Furthermore, we discovered that TRIM46 interacts with TBK1, leading to TBK1 degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination. Our results suggest a novel function of TRIM46 in H7N9 virus infection.TRIM proteins, belonging to the ubiquitin E3 ligase family, participate in regulating the host innate immune response against virus infection. A number of TRIM family proteins, such as TRIM22, TRIM25, TRIM35, TRIM56, have been found to be involved in the replication or pathogenesis of influenza virus [27,28,29,30]. TRIM proteins function as positive or negative regulators in host innate immune signaling pathways by mediating the ubiquitination of signaling protein [27,28,29,30,31]. For example, TRIM21 interacts with MAVS and catalyzes its K27-linked poly-ubiquitination to promote innate immune response against RNA viruses. By contrast, another TRIM family protein, TRIM29, inhibits host innate immunity by inducing K11-linked ubiquitination of MAVS [32, 33]. Our study demonstrated that TRIM46 promotes H7N9 virus infection by mediating the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, which leads to TBK1 degradation, thus inhibiting innate immunity.During virus infection, virus RNA is sensed by PRRs, which include RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [34,35,36,37]. After influenza virus infection, influenza viral RNA is recognized by the RIG-I receptor, which activates and recruits the downstream TBK1/IKKγ/IKKε complex to induce IRF3 signaling, resulting in the production of type I interferons [38, 39]. Notably, viruses have involved multiple strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance and elimination, among which TBK1 is a target for virus-induced degradation. For instance, the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein inhibits the production of type I interferons through induction of K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, which subsequently impairs IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization [40]. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2S could interact with TBK1 and recruit USP15 to remove the K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains of TBK1 [41]. Phosphatase PP4 dephosphorylates and deactivates TBK1 to inhibit the production of type I interferons [42]. The ubiquitin–proteasome pathway plays an important role in protein degradation, and ubiquitination of TBK1 is an important method of modulate the production of type I interferons during virus infection, during which process, viral proteins and host proteins participate [43,44,45]. In the present study, we found that TRIM46 could promote K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, which inhibited the phosphorylation of IRF3 and decreased the production of type I interferons.ConclusionsTaken together, the results of the present our study show that H7N9-induced TRIM46 negatively regulates the production of type I interferons by inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation by inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 (Fig. 7). This study highlights the underlying mechanism by which H7N9 virus escapes the host innate immune response, which might lead to the development of novel antiviral agents to prevent or treat H7N9 virus infection.Fig. 7Schematic model of TRIM46-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1.

Then, TRIM46 mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 and degraded TBK1, subsequently, decreased the phosphorylation of IRF3 and type I IFNs expressionFull size image Availability of data and materials All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.

CoronavirusNovember 1, 2022 A tripledemic expected this winterBy Tricia Tomiyoshi RSV, flu and COVID-19 are coming (SACRAMENTO) Just when we thought the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was over, experts are warning that a tripledemic is heading our way this winter. This trio of viral threats includes respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (flu) and COVID. Many children’s hospitals in other parts of the country are already experiencing a surge, fueled by a spike in respiratory viruses, leaving them with no free beds. "COVID cases are expected to rise during the winter. This will be occurring at the same time we expect to see influenza rates increase while we are already seeing an early start to RSV season,” said Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital. “With all three viruses on the rise, we are worried about an increase in the rates of viral infection that may lead to an increase in hospitalizations.” We asked Blumberg about ways to keep ourselves and our families safe this winter. What symptoms should we look out for? With COVID-19, symptoms include: fever or chills respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, runny nose) loss of taste and smell fatigue sore throat muscle or body aches headache Influenza (flu) is typically defined by a really rapid onset. You might be feeling fine one minute, then all of a sudden, you feel like you were hit by a freight train. You can expect: fever or chills respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, runny nose) muscle aches and pains headaches Children tend to have more stomach symptoms with influenza – stomachache, vomiting and diarrhea - compared to RSV and COVID. RSV results in runny noses and frequent sneezing, but it’s generally a milder infection compared to flu and COVID. Other RSV symptoms include: coughing fever wheezing decrease in appetite In order to confirm which virus is causing infection, a nasal swab test would need to be ordered by your primary care physician. What is RSV? RSV is a common upper respiratory infection that circulates in the community every year. Some people may even get it twice a year. Children are generally infected in the first 3 years of life, and reinfection is common. It’s primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes. But the following groups are at higher risk for getting more severe RSV, resulting in hospitalization: young children children born prematurely or born with other congenital health conditions the elderly If your child is having trouble breathing, their lips are turning blue, or their ribs are sticking out when they are breathing, then you should bring them to the emergency department. An estimated 58,000 children under 5 years old are hospitalized from RSV every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What are the treatment options for RSV? Children can get supportive care. They may receive oxygen to help them breathe. Some children work so hard on their breathing that they may fall behind on their fluids and get dehydrated. For children most vulnerable to severe infection, there is a monoclonal antibody preventative injection, palivizumab, that is given once per month during the RSV season to prevent infection. But there’s only a small number of children who qualify. There is no vaccine available for RSV. However, RSV vaccines are in development and might be available in the next few years. Why did we not see a tripledemic last winter? Last year, we still had more masking in place and social distancing, so we didn’t have the increased risk of transmission in the same way. RSV rates increased this summer, which is early, but they didn’t reach a very high rate. We did see a large increase of influenza this year in the southern hemisphere during their winter, which is our summer. In Australia, influenza rates were greater than anytime seen in the last 10 years. They were three times greater than normal. This is usually predictive of what we’re going to see in the U.S. We’re worried that it will be a bad influenza year and a bad RSV year, on top of COVID. What should we expect to see with COVID-19 this winter? Well, we got through the Omicron period and the latest BA4/BA5 wave. The models suggest that we are going to see an increase in cases this winter and that’s to be expected because COVID is part of the coronavirus family, which peaks during the winter months. The humidity and the temperature favor viral survival. That’s why we do expect an increase in cases this winter. The new bivalent boosters are recommended. One of the main advantages is that it combines the original and the Omicron strains, which results in a wider, more diverse immune response. Not only will this protect against currently circulating strains, but it’s expected to provide better protection against emerging variants that we haven’t even seen yet. The side effects of the booster are very similar to the primary series and other boosters that people are already familiar with: Pain at the injection site Fever Fatigue Headache This generally lasts a day or two. The protections are expected to be better than the previous boosters. It takes two weeks to get the full immune response. People over 50 years of age really need their boosters since they are at an increased risk for hospitalizations and death. Also, anyone who has underlying conditions, anyone eligible for a booster, should get their booster to decrease their risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death. What are other ways that we can stay safe? For COVID and influenza, being vaccinated and boosted provides your best protection. The influenza vaccine is updated yearly, aiming to include strains predicted to be circulating. So far, the strains in this year’s shot are a good match to the circulating strains, so we’re hopeful that the vaccine will provide good protection. Even if you get a breakthrough infection, you will have a milder illness, so I recommend this for everyone 6 months of age and older. You can get the COVID shot and flu shot at the same time. Masks also protect against all of these respiratory viral infections. People who want to decrease their risk of infection can continue to mask indoors and around others outside of their household. The standard rectangular surgical masks continue to provide about a 50% decreased risk against disease. If you want to up your game, you can wear a KN95 or an N95. These will provide about an 80% decreased risk against COVID transmission, and also decrease risk of RSV and influenza. What about other treatments? If people do get infected with COVID, they may want to contact their health care provider. There are a variety of available treatments. For people over 50, the oral antiviral Paxlovid can decrease their risk of hospitalization and death. Younger individuals at higher risk for severe disease may also take Paxlovid. Monoclonal antibodies are available to treat people who may not be eligible for Paxlovid or other treatments. The monoclonal antibody, Evusheld, can be given to those who are immunosuppressed before they get infected. This is an injection that is given every six months. For the antiviral treatment for influenza, call your health care provider within a day or two of getting flu symptoms. Getting the antiviral treatment may shorten the illness duration and can make a big difference. Related links What you need to know about bronchiolitis, a complication of RSV Can adults get RSV?

Kristy Brittain, a pharmacist at MUSC Health who gives flu shots, knows exactly why they’re so important. This year’s flu season hit early — and hit home for her family. Brittain’s children came down with the flu before they had a chance to get vaccinated. “They had a variety of fevers and there was a lot of vomiting,” she said. As you can see on the graph below, they have plenty of company. The flu has roared back with a vengeance after two years of low case numbers during the pandemic. Graph by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The top type of flu being reported in South Carolina is influenza A. It has infected more than 8,600 people statewide so far this flu season. Influenza B has hit more than 220 people, and a handful of people have been infected with two types of flu at the same time. Brittain said at this point, it looks like this year’s vaccines are a good match for the flu strains that are circulating. But they only work if people get them. “I think there are some patients who wait to get vaccinated until later in November or early December because they are thinking, ‘Oh well, most of our spikes end up happening in the colder months when people are inside in close proximity.’ But that's not really happening right now. Getting vaccinated as soon as possible is key.” Brittain, an associate professor in the College of Pharmacy at the Medical University of South Carolina, said the vaccine will not give you the virus. “It's an inactivated vaccine and uses a dead virus. So there's not a possibility that it will give somebody the flu.” Instead, it will give them protection, causing the body to make antibodies about two weeks after vaccination. And Brittain recommended that even people who have had the flu — like her own kids — get vaccinated. “You could have been exposed to influenza A and we could later see influenza B circulating and you could get sick again.” Dr. Kristy Brittain She said MUSC Health is trying to vaccinate as many people as possible. “Our outpatient pharmacies are helping to meet the need. We’re doing this through our vaccine clinics for both patients and employees. We are also working with community groups and employers to offer flu vaccination.” MUSC Health is also working with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and other health systems to spread the word about flu prevention. Recommendations include washing your hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes, wearing a mask if you’re at higher risk of getting seriously sick and staying home and away from others if you’re ill. The flu spike follows a surge of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, cases in children’s hospitals. RSV hits babies especially hard in part because their immune systems are so new. Children under the age of 5 are also at risk of serious flu-related complications, according to the CDC. The good news is that the RSV surge has eased in recent weeks. But the flu stepped right in to take its place in both children and adults. Brittain said people also need to be aware of the fact that while there are plenty of flu vaccines, flu antivirals are in shorter supply. “As we're seeing higher rates of influenza we are trying to acquire antivirals for patients. Tamiflu would be an example that somebody would use either to treat a flu case, or in some instances, you'll have patients that would use those as a preventative if someone in their household has the flu.” Brittain said plenty of households are already dealing with the virus. “I think it's going to be a very active influenza season, based on what we're seeing currently. It's hard to say how long this will continue.” Related News Pharmacy Week If your only experience with pharmacists is at your local drugstore, get ready to be surprised by how much more there is to the pharmaceutical field.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News Can You Get Two Flu Shots in the Same Season? By Amy Isler, RN, MSN, CSN Published on November 04, 2022 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print LUHUANFENG/Getty Close Key Takeaways Most people only need one annual influenza vaccine to be protected for the entire season.Flu shots don’t really have boosters like other vaccines do, but there are some cases where a person might need a second shot in the same flu season. For example, children ages 6 months to 8 years who are getting flu shots for the first time. They will need two doses of flu vaccine that are spaced four weeks apart.Experts are predicting a more severe cold and flu season this year, which is why getting your flu shot as soon as possible is important. With a longer and more severe cold and flu season expected this year, many are wondering if one dose of the influenza vaccine will be enough to ward off severe illness and dangerous respiratory complications. With a lot of talk about extra vaccine doses and booster shots for COVID-19, you might wonder if getting two flu shots would offer more protection—or if it’s even possible to get more than one flu shot in the same season. Just one flu shot a year is recommended (and enough) for most people, but there are exceptions—for example, kids who are getting a flu shot for the first time. Roshni Mathew, MD, co-medical director of Infection Prevention & Control and pediatric infectious diseases physician at Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, told Verywell that children ages 6 months to 8 years old who “have not previously received a total of two or more doses in their lives need two doses, separated at least by four weeks.” According to Mathew, “everyone else only needs to get a single influenza vaccine for the season.” Can the Flu Shot Give You the Flu? How Well Does One Flu Shot Work? Each February, the United States works with the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine the formulation of the flu vaccine for the upcoming influenza season. The goal is to closely match the same viruses that are currently circulating and causing illness. All U.S. flu vaccines protect against type A and B viruses. This includes a flu A(H1) virus, a flu A(H3) virus, a flu B/Yamagata lineage virus, and a flu B/Victoria lineage virus. Flu vaccine components are determined based on current international data, including: Which flu viruses are currently making people sick How much the viruses are spreading The effectiveness of the previous season’s vaccines against the virus The ability of the vaccine to provide cross-protection against multiple flu virus types How Well Do Flu Shots Work? In some years, flu shots will work pretty well. In others, not so much. A flu vaccine’s effectiveness is affected by a number of factors, including: The age and health of the person getting vaccinated Which strain of flu virus is going around—e.g., the vaccines tend to offer the most protection against influenza B and influenza A (H1N1) viruses and less against influenza A (H3N2) viruses Would Two Flu Shots Ever Be Recommended for Adults? While kids benefit from two flu shots, there is not enough evidence to show that it would be helpful for any other groups to get a second dose. Some studies in adults with compromised immune systems (like organ transplant recipients) have looked at whether getting a second flu shot might be helpful, but more research is needed before the recommendation would be changed. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that for adults, “studies have not shown a benefit from getting more than one dose of vaccine during the same influenza season, even among elderly persons with weakened immune systems.” What If I Get Two Flu Shots By Mistake? If you accidentally get two flu vaccines by mistake, don’t panic. Getting a double dose is not dangerous, but it’s also not going to be more helpful than getting one. How Long Does Flu Shot Protection Last? A flu shot that works well is key to combating a severe flu season, but the length of immunity provided by each annual dose is another key aspect. According to experts, flu vaccine immunity wanes over time but typically provides protection for five to six months. However, this timeframe depends on different factors like a person’s age and the strain of flu virus that’s going around. Buddy Creech, MD We know that vaccine effectiveness wanes through the season, with some estimating an approximate 5% loss each month following vaccination. — Buddy Creech, MD When to Get a Flu Shot for the 2022-2023 Season “The length of the influenza season is, indeed, relevant to our strategy for vaccination,” Buddy Creech, MD, MPH, a professor and chair in the Department of Pediatrics at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program, told Verywell. “We know that vaccine effectiveness wanes through the season, with some estimating an approximate 5% loss each month following vaccination.” That said, Creech added that these numbers are challenging to come by. “[I] think it’s fair to say that the longer we go after vaccination, the less immunity we have.” Reasons You Might Want to Get a Flu Shot Early Some people may want to get their yearly flu shot a little sooner. For example: Travelers who missed vaccination in the previous winter or fall Children younger than age 9 who needed two doses of the flu vaccine but did not get their second dose early in the season People who may not be able to get vaccinated later in the season People in the third trimester of pregnancy Why Flu Shots Don't Always Work Well Despite waning immunity over time, the CDC still says that one flu shot is enough to get the general population through an entire flu season. “This is part of the reason CDC suggested that older individuals get vaccinated in October rather than being first in line to get them in July or August,” said Creech. “We do not fully know the characteristics of waning immunity in children, but it is clear that vaccinating in the fall protects children through the influenza season, even when it extends into the very late spring.” Experts suggest people get their annual flu shot in September or at least by the end of October. The flu vaccine is offered as long as the flu virus is circulating in the community, but the U.S. flu season tends to peak in January and then taper down in the spring. Who Should Not Get Flu Shots? Which Flu Shot Should You Get? The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months get their flu shot. The flu vaccines for the season are available at providers’ offices, pharmacies, and even grocery stores. If you’re over the age of 65, the CDC recommends that you get one of the three high-dose vaccines: Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccineFluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine While you most likely only need to get one flu shot per flu season, timing matters. Remember that it takes about two weeks after you get vaccinated for immunity to kick in. What This Means For You Annual influenza vaccines are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. The only group that needs more than one flu shot per season (two doses spaced four weeks apart) is kids between the ages of 6 months and 8 years old who haven’t gotten a flu shot before.People over the age of 65 should get one of three high-dose flu vaccines available to ensure they get the best protection. Getting your flu shot in the months of September and October helps make sure you have protection through peak flu season into the spring.

Cold, flu, or COVID-19: Which one is it? November 2, 2022 | Healthy You | Wellness Coughing? Fever? Chills? How can you tell if you have a cold, influenza, or COVID-19? Here's how they compare. Not just colds, the flu and COVID-19 PeaceHealth providers are seeing a lot more patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Learn more about RSV symptoms and treatment. How can you tell if you have a cold, influenza, or COVID-19? Understanding the differences in symptoms that these illnesses cause will help. Common colds, influenza (flu), and COVID-19 are contagious respiratory illnesses caused by different viruses. Many symptoms of the three are similar, which can cause confusion about which one you may be suffering from. Contact your primary care provider to determine what care you may need, including testing to determine which, if any, virus you have. How the three illnesses compare COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness. COVID-19 can have varying degrees of symptoms, from none to severe. Symptoms may include fever or chills, cough, sore throat, and the loss of taste or smell. COVID-19 can cause medical complications, especially in higher-risk groups, and can result in hospitalization and death. Severe illness, such as lung injury, is more frequent with COVID-19 than with influenza. The mortality rate also is higher with COVID-19 than with the flu. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that can cause mild to severe symptoms such as fever, cough, and body aches. A bad headache and fatigue—which can linger for weeks after your initial illness has passed—are hallmarks of the flu. Most people with the flu don't need medical care or medication. However, the flu can be very serious and require medical attention. Contact your doctor if your symptoms worsen, are prolonged, or if you're at high risk of flu-related complications. You may feel pretty crummy with a common cold, but the symptoms are mild compared to viruses like the flu and COVID-19. Cold symptoms typically progress over seven to 10 days in this order: Sore throat, congestion, cough. Sniffling and sneezing are classic cold symptoms, and it's more common to experience a stuffy or runny nose with a cold than the flu. Rest and many over-the-counter medications can help relieve symptoms. Symptoms are increasingly similar The latest update from the Zoe Health Study, a COVID-19 symptom tracker devised by researchers at Harvard, Stanford and King's College in London, shows that COVID-19 symptoms are looking more and more like those of the flu, colds and even allergies, especially among the vaccinated. Doctors noticed that as the omicron variant became predominant, patients experienced more upper respiratory symptoms than earlier variants. Because initial symptoms are now "influenza-like," you may need to see a doctor for testing to determine which virus you have. The new ranking of symptoms for people who have received at least two doses of vaccine is: Sore throat Runny nose Blocked nose Persistent cough Headache Reports of sneezing as a COVID-19 symptom emerged from people who'd had at least one dose of the vaccine. But sneezing was not widely reported by those who have remained unvaccinated; instead, they reported more often experiencing fever. The new ranking for the unvaccinated is: Headache Sore throat Runny nose Fever Persistent cough It typically takes longer for someone to experience symptoms of COVID-19 than if they have the flu. COVID-19 symptoms generally appear two to five days after infection but could be as long as 14 days later. In contrast, flu symptoms usually appear about one to four days after infection. It's possible to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or the flu without experiencing symptoms. Common cold symptoms usually appear one to three days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Differences in COVID-19 and influenza symptoms So far, research indicates that a change in or the loss of taste and smell may be the only significant difference in symptoms between COVID-19 and the flu. Some people with the flu may also experience a loss of taste or smell, but it is less frequent. Because of this, you may need to see a doctor for testing to determine which virus you have. There are a few other notable similarities and differences between influenza and COVID-19. How the viruses spread: Similarities: COVID-19 and the flu can spread from person-to-person when they're within about 6 feet. Both are spread mainly by respiratory droplets when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. People may spread both before they begin showing symptoms, by people with very mild symptoms, and by people who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic). Differences: Although they spread similarly, COVID-19 is generally more contagious and appears to spread more quickly and easily than the flu. COVID-19 can spread to others by people before they begin showing symptoms, by people with very mild symptoms, and by people who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic). People at higher risk for severe illness: Similarities: Both viruses can cause severe illness in older adults, people with certain underlying medical conditions, and pregnant people. Differences: Overall, COVID-19 seems to cause more severe illness in people. Some groups of people are at a higher risk for COVID-19 than others. Complications: Similarities: Both COVID-19 and the flu can cause these complications: Pneumonia Respiratory failure Acute respiratory distress syndrome (fluid in the lungs) Sepsis (a life-threatening illness caused by the body's extreme response to an infection) Cardiac injury (heart attacks and stroke) Multiple-organ failure (respiratory failure, kidney failure, shock) Worsening of chronic conditions (involving the lungs, heart, or nervous system or diabetes) Inflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle tissues Secondary bacterial infections (infections in people who have already had the flu or COVID-19) Differences: COVID-19 can also cause blood clots in the lungs, heart, legs or brain and cause Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A). Anyone who has had COVID-19, even if their illness was mild or had no symptoms, can experience post-COVID conditions, also known as Long COVID. Post-COVID conditions are a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection. Many people with the flu or mild symptoms of COVID-19 can recover at home with rest and fluids. But some people become seriously ill from the flu or COVID-19 and must stay in the hospital. Prevention Stay up-to-date on your COVID-19 vaccinations and get an annual flu vaccine. Following several standard precautions can reduce your risk of infection from the viruses that cause COVID-19, colds, and the flu. Avoiding close contact (within 6 feet) with people who are sick. Self-quarantining when symptomatic. Wearing a face mask in indoor public spaces and outdoors, such as at a crowded event or large gathering. Avoiding crowded indoor spaces. Covering your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces and objects. Treatments There's no cure for the common cold. Treatment may include pain relievers and over-the-counter cold remedies, such as decongestants. Most people recover from a common cold in three to 10 days, although some colds may last as long as two or three weeks. Like the cold, there are many over-the-counter remedies available. Getting an annual flu vaccine will reduce the severity of the flu and the risk of serious complications if you get sick. The vaccine is recommended for everyone six months or older and can be given as a shot or a nasal spray. In more severe cases, several antiviral drugs may be prescribed by a physician. Treatments can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. Unlike the common cold and the flu, there are only a few approved medications to treat COVID-19. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illnesses and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better. Like the flu vaccine, staying up-to-date on your COVID-19 vaccination can also reduce the severity of COVID-19 and the risk of serious complications. The FDA has authorized certain antiviral medications to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very sick. Paxlovid and Molnuoiravir are oral medications that need to be started within five days of when symptoms start. If you have symptoms of the flu or COVID-19, contact your primary care provider to determine what care you may need, including testing to determine which, if any, virus you have. COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available at many community locations, including drug stores and pharmacies. Visit vaccines.gov to find a location near you.

Back to News No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs Share No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs November 3, 2022 No special precautions needed for flu shots for people allergic to eggs November 3, 2022 No greater risk of reaction than for those without an allergy ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. – For many years, people with an egg allergy were told to avoid or take special precautions when getting a flu shot because most influenza vaccines are grown in eggs and contain a tiny amount of egg protein. A practice parameter from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters stresses that people with egg allergy should receive their yearly flu shot, and that no special precautions are required. Health care providers often ask those getting flu shots if they are allergic to eggs. Health care providers and people with egg allergy should know there is no need to ask this question anymore, and no need to take any special precautions. Overwhelming evidence has shown that a flu shot poses no greater risk to those with egg allergy than those without. There have been dozens of studies involving thousands of patients with egg allergy who have received a flu shot without allergic reactions – including hundreds with life-threatening egg allergy. This is because the influenza vaccine does not contain enough egg protein to cause an allergic reaction, even in patients with severe egg allergy. The practice parameter stresses that no special precautions are needed or recommended for those with egg allergy. There is no longer a need to: see an allergy specialist for the flu shot; give special flu shots that don’t contain traces of egg; require longer-than-normal observation periods after the shot; or even ask about egg allergy before giving the vaccine. If the vaccine is age-appropriate, it can be used for anyone with or without egg allergy. These recommendations from the allergy community are consistent with those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, all emphasizing the safety and importance of egg-allergic patients receiving their annual influenza vaccine. There are hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States every year because of the flu, most of which could be prevented with a flu shot. Egg allergy primarily affects young children, who are also particularly vulnerable to the flu. It’s very important that everyone, including children with egg allergy, is encouraged to get a flu shot. One of the main concerns with any vaccine is a severe allergic reaction – known as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can happen with any vaccine at a rate of about one per million, no matter the type or whether the person has an allergy. That is why it is always recommended that all personnel and facilities providing vaccines have procedures in place for responding to this rare event.

We sought to investigate metabolic factors/predictors of influenza vaccine immune response in an older adult (age ≥65 years) cohort in Singapore, where influenza typically circulates year-round. The primary outcome for the DYNAMIC prospective cohort study was haemagglutination-inhibition titer (HAI) response to each of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine strains at day 28 (D28) compared to baseline (D0), as assessed by seroconversion and D28/D0 log2 HAI fold rise. Baseline blood samples were tested for total Vitamin D (25-(OH) D) levels. We enrolled 234 participants in June–Dec 2017. Two hundred twenty completed all study visits. The median age was 71 [IQR 68–75] years, 67 (30.5%) had diabetes mellitus (DM), and the median BMI was 24.9 [IQR 22.2–27.8] kg/m2. Median baseline totals 25-(OH) D was 29 [IQR: 21–29] ng/ml. Age, DM, obesity, and baseline 25-(OH) D were not associated with HAI fold rise in multivariable analysis. More recent prior influenza vaccination and higher baseline HAI titers were associated with lower HAI fold rise for influenza A/HK/H3N2. Physical activity was associated with a higher HAI fold rise for influenza A/HK/H3N2 in a dose-response relationship (p-test for trend = 0.015). Older adults with well-controlled metabolic co-morbidities retain HAI response to the influenza vaccine, and physical activity had a beneficial effect on immune response, particularly for influenza A/HK/H3N2.

Singapore, a tropical city-state with 5.7 million people, normally experiences year-round influenza circulation, with peaks coinciding with northern and southern hemisphere winters accounting for disproportionate deaths in persons older than 75 years3.While there are ongoing efforts for an effective, durable, ‘universal’ influenza vaccine, the reduced effectiveness of standard-dose seasonal influenza protein subunit vaccines with haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens in older adults is well-recognized. Goodwin et al. estimated an adjusted odds-ratio of protective vaccine response in older versus young adults ranged from 0.24 to 0.59, defined by seroconversion and seroprotection as measured by haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titers4. This reduced effectiveness is partly due to age-related immune dysfunction, characterized by various changes in the innate and adaptive immune system, notably a reduced naïve T-cell pool, B-cell numbers, and inflamm-aging5,6.Compounding these biological factors is the rising burden of metabolic co-morbidities in high- and low-middle-income countries (LMICs)7,8. Several studies in Asian populations have shown higher cardiometabolic risk and a higher body-fat proportion at lower BMI (body-mass index), thereby a World Health Organisation expert panel supported Asian countries implementing public health measures at lower BMI (BMI ≥ 23.0 kg/m2 for overweight/increased risk and BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 for obesity/high risk) and incorporating waist circumference (central obesity) as an additional measure. The waist-circumference cutoffs used in Asian populations are also correspondingly lower (90 cm for men and 80 cm for women)9,10.Both type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are associated with a higher risk of influenza-related hospitalization11. Importantly, these metabolic co-morbidities may contribute to inflamm-aging and the suboptimal response to vaccines12. The reported effects of DM on humoral (HAI) immune response to influenza vaccination are variable13,14,15,16. Among these studies, worsening glycemic control, increasing obesity (higher waist circumference), and lipids levels were associated with poorer HAI response14,16,17,18,19. However, there is a paucity of data on these measures from tropical and Asian countries despite high rates and rapidly rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity.Vitamin D has complex immunomodulatory effects, specifically a robust action on the innate immune response, effects on cellular immunity with a bias towards a Th2 phenotype, and enhanced autoregulatory function of T-reg cells20. Although the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed widely in many human tissues and immune cells20,21, the exact threshold of systemic 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D) for its immune actions is unknown22. Animal studies have shown superior antigen-specific immune response for 1,25-(OH)2 D3-co-administered vaccines23,24,25. Prior human studies evaluating Vitamin D in the immune response to influenza vaccine had mixed results and were limited to selected populations20,26.Our study aimed to evaluate the metabolic predictors and factors associated with influenza vaccine-specific adaptive immune response in older adults aged 65 and older living in the community in Singapore, as measured by HAI responses at day 28 post-trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) compared to baseline in a prospective cohort study. The factors of interest were baseline (day 0) 25-(OH) D levels, metabolic co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and physical activity. We hypothesized that older persons with metabolic co-morbidities, obesity, or lower baseline 25-(OH) D levels would have a poorer immune response to the influenza vaccine.ResultsStudy participant characteristicsFour hundred and thirty-five participants were screened, and 234 were enrolled following written informed consent. Fourteen participants (6.0%) withdrew from the study before study completion (Fig. 1). Two hundred and twenty participants (94.0%) completed all study visits and composed the full analysis set. There were no significant baseline differences between the included and excluded participants. The median age for included 220 participants was 71 (IQR 68–75 and range 65–89) years, 64 (29.1%) were males, and 196 (89.1%) had at least one chronic condition. Specifically, 67 (30.5%) had diabetes mellitus, and 150 (68.2%) had hyperlipidemia. The median BMI was 24.9 [IQR 22.2–27.8] kg/m2 with a range of 15.2–49.9 kg/m2. The classifications of BMI in categories of normal, overweight, and obesity is based on cardiometabolic risk. Based on the WHO recommendation for the classification of obesity in Asian populations, 91 (41.4%) were overweight (BMI 23.0–27.4), and 62 (28.2%) were obese (BMI ≥ 27.5). The various ethnic groups in Singapore were represented in our enrolled population. Ninety-seven participants (44.1%) had received IIV3 in the 5 years before study enrollment.Fig. 1Study participant flow diagram for the DYNAMIC cohort study showing the enrollment, follow-up and analysis phases.Full size imageGeometric mean titers, seroprotection, and seroconversionThe geometric mean titers for each vaccine strain at baseline and post-vaccination for the full cohort and comparing those with and without diabetes mellitus and obesity are shown in Fig. 2. 214 (97.3%) participants were seroprotected to at least one strain at baseline compared to 219 (99.5%) at D28 (titer of ≥1:40); specifically 126 (57.3%) at baseline for A/HK/H3N2 and 205 (93.2%) at D28, 22 (10.0%) at baseline for A/MI/H1N1 and 133 (60.5%) at D28, 206 (93.6%) at baseline for influenza B and 218 (99.1%) at D28. High baseline titers and seroprotection could result from prior influenza vaccination or natural infection. The lower baseline seroprotection for A/MI/H1N1 in comparison to influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B is expected as the circulating strain in the immediate previous season had been A/H1N1/California/7/2009, which had been included in the previous season’s vaccines (Supplementary Information). Due to high baseline seroprotection rates for two of the three strains, the D28 seroprotection rate is less meaningful as an outcome, hence we focused on seroconversion at D28 and D28/baseline log2 HAI fold rise for our analyses.Fig. 2: Geometric mean titers (GMT) pre-and post-influenza vaccine among full cohort for influenza A/HK/H3N2, A/MI/H1N1, and B-split, and among those with and without diabetes mellitus and obesity.Panels a shows line graphs depicting GMT and 95% confidence intervals pre- and post-influenza vaccination for A/HK/H3N2, A/MI/H1N1 and B-split for the full cohort, subcategorized by their baseline seroprotection status (HAI of at least 1:40) for each respective strain. Panels b shows GMT and 95% confidence intervals pre- and post-influenza vaccination for the three strains amongst those with diabetes mellitus (n = 67) compared to those without. Panels c show GMT and 95% confidence intervals pre-and post-influenza vaccination for the three strains amongst those with obesity (n = 163, applying the same definition as in Tables 1 and 2) compared to those without. The embedded table displays the GMT and 95% CI data as shown in the corresponding panel line graphs.Full size imageOne hundred sixty-nine (76.8%) seroconverted to at least one of the three strains contained in the vaccine, with 124 (56.4%) seroconverting to influenza A/HK/H3N2, 110 (50.0%) to A/MI/H1N1, and 34 (15.5%) to influenza B. Table 1 shows the clinical and demographic variables amongst participants who seroconverted to each strain and those who did not. Among those who seroconverted to at least one strain, a lower proportion had received a more recent influenza vaccine (SH 2016 or NH 2016–2017 vaccine) as compared to those who did not seroconvert (26.0% vs 60.8%). Those who seroconverted to at least one strain had a lower pre-vaccine titer as compared to those who did not. This was most pronounced for influenza A/HK/H3N2, where the 2017 study vaccine had similar antigen composition compared to the immediate previous season’s vaccine (Supplementary Information). Women and younger participants were more likely to seroconvert to at least one strain.Table 1 Socio-demographic, medical and influenza vaccination history, physical activity, and baseline titers, by seroconversion status to each of the vaccine strains.Full size tableMultivariable analyses for HAI fold riseIn the multivariable analyses, increasing age, gender, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with HAI fold rise at D28. Similarly, anthropometric markers of obesity, co-morbidities, and baseline 25-(OH) D were also not found to be significantly associated with HAI fold rise (Table 2). We used a composite variable for obesity in our regression model, combining waist circumference, waist-hip circumference ratio, and obese BMI to avoid multicollinearity while enhancing sensitivity. While the threshold for 25-(OH) D’s immune actions is not defined, we observed a reasonably wide range of levels in our participants (10–42 ng/ml). Physical activity was significantly associated with a notable increase in HAI fold rise for influenza A/HK/H3N2 in a dose-response relationship generally, where there is an overall tendency for participants reporting a higher level of physical activity to have a higher increase in HAI fold rise for influenza A/HK/H3N2 (p for trend = 0.015). Participants reporting light physical activity levels had 2.04 times [95% CI 1.06–3.91] higher A/HK/H3N2 fold rise as compared to those who reported being rarely involved in physical activity. The lack of dose-response relationship seen among patients with vigorous physical activity could be due to the small sample size in this group (n = 14). Participants with more recent prior influenza vaccine had significantly lower HAI fold rise for influenza A/HK/H3N2 as compared to those with no prior influenza vaccination in past 5 years (p < 0.001).Table 2 Multivariable regression analyses of factors associated with A/HK/H3N2, A/MI/H1N1, and B HAI fold rise at D28 compared to D0.Full size tableIn the models which included interaction terms between prior influenza vaccine type received and baseline HAI titer for fold rise in A/HK/H3N2, A/MI/H1N1, and B-Split, there is no statistically significant interaction found on the respective fold rise among prior influenza vaccination groups with different baseline HAI titers (Supplementary table 1).DiscussionOur findings in this cohort of 220 older adults with well-controlled chronic conditions living in the community showed that 169 (76.8%) seroconverted to at least one of the influenza vaccine strains contained in the vaccine. Age, diabetes mellitus, baseline 25-(OH) D, markers of obesity, were not significantly associated with HAI response based on seroconversion and HAI fold rise. Physical activity was associated with a higher A/HK/HAI fold rise in a general dose-response relationship. Our finding of prior seasonal influenza vaccination and high pre-vaccination titer associated with lower seroconversion/HAI fold rise (particularly if the prior season’s vaccine contained a congruent strain with the current season’s vaccine) is consistent with findings from other studies examining cohorts with prior and repeated influenza vaccination, particularly for A/H3N227,28,29. Several authors have postulated this may be linked to the ‘antigenic distance’ hypothesis27. A more recent influenza vaccination (while accounting for waning) may also be associated with a higher baseline titer (57.3% of our cohort were seroprotected to A/H3N2 at baseline), although prior natural infection may also account for higher baseline titers. The immune response to the current vaccine might also differ if the prior vaccine received had congruent strains with the current vaccine. We, therefore, investigated this in the interaction terms between the prior influenza vaccine received and baseline titer but did not find any significant modifying effects on HAI response. As a comparison, Snape et al enrolled 75 COPD and 72 age-matched healthy older adults (range 50–90 years) in Brisbane and Melbourne, Australia, and assessed influenza vaccine immunogenicity via HAI seroconversion at Day 28 as the primary end-point29. Importantly, approximately 90% of this cohort had received recent influenza vaccination in the preceding two years. The authors found that the year of vaccine, vaccine strain, and study site were independently associated with seroconversion at Day 28 in multiple logistic regression. Age and BMI (median BMI 26.7 kg/m2, range 18.2–52.9) were not associated with seroconversion, generally similar to our study findings, and notably, the age range of participants was wider while the BMI range was comparable. The authors postulated site environmental variables and vitamin D status may have contributed, given the different latitudes/climates, but this needs to be studied further. In further analyses, the authors concluded the variation observed from the year of vaccination was attributable to the vaccine strain (higher seroconversion with novel strains) and higher baseline antibody levels negatively correlated with the amplitude of fold increase in post-vaccination antibody, similar to our findings.Importantly, while studies have shown some impact of diabetes mellitus and obesity on influenza vaccine immune response, our study and others have shown that well-controlled co-morbidities may not have any significant effect on HAI response13,14,29,30. However, HAI titers have limitations concerning translation to protection from infection in older adults. While pre- and post-vaccination HAI titers are commonly used and accepted in immunogenicity studies, HAI titers do not fully explain protection from infection. Furthermore, HAI 1:40 represents 50% protection from infection based on studies performed in younger adults31. While there is no accepted correlate of protection, other wider immune responses, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immunity, are important considerations.Our finding of the beneficial association of physical activity on HAI response has also been shown by other investigators32,33,34. Importantly, physical activity retains benefits even after adjusting for BMI and co-morbidities, and we observed relative benefit even for modest physical activity. Wong et al. showed improved B cell and plasmablast expansion after vaccination in active compared to sedentary women33. The type of physical activity, and consistency over time likely influence the overall physiological benefits, and the mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. The lack of regular physical activity and obesogenic environments is a great concern and anticipated major risk factors for global mortality35. Promoting physical activity is expected to have wider benefits.Our study did not find any association of vitamin D with HAI response. Multivariable regression of HAI response has shown that there is no correlation in HAI fold-rise with unit increases in baseline 25-(OH) D level in any vaccine strain while controlling for other covariates. In vitro studies suggest vitamin D may modulate B-cell differentiation but does not stimulate plasma cells or memory B cells, and the lack of association of 25-(OH) D on humoral responses to influenza vaccine has been observed in other studies18,24. Nevertheless, the role of Vitamin D in vaccine response may still be relevant through other pathways, such as cell-mediated immunity18. In addition, a recent concept of the “personal vitamin D response index” related to molecular and epigenetic variations in the vitamin-D-signaling pathway may explain variable vitamin-D-responsiveness or ‘sufficiency thresholds’ for individuals and population groups36. This may potentially explain the conflicting results of vitamin D observational and supplementation studies. The “vitamin D-response index” could be studied in greater depth in conjunction with systemic Vitamin D levels or targeted supplementation once this is better defined.Our study has notable strengths. We enrolled a community older adult cohort with well-represented Asian ethnic groups from Singapore with a representative proportion of participants with metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and elevated BMI comparable with national rates37,38. Due to the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity in Asian countries (both high-income and LMIC), our study contributes to the urgent need for well-designed studies in Asian populations to better understand the impact of metabolic co-morbidities on the immune response to vaccination (and infection) that will inform public health action. Vitamin D deficiency (based on bone health) is not uncommon in tropical countries. While there is no accepted minimum systemic Vitamin D level for its non-skeletal and immunomodulatory actions, it is important to study this in local populations. Our high study retention and completion help to minimize bias from loss-to-follow-up. HAI assays were performed at the WHO collaborating laboratory with standard protocols.There are a few limitations that we need to acknowledge. Firstly, HAI response alone does not provide the full spectrum of the immune response. We are investigating cell-mediated immunity assays separately. Secondly, while other studies have found some impact of obesity and high BMI on influenza vaccine immune response, we were not able to replicate these findings. Whether this is due to study and population heterogeneity, or other population-level biological differences is unclear. We used more than one measure of obesity, i.e., BMI, waist, and hip circumference. Our findings may not apply to populations with a higher proportion of overweight or obese older adults. Further study with adipokines, examining for leptin or insulin resistance, and studies in populations with greater prevalence of obesity/severe obesity may be informative. Thirdly, we may be underpowered for certain analyses, for example, the analyses with interaction terms. Fourthly, while our study enrolled a multi-ethnic older adult Asian cohort, our findings would not be generalizable to a very frail population or to those with poorly controlled metabolic syndrome. Lastly, while we have interesting findings related to physical activity and HAI response, the data on physical activity was obtained via interviewer-administered questionnaires, although the RAPA questionnaire used has been validated in other settings in older adults39. We did not have directly observed data by active reporting or pedometers, and our data may be subject to recall and social desirability bias. However, the observed effects are likely to be real albeit attenuated, as the measurement error is likely to be non-differential and biased toward the null. Conversely, while intervention studies are viewed as a superior study design, there are pragmatic disadvantages to extrapolating prescribed scenarios in trial settings regarding physical activity habits to the population scale. Nonetheless, the congruence of our findings with other studies and the observed dose-response relationship provides more credibility.In conclusion, our study found that older adults with well-controlled metabolic co-morbidities do retain HAI response to influenza vaccine, and physical activity had a beneficial effect on HAI fold rise, particularly for influenza A/H3N2. We recommend the encouragement of influenza vaccine uptake among older adults. Ideally, a novel influenza vaccine with more durable protection is desirable, either using mRNA technology or other platforms targeting more conserved regions of the influenza virus. Meanwhile, a personalized influenza vaccination approach has been suggested with the assessment of pre-vaccination antibody levels29, but the latter would be difficult to implement at the population scale without an assay widely available in clinical laboratories and a well-established correlate of protection. Physical activity is a potential modifiable beneficial low-cost lifestyle intervention for vaccine HAI response, along with other wider health benefits. Finally, we recommend older adults with metabolic conditions be specifically studied, including evaluating dynamic host factors that could optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness in this population.MethodsStudy designThis prospective cohort study comprised three study visits shown in Fig. 3. Each enrolled participant had up to 23 milliliters (ml) of venous blood collected at two time-points, baseline and at D28 (±3 days) following intramuscular influenza vaccination. During the first study visit, participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire by trained interviewers with data collected on demographic information, medical history, vaccination history, and health and physical activity habits (Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity—RAPA questionnaire)40.Fig. 3: Outline of study visits, the DYNAMIC cohort study.¶ anthropometric measurements comprised weight (kg), height (m), waist, and hip circumferences (cm). BMI (kg/m2), and waist: hip circumference ratios were calculated.Full size imageEthical approvalThe study was approved by the National Healthcare Group Institutional Review Board (DSRB 2016/00248). At the time of the study’s enrollment, all human subject studies with an intervention (such as the influenza vaccine for this study) were regulated by Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (this study’s Clinical Trial Notification CTN1700053 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03399357).Participants and recruitmentAdults aged 65 and older residing in the community in Singapore were prospectively enrolled after written informed consent at community sites and our institution’s research clinic from June to December 2017.

The community sites comprised a few sites that were part of the National Healthcare Group’s mid-year influenza vaccination program outreach for older adults, and other sites engaged in community initiatives for older adults (Supplementary Information).Eligible older adults included those with well-controlled chronic conditions if they had not been hospitalized in the preceding 12 months. They should also have received their most recent annual seasonal influenza vaccine no more recently than 10 months prior. Immunocompromised adults were excluded.

The northern hemisphere IIV3 2017–18 composition was identical to the composition of the 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine42. Trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were the standard clinically available vaccines in Singapore at the time of this study’s enrollment. The vaccine was maintained in a cold chain between +2 and +8 °C as recommended by the manufacturer before administration to participants via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle by a trained research nurse. Temperature monitoring was performed for vaccines administered at all study sites.Laboratory methodsBlood samples were stored at +2 to +8 °C following collection and delivered to a central laboratory at Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) for processing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum were stored at −80 °C and only thawed at the time of assays. Assays on PBMCs assessing markers of cell-mediated immunity will be reported separately.25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH) D) assay25-Hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were measured on baseline sera for participants who completed all study visits at the Mayo Clinic Immunochemical Core Laboratory by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Franklin, Massachusetts 02038 and Applied Biosystems-MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA 94404). Intra-assay C.V.’s for 25-(OH) D2 were 4.4%, 3.3%, and 4.2% at 14, 41, and 124 ng/mL, respectively. Interassay C.V.’s were 6.1%, 6.2%, and 4.7% at 15, 43, and 128 ng/mL, respectively. Intra-assay C.V.’s for 25-(OH) D3 were 3.8%, 2.4%, and 4.7% at 25, 54, and 140 ng/mL, respectively. Interassay C.V.’s were 6.4%, 6.8%, and 5.0% at 24, 52, and 140 ng/mL respectively. As 25-(OH) D2 were universally low, the total 25-(OH) D was used for analyses.Haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assaysHAI assays were performed on the baseline and D28 sera at the WHO Influenza Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Australia, using standard protocols with egg-grown influenza viruses contained in trivalent influenza inactivated vaccine the subjects had received, namely A/Hongkong/4801/2014-H3N2 like virus, A/Singapore/GP1908/2015-H1N1 (antigenically identical to the A/Michigan/45/2015-H1N1 contained in the vaccine) and B/Brisbane/60/200843. The data used for the analyses for B/Brisbane/60/2008 were from assays performed with the ether-split virus. Turkey red blood cells were used for all assays. Additional dilutions were performed as needed for high HAI titers.Statistical analysisWe estimated the sample size based on the study objective for 25-(OH) D status on HAI response. In our null hypothesis, the proportion of vitamin-D-deficient and non-deficient subjects with HAI seroconversion would be the same. We obtained a conservative estimate of 30% to be vitamin D deficient for our study population based on existing literature, including studies investigating Vitamin D status/deficiency in Singapore20,26,44,45,46, and assumed 20% of vitamin-D-deficient patients and 40% of non-deficient patients will seroconvert to any of the influenza vaccine strains. To detect this difference in proportion with a Pearson’s Chi-square test, we set the level of significance at 5% and a power of 0.8 to derive a total sample size of 237 required for the study (Supplementary Table 2).The HAI titers appear in results as A/HK/H3N2 (abbreviated for A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-H3N2 like virus), A/MI/H1N1 (A/Michigan/45/2015-H1N1), and B-split (B/Brisbane/60/2008). We assessed HAI response based on (1) the proportion who seroconverted post-vaccination for each vaccine strain, as defined by at least a 4-fold rise in HAI titer at D28 compared to baseline with a titer of at least 1:40, and (2) D28/baseline log2 HAI fold rise. We explored the proportion of participants seroprotected (titer of ≥1:40) at D28 compared to baseline, but due to high baseline seroprotection rates for two of the three vaccine strains, the proportion seroprotected at D28 is a less meaningful outcome for our study objectives.Clinically relevant variables were discussed among clinicians and based on a literature review before identifying possible factors of antibody fold rise. These included variables of interest in the aims of this study, such as metabolic co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), chronic pulmonary disease, baseline 25-(OH) D, anthropometric measures of obesity (waist circumference, hip circumference, and body-mass index), demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity), physical activity, baseline HAI titer, and prior influenza vaccine history.Descriptive statistics were performed, and differences in patient characteristics between seroconversion status for each strain’s HAI responses were assessed based on Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate) for categorical variables. Due to the nature of a two-fold serial dilution performed to measure antibody titer, the resulting antibody fold rise can be expressed in the form of an exponential expression. As such, the exponent in the expression for each HAI fold rise was used as outcome measurements by calculating log2 [HAI fold rise] to restrict the range and ensure the normality of data47. Multiple linear regression was then performed on each of these outcome measurements to adjust for potential confounding due to all other included variables. Similarly, the exponent in the exponential expression for each baseline HAI titer was also used as the independent variable. Test of the trend was conducted for the ordinal variables where appropriate, by treating it as a categorical variable represented as ordered integers in the regression model. Modifying effects of prior vaccination with different influenza vaccines on HAI responses were also investigated with regression models, which included interaction terms between the vaccine type and baseline HAI titer. All analyses were performed in R3.6.2, and statistical significance was deemed when a p < 0.05 (two-sided) was achieved48.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Emergency Preparedness and Response Increased Respiratory Virus Activity, Especially Among Children, Early in the 2022-2023 Fall and Winter Print Minus Related Pages Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network November 04, 2022, 3:30 PM ET CDCHAN-00479 Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory about early, elevated respiratory disease incidence caused by multiple viruses occurring especially among children and placing strain on healthcare systems. Co-circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and others could place stress on healthcare systems this fall and winter. This early increase in disease incidence highlights the importance of optimizing respiratory virus prevention and treatment measures, including prompt vaccination and antiviral treatment, as outlined below. Background Many respiratory viruses with similar clinical presentations circulate year-round in the United States and at higher levels in fall and winter. In the past 2 years, respiratory disease activity has been dominated by SARS-CoV-2, and seasonal circulation of other respiratory viruses has been atypical or lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic years. Currently, the U.S. is experiencing a surge and co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2. CDC is tracking levels of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) that are higher than usual for this time of year, especially among children, though RV/EV levels may have plateaued in recent weeks. SARS-CoV-2 also continues to circulate in all U.S. states. RSV CDC surveillance has shown an increase in RSV detections and RSV-associated emergency department visits and hospitalizations in all but two U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions (regions 4 and 6), with some regions already near the seasonal peak levels typically observed in December or January. This year, rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations began to increase during late spring and continued to increase through the summer and into early fall. Preliminary data from October 2022 show that weekly rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations among children younger than 18 years old are higher than rates observed during similar weeks in recent years. While RSV activity appears to be plateauing in some places, the timing, intensity, and severity of the current RSV season are uncertain. Influenza CDC has been tracking early and increasing influenza activity in recent weeks. The highest levels of influenza activity have been found in the southeast and south-central parts of the country. The most common viruses identified to date have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with most infections occurring in children and young adults. Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rates for children (age 0–4 years and 5–17 years) and all ages combined are notably higher compared to the same time periods during previous seasons since 2010–2011. Although the timing, intensity, and severity of the 2022–2023 influenza season are uncertain, CDC anticipates continued high-level circulation of influenza viruses this fall and winter. SARS-CoV-2 CDC data are available to monitor COVID-19 community levels, which are based on hospitalization and case data and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 activity. SARS-CoV-2 activity is expected to increase in the winter as has been observed in previous years. Rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among all age groups including children have decreased since August, but rates in infants younger than 6 months remain higher than in other pediatric age groups and higher than in all adult age groups except those 65 years and older. CDC expects continued high-level circulation of SARS-CoV-2 this fall and winter. Recommendations for Healthcare Providers CDC recommends that healthcare providers offer prompt vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 to all eligible people aged 6 months and older who are not up to date. Vaccination can prevent hospitalization and death associated with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Influenza vaccines have been updated for the current season (1). Of influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have been analyzed in the United States since May 2022, most A(H3N2) viruses are genetically and antigenically closely related to the updated A(H3N2) vaccine component. These data suggest influenza vaccination this season should offer protection against the predominant A(H3N2) viruses to date. Currently approved SARS-CoV-2 bivalent mRNA booster doses for use in patients 5 years of age and older offer protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and the currently predominant Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants that cause COVID-19. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccination provides some protection against multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and against post-COVID-19 conditions, and that vaccination among persons with post–COVID-19 conditions might help reduce their symptoms (2). To prevent RSV-associated hospitalizations, eligible high-risk children should receive palivizumab treatment in accordance with AAP guidelines. In brief, children eligible for palivizumab include infants prematurely born at less than 29 weeks gestation, children younger than 2 years of age with chronic lung disease or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, and children with suppressed immune systems or neuromuscular disorders. While vaccination is the primary means for preventing influenza and COVID-19, antiviral medications are important adjuncts used to treat illness in persons with severe illness and those at increased risk for complications. Both influenza and COVID-19 antiviral medications are most effective in reducing complications when treatment is started as early as possible after symptom onset. Specific Considerations for Healthcare Providers 1. Recommend and offer vaccinations against influenza and COVID-19 for all eligible persons aged 6 months or older Anyone who has not received an influenza vaccine this season or who is not up to date with COVID-19 vaccination should be vaccinated now. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines can be administered at the same visit. Vaccination is the best way to reduce the chance of illness and complications, including those resulting in hospitalization and death, from influenza and COVID-19. For the 2022-2023 influenza season, CDC recommends influenza vaccination with a licensed age-appropriate influenza vaccine for all people months and older (3). For COVID-19, CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older complete a primary series of COVID-19 vaccines (4). In addition, CDC recommends that people 5 years and older receive one updated (bivalent) booster, if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose, whether that was a primary series or original (monovalent) booster (4). This recommendation includes people who have received more than one original (monovalent) booster. To date, uptake of both the current seasonal influenza vaccine and COVID-19 booster vaccines remains suboptimal (5, 6, 7). For COVID-19, preexposure prophylaxis with EVUSHELDTM, a monoclonal antibody, may help prevent COVID-19 in persons 12 years and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised who might not mount an adequate immune response after COVID-19 vaccination, as well as persons for whom COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended because of their personal risk for severe adverse reactions. These guidelines may be updated based on circulation of variants with reduced susceptibility to monoclonal antibodies. 2. Use diagnostic testing to guide treatment and clinical management With multiple co-circulating respiratory viruses, particularly influenza and SARS-CoV-2, for which there are antiviral options recommended for specific groups, diagnostic testing can guide treatment and management to improve patients’ clinical course and outcomes. Diagnostic testing should be considered for patients with suspected respiratory virus infections, particularly among hospitalized patients, those with factors placing persons at high risk for severe outcomes from flu and COVID-19, and those with severe or progressive illness. Molecular assays are recommended when testing for RSV, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory viruses in hospitalized patients with suspected respiratory virus infections, and multiplex respiratory testing should be considered since multiple respiratory viruses may cause severe illness. Information to assist clinicians about when to consider respiratory virus testing is available at Information for Clinicians on Influenza Virus Testing, Respiratory Syncytial Virus for Healthcare Professionals, and COVID-19 Testing: What You Need to Know. Information on RV/EV, EV-D68 testing was described in detail in a HAN Health Advisory released on September 9, 2022. 3. Treat patients with suspected or confirmed influenza who meet clinical criteria with influenza antivirals CDC recommends influenza antiviral treatment as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is: a) hospitalized; b) an outpatient at higher risk for influenza complications; or c) an outpatient with severe, complicated, or progressive illness. Treatment with influenza antivirals has been shown to be safe and have clinical and public health benefit for both children and adults. Evidence from observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials shows influenza antivirals reduce illness and severe outcomes of influenza (8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered as early as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours), although antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for some patients (e.g., outpatients at increased risk for complications and hospitalized patients). Clinicians should not wait for laboratory confirmation to decide when to start influenza antiviral treatment in patients with suspected influenza. Oral oseltamivir (generic formulation or Tamiflu®) is the recommended antiviral for outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and for hospitalized influenza patients. Oral baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute uncomplicated influenza in people 5 years and older who are otherwise healthy or in people 12 years and older who are at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. Oseltamivir is available as both an oral suspension and as capsules, whereas baloxavir is available only as tablets in the United States this fall and winter. Inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir are less commonly used influenza antiviral medications. There is additional information on influenza antiviral medications for clinicians on the CDC website. 4. Treat outpatients and hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at increased risk for severe illness and meet age- and weight-eligibility requirements COVID-19 antiviral agents reduce risk for hospitalization and death when administered soon after diagnosis. The antiviral medications nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) or remdesivir (Veklury) are the preferred treatment options for COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate illness who are at increased risk for severe illness, including older adults, unvaccinated persons, and those with certain medical conditions (14). The antiviral medication molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and monoclonal antibody bebtelovimab are alternative treatment options when Paxlovid and Veklury are contraindicated or not available. Additional information is available about treatment options for hospitalized adults and children and outpatient adults and children. Guidelines may be updated based on information about susceptibility of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. 5. Resources for patient education In addition to practicing everyday prevention methods, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick, staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and hand washing, there are additional considerations for patients to help control the spread of and treat influenza, RSV, and COVID-19. For patients and the general public who would like to know more about RSV, and clinicians who would like to learn about the impact of RSV infections among older adults, see Older Adults are at High Risk for Severe RSV Infection. Materials describing RSV prevention information in English and Spanish are also available. Only about half of the U.S. population receives an annual influenza vaccine for various reasons, including misinformation about vaccination. Patient education materials are available at the Seasonal Flu Partner Resources Center. In addition, results from unpublished CDC qualitative research shows that many people are not aware that there are drugs to treat influenza illness. A fact sheet for patients is available. Symptoms of COVID-19, options when experiencing symptoms (including getting tested for COVID-19 and isolation guidance), when to seek emergency medical attention, and differences between influenza and COVID-19 are described here: Symptoms of COVID-19 | CDC. CDC also provides easy-to-read COVID-19 materials.

Fouchier, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, and another scientist, Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, had separately tweaked the H5N1 virus — an influenza that primarily infects birds — in a way that made it spread more easily in ferrets. H5N1 is a prime pandemic candidate, and ferrets are often used as proxies for humans in flu experiments. When word got out that the two scientists were planning to publish papers detailing their experiments, making a blueprint available to the world, the outcry was extreme. The scientists were trying to better understand H5N1 in order to prevent a pandemic, but critics worried that their experiments could instead cause one — or provide would-be bioterrorists with an outbreak manufacturing guide. The New York Times ran an editorial titled “An Engineered Doomsday.” The backlash was so severe that in 2012, Kawaoka, Fouchier, and other prominent flu scientists voluntarily agreed to pause the transmissibility work. The debacle prompted an overhaul of policies, now being reconsidered in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, governing work with so-called gain-of-function research of concern. The story is well known. And yet, what happened next has never been reported in its entirety. Early on, Fouchier told Science that he had created “probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make.” But after controversy broke out, as the science communicator Peter Sandman has written, Fouchier and his supporters shifted to downplaying the danger. In early 2013, flu scientists ended their voluntary pause, arguing that when the research was done at enhanced biosafety level 3, or BSL3+, the benefits outweighed the risks. Kawaoka, who was normally the more taciturn of the two, hosted journalists in his lab, where he explained his safety procedures. “The influenza virus is sensitive to detergent,” he reportedly said while explaining the process of showering out. “They die.” A biosafety staffer at the University of Wisconsin got up before a university audience to dispel what she called myths about lab oversight. The address was broadcast on local television. Then, months later, Kawaoka’s lab saw two accidents involving lab-generated flu viruses, just one week apart. The accidents, a spill and a needle prick, carried a low risk of infection. Flu viruses are typically transferred through respiratory droplets, not skin contact or injection. Nonetheless, in letters obtained by The Intercept, staff at a funding agency accused the university of shirking biosafety precautions that Kawaoka had promised to adopt. They also demanded changes to the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s protocol for accidental lab exposures. Of particular concern was a plan to quarantine all researchers exposed to modified H5N1 at home, even if they were at high risk of infection — an approach that the funding agency administrators found so alarming that they threatened to end the lab’s grant unless the university changed course. At the center of the debacle was the National Institutes of Health, whose National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases had funded both Kawaoka’s and Fouchier’s labs. (Fouchier was a sub-awardee on a grant to a U.S. institution.) The agency oversees biosafety protocols on the same research it funds, and its oversight arm has a reputation for being timid, generally resolving issues through polite dialogue. “We want to be cautious about when we use that stick,” said Jessica Tucker, acting deputy director of NIH’s Office of Science Policy, referring to the threat of termination. Under NIH’s guidelines on research with recombinant DNA, home quarantine is acceptable for low-risk H5N1 exposures, like the two 2013 accidents, but not for high-risk ones in which a scientist has potentially inhaled the virus. The guidelines say that lab workers exposed through their respiratory tract or mucous membranes need to be isolated in a dedicated facility, like a hospital. With pathogens like modified H5N1, quarantining an exposed lab worker in such a facility is “a prudent precaution and reduces the risk to the worker’s family and community if they do become infected,” wrote Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, in an email. The University of Wisconsin–Madison did not have such a plan in place, according to the documents. In a letter to NIH, a university vice chancellor wrote that after consulting health care providers and Wisconsin health officials, administrators had determined that “a home quarantine was appropriate for all exotic influenza viruses.” Rebecca Moritz, who was with the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Office of Biological Safety at the time, told The Intercept that the outside health experts were concerned that quarantining researchers in the hospital would put medical staff at risk and unnecessarily take up an isolation bed. Key Takeaways The Intercept obtained over 5,500 pages of NIH documents, including 18 years of laboratory incident reports, detailing hundreds of accidents. In 2013, a University of Wisconsin lab had two accidents, a spill and a needle prick, involving modified strains of H5N1 avian influenza. The accidents prompted a stern reaction from NIH, as did a university plan to quarantine all exposed researchers at home. The agency threatened to end the lab’s grant unless the quarantine plan was changed. NIH alleged in a letter that university officials also worried about “the stress [hospital quarantine] would place on the laboratory worker.” “That is not a persuasive argument,” said Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University who sits on his university’s institutional biosafety committee. “Most major hospitals have an infectious disease isolation ward with rooms that are expressly designed to reduce transmission. No homes do.” In a hospital, he added, “[Quarantine] is supervised, which is not happening for a person in a home.” Although the scientific community was debating how to oversee gain-of-function research, and the accidents would have been relevant to that debate, the dispute was handled quietly. One incident came to light 18 months later, the second emerged only last year, and the full story has gone untold until now. Lack of Clear Standards Descriptions of the two incidents, along with the agency’s responses, appear in the trove of documents obtained by The Intercept, Edward Hammond, and Lynn Klotz detailing lab accidents reported to NIH’s Office of Science Policy over a span of 18 years. The documents, which number over 5,500 pages, cover the years 2004-2021 and paint a picture of various animal bites, escapes, needlesticks, equipment malfunctions, and even some human infections. Hammond, former director of the now-defunct transparency group Sunshine Project, and Klotz, senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, requested some of the documents under the Freedom of Information Act; The Intercept requested others directly. When the University of Wisconsin reported the two incidents to NIH’s Office of Science Policy, as required of institutions that use NIH funding to research certain pathogens, it set off a flurry of heated conference calls and sternly worded letters involving high-level administrators on both sides. The spat lasted six weeks. Kawaoka and the university had assured the world that his research was safe, but NIH alleged that they were not adhering to all regulations, and even in some cases to the university’s own policies. “NIH has significant concerns regarding the biosafety practices associated with both of the recent incidents,” two agency officials wrote in one letter. They threatened to “institute enforcement action(s),” including suspending or terminating Kawaoka’s grant. The agency’s reaction to the accidents was more extreme than in any other instance examined by The Intercept. After many other accidents, including for some involving potential pandemic pathogens, the same bureaucrats responded with brief thank-you emails. In a few cases, they asked for corrective actions. In no other instance did they threaten to withhold funding.

In our experience, this has been a successful approach.” (Bayha was previously an analyst with the office, and the initial report of the needle prick went to him, along with other staffers.) In some instances, the University of Wisconsin–Madison biosafety practices singled out for scrutiny by the agency aren’t clearly delineated in agency guidelines. The dispute highlights a lack of clear standards in how to respond to exposures in high-risk labs — a gray area that, critics argue, could put the public in danger. “It shouldn’t be up to people in the moment of a disaster,” said Rocco Casagrande, managing director of Gryphon Scientific, a biosafety advisory firm. “Someone needs to step in and say, ‘This is how it should be.’” The needle prick was previously reported by USA Today, as part of a larger investigation into U.S. biolabs. Klotz wrote about the two accidents in an article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last year. The Intercept is publishing the full correspondence between NIH and the University of Wisconsin–Madison about the breaches, along with additional details and reporting, for the first time. (The Intercept has omitted one document to protect the lab’s security.) “The Influenza Research Institute has never experienced an event where public health or safety has been put at risk,” wrote Andrea Ladd, director of biological safety at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, in an email to The Intercept. “This does not mean incidents do not occur, but when they do, there are protocols and systems in place to ensure that risk is mitigated and our researchers, community, and environment are protected from harm.” “No one that is currently at UW-Madison was involved in those conversations with the NIH and therefore we cannot confirm details of those conversations,” she added. But she wrote that before NIH intervened, home quarantine was the university’s policy “in most cases” following exposure to highly pathogenic avian flu viruses like H5N1: “Examples of when quarantine would have been at a location other than a personnel residence were not specified in the UW Exposure Control Plan prior to December 2013.” The university currently quarantines high-risk exposures in an isolation room at a local hospital, she said. Ladd wrote that unlike in the bombshell avian influenza studies, the two strains at issue in the accidents were “not known to be mammalian transmissible.” Critics counter that Kawaoka’s research entailed stitching genes from H5N1 onto human flu strains and adding progressively more mutations until the hybrid viruses became transmissible, and that, while risk is hard to predict, strains along that continuum could also be concerning. “If it is a version that is on the pathway toward mammalian transmission, more than strains that circulate in nature, then it is a subject of high concern,” said Ebright. According to the documents, one of the strains had a mutation in the receptor binding site, which is critical to infection. Fouchier declined to comment, writing in an email, “I have commented many times in the past.” Kawaoka confirmed the accuracy of Ladd’s responses but declined to respond to questions. Shortly after publication, he wrote in an email that “on rare occasions, humans become infected with avian influenza viruses, usually following close or prolonged contact with infected birds. The mutation in question was found in a patient sample and is not known to be mammalian transmissible. We did not test the transmissibility of the virus in question or use this virus for any animal experiments.” “Dr. Kawaoka is one of most compliant, if not the most compliant PIs [principal investigators] I have ever worked with,” said Moritz, who was with the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Office of Biological Safety at the time. “He takes safety and security incredibly seriously and works very, very well with people like me to figure out how to mitigate risk.” She added: “One of the things that I find most disheartening about this entire debate is that we’re debating the ethics of a set of experiments. That’s what we’re ultimately debating.” Others agree that the accidents were not unusual or reckless but contend that when it comes to experiments with a small but real chance of ravaging the population, safety and ethics are inextricable. “We should be brave enough to say that some experiments should not be done,” said Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris who supported restrictions on controversial gain-of-function research in the wake of the 2011 studies. Because such work accounts for a small proportion of biomedical science, he argued, “This is not an attack on the scientific system. It is about protecting the integrity of the scientific system and society as a whole.” Yoshihiro Kawaoka, left, a professor of the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, and Masato Tashiro from Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases, hold a press conference in Geneva on Feb. 17, 2012. Photo: Kyodo via AP Images A Punctured Glove When flu viruses reassort, or swap gene segments, in nature, the hemagglutinin gene often plays a critical role. For the controversial 2011 experiments, Kawaoka’s team had combined a mutated version of the hemagglutinin gene from an avian H5N1 strain with gene segments from a human H1N1 flu strain. They used a similar approach to generate one of the viruses at issue in the 2013 accident reports, though with a different strain of H5N1 and fewer mutations in the hemagglutinin gene. On a Saturday evening that November, a researcher in Kawaoka’s lab was using a needle to draw up liquid containing the virus when he pricked his hand. The needle punctured his glove, sinking into his finger. The researcher dialed the on-call lab manager, who gave detailed instructions on what to do next: Squeeze blood out of the wound, run his hand under water for 15 minutes, put on new gloves, clean up, and shower out. After notifying health care providers and other staff, the lab manager gave the researcher Tamiflu, an N95 mask, and a new glove to cover his injured hand; the laboratory manager drove the researcher home, instructing him to quarantine there for a week. A colleague had called ahead and told the researcher’s family members to pack their things so they could be moved to a hotel before he arrived. A university employee alerted city and state health officials. Once home, the researcher started taking his temperature, and the next morning the lab manager collected throat and nose swabs for testing. Soon after, a biosafety officer informed NIH about the accident, boasting: “This has been an exceptional response.” Administrators at the Office of Science Policy disagreed. A week earlier, a researcher in the same lab carrying a stack of tissue culture plates containing a different modified H5N1 strain dropped a plate, spilling a small amount of virus onto the lab floor. Some of it splashed onto his Tyvek suit, just below the knee. From there, the suit extended down his legs and then stopped at his ankles, leaving patches of bare skin. The researcher cleaned up the accident; doused his arms, legs, and some lab equipment in an ethanol solution; stuffed all of the waste into a biohazard bag; and phoned the on-call scientist to report what had happened. After consulting a doctor and getting him a prescription for Tamiflu, biosafety staff discharged the researcher, telling him to monitor his body temperature. After he left the lab, a second researcher went in to dispose of the waste. As NIH staff pried into the University of Wisconsin’s policies for research on avian influenza viruses, they learned that the institution planned to quarantine exposed researchers at home in all cases, no matter the risk level. “An individual’s permanent residence is not appropriate due to the fact that many residences are in buildings with high occupancy that share air exchange and other infrastructure,” wrote Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, an official in the Office of Science Policy, in a December 2013 letter to the university. She pointed out that in a research plan sent to NIH earlier that year, Kawaoka had said he had access to a “designated quarantine apartment” for researchers who were at high risk of infection. (Ladd told The Intercept that Kawaoka’s statement about the apartment was caused by a “misunderstanding” between him and the university on where researchers would quarantine after high-risk exposures.) Corrigan-Curay ordered the university to find a dedicated quarantine facility, noting, “An isolation room in a hospital would be appropriate.” NIH also noted that the exposed researcher had been using the needle for an unauthorized purpose; the laboratory’s standard operating procedure did not allow needles to be used for drawing up tissue culture supernatant, the liquid the researcher had targeted. (Ladd said that the policy has since been “revised for improved clarity” and that the lab workers were retrained.) In the spill, NIH took issue with the researcher’s exposed ankles. Agency officials contended that bare skin violated the agency’s guidelines covering research with recombinant DNA. On a phone call, university representatives disagreed. According to a note about the call in the correspondence, someone said that the lab had recently been inspected by the Select Agent Program, which is jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that the report from the inspection did not mention any restrictions of the sort on bare skin. NIH shot back that the agency had consulted staff at the Select Agent Program. “They are in agreement that bare skin is unacceptable at this level of containment,” wrote Corrigan-Curay. “The University must take immediate action to ensure that, in the future, no workers in this or any other high containment laboratories have exposed skin.” Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I'm in The dispute over bare ankles illustrates a lack of clear and consistent standards. In Canada and select other countries, research on pathogens is centrally regulated. The United States has a jumble of policies, and biosafety training can vary widely from one lab to the next. After the uproar over the 2011 avian influenza studies, NIH adopted additional biosafety guidelines for research with H5N1 strains that are transmissible in mammals, but even those are not comprehensive. “They don’t have good guidelines about when things are mitigated enough,” said Casagrande, whose firm has advised NIH on the risks and benefits of gain-of-function research. “They can have one response that is guns blazing, and another that is very muted — and why? What’s the standard?” “Clearly, [oversight] only happens in extraordinary cases,” said Koblentz, the biosafety scholar. “But really it should be the routine.” “Cannot Have More Accidents” The exchange may have been particularly heated because the accident occurred at a fraught moment for high-risk viral research. H5N1 belongs to a group of what are called “potential pandemic pathogens”: bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that, either through handling or through modification, could set off another pandemic. Policies governing research with such pathogens were established in the wake of Kawaoka’s and Fouchier’s controversial papers, which were published with some revisions by Nature and Science, respectively, in 2012. (Klotz, who provided The Intercept with the University of Wisconsin incident reports, coined the term “potential pandemic pathogen” with Edward Sylvester of Arizona State University.) In 2014, the U.S. government adopted a moratorium on funding for gain-of-function research that could spark a pandemic. Three years later, the pause was lifted and the Department of Health and Human Services, NIH’s parent agency, shifted to a framework called P3CO, under which research that involves modifying potential pandemic pathogens or is “reasonably anticipated” to create them has to undergo a special review process in order to get funding. Related Student Infected With Debilitating Virus in Undisclosed Biolab Accident Neither policy has been evenly or transparently implemented. The Intercept has reported that in 2016, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases administrators flagged a proposal by EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. nonprofit that worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on bat coronavirus research, as potentially being covered by the moratorium. But instead of insisting on modifications that would have made the research safer, they let the organization craft an unusual rule to govern its own work. Since the P3CO policy was adopted in 2017, according to Health and Human Services, only three projects have undergone special review. In a detailed analysis of NIH’s grant database last year, the Washington Post identified a total of eight projects that appear to have warranted review. And just last month, in articles from Stat and Science, it emerged that two more risky experiments had not undergone review. In the first instance, at Boston University’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratory, scientists created a hybrid version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases alleged that they had not sought approval for the work, prompting scientists not connected with the experiments to point out that the guidance on when to seek approval is unclear. Moritz, the former University of Wisconsin–Madison biosafety staffer, contended that NIH’s response to the 2013 accidents was overblown and driven by the gain-of-function controversy. “You need to look at the timeframe and the context of what was going on politically,” said Moritz, who is now biosafety director at Colorado State University and the incoming president of ABSA International, a biosafety professional association. “That’s why the reaction was the way it was.” “These decisions are not made politically,” said Tucker, the Office of Science Policy acting deputy director. “They’re made in terms of the best response and working with institutions to come into compliance.” After NIH threatened to terminate Kawaoka’s grant, the documents show, the University of Wisconsin overhauled its policies, agreeing to adopt new guidelines on quarantining and on exposed ankles. The university sent the agency copies of new training slides. One conveyed a mixed message to lab workers. “Cannot have more accidents,” read one. “But MUST report any incidents, even the most minor.” The researcher who had spilled the plate containing modified H5N1 got up in front of his fellow lab workers and reenacted the accident. Staff peppered him with questions. “Did you ever have a moment when you panicked?” asked one. “What was your worst fear? Quarantine?” asked another. The university sent notes on the meeting to NIH. Finally, the two sides reached an agreement. On Christmas Eve in 2013, NIH wrote in a letter to the University of Wisconsin associate vice chancellor that the university had complied with its demands. Kawaoka’s lab could resume the controversial work.

Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images Weak and Nonspecific Today, research with potential pandemic pathogens is again in the spotlight. In February, NIH charged a committee called the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity with reconsidering the P3CO policy, along with a policy on dual-use research. The NSABB has a fraught history, and its members are appointed by NIH itself. “There is an inherent conflict of interest in having a group appointed by an agency to review that agency’s work,” said Koblentz. At NSABB meetings in April and September, tensions ran high. At stake is not just the future of gain-of-function research, some participants stressed, but the safety of the world. And yet, lost in the discussion is the fact that one of the labs that set off the gain-of-function fracas actually has had accidents involving modified H5N1. When lab accidents happen, “They don’t put it in the local newspaper, and I think it’s reasonable that they don’t,” said Stuart Newman, a cell biologist at New York Medical College who sits on his university’s institutional biosafety committee. “But because it’s all handled quietly, the general public isn’t aware of the frequency of incidents like this — or even that they exist.” Even though most incidents don’t lead to infection, Newman said, “Just the fact that they happen should be more widely known.” The NSABB released preliminary recommendations last month. Critics say they’re incomplete. At the meeting where the results were unveiled, Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch took issue with the section of the recommendations that deals with transparency, saying, “It’s too weak and too nonspecific.” Tucker said the final recommendations are expected in December or January. Some biosafety advocates say that a broader overhaul is needed. “As long as all of the oversight is strictly advisory and none of it is enforceable with force of law, nothing ever will move forward — particularly so long as the oversight is housed in an institution that performs and funds research,” said Ebright. “It needs to come from Congress or the White House.” One model for regulating pathogen research could be the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees all facilities that work with radiological materials and also funds research on safety and security. Others say that nothing short of a dramatic shift in worldviews is needed. Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, compared it to research on human subjects. Until the 1970s, scientists regularly carried out experiments on prisoners, including for infection studies. Over time, opinions shifted. “At some point, it became accepted that even though experiments on prisoners were scientifically informative, they just aren’t ethical to do,” said Bloom. For the rest of the world, how the United States regulates research with dangerous pathogens matters. “The United States has a special responsibility when it comes to oversight and getting it right,” said Filippa Lentzos, an expert on biosecurity and biological threats at King’s College London who co-chairs an international task force on high-risk pathogens with Bloom. “It is a leader in a lot of this research, and it’s where most of this research takes place.” In 2014, the moratorium on gain-of-function work made it impossible for Kawaoka’s lab to continue with transmissibility studies. But five years later, Science reported that the Health and Human Services P3CO panel quietly greenlighted the controversial bird flu experiments to resume, without alerting the public. The agency did not release details on how the panel assessed the proposals or what evidence was evaluated. The grant was contingent on the lab following additional safety measures, but the agency did not announce what these were. The decision came to light only because word leaked to a journalist, a fact that two prominent experts writing in the Washington Post called “unacceptable.” The 2013 accident reports and correspondence might have helped inform the discussion. But at that point, they weren’t public. Update: November 2, 2022 This article has been updated with a comment from Yoshihiro Kawaoka that was received after publication.

However, they are caused by two entirely different viruses. The combination of specific diagnostic tests able to distinguish between the two viruses and mortality data indicate that COVID-19 is not caused by the influenza virus. Instead, it’s a new disease, responsible for millions of additional deaths. Reviewed content Verdict: Incorrect Claim: the 2.8 millions who died of COVID in 2020 can be due to the flu and pneumonia Source: Facebook, Facebook users, 2022-11-01 Verdict detail Incorrect: Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 aren’t caused by the flu. COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the flu is caused by the influenza virus. Diagnostic tests are able to distinguish one virus from the other. Flawed Reasoning: Millions of excess deaths, or more deaths than expected, were recorded worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. If influenza deaths were simply mislabeled as COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths wouldn’t be observed. See our method of evaluation Full Claim "2.9 million people died of Influenza and Pneumonia in 2018 [...] 2.8 million “die of covid” in 2020…it’s really not that hard figure out (sic) what they’ve done." Review Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020, the unfounded narrative that COVID-19 is a hoax or that its severity was exaggerated has persisted on social media, as previous reviews by Health Feedback can attest to. One iteration of this narrative is that seasonal flu cases have been miscounted as COVID-19 cases, thereby exaggerating the real toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here again, Health Feedback showed how this is false and inconsistent with available epidemiological data (see here, and here). This claim resurfaced in November 2022 when social media users shared a screenshot of a tweet originally posted in April 2022, claiming that “2.9 million people died of influenza and pneumonia” in 2018 and that 2020 saw “2.8 million [dying] of COVID” while there was a “98% decline in influenza cases” in the same year. The tweet concluded by saying that “it’s really not hard figure out (sic) what they’ve done”. These statements taken together clearly suggested that COVID-19 deaths were actually caused by the flu. However, this claim is inaccurate and inconsistent with scientific evidence, as we will show below. To begin with, the claim didn’t provide a source for the numbers it used. Furthermore, they aren’t logical. Pneumonia is an infection of the lower respiratory system that can be caused by many bacteria and viruses, including the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It would have made more sense to compare instead the change in influenza mortality between 2018 and 2020 to the increase in COVID-19 mortality in 2020. It’s true the number of reported influenza cases did significantly reduce between 2018 and 2020. Figure 1 shows the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The 2019 – 2020 flu season, which had begun in a similar fashion as previous seasons, came to an abrupt end at the beginning of March 2020. Figure 1 – Number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza globally. The different colors correspond to different strains of influenza. Note the sharp decrease in detected cases at the end of the 2019-2020 flu season and the quasi-absence of cases during the 2020-2021 flu season. Source: WHO. Figure 1 shows that flu almost disappeared for the rest of 2020 and the first half of 2021. This wasn’t due to a lack of specimen testing for influenza as a 2021 WHO review of global flu circulation in the 2020 – 2021 season explained that the testing activity was barely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the reduction in flu cases isn’t because people with flu were tested less often, but suggests a genuine decrease in infection. While WHO worldwide data don’t report flu mortality, it is highly likely that such a drastic reduction in cases would also result in greatly reduced mortality. And U.S. epidemiological surveillance data supports this, as it showed that markedly fewer influenza-associated deaths were registered in the 2020 – 2021 flu season (Figure 2). Figure 2 – Influenza mortality in the U.S. In orange, plotted on the right axis, the number of deaths where the death certificate lists influenza as the cause of death. The red line represents the proportion of all deaths in the country that are due to pneumonia and influenza. The black lines are the epidemiological thresholds representing the proportion of deaths from all causes that are expected to be due to pneumonia and influenza. Source: CDC. However, the reduction in influenza cases doesn’t demonstrate that COVID-19 mortality has been inflated by deaths actually caused by the flu. First, influenza and COVID-19 are two diseases caused by completely different viruses, with different genetic information, and diagnostic tests are perfectly able to distinguish between them. The virus responsible for COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2[1], belonging to the virus family named Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV-1, which was responsible for the 2003-2005 SARS outbreaks, also belongs to the same family. On the other hand, flu is caused by viruses belonging to the virus family Orthomyxoviridae. This demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 is not a strain of influenza and COVID-19 is not a type of flu. Although both COVID-19 and the flu are respiratory diseases that share some common symptoms, laboratory-confirmed cases rely on specific molecular tests such as the PCR tests that are highly specific to one virus, as Health Feedback previously explained. Therefore, if an influenza PCR diagnostic test returns a negative result, it indicates that the specimen doesn’t contain the influenza virus. If a patient tests positive for COVID-19, it means that they are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and not by the flu virus since a COVID-19 PCR test doesn’t detect the flu virus. WHO data indicated that the proportion of diagnostic tests positive for influenza diminished in the course of 2020 as the proportion of tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 rose (Figure 3). At first glance, this may look like supporting evidence for the claim. However, since diagnostic tests are highly specific to a particular virus, the change in positive tests for flu means that the spread of the flu virus was greatly limited in contrast to SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3 – Detection of influenza and COVID-19 cases globally. The blue line indicates the proportion of influenza diagnostic tests that returned a positive result. The blue bars represent the number of detected influenza cases. The red line represents the proportion of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that returned a positive result. The red bars represent the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Source: WHO. Second, mortality data showed that COVID-19 is a new cause of death, independent of seasonal flu. If COVID-19 were merely a new name for the flu, we should observe a similar mortality trend in 2020 compared to the past years. However, this isn’t what happened. Health authorities registered more than two million COVID-19 deaths worldwide by the end of 2020. This is much higher than the 294,000 to 518,000 influenza deaths that occur globally in a normal year, according to the Global Influenza Mortality Research project. Another way to analyze mortality in 2020 is to look at the excess deaths from all causes. Excess mortality is defined as the number of deaths exceeding what would normally be expected based on the previous years. The world has registered an estimated 16.8 to 28.2 million excess deaths from all causes since 2020, according to a The Economist model, and this phenomenon is still ongoing in 2022. The same model estimated between 3.7 and 6.4 million excess deaths by the end of 2020. Again, if COVID-19 were just another name for the flu, we wouldn’t observe excess mortality. Therefore, mortality data directly contradict the claim and show that COVID-19 is a cause of death independent from influenza. What, then, could explain the unusually low number of influenza cases and deaths during the 2020-2021 influenza season? Since COVID-19 and the flu are infectious respiratory diseases and both can be transmitted through respiratory droplets, it’s logical to infer that measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 also limited the circulation of the flu virus. The onset of the COVID-19 led many countries to take a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of COVID-19, including mask-wearing, physical distancing, lockdowns, and restrictions on domestic and international travel. In its review, the WHO considers that it is plausible that all these measures actively limited the risks of propagation of influenza. Supporting these conclusions is the observation that the influenza virus’ circulation decreased after the onset of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aiming at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection[2,3,4]. Importantly, researchers also observed a reduction in other respiratory infections, such as the respiratory syncytial virus[5,6]. This reinforces the hypothesis that the lower number of influenza cases is actually part of a wider phenomenon in which less respiratory diseases spread due to global preventive measures. In summary, the 2020 – 2021 flu season did indeed see much fewer flu cases and deaths compared to the previous years. However, this isn’t because flu cases were mislabeled as COVID-19 cases, contrary to the claim in viral social media posts. Instead, NPIs, such as travel restrictions and physical distancing, were one likely explanation for the sharp fall in flu cases. This is because NPIs aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 also limit the spread of other respiratory infectious diseases, including influenza. COVID-19 is a different disease from the flu that is caused by a coronavirus, not the flu virus, and is responsible for millions more deaths than expected during the pandemic.

It was the Friday afternoon before Labor Day in 2011, and people were rushing out of the city for a long weekend. Three days earlier, the ferret had been inoculated with a recombinant strain of 1918 influenza, which killed between 20 and 50 million people when it swept through the world at the end of World War I. To prevent it from sparking another pandemic, 1918 influenza is studied under biosafety level 3 conditions, the second-tightest of biosafety controls available. The researcher at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (now Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) was wearing protective equipment, including two pairs of gloves. But the ferret bit hard enough to pierce through both pairs, breaking the skin of his left thumb. The flu is typically transmitted through respiratory droplets, and an animal bite is unlikely to infect a scientist. But with a virus as devastating as 1918 flu, scientists are not supposed to take any chances. The researcher squeezed blood out of the wound, washed it with an ethanol solution, showered, and left the lab. A doctor gave him a flu shot and prescribed him Tamiflu. Then, after checking that he lived alone, a Mount Sinai administrator sent him home to quarantine for a week, unsupervised, in the most densely populated city in the United States. As documents obtained by The Intercept show, staff told him to take his temperature two times a day and to wear an N95 respirator if he got sick and needed to leave for medical care. NIH guidelines say that only people exposed through their respiratory tract or mucous membranes need to be isolated in a dedicated facility, rather than at home. But some experts contend that the protocols governing research with the most dangerous pathogens should be stronger. “That is a pretty significant biosafety breach,” said Gregory Koblentz, director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government. Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, agreed: “Say the risk was 0.1 percent. But if he just happened to be unlucky, then the consequences would be absolutely gigantic.” A researcher stuck in a small apartment in New York City might be tempted to venture outside to get food or fresh air, he added. Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said that Mount Sinai’s response seemed appropriate. But, he said, the episode shows that “accidents sometimes happen even where there isn’t negligence.” In his view, the solution was simpler: 1918 influenza is so dangerous that experiments with it shouldn’t be done at all. Key Takeaways The Intercept obtained over 5,500 pages of NIH documents, including 18 years of laboratory incident reports, detailing hundreds of accidents. In one breach, a ferret inoculated with the recreated 1918 influenza virus bit a researcher at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. The researcher was sent home to quarantine. Some feel that 1918 influenza, which killed between 20 and 50 million people, is so dangerous that experiments with it should not be done. The documents reviewed by The Intercept show broad variation in how seriously scientists and biosafety officers treated errors and accidents. Adolfo García-Sastre, the lab’s principal investigator, knew firsthand how work with the 1918 flu virus could spark controversy. In 2005, he was part of a team that reconstructed the virus in order to study how it had become so devastating. The effort was the culmination of an outlandish journey, which started when a Swedish microbiologist trekked to Alaska to take a sample of the virus from the corpse of a 1918 flu victim; she had been buried in a mass grave after the virus wiped out most of her village, and her body was preserved in the permafrost. Using that and other samples, scientists spent years sequencing parts of the virus, eventually sequencing the whole genome. García-Sastre and collaborators then used a technique called reverse genetics to make a copy of the virus’s DNA, laying the groundwork for recreating the virus. (The actual reconstruction of the virus was done at a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta.) When the team studied the virus in mice, they found that it was incredibly lethal. Some mice died within three days of infection. Furor ensued. Biosafety proponents argued that the risk of accidental release was not worth taking. No one really knew how potent the virus would be in modern times. Did we want to find out? The ferret bite happened six years later but has not been publicized until now. For some, it is a stark example of the risks that accompany research on dangerous pathogens. The mishap and hundreds of others are recorded in more than 5,500 pages of National Institutes of Health documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, detailing accidents between 2004 and 2021. The Intercept requested some of the reports directly, while Edward Hammond, former director of the transparency group the Sunshine Project, and Lynn Klotz, senior science fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, separately requested and provided others. The documents show that accidents happen with risky research even at highly secure labs. NIH recently convened an advisory panel to consider how it regulates such experiments. In 2017, following a protracted controversy over experiments in which scientists tweaked the H5N1 avian influenza virus to make it more transmissible in ferrets, the Department of Health and Human Services adopted new oversight of research on pathogens with the capacity to spark a pandemic. Those guidelines require experiments that are “reasonably anticipated” to confer dangerous new traits to so-called “potential pandemic pathogens” — or create new ones — to undergo a special review process in order to get NIH funding. But as The Intercept has reported, the policy has been unevenly applied. Some experts are calling for other biosafety policies, such as those outlining what to do after a lab accident, to be tightened as well. “A lot of our talk now is about potential pandemic pathogens and risks around that,” said Koblentz of the ferret bite. “But the 1918 flu was a known pandemic pathogen. That should have the highest possible level of biosafety and measures taken in the event of an accident or a suspected or known exposure.” “The downside with that type of pandemic pathogen is so high that it just doesn’t seem to me that there’s any level at which it’s worth it.” Mount Sinai and García-Sastre did not respond to requests to comment. Mount Sinai reported the ferret bite to NIH, as well as to the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as required under a program governing the use of certain toxins called select agents. “[I]solation in a predetermined facility was not necessary because an animal bite did not meet the definition of known laboratory exposure with a high risk of infection,” wrote Ryan Bayha, a spokesperson for NIH’s Office of Science Policy, in an email. (Bayha was previously an analyst with the office, and the report on the ferret bite was addressed to him.) Bloom said that experiments with 1918 influenza are scientifically interesting. At one point, he supported doing them. But he came to change his views after considering the risks more holistically. “I now feel that experiments with actual 1918 influenza just shouldn’t be done,” he said. To him, the ferret bite shows that accidents with dangerous viruses happen at even the best, most secure labs. “It’s like a nuclear weapons accident. The downside with that type of pandemic pathogen is so high that it just doesn’t seem to me that there’s any level at which it’s worth it.” A scientist works with a box of frozen spanish flu virus strains at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health on Dec. 19, 2017, in Bethesda, Md. Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP “A Complete Farce” Many of the biotechnology safety standards in place today trace to 1975, when a group of scientists gathered at the Asilomar Conference Center on the California coast. Advances in biology had recently made it possible to modify DNA by inserting genes from one organism into the genetic code of another, and scientists convened the International Congress on Recombinant DNA Molecules to consider the implications of such research. Though driven by concerns about ethics, the conference would come to be seen by historians and bioethicists as an elite gathering aimed in part at warding off intervention by U.S. Congress. Three years earlier, Stanford University biochemists Paul Berg and Janet Mertz had sparked outcry when they combined genes from the gut bacteria E. coli with DNA from a type of simian virus that can cause tumors in rodents. They had planned to insert the new DNA back into E. coli, but some of their peers worried that the modified bacteria could cause cancer in lab workers. Others feared that genetically engineered organisms could be used as bioweapons. The Asilomar meeting was organized in part by scientists whose primary interest was in allowing the research to go forward. Berg, under fire, co-chaired the conference. “They focused on this idea that research is done outside of society — that if scientists can get their act in order and govern themselves, then they don’t have to worry about the broader world,” said Sam Weiss Evans, a senior research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School’s Program on Science, Technology, and Society. “But for many citizens at the time, the issue was very different: Are these scientists going to run rampant and just do whatever they want, or is there going to be some kind of ability for us to have a check on them?” The critics’ worst fears about carcinogenic gut bacteria did not pan out, but the notion that scientists could set their own guardrails would have long-lasting consequences. The recommendations drawn up by the delegates to the Asilomar conference became the basis for the NIH guidelines on recombinant DNA that, with some revisions, are still in place today. Most Read Congress Is About to Gift Trump Sweeping Powers to Crush His Political Enemies Noah Hurowitz How California Got Convinced to Lock More People Up Jonah Valdez The Looming Fight to Make Local Cops Part of Trump’s Deportation Machine Shawn Musgrave In 2001, after letters laced with anthrax killed five Americans, the United States adopted new biosecurity regulations, including rules governing the use of select agents. A decade later, the H5N1 controversy spurred another layer of oversight. But in other areas, regulation is lacking, despite breakthroughs in fields like synthetic DNA. At NIH, meanwhile, critics point to an inherent conflict of interest: The agency is charged with overseeing the same research it funds. Institutional biosafety committees — or IBCs, review boards at universities and other institutions that evaluate potentially risky research plans for NIH compliance — are another legacy of Asilomar. Scientists devising a new experiment consider the risks and come up with ways to mitigate them: safety equipment, checks, and controls. They then propose that plan to the IBC. But there are no standards in place for an IBC to determine whether the benefits of an experiment actually justify the remaining risks — a glaring problem when it comes to pathogens like the 1918 flu virus. “Yes, they’re all experts, and yes, they’re all trained in this type of thing, but do we really just want it to be down to a judgment call?” said Rocco Casagrande, managing director of the biosafety advisory firm Gryphon Scientific. “How do you determine if the experiment should be done, if there really aren’t any standards?” “How do you determine if the experiment should be done, if there really aren’t any standards?” Critics say that the IBC system, like NIH oversight, also has a conflict-of-interest problem: Research is evaluated by an institution that relies on grant funding. Some institutions even hire out IBC work to private companies. As director of the Sunshine Project, which is now defunct, Hammond spent years pressing institutions for minutes from institutional biosafety committee meetings, which NIH requires be made available upon request. Some of the institutions he contacted could not provide them, he said. “The IBCs didn’t exist at a lot of institutions. They hadn’t met in years. They weren’t doing the oversight business. The system was just a complete farce.” Shortly before the reconstruction of the 1918 flu virus, Hammond’s Sunshine Project published a report that singled out Mount Sinai for criticism, alleging that the institution had no IBC minutes. Earlier this year, for an investigation published by Undark, journalist Michael Schulson asked eight institutions in the New York area for IBC minutes. Mount Sinai did not provide them, Schulson told The Intercept. Mount Sinai also did not respond to a request to provide minutes to The Intercept. The documents reviewed by The Intercept show broad variation in how seriously scientists and biosafety officers treated errors and accidents. In one report, a principal investigator apologized profusely after his IBC approval expired in the chaos of the early pandemic and his lab continued with research without renewing it. “This is completely my (PI) fault,” he wrote. “I failed my role as an effective PI this time.” In other cases, staff appear eager to avoid responsibility. After a 2020 incident in which a researcher at the University of Wisconsin–Madison pricked themselves with a needle while working in a biosafety level 3 lab with a mouse infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a biosafety officer blamed the accident on the mouse, writing, “The root cause is the natural instinct of an animal to be uncooperative with a procedure it dislikes.” (The officer wrote that “incomplete restraint” techniques contributed to the accident.) In responding to violations, NIH can ask for changes or corrective action — and in some cases, the agency did. It can also pull funding if the guidelines aren’t met. But in 18 years of documents, The Intercept found no evidence of such extreme measures being taken. In one instance, NIH threatened to terminate funding after two incidents in a University of Wisconsin–Madison lab working with modified H5N1 avian influenza; the standoff ended with the institution adopting stricter protocols. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I'm in Regulators intent on preventing future pandemics are now exploring changes to biosafety policies. The issue has been taken up by Congress, the White House, the World Health Organization, and NIH itself. But the discussion is highly politicized, with some scientists resisting regulation and some experts pessimistic that the process will lead to real change. One problem is a dearth of information. “We don’t have a clear picture of all accidents,” said Filippa Lentzos, an expert on biosecurity and biological threats at King’s College London. “It’s difficult to get good information on how risky stuff is, and how likely it is that you’re going to have an accident. We simply don’t have that data.” News of severe breaches sometimes leaks out in press reports. But many lab workers are graduate students. For them, speaking up about safety problems could mean career suicide. The new documents fill in some of those gaps. While the researcher at Mount Sinai did not fall ill, in a small number of cases, accidents did lead to infection. In one instance, a researcher at Washington University of St. Louis contracted Chikungunya virus, which has sparked epidemics in Africa, after pricking herself with a needle in a biosafety level 3 lab. She only reported the accident after getting sick. With pathogens like the 1918 flu virus, the stakes are even higher. The current system “gives a good level of review most of the time,” Bloom said. “But it’s not the kind of system that you could count on if you potentially have research that could kill 10 million people if it goes wrong.” “There’s a lot of responsibility that comes with doing these experiments that are so high-risk,” says Lentzos. “It’s about talking through some of that. That is the biggest loophole that needs to be addressed.” Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Contact the author: Mara Hvistendahl mara.hvistendahl@theintercept.com @MaraHvistendahl on X Related Student Infected With Debilitating Virus in Undisclosed Biolab Accident Infection of Wildlife Biologist Highlights Risks of Virus Hunting How the Pursuit of Unknown Viruses Risks Triggering the Next Pandemic NIH Officials Worked With EcoHealth Alliance to Evade Restrictions on Coronavirus Experiments Latest Stories Congress Is About to Gift Trump Sweeping Powers to Crush His Political Enemies Noah Hurowitz - Nov. 10 The House is set to vote Tuesday on a bill that would let the administration destroy nonprofits it claims support terrorism.

Tips & Tools Question Is it safe to get a flu shot if I am pregnant? Datta Munshi MD, FAAP Answer Article Main Image Page ContentYes! The influenza (flu) virus typically infects between 3% and 11% of the U.S. population every year. Most often, it causes symptoms like fever, cough, cold symptoms, muscle aches and fatigue. But it can also lead to serious complications like bacterial pneumonia. In addition, it can worsen chronic medical conditions like asthma and diabetes. Pregnant people and children under the age of 5 are more likely to suffer serious complications from influenza. So, while it's important to get the flu shot each year, it may be even more important while you are pregnant.Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID started to spread earlier than expected in fall 2022. In October, a record number of children under age 4 years were hospitalized with the flu—the most in 10 years. The best thing pregnant people can do is to get vaccinated.Why can influenza make pregnant people sicker?Pregnant people undergo changes in how their heart, lungs and immune system works when they are pregnant. While these changes are normal, they can make them prone to more severe illness with the influenza virus that could require hospitalization.What can pregnant people do to decrease their risk of serious illness?The best protection against influenza infection is getting the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine has been shown to decrease hospitalization due to influenza during pregnancy by 40%. In addition, hygiene practices like frequent handwashing and keeping distance from people who are sick can help decrease risk.Are there other advantages to getting the flu shot during pregnancy?Yes! In addition to decreasing risk of severe illness, the flu shot provides immune protection against the flu to their newborn babies who are too young to get the shot.Is the flu vaccine safe while pregnant?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) strongly recommend flu vaccination for pregnant people. If you are pregnant, you should get the flu shot, not the live nasal spray. This recommendation comes from data from millions of pregnant people receiving flu vaccination safely over many years.More informationAsk the Pediatrician: Flu RoundupCOVID-19 Vaccines During Pregnancy & Breastfeeding: Parent FAQsAges & Stages: Prenatal (HealthyChildren) Datta Munshi MD, FAAP Dr. Datta Munshi is a community pediatrician in Georgia with a strong interest in pediatric behavioral health.

Video Ad Feedback 'It's awful': Doctor explains RSV symptoms as cases surge 04:03 - Source: CNN CNN — Government health officials on Friday warned of an early and severe start to cold and flu season in the United States, saying they were closely monitoring hospital capacity and medical supplies and were ready to send help if needed. “We suspect that many children are being exposed to some respiratory viruses now for the first time, having avoided these viruses during the height of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jose Romero, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a call with reporters. With hospital beds in short supply, Mattie McKoy waited three weeks for scans in Atlanta. Katie McKoy While respiratory viruses surge, shortage of pediatric hospital beds delays care for some kids Across the United States, cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and influenza are increasing. At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the last three weeks, Romero said. Cases have flattened as a raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer. The spikes in viral illnesses have already begun to strain hospitals. Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said Friday that her agency was staying in close contact with health care systems and states. “We are monitoring capacity across the country sharing best practices to reduce the strain on systems and standing by to deploy additional personnel and supplies as needed,” she said, noting that so far, no states have requested this help. “There’s no doubt that we will face some challenges this winter,” O’Connell said. Flu, RSV hitting early and hard Seventeen states, Washington, DC, and New York City, are reporting high or very high respiratory illness activity amid a flu season that’s hitting harder and earlier than usual, according to data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza activity continues to increase in the US – the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths so far this season nearly doubled in the past week. The CDC now estimates that there have been at least 1.6 million illnesses, 13,000 hospitalizations and 730 deaths from influenza, including two reported deaths among children so far this season. About one in 11 tests for flu were positive last week. “In fact, we’re seeing the highest influenza hospitalization rates going back a decade,” Romero said.

(AP Photo/Hajarah Nalwadda) Hajarah Nalwadda/AP Lessons from past outbreaks can stop new epidemics in their tracks The last time flu hospitalization rates have been this high at this point in the season was during the H1N1 pandemic. The latest CDC update tracks data through October 29. There’s no real mystery about why viral illnesses are on the upswing, said Dr. Michael Mina, who is an epidemiologist and chief science officer at eMed, a company offering telehealth test-to-treat services. “We enjoyed the benefit of not having influenza for the last couple of years, primarily because of SARS-CoV-2. Extra mitigation measures like social distancing, masking, and not going out for roughly a year have only delayed the inevitable. Now that we have released the pressures put in place to keep viruses at bay and move into this first real flu season, we, unfortunately, feel its impact,” he said. RSV cases are also increasing nationally, although there are regional differences in the circulation of these viruses, Romero said. It’s a common respiratory infection that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but it can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults and infants. In the South and Mountain West, RSV cases appear to have peaked in October. In those regions, RSV cases are falling, even as influenza is spiking. Flu activity is highest in the South, followed by the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the West Coast. Data from Walgreens that tracks prescriptions for antiviral treatments – such as Tamiflu – suggest there are hotspots in Mississippi and Alabama, as well as the Gulf Coast area, including Houston and New Orleans. RSV hospitalizations were also significantly higher than usual, according to another weekly update published by the CDC on Thursday. Cumulative RSV hospitalization rates have already reached levels that are typically not seen until December in the US. They’re rising among all age groups, but especially among children.

RSV is a common contagious virus that infects the human respiratory tract. NIAID By the next RSV season, the US may have its first vaccine About four out of every 1,000 babies under 6 months old have been hospitalized with RSV so far this season – just about a month in. More than two in every 1,000 babies between 6 months and one year have been hospitalized with RSV so far this season, as have more than one in every 1,000 children between age one and two. Overall in the US, nearly one in five PCR tests for RSV were positive for the week ending October 29, nearly doubling over the course of the month. Weekly cases counts are less complete for the most current weeks, but there have been more RSV cases detected by PCR tests each week in October 2022 than any other week in at least the past two years. Weekly case counts for the week ending October 22 were more than double any other week in 2020 or 2021. There are signs that RSV cases are slowing in the southern region of the US, but test positivity rates and cases continue to rise in other regions, especially the Midwest. And pediatric hospitals remain more full than average with RSV patients and other conditions. According to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds and pediatric ICU beds are currently in use nationwide, compared with an average of about two-thirds full over the past two years. As of Friday, seventeen states have less than one in five beds available. Five of them are more than 90% full: Rhode Island, Arizona, Maine, Minnesota and Delaware, along with Washington, DC. Vaccination is the best protection Romero stressed that with holiday gatherings just around the corner, vaccination is the best protection against these infections. “We have vaccines for two of the three viruses we talked about influenza, and COVID 19,” he said, and he urged Americans to take advantage of them, though not enough have. According to the CDC’s data tracker, just 8.4% of eligible Americans have received a new updated Covid-19 booster.

F-glycoproteins allow the virus to fuse with and infect human cells. NIAID Treatment approved in Europe to prevent RSV in infants could be coming to the US soon Vaccinations are lower than usual for influenza, too. Based on data from insurance claims, adult flu vaccinations are down about 5 million compared to where they were last year at the same time, said Lynnette Brammer, who leads surveillance for the CDC’s influenza division. For children, coverage looks about the same as last year, but those levels represent a 6% drop from what flu vaccinations in kids looked like before the pandemic, Brammer said. Romero stressed that while most adults only need a single annual influenza vaccine, children who are being vaccinated against the flu for the first time need two shots. He also advised people not to try to guess what they had based on their symptoms alone since many of these viruses can cause similar symptoms.

Going to the doctor for a test as as soon as you start to feel bad could help you take advantage of early antiviral treatments which are available for influenza and Covid-19. Romero said the CDC was preparing to send doctors more information about who should qualify for these test-to-treat strategies. In addition to vaccination, Romero reminded people to cover their coughs and sneezes, avoid other individuals who are sick, wash hands frequently and use alcohol-based hand sanitizers. “People who also may also choose to wear a well-fitting mask as an added precaution,” Romero said.

Cold and flu season is almost here Spot the symptoms, and learn to tell the difference between illnesses Written by Parenting Services November 3, 2022 7 min read HOME / Parenting A fever is one sign of the flu or COVID-19, so check your child's temperature and other symptoms to figure out what to do next. (Photo by Getty Images) Cold and flu season is just around the corner. A common question parents ask is, “Is this a cold, the flu or COVID-19?” Cold, flu or COVID-19? Pay attention to the symptoms your child shows. Monitor your child for a few days and document whether your child’s condition is getting worse. If it’s getting worse, what you thought was a cold may actually be influenza or COVID-19. The onset. Sudden onset is associated with influenza. If the illness came on slowly, it may be a common cold. COVID-19 can cause a rapid or gradual onset of symptoms. Fever. Flu and COVID-19 often cause a high fever, whereas a cold may produce a mild fever or no fever. Fatigue. A cold can cause mild exhaustion. The flu and COVID-19 may cause severe exhaustion. Body aches. A common cold doesn’t usually come with body aches. The flu and COVID-19 may cause your child to feel achy all over. There’s really only one way to tell the difference between the flu, a cold and COVID-19: Get tested for COVID-19. At-home COVID-19 tests are a convenient and accurate option. Find a test at your local pharmacy or retailer. A negative test can indicate that a cold or the flu is behind your child’s symptoms. Meet Mr. Flu In the U.S., flu season runs from October to May. Flu symptoms usually begin about two days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of appetite, cough, sore throat, weakness, ear pain, nausea and diarrhea (more common in children). Flu symptoms can last about five days and should be gone within a week or two. It’s important to take influenza seriously as it can lead to pneumonia or other life-threatening complications. The flu is contagious. It’s spread by droplets that are coughed or sneezed into the air. They can be inhaled or picked up on common surfaces. The flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months old and older. The vaccine isn’t a guarantee against getting the flu, but it may result in fewer or milder flu symptoms. Say hello to Mr. Cold Kids can get eight or more colds per year. Symptoms of colds can be similar to the flu, but there are some key differences. Cold symptoms include sneezing, cough, sore or itchy throat, runny or stuffy nose and watery eyes. In some cases, people may have a fever, muscle or body aches and fatigue. Colds are contagious and are spread by a sneeze or cough or touching a contaminated surface. Cold symptoms show up within two to three days after exposure to the virus and can last up to two weeks. Get to know Mr. COVID-19 Generally, kids experience milder cases of COVID-19, although they should still take precautions. It can take longer for people to show symptoms of COVID-19 compared to the flu with symptoms starting up to 14 days after they were exposed. It can also cause more serious illnesses in high-risk groups, like seniors or people with immune system disorders. COVID-19 can cause all the same symptoms as a cold or the flu, but sneezing is less common. Additional symptoms can include new loss of taste or smell and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. COVID-19 spreads more easily than the flu. People infected with COVID-19 are also contagious for longer. COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets. A sick person exhales infectious droplets when they breathe, talk or cough. Everyone 6 months old and older should receive the COVID-19 vaccine and booster when eligible. The vaccine helps protect your health and the health of those around you. Talk to your provider about how many doses you and your child should get. Prevent the spread Get your child vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19 if they’re 6 months old or older. Wash hands often with soap and warm water, especially before and after eating, using the bathroom, coughing or sneezing. Use a clean tissue to pick up used tissues and never share cups or eating utensils. Keep your child home from school or day care when they’re sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. If needed, cough or sneeze into your upper arm, not your hands. Teach your child this technique. If you have further questions or concerns, contact your child’s provider. Learn more Is it a cold or RSV?

San Diego-based Arcturus Therapeutics signed a strategic collaboration and licensing deal with CSL Seqirus. Under the deal, Arcturus will offer CSL a license to its mRNA technology, LUNAR and STARR, to help develop and commercialize vaccines. Under the terms of the agreement, CSL Seqirus is licensing Arcturus’ STARR self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) technology, LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery and manufacturing expertise for mRNA drug substances and drug products. CSL Seqirus will handle the development and commercialization of the vaccines. The two companies will work to advance vaccines against COVID-19, influenza, pandemic preparedness and three other common respiratory infectious diseases. CSL will pay Arcturus $200 million upfront in the deal. Arcturus will be eligible for more than $1.3 billion in development milestone payments and more than $3 billion in commercial milestones. Arcturus is also eligible for a 40% net profit share for COVID-19 vaccine products and up to double-digit royalties for the other potential products. A CSL Seqirus spokesperson told BioSpace that while its focus is still on influenza, this agreement will allow it to expand into other areas. “This includes the near-term entry into COVID-19 vaccines with differentiated, next-generation mRNA technology, and the potential development of vaccines against other respiratory pathogens, including those with pandemic potential, all of which will help us achieve our future vision to become a global vaccines leader,” the spokesperson said. How the Technology Works LUNAR is a proprietary lipid-mediated nucleic acid delivery system. It leverages the company’s library of more than 250 proprietary lipids, which can be formulated to act as vectors for messenger RNA vaccines. The STARR technology platform combines self-amplifying mRNA with LUNAR to act as a single solution to manufacture proteins in the body. Arcturus’s mRNA design would allow for smaller doses of vaccines than the mRNA vaccines developed by Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech. Arcturus’ approach also leverages a freeze-drying process that allows the vaccines to be stored at room temperature, then rehydrated. This would offer significantly simpler and more convenient vaccine transport and cold-chain storage than the conventional mRNA vaccines to date. CSL is a leader in producing influenza vaccines globally, with manufacturing facilities in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. It recently opened a new facility in Waltham, Mass. In early October, CSL reported preclinical results from its sa-mRNA influenza vaccine candidate. The data demonstrated the potential of the technology to offer protection against pandemic and seasonal influenza in a single vaccine dose. On Aug. 31, Arcturus reported that the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority had awarded it up to $63.2 million to fund the development of an sa-mRNA vaccine for rapid pandemic influenza response. The funds will support preclinical, manufacturing and nonclinical safety studies, as well as development and regulatory support for more than three years through Phase I clinical trials.

Study: Coinfection by influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus produces hybrid virus particles. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock Background Intracellular pathogens such as viruses generally exhibit tropism, where they show affinity towards selected cell types. Some cells and tissues can be coinfected by taxonomically different viruses since diverse viruses can have an affinity for the same cell type. Coinfections provide an ecological niche for viruses to interact with each other. These interactions include pseudotyping, where surface proteins from one virus are incorporated into the other virus, or they could result in genomic rearrangements which could give rise to completely new strains with increased infection potential. While some studies claim that disease outcomes are independent of coinfections, others indicate an increase in severe outcomes due to coinfections. However, the mechanisms of viral interactions during coinfections that determine disease outcomes remain unclear. About the study In the present study, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (HEp-2) were used to grow virus stocks of hemagglutinin 1 neuraminidase 1 (H1N1) IAV and RSV strain A2, respectively. Cultured human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were infected with IAV and RSV individually and synchronously at high multiplicity of infection (MOI). Plaque assays were used to determine infectious titers of IAV and RSV in MDCK and HEp-2 cells, respectively. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to assess single and coinfected cells to determine the effect of coinfections on viral protein localization and infected cell proportions. Virions with IAV haemagglutinin and RSV fusion glycoprotein immunolabels were examined using super-resolution confocal microscopy to determine whether the mixing of the two viral glycoproteins resulted in the budding viral particles incorporating components of IAV and RSV. Additionally, cryo-electron tomography was performed to investigate the structural characteristics of the RSV and IAV filaments budding from the coinfected cells. Furthermore, since hybrid viral particles would contain surface glycoproteins of both RSV and IAV, antibodies against the IAV haemagglutinin and RSV fusion glycoprotein were used in neutralization assays against IAV and RSV viruses collected from cells infected individually and synchronously. The cellular receptor for IAV, sialic acid, was removed using neuraminidase, and the cells were inoculated with IAV and RSV viruses from individually infected or coinfected cells to determine whether incorporation of RSV glycoproteins could expand the IAV receptor tropism of hybrid viral particles. Cells were immunostained for the IAV and RSV nucleoproteins and quantified. Additionally, human bronchial epithelial cells were coinfected with RSV and IAV, and paraffin-embedded infected cultures were immunostained for IAV haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein and the whole RSV virion to determine whether other relevant biological systems formed hybrid viral particles. Results The results reported that in coinfected cells, IAV titers were equal to or marginally higher and the RSV titers were lower than cells individually infected with the two viruses. In contrast, in cells coinfected with IAV and rhinovirus, IAV replication was inhibited. This suggested that coinfection outcomes were dependent on the type of viruses involved and the subsequent virus-specific cellular responses.

These hybrid viral particles exhibited evasion of IAV-targeted neutralization and the ability to infect neuraminidase-treated IAV receptor-negative cells, indicating modified antigenicity and wide tropism characteristics. Neutralization assay using anti-RSV glycoprotein antibodies showed that the entry of hybrid viral particles into cells is mediated by the RSV fusion glycoprotein, which suggested that IAV could recruit an unrelated viral glycoprotein as the functional envelope protein. Although IAV infections are generally restricted to the upper respiratory tracts, hybrid viral particles with structural and functional components of both viruses could enable IAV infections in the lower respiratory tract regions. These results are indicative of the potential increase in pathogenicity and disease severity, and complications such as viral pneumonia. Additionally, since IAV experiences high mutation rates, hybrid viral particles infecting the lower respiratory tract could result in the selection of viral particles with increased pathogenesis and greater tropism for the lower regions of the respiratory tract. The results also showed that hybrid viral particles were maintained over multiple infection rounds, and aided the spread of IAV into refractory cell populations. Coinfection of human bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the formation of hybrid viral particles in biologically relevant tissues and indicated that since IAV and RSV both circulate during the same season and share tropism for ciliated epithelial cells, the probability of coinfections and in vivo generation of hybrid viral particles is high. Conclusions Overall, the study demonstrated that coinfections by RSV and IAV form hybrid viral particles that exhibit modified antigenicity and expanded tropism, and suggested the possibility of other such hybrid viral particle formations from coinfections involving pleomorphic enveloped viruses such as RSV. The authors believe that while hybrid viral particle formation is dependent on various factors other than structural compatibilities, such as overlaps in circulation season and geography and tropism, coinfections pose the risk of hybrid virus particles with wide tropism and increased immune evasion.

He also warned that COVID-19 hasn't disappeared, with a rate that has now leveled off after decreasing the last few months.Over the past several weeks, activity involving other viruses has increased, though with notable differences by region. For example, southern states are reporting flu test positivity rates as high as 20%, mostly involving H3N2, a subtype known to cause more severe illness in young children and seniors.Meanwhile, the Middle Atlantic and Midwestern states are seeing rises in 2009 H1N1 activity.He said RSV, like flu, is more likely to be serious in younger children and seniors. Virus levels are increasing in all regions except those that include the Southeast and South Central states, areas that were the first to rises from flu.Romero said RSV activity is declining in the northwestern region that includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.The CDC today also issued a Health Alert Network notice to health providers that covered protocols for diagnosis, testing, and prevention.Federal health officials today urged people to get vaccinated against flu and COVID to avoid illness and a burden on hospitals, especially with the holidays right around the corner. Given that the different diseases have similar symptoms, Romero urged parents to look for warning signs that children need immediate medical care, including fast or difficult breathing, bluish lips, chest pain, muscle pain, and dehydration.Flu vaccine uptake numbers are running behind for most groups, except for children.The officials also recommended other steps, including frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, wearing a well-fitted mask for extra protection, and seeking early access to antiviral treatment for flu.Dawn O'Connell, JD, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said officials are tracking hospitalization trends and medical supply chain status. She added that regions currently seeing the biggest impacts are in the Middle Atlantic, New England, and Washington state regionsSupplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators are still available. Though hospitals in some states are under pressure, none have requested supplies. "But we stand by ready to help," she said.Flu markers show steady riseIn its weekly update on flu activity today, the CDC reported another steady rise in indictors, noting that levels are highest in the Southeast and South Central regions, followed by states in the Middle Atlantic and south-central West Coast regions.The percentage of respiratory specimens that were positive for flu jumped from 6.2% to 9% last week, and the percentage of clinic visits for flulike illness—which can also reflect impact from other respiratory viruses—rose to 4.3% last week, keeping it well above the 2.5% national baseline. Eleven states reported very high flu activity, while eight reported high activity. Most are in the south and southeastern regions.At public health labs, 66.3% of subtyped influenza A samples were H3N2, and 33.8% were H1N1.The hospitalization rate last week for this point in the flu season was at the highest level since the 2010-2011 flu season. Levels are highest in seniors and children up to age 4. The CDC reported its second pediatric flu death of the season, which occurred last week and involved H3N2.COVID decline slows, variant proportions shift furtherIn its weekly summary on COVID-19 activity today, the CDC said the decline in COVID cases and hospitalizations has slowed in recent weeks. It said as of Nov 2, the 7-day average for new daily cases was 39,016, up 4.7% compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, the 7-day average for new hospitalizations declined 1%, while the 7-day average for deaths decreased 3% compared the week before.In the CDC's latest variant proportion estimates today, the Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 combined made up 35.3% of sequences. In CDC region 2, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 made up an estimated 52% of infections.Meanwhile, the BA.5 showed another steady drop, declining from 50.8% to 39.2%.So far, 26.38 million Americans have received the updated bivalent COVID-19 booster, but the CDC said only 49.1% of the eligible population has yet to receive any booster doses.

Find out about the lifting of mandatory housing measures. Mandatory housing measures for all poultry and captive birds are to be introduced to all areas of England from 00:01 on Monday 7 November, following a decision by the United Kingdom’s Chief Veterinary Officer. The housing measures legally require all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors and to follow stringent biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the disease, regardless of type or size. The order will extend the mandatory housing measures already in force in the hot spot area of Suffolk, Norfolk and parts of Essex to the whole of England following an increase in the national risk of bird flu in wild birds to very high. Over the last year, the United Kingdom has faced its largest ever outbreak of avian influenza with over 200 cases confirmed since late October 2021. The introduction of the housing measures comes after the disease was detected at over 70 premises since the beginning of October, as well as multiple reports in wild birds. The Chief Veterinary Officer is now encouraging all bird keepers across England to use the week to prepare, including taking steps to safeguard animal welfare, consult their private vet and expand housing where necessary. The United Kingdom’s Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: We are now facing this year, the largest ever outbreak of bird flu and are seeing rapid escalation in the number of cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds across England. The risk of kept birds being exposed to disease has reached a point where it is now necessary for all birds to be housed until further notice. Scrupulous biosecurity and separating flocks in all ways, from wild birds remain the best form of defence. Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from Monday 7 November onwards you must keep your indoors. This decision has not been taken lightly, but is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease. Evidence shows that housing birds reduces the risk of kept birds being infected with bird flu. However, housing alone will not protect birds and all keepers must still follow the other enhanced biosecurity measures mandated by the AIPZ at all times to protect their flocks and prevent the risk of future outbreaks which is circulating in wild birds. Housing combined with stringent biosecurity measures can provide even greater reduction in risk. The new housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) earlier this month. The AIPZ means that all bird keepers need to take extra precautions, such as restricting access for non-essential people on site, ensuring workers change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and cleaning and disinfecting vehicles regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading. The UK Health Security Agency continue to advise that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency advice remains unchanged, that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Further Information: Biosecurity guidance and a biosecurity self-assessment checklist have been published by Defra to assist all bird keepers in instigating and maintaining good biosecurity. Further updates on the latest avian influenza situation, can be found via GOV.UK/bird-flu The addition of housing measures to the AIPZ already in force across England means all bird keepers across England must: housing or netting all poultry and captive birds cleanse and disinfect clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and use effective vermin control keep records of mortality, movement of poultry and poultry products and any changes in production thoroughly cleanse and disinfect housing on a continuous basis keep fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all farm and poultry housing entry and exit points minimise direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds prevent access by poultry to ponds and watercourses and ensure that birds are kept in fenced or enclosed areas Share this page The following links open in a new tab Share on Facebook (opens in new tab) Share on Twitter (opens in new tab) Updates to this page Published 31 October 2022 Related content Bird flu (avian influenza): poster for bird keepers APHA animal disease alert subscription service Avian influenza (bird flu) in Europe, Russia and the UK Notifiable avian disease control strategy Explore the topic Animal and plant health Is this page useful?

Region 6, where Texas is located, has a 5% positive test rate. Dr. Berk, dean of the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center School of Medicine, said that around 40,000 of people die from the flu each year across the country, adding it's a threat that should be taken seriously.“The best time to get the influenza vaccine is just before the influenza season occurs and that is in November," he said. "So this is a time to start."He said he strongly urges young, healthy people to get the vaccine so they don’t spread it to those who have underlying health conditions or are in the older population.“The one new thing about the influenza vaccine that everybody's talking about is that there's a strong recommendation now that individuals over 65 years of age, get this special influenza vaccine, which essentially is stronger and will give more protection,” Berk said.This new vaccine is called a quadrivalent vaccine, Berk said. It contains four strains of the flu vaccine identified by the CDC and the World Health Organization to be the worst strains this year. According to the CDC, the quadrivalent vaccine contains an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus and two different lineages of influenza B.With the COVID-19 pandemic still prevalent today, Dr. Berk said it is unknown how this year's flu will interact with COVID-19.“People who are having COVID-19 symptoms, they probably even more than the next person need to get an influenza vaccine,” Berk said. Currently, CVS and Walgreens are offering free flu shots. United Supermarkets pharmacies, including Market Street locations, and several other local pharmacies are also offering the flu vaccine.Flu vaccines at United pharmaciesWith health experts anticipating a severe flu season on top of a winter surge in COVID, pharmacy teams across The United Family are gearing up with plenty of vaccines for communities.In Texas and New Mexico, pharmacy teams at United Supermarkets, Market Street, Albertsons Market and Amigos are now equipped to administer flu vaccines along with the newly updated booster vaccines — which target the Ba.4 and Ba.5 Omicron subvariants, as well as the original virus, according to a news release from United.“The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-variant,” said Tim Purser, director of pharmacy for The United Family. “With the prediction of a bad flu season, we made sure we are stocked up and ready to serve guests across all of our communities.”Along with the CDC, United Family pharmacists recommend that adults receive both the flu and bivalent COVID booster, which can be safely co-administered in one visit. Pharmacies will be offering extra hours as well as walk-in appointments to help accommodate guests’ needs.As has been the case, all COVID-19 vaccines and boosters will be available to eligible guests at no cost. The seasonal flu shot is typically free through most insurance providers, but has an out-of-pocket cost for those without insurance. In addition to the flu and COVID-19 vaccines, guests will have access to vaccines for Shingles, Tetanus, Pneumonia, HPC, Meningitis, Hep A, Hep B and more.Pharmacists will only require a guest’s I.D. card and insurance card at the time of the shot. Guests can either walk-in, call to make an appointment or use the newly updated online scheduler to make an appointment at the location of their choosing. This scheduler can be used for all vaccines offered through the pharmacy.

Sarah Newey Global Health Security Correspondent 31 October 2022 6:00pm GMT The virus incubates silently within its host for between two and eight days. Once symptoms emerge, victims quickly lose their balance and many become blind. Death is most commonly caused by necrosis of the spleen and pancreas, and typically occurs within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. The fatality rate is over 90 per cent and the reproduction, or “R,” rate can exceed 100.“When the disease takes hold, there’s nothing you can do,” said Mark Gorton, who has seen more than 100,000 deaths in the last month alone. “You can’t give them medicine, you can’t give them extra bedding or make them a bit warmer. There’s nothing you can do and it’s absolutely soul destroying”.So worrying is the speed and scale of the outbreak that on Monday ministers announced a “mandatory national housing order” – or lockdown – in a bid to slow the UK epidemic down ahead of Christmas. It mirrors a compulsory housing order introduced between November 2021 and May 2022, which some critics say was lifted too early.For the moment, at least, this latest disease outbreak is thankfully almost entirely confined to avian populations. Nevertheless, it has been devastating to many.Mr Gorton, the founder of Traditional Norfolk Poultry, has witnessed the death of 10 per cent of his free range organic chickens and turkeys. “Every night is a sleepless night,” he told The Telegraph. “It’s a very, very worrying time.”Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief veterinary officer, confirmed his view when announcing the lockdown on Monday. “We are now facing, this year, the largest ever outbreak of bird flu and are seeing rapid escalation in the number of cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds across England,” she said. “The risk of kept birds being exposed to disease has reached a point where it is now necessary for all birds to be housed until further notice.” bird flu map The disease ravaging UK wild bird and poultry populations is a form of bird flu known as Avian H5N1. An estimated 2.8 million farmed birds (including chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon, partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants) have been culled in the past 12 months as part of an unprecedented global pandemic.In continental Europe alone there have been at least 2,467 outbreaks in poultry farms, leading to 48m birds being culled, according to the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC). Globally, the picture is worse still. Between October 2021 and September 2022, 112m birds died or were culled, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. “It’s bad, that’s the only word,” said Prof Sjaack de Wit, a professor in global poultry health. “This year it’s exploding, not only in poultry, but in wild birds”. Global poultry deaths from culling and sickness But what of the impact on us humans? How might the avian flu pandemic impact food supplies and prices, not least at Christmas? And what are the risks to people? The World Health Organisation (WHO) has long warned that a bird flu that jumps to humans represents the biggest single pandemic risk we face. Does the dramatic spread of H5N1 in birds around the world herald the possible start of the human bird flu pandemic so long feared?A bird-free ChristmasExperts say, as they are prone to do, that there is no cause for panic.While your bird of choice may not be available this Christmas at its normal price point, or perhaps it will arrive frozen, the risk to human health appears limited for the moment at least.Richard Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Poultry Council, told the BBC the “free range side of the sector has been heavily hit”, and that “30-35 per cent” of free range poultry had already been killed by the virus or culled because of it.Mr Griffiths added that he was pushing the government to change the marketing rules for poultry so turkeys could be frozen now while healthy and, after being defrosted, sold as “fresh” for Christmas.“It’s a flexibility we’ve asked for this year – it allows people to get started [packaging] early,” he said. “Essentially remove birds from the risk of avian influenza and make sure more of them are getting to Christmas.”The price of poultry has already been rising fast and the trend, say experts, is likely to continue. “The cost of production is increasing due to both disease outbreaks and feed prices, [which affects] the livelihood of farmers as well as affordability for customers,” said Prof Munir Iqbal, head of the Avian Influenza Virus group at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey. “The price of both poultry meat and eggs has significantly increased in the UK and other countries.” Steve Childerhouse has warned turkeys might be short supply this Christmas Credit: Tom Maddick / SWNS Culling remains the only option to vets and farmers once the disease gets a hold in a poultry flock Credit: GLYN KIRK /AFP Steve Childerhouse, 51, who rears turkeys on a 35-acre production unit in Norfolk, said producers had been “absolutely hammered” by the outbreak and warned that families may struggle to get hold of turkeys and geese this winter as the usual stock levels are “just not going to be there”.“We are a traditional fresh farm, but even the big people are getting absolutely hammered by this. It's affecting the whole industry,” he said. “We supply a lot of butchers and farm shops, and we've told them we haven't got any. They're not selling any turkeys or geese this Christmas as they can't get them.”Human riskAlthough H5N1 does not spread rapidly in humans, it is not just birds that the current strain of the virus has been found in.Mutations in the virus have allowed it to infect a very broad range of bird species but also many other mammals including dolphins and porpoises, cats and dogs, foxes and skunks, and even tigers.In humans, too, there have been infections and deaths. Since 2003, close to 2,500 people have been infected with one of the four bird flu strains known to affect humans.This includes the Devon duck keeper, Alan Gosling, who in January became the first (and so far only) person in Britain to contract the current strain of H5N1. A total of 864 human cases of H5N1 have been reported to the World Health Organization since 2003, with 456 human deaths recorded, giving an estimated fatality rate of about 50 per cent. The H5N1 'Bird Flu' Pandemic in Numbers A second bird flu strain – H7N9 – has impacted an even greater number of people: 1,568 have caught this virus and 616 have died since 2013. Two further strains, H5N6 and H5N8, have infected around 38 and seven people, respectively. “We know the virus can infect mammals, can infect humans, but currently it doesn’t seem to be circulating within these groups,” said Dr John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London. Dr McCauley said he believed the risk of the H5N1 adapting to spread rapidly in humans was “low” but noted that the more interactions there were between humans and birds infected with the virus the more likely it was that the virus might adapt. “If there is an awful lot of virus around… then you are increasing the likelihood that it will find its way to adapt to humans. And then it just requires a couple more evolutionary steps to spread more widely,” he said.“We can just hope… that this is a one-year or two-year epidemic in birds that naturally runs its course.”BirdicideVaccines exist for H5N1 but giving them to infected animals is not seen as practical by the government and other experts; quite apart from the logistics involved in inoculating millions of birds, the vaccines currently available do not fully prevent transmission of the virus.Culling then remains the only option to vets and farmers once the disease gets a hold in a poultry flock. When a case is detected, government workers kitted out in hazmat suits are brought in to kill birds in their tens of thousands. A former farm worker from Norfolk, who asked to remain anonymous, described how the birds used to be marched into electrocuted water when a cull was confirmed. These days, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) say they euthanise birds with carbon dioxide gas or nitrogen-infused foam. The National Trust team of rangers clear deceased birds from Staple Island Credit: Owen Humphreys /PA But culling birds is far from easy. “The situation in Norfolk is completely out of control. The sheer scale means APHP and Defra’s resources are completely and utterly stretched beyond capacity,” said Mr Gorton last week.“We cannot get information about what we need to do to the farms, in terms of cleaning and disinfecting. We can’t get vets out. Everything is really slow and delayed.” For wild birds, the impacts are no less nightmarish. Seabirds – including great skuas and gannets – have been worst hit in outbreaks across the UK, from the Farne Islands in Northumberland and Bass Rock in Scotland to the Norfolk coast. It’s hard to put a figure on the death count in the wild bird population, said Jeff Knott, director of policy and advocacy for the RSPB, because only a “tiny percentage” of birds get tested, but it’s likely that “hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of birds have been affected”. “It’s serious because many species were already not doing that well,” he added. “We’re seriously worried about the potential for global extinction for species including the great skua. If that were to happen, it would be the first time… since the nineteenth century.” Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health Death by stigma: The HIV patients in Malawi refusing life-saving medication What is mpox?

Archive / Daily Listin Santo Domingo, DR The lungs are observed to be more affected in patients with influenza who come to seek medical attention in the country. This was revealed to Listín Diario by pulmonologist Evangelina Soler, who explained that the disease affects the population of all ages but with greater emphasis on children and most adults. She said that compared to 2020 and 2021, this year, there has been a significant increase in cases of influenza in the Dominican population, which she attributes to the fact that in those two previous years, people used masks to protect themselves from Covid-19 and this year they stopped using them. “In the behavior of the virus, we see different from the years prior to the pandemic is that the cases are with greater pulmonary affection, and there is a higher incidence of cases of people with the virus,” said the former specialist president of the Dominican Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery. The fact, she added, that during those two years, the population was not vaccinated against the virus may be contributing to a more significant increase in the number of cases of influenza. Earlier Another big difference we have observed is that previously the highest number of influenza cases occurred between November, December, January, and February; this significant increase has been observed since October. He recalled that influenza manifests itself with fever, headache and body aches, general malaise, and dry cough; patients are presenting diarrhea or retro ocular pain and compromised upper airways. Occasionally, he said, influenza symptoms are also associated with pneumonia outbreaks. He urged the most at-risk population to vaccinate and protect themselves to avoid contagion. The country has available the vaccine against seasonal influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and type B influenza in fixed vaccination posts, which began to be applied on October 10. The vaccination is being directed to groups at higher risk of complications in case of infection by the virus, such as the elderly, children under two years of age, pregnant women, health workers, and people with primary diseases. The State has 475 thousand doses which are applied free of charge. Up to the beginning of the week, 53,524 doses of seasonal influenza vaccines had been administered, with the population over 65 years of age being the most vaccinated. The cases of children with flu increased three times more in the last weeks, had revealed in October by the president of the Association of Clinics and Private Hospitals (Andeclip), Rafael Mena. 0 0 votes Article Rating Subscribe Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Label {} [+] Name* Email* Website Δ Label {} [+] Name* Email* Website Δ 0 Comments Inline Feedbacks View all comments COVID-19 November 9, 2024 | 8:34 am26 cases of leptospirosis registered in one monthIn the last four weeks, the country reported 26 probable cases of leptospirosis, a...November 9, 2024 | 8:00 amMore changes in hospitals, three new directorsNational Territory—Mario Lama, the director of the National Health Service (SNS), swore in three...November 4, 2024 | 8:20 amAuthorities dismantle counterfeit medicine operationSanto Domingo.- The Dominican Public Ministry, in collaboration with the National Police, CECCOM, and...November 2, 2024 | 8:37 amRespiratory problems affect children and adultsNational Territory – Several types of respiratory viruses circulate in the Dominican Republic, affecting...November 1, 2024 | 8:11 amPublic Health intensifies malaria control effortsSanto Domingo.- The Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Public Health (MSP) is intensifying its malaria...October 30, 2024 | 4:52 pmPro Consumidor grants 30-day extension for removing sun-exposed water bottlesSanto Domingo.- The National Institute for the Protection of Consumer Rights (Pro Consumidor) has...

READ MORE: Farmers say cover crops are on 40% of cropland The discovery at the chicken farm comes just over a week after Mexico reported its first-ever case of H5N1 avian influenza, or bird flu, to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). The disease was detected when Mexico's agri-food health service tested samples from a farm in Montemorelos, Nuevo Leon, after a producer there raised concerns, Mexico's agricultural ministry said in a statement. A quarantine has been declared and an unspecified number of birds will be euthanized to control the outbreak, the ministry said. It did not say how many birds were infected. Mexico's first case of the virus was detected in a wild bird in the Metepec district to the west of capital Mexico City. Another H5N1 case was found in a wild bird in Tijuana in Baja California state, Mexico's agriculture ministry said, as well as in a 186-chicken, family-run farm in Chiapas in the country's south. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has killed poultry in the United States and Europe, with experts concerned the virus did not abate this year as it has previously done during the northern hemisphere summer.

The British government said on Monday the mandatory measures would be introduced from midnight on November 7. This is the largest-ever outbreak of avian flu in the UK, with 200 confirmed cases in the past 12 months.Bird keepers will be required to disinfect clothing and equipment, and keep mortality records. (Reuters: Peter Nicholls)The mandatory housing order will extend measures already in force in parts of eastern England to the whole nation, following an increase in the risk of bird flu in wild birds to "very high", the government said in a statement.Bird keepers will be required to follow stringent biosecurity measures including disinfecting clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles and keeping mortality records."We are now facing this year, the largest ever outbreak of bird flu and are seeing rapid escalation in the number of cases on commercial farms and in backyard birds across England," UK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said."The risk of kept birds being exposed to disease has reached a point where it is now necessary for all birds to be housed until further notice."In the same statement, the UK Health Security Agency said it continued to advise that the risk to public health from the virus was very low.What is bird flu?Bird flu is caused by a handful of influenza viruses, just like the seasonal flu that circulates each winter.What are the symptoms of bird flu in poultry?Sudden deathDifficulty breathing, such as coughing, sneezing, or raspingSwelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb, wattles and neckRapid drop in eating, drinking and egg productionRuffled feathers, dopiness, closed eyesDiarrhoeaBut while seasonal flu infections rise in cool weather and spread easily in human populations, bird flu is transmitted only between animals or from animals to humans.Larger birds, such as ducks and geese, tend to ferry bird flu viruses around the world, said Frank Wong, a CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory microbiologist and World Organisation for Animal Health reference expert for highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza.However, if smaller migratory birds such as shorebirds are infected with bird flu, they're more likely to delay their migration, or not set out on their journey at all.Larger birds, such as ducks and geese, tend to ferry bird flu viruses around the world. (Reuters: Ronen Zvulun)"When the birds congregate [to feed and breed] … mixing of birds also results in mixing of viruses, including influenza viruses. Then when the birds fly south or westwards for the winter, they carry those viruses with them," Dr Wong said. "If those wild birds interact with domestic birds, the viruses they're carrying might spill over and cause outbreaks in domestic poultry."What's the bird flu situation in Australia?Australia is in a pretty safe place when it comes to bird flu.There have been only eight outbreaks of the disease in Australia since the 1970s, with the biggest happening in Victoria last year.Unlike Europe and Asia, Australia has no large waterfowl seasonal migrations from abroad, which bring in new viruses each year, Dr Wong said.Australia also has stringent controls around how poultry is shuttled into and around the country.Among other biosecurity measures, local regulations state that poultry farms cannot be located near lakes or other bodies of water."In Australia, we don't want these viruses around, so regardless of if it's a low-pathogenic strain or a high-pathogenic strain, depopulation is the way to go," said Ricardo Soares Magalhães, associate professor in population health and biosecurity at the UQ School of Veterinary Science.What is depopulation and how does it work?Depopulation — or culling — may seem an extreme measure, but the disease can quickly cause debilitation and death, especially if it's a highly pathogenic strain."The best strategy from an animal welfare perspective is to depopulate the flock," Dr Soares Magalhães said."That happens on a radius of 3 kilometres around the affected zone, and then we impose a surveillance zone out to another 7km."Because some bird flu subtypes have been known to infect humans, any culling or depopulation is conducted in full PPE. (Kyodo/via Reuters)How do humans get bird flu?For a human to get bird flu, they need direct contact with infected birds, or contaminated feathers or faeces.It can't be passed on by eating eggs or cooked meat.So far, there's been very little human-to-human bird flu transmission, but that doesn't mean new strains won't gain that ability, Dr Soares Magalhães said."COVID [which probably originated in bats] is a good example of that."Avian Influenza H5N1 virus particles (depicted in gold), grown in kidney cells (green), as seen using an electron microscope.

No, the flu is not more deadly than COVID Meg Williams November 1, 2022 WHAT WAS CLAIMED COVID-19 always had a greater survival rate than influenza. OUR VERDICT False. COVID has a higher mortality rate than influenza, data shows. An Australian protester claims that COVID has always had a greater survival rate than influenza. The claim is false. Experts told AAP FactCheck that the opposite is true: so far, COVID has always had a higher mortality rate than the flu. The claim was made in a Facebook video by a man at a protest for “Australian neutrality with Russia”. In the video, a man being interviewed says: “COVID always had a survival rate greater than influenza. It is a less dangerous virus than influenza” (video mark 2min 30sec). David Muscatello, associate professor in infectious diseases epidemiology at the UNSW Sydney, told AAP FactCheck via email: “COVID has never had a survival rate greater than flu. COVID has already killed more Australians in the first half of this year than a severe influenza season.” There were 6651 COVID deaths in Australia from January 2022 to July 2022, but only 252 flu deaths. For the entire year of 2017, a particularly severe flu season, there were 1255 deaths due to influenza. There were 6651 COVID deaths in Australia from January 2022 to July 2022, but only 252 flu deaths Prof Muscatello also pointed to the latest excess deaths figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), showing that, within only the first half of this year, there were more than 13,000 excess deaths in Australia. By contrast, “the most recent pre-pandemic year in which we saw many excess deaths for Australia was 2017, with an estimated 6,400 additional deaths for the whole year,” Prof Muscatello said, drawing upon his recent study. “In 2019, the estimate was 5,200. These were severe influenza seasons.” Allen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University and director of the Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology unit at Alfred Health, also said the claim was false. “The short answer is that COVID has always had a higher mortality than influenza, except in very young children,” he told AAP FactCheck in an email. Prof Cheng said there had been considerable excess mortality in 2022 associated with COVID, with the virus causing at least five times as many deaths in the first half of the year as deaths attributed to the flu in 2017, “even with widespread vaccination and Omicron.” He added: “So, even when we compare 2017 flu deaths (considered to be a particularly bad flu year) with 2022 post-vaccine and post-Omicron COVID deaths, the COVID mortality is higher in Australia.” Prof Cheng noted many government health departments have been reporting excess mortality, which can account for deaths that may be indirectly related to the pandemic. The figures suggest that COVID mortality is “much larger than anything we have experienced before, with the exception of the 1918 influenza pandemic”. He said mortality rates can be one of several measures, including infection-fatality rate (proportion of deaths among all infected individuals) and case-fatality rate (proportion of deaths among all confirmed cases). Historically only a minority of patients with flu were diagnosed but for COVID more have been tested These are two distinct measures but they are sometimes conflated, leading to confusion about how COVID mortality compares with influenza mortality. “Historically, only a minority of patients with influenza were diagnosed, so the case-fatality ratio… far overestimates the true infection-fatality ratio,” Prof Cheng said. “For COVID, many more people with infection are tested, so the case fatality is closer (but still an overestimate) to the infection fatality ratio.” There is a risk of overestimating the true influenza IFR by only using the CFR. However, an article in The Conversation suggests the COVID CFR has still been greater than the influenza CFR in Australia since the beginning of the pandemic. Evidence also suggests that COVID has consistently had higher mortality rates than influenza globally. In a 2019 press release, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated there are one billion influenza cases and 290,000 to 650,000 influenza deaths per year. By contrast, there have been at least 630,000,000 COVID cases and more than 6,580,000 COVID deaths at the time of writing – a higher proportion of deaths-to-cases than the WHO’s annual estimate for the flu, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. According to Health Feedback, which debunked a similar claim in 2021, the majority of studies found the COVID IFR was higher than that of the flu. A December 2020 study about age-specific COVID fatality rates concluded that, while influenza mortality is usually below 0.1 per cent, the COVID IFR at the time was 0.4 per cent at age 55, 1.4 per cent at age 65, 4.6 per cent at age 75 and 15 per cent at age 85. For young adults and children, the IFR was generally below 0.01 per cent. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics said that “annually, deaths due to COVID have been higher than those due to flu and pneumonia in any year since 1929”. Over the course of the pandemic, a wide range of false claims about COVID and the flu have been debunked (see here, here, here, here, and here). AAP FactCheck has also debunked claims that COVID is only slightly worse than the flu, that COVID is the flu “rebranded” and that COVID has a 99.996 per cent survival rate. The Verdict The claim that COVID always had a greater survival rate than the flu is false. Experts say that data shows the COVID mortality rate in Australia is greater than that of the flu across a number of different measures. This has been the case since the start of the pandemic. Globally, studies also show the COVID infection-fatality rate is higher than the flu infection-fatality rate.

Harriet Barber Global Health Reporter 04 November 2022 4:48pm GMT Health chiefs are running simulated emergency drills so they are ready to act should the bird flu virus sweeping the UK jump to humans, say Whitehall officials.Speaking to The Telegraph ahead of a mandatory “housing order”, or lockdown, for farmed birds coming into force on Monday, the Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said everything possible was being done to protect human as well as animal health.In addition to desk top simulations, she said this included testing the virus at each infected farm for new mutations and offering workers antivirals as a precaution. “Because this is a zoonotic disease, it has the potential to infect people” said Dr Middlemiss. “We exercise frequently with the UK Health Security Agency and others for those scenarios happening.”More than 3.8 millions birds have been culled in the UK this year following Avian H5N1 outbreaks and the virus continues to move fast among both farmed and wild bird populations. In densely packed populations, the reproduction, or “R,” rate can be as high as 100, meaning one bird will infect as many as 100 others. Ranger Rosie Parsons collects bird carcasses in the outer Farne islands, off the coast of Northumberland Credit: Joanne Coates /The Telegraph “A teaspoon full of infected bird droppings will have thousands and thousands of infected viral doses in it,” Dr Middlemiss said. “It takes a really small amount of virus to create an outbreak.”The virus has not mutated sufficiently to spread between humans, but people working in close proximity to infected birds can and do catch the disease.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 868 people have become infected with AH5N1 since 2003, with 456 deaths reported in 21 countries. As all-consuming as CovidOn November 3 it was announced that two farm workers in Spain had become infected. Earlier in the year, a 79-year-old duck keeper, Alan Gosling from Devon, caught the virus, taking the total human caseload in Europe to three. Dr Middlemiss said the risk to the general population remained “low”. This is also the view of the WHO, although for “occupationally exposed persons” it describes the risk as “low to moderate”.“We're not being complacent,” Dr Middlemiss told The Telegraph. “In every infected premise we… look at the genomics of individual isolates. Is the virus changing? Has it become more humanised? … We're confident at the moment that that is not happening, but we keep looking just in case.” The H5N1 'Bird Flu' Pandemic in Numbers For the chief vet, the AH5N1 pandemic is as all-consuming as Covid-19 was for Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer.Dr Middlemiss said she was working “18 to 20 hours a day” as the virus ravaged avian populations across the country. She said that although a large number of birds had been culled and more would inevitably follow, the numbers were small in terms of the UK’s total poultry population. This meant that the bird flu pandemic did not pose a threat in terms of the UK’s “food security”.In a bid to salvage the traditional Christmas dinner, the regulations governing the marketing of poultry have been changed to allow free range birds to be slaughtered early.“What we have done, as of last week, is make a derogation, where free-range turkeys can be slaughtered now for Christmas and frozen and then sold as free-range at Christmas time,” Dr Middlemiss said. “That removes the risk of them becoming infected in the later period… and under the marketing regulations you can still sell them as free range-birds.” bird flu map Normally turkeys would be killed just three weeks ahead of December 25. Asked if a shorter life span might lead to smaller birds, she said: “I don’t know about your family, but we always end up buying a much bigger bird than we can eat in one day, or even two days. Some of us might be a bit relieved that we don't have to eat turkey every day for a week.”Bird flu and other farming concerns, including Bovine TB, are not the only issues on the chief vet’s agenda. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have created unusual challenges in the area of domestic pets.The boom in dog ownership during lockdown caused the number of strays to rise and for other pets to develop “separation anxiety” as their owners returned to the office.“My understanding from some of the rescue centres is that they're now seeing quite a number of [pets] being given up as people's circumstances post-Covid have changed,” Dr Middlemiss said. “Animals get really used to routine… if you’ve got a puppy or kitten in lockdown, and you’ve been there all the time, then suddenly you’re not there, they’re like ‘what’s happened, what’s going on? That’s quite a big change for them.” Avian flu: our food chain is in crisis The influx of Ukraine refugees to the UK has also posed challenges with rabies as so many have brought animals with them.In Ukraine, rabies is endemic but the influx was such that normal quarantine procedures could not be applied. Instead, animals were tested for vaccine-induced antibodies to the virus and only those which returned negative results were placed into quarantine.In the end, only one suspected case of rabies from Ukraine was detected – and even that ended up proving negative. The change to the rules posed some additional risk but “worked well,” Dr Middlemiss said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Advertisement More stories More from Global Health Security Libya introduces Taliban-style morality police to crack down on women’s dress and ‘strange’ haircuts The international community’s failure on Sudan has shocked me to my core Teenager hospitalised with bird flu Iraq to lower the ‘age of consent’ for girls to nine New case of dangerous mpox strain brings UK total to four ‘Go wild, Robert’: what Trump’s victory means for global health More from The Telegraph The Telegraph Poppy Back to top Follow us on: Facebook icon Instagram icon X icon Snapchat icon LinkedIn icon YouTube icon Download the Telegraph App Help Centre About us Telegraph Extra Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication and Commissioning Fantasy Sport UK Voucher Codes Betting Offers Tax Strategy Broadband and Mobile Deals Newsletters Privacy Terms & Conditions Modern Slavery Advertising terms Guidelines The Chelsea Magazine Company © Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited 2024Bird flu in New Jersey: 30 swans dead at lake in Point Pleasant Beach, prompting safety precautions | PhillyVoice Thank veterans for their service Lung screenings at Temple Health Hampshire Co., WV: A holiday destination Finding a primary care doctor Menu PhillyVoice News Health Culture Events Sports News Search News Politics Opinion Crime Odd News Education Business Health Health News Illness Children's Health Addiction Fitness Wellness Parenting Culture Entertainment Lifestyle Food & Drink The Arts Pets Restaurants Events Fitness Family-Friendly Festivals Performances Food & Drink Shopping Sports Eagles Sixers Phillies Flyers Fantasy Football Staff / Contributors Company Info About Us Advertise Contact Us Legal / Privacy Staff / Contributors RSS © 2024 WWB Holdings, LLC.

The virus is rarely transmitted to people. The photo above is a stock image. Read More A swan population at a Jersey Shore lake has been ravaged by the avian influenza outbreak that has been spreading among birds throughout the United States. In recent days, approximately 30 swans, a duck and a goose have died at the Lake of the Lillies in Point Pleasant Beach, Ocean County.

"While the risk of human transmission is low, please stay away from the area for the time being until it has run its course amongst the swans and geese there."Outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu were first detected in the U.S. late last year and spread rapidly this spring. The flu variant is different from the one that killed more than 50 million birds in the U.S., mostly at poultry farms in the Midwest, in 2015. The current bird flu has affected a much wider territory in the U.S. and is impacting a broader range of species. The virus also has lasted longer into the year, outliving the summer timeline that scientists hoped would keep it contained. Fall migration has threatened to spread the disease further, taking a huge toll on poultry farming and wild birds, including endangered species. Kantira told NJ.com that many of the infected birds at Lake of the Lillies appear to be without symptoms. Point Pleasant Beach Police asked residents to avoid sick, injured or dead birds while the matter is being investigated. The outbreak in Point Pleasant Beach is one of several that have happened in New Jersey over the past few months. In Lacey Township, Ocean County, 80 chickens, ducks and domestic geese needed to be euthanized to stop the spread of the virus at the Popcorn Park Animal Refuge late last month. The refuge also closed temporarily and stopped selling food to guests. Precautions have led to exhibit closures at the Cape May County Zoo and Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange. And in August, more than 100 black vultures were found dead along a stretch of the Lafayette trail in Sussex County, prompting the area to be closed to people. In Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Zoo also has closed bird exhibits. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported only one case of human transmission of the current variant of avian influenza. A Colorado prison inmate, who was on work release at a job that involved culling chickens at a poultry farm, tested positive for the virus in April. There have been questions about whether the man was legitimately infected, or if his nasal swab simply picked up a detectable load of the virus. Though the avian flu is a remote risk to people, the virus has been found in a number of other species, including seals, dolphins and foxes, according to a database from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some of these cases have been fatal. The H5N1 virus first surfaced in poultry in China's Guangdong province in 1996. It has since evolved to affect a wider array of bird species and other animals that hunt infected birds. The virus is primarily spread by wild aquatic birds, but periodically finds its way into domestic poultry and other species. Some variants don't spread very quickly, but the current variant has established a foothold in large parts of Europe and North America. In Iowa, an outbreak at an egg facility will require more than 1 million hens to be killed to contain the spread of the virus, the state's Department of Agriculture reported Monday. Lab research that has been conducted over the years to study the virus has drawn closer scrutiny during the current outbreak, prompting questions about the safety of such experiments, the Intercept reported this week.

Published November 1, 2022 • Updated on November 1, 2022 at 6:49 pm With cases of COVID-19 creeping up and health experts expecting an active flu season, many residents are getting inoculated against both viruses ahead of the winter. While side effects widely vary for each person, some people are wondering if getting both vaccines at the same time makes them more likely to experience certain side effects. 📺 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are According to Chicago's top doctor Allison Arwady, the side effects experienced likely have to do with your immune system. For those experiencing more intense, robust side effects that aren't long-lasting, that may be the sign of a robust immune system, according to Arwady. Additionally, Arwady said that those who have experienced strong side effects for previous vaccines should avoid getting the flu and COVID shots at the same time. However, those who haven't noticed severe side effects in the past shouldn't have any difficulty getting both of the shots at once. "For most people, it's very convenient to get the flu vaccine in one arm and the COVID vaccine in the other arm. And please, do take some comfort in the fact that if you if you have a robust immune response, it means you've got a strong immune system," Arwady said.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Allergies Food Allergies Living With What Vaccines Are Safe for People Allergic to Eggs? 3 vaccines may be risky By Jeanette Bradley Updated on November 03, 2022 Medically reviewed by Jurairat J. Molina, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Rabies Vaccine Flu Shots Yellow Fever Vaccine A Word From Verywell Close Three vaccines, including those for yellow fever, influenza, and rabies, contain small amounts of egg protein because they're cultured either in eggs or in chick embryos. This raises a potential concern for people who are allergic to egg protein. However, even in the three vaccines considered to be potentially problematic for egg-allergic people, each vaccine contains different levels of egg protein. Therefore, some are considered safer for people with egg allergies than others. Also, egg-free alternatives exist for two of the vaccines. Other recommended vaccines, including the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine and Pneumovax 23 vaccine, are not considered a risk for those with egg allergy. While MMR is made in chicken fibroblast cells, it contains no traces of egg. Here are the details for each of the three vaccines containing small amounts of egg protein. Practice Talking to Someone Skeptical About Vaccines JGI/Tom Grill/Getty Images Rabies Vaccine and Egg Allergies Rabies is a dangerous virus transmitted through bites from infected animals. Once symptoms begin, the disease is almost always fatal. There are various different vaccines on the market for rabies that can be administered after you've been exposed to the virus. However, most of the vaccines are cultured in chicken embryos and aren't considered safe for people who have severe egg allergies. Fortunately, there is one option for the egg-allergic: Imovax, which is not cultured in chick embryos. Flu Shots and Egg Allergies The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages six months and older should get an annual flu shot. However, people with egg allergies need to take special precautions, since almost all influenza vaccines are cultured in chicken eggs. There's one flu vaccine—Flublok, made by Protein Sciences Corporation—that does not use chicken eggs during manufacturing. Flublok is approved for anyone ages 18 and up, so if you're allergic to eggs and fall into that age range, you should ask specifically for Flublok. The CDC recommends that people with a history of egg allergy of any severity should receive any licensed, recommended age appropriate vaccine. Only those with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg ( i.e., any symptoms other than hives) should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting, under the supervision of a healthcare provider with expertise in handling severe allergic reactions. However, studies showed that severe allergic reaction in people with egg allergies are very rare. Yellow Fever Vaccine and Egg Allergies Yellow fever is a severe, mosquito-borne illness common in parts of South America and Africa. The disease has a high death rate, and you need to be vaccinated against yellow fever in order to travel to certain countries. However, all yellow fever vaccines are cultured in eggs, and healthcare providers advise those with a history of severe allergic reactions to avoid the vaccine. Those with milder allergic reactions may be able to handle the yellow fever shot, or it's also possible to have allergy testing done with the vaccine itself to see whether you might be able to handle it. MMR Vaccine and Egg Allergies The MMR vaccine normally is given twice in childhood: once at 15 months, and again in a booster shot at ages four to six. This vaccine is considered safe for people who have even severe egg allergies.The shot is cultured in chicken embryos, but no traces of egg protein remain in the finished product. Medical researchers have looked at the effects of the vaccine in children with egg allergies, and have found no allergic reactions resulted from getting the shot.Note that research has shown it's safe for children with egg allergies to receive the MMR vaccine. Still, if you have concerns about it, you should talk to your child's pediatrician. A Word From Verywell As you can see, the risks of these three vaccines vary for those who are allergic to eggs, and there are alternatives to two of the three vaccines. Yellow fever is the most potentially problematic of the three, and unfortunately, there's no egg-free alternative. If you have concerns about the potential risks of any recommended vaccination, talk to your healthcare provider about the safety of each individual vaccine.

Mobile County Mobile County mom warning parents after son gets uncommon side effect from flu by: Nicolette Schleisman Posted: Nov 4, 2022 / 05:51 PM CDT Updated: Nov 4, 2022 / 05:51 PM CDT by: Nicolette Schleisman Posted: Nov 4, 2022 / 05:51 PM CDT Updated: Nov 4, 2022 / 05:51 PM CDT SHARE MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — A child in Mobile County gets the flu and temporarily loses the ability to walk. He had viral myositis and was unable to walk for a few days after he came down with the flu. Across the country, and in Mobile County, the flu is running rampant. Mobile woman sentenced to life without parole for 2019 murder: Mobile District Attorney Nicole Rowell says her 7-year-old son, Blaze, came down with the virus last week. “I pretty much figured he had the flu because I knew how rampant it was going around,” she said. Rowell explained her son started to feel better, but then he woke up in pain and was unable to walk. “I heard him say ‘mom my legs,'” said Rowell. She continued, “he just could not bear weight on them. I thought he was being a little bit dramatic, so I laid him on the couch and I touched his calf and he screamed.” They went to USA Children and Women’s, where they told her he had viral myositis. “Viral myositis is actually a viral inflammatory condition of the muscles, it occurs most commonly with Influenza A,” said Dr. Larry Mellick, the Vice Chairman for Pediatric Emergency Medicine at USA Children and Women’s. It’s not common, but it does happen during flu outbreaks. “I can go months without seeing a case of it, and then we get a flu epidemic and we get 2, 3, 4 a week presenting,” said Dr. Mellick. Vigil for man involved in Government Street standoff to spotlight mental health awareness Rowell says she had never heard of it until doctors told her about it, her son was back to his normal self within two and a half days. She said she wanted to share her story so other parents are aware. “It does get better, it’s not a permanent thing, it’s just partial paralysis, it will go away. Not to be caught off guard, kind of like we were. Just so that they had a little more insight about some symptoms that would come or possibly would come to their kids,” said Rowell. Right now, USA Children and Women’s say their emergency room is breaking volume records of the number of patients. If your child has regular flu symptoms, and no other issues, you’re encouraged to take them to your pediatrician or to urgent care. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Bird lovers are getting conflicting advice | CBC News LoadedNova ScotiaTo feed or not to feed? Bird lovers are getting conflicting adviceDifferent views are circulating on the contribution of bird feeders to disease spread, including avian influenza.Government agencies say poultry farms with nearby feeders are the most at riskCBC News · Posted: Nov 02, 2022 5:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: November 2, 2022Avian flu is affecting domestic and wild birds in Canada and around the world. (Mike Evans/CBC)Social SharingFeeding the birds during fall and winter months is a much-loved tradition for many Nova Scotians, but there is increasing concern about the role that could play in the spread of bird flu and other diseases.Anyone looking for definitive advice on the safety of their feeders will be disappointed, however, with at least one bird expert calling it a "controversial topic."Diane LeBlanc, president of the Nova Scotia Bird Society, says avian influenza usually spreads through waterfowl so the risk of it spreading at feeders is very low unless ducks are nearby. And colder temperatures lessens the risk of pathogens spreading, she says.But a wildlife biologist and president of Nature Nova Scotia, Bob Bancroft, told CBC Radio's Maritime Noon that bird feeders encourage birds to congregate and could expose them to a host of diseases including salmonella, trichomonosis (also known as trichomoniasis) and avian influenza.Bancroft said people should not feed birds this year, especially near poultry farms, because of the danger of spreading bird flu which is raging around the world.Bird feeders are popular in winter. (Submitted by Tena Reid)"Consider your neighbours if you're going to continue to feed, and I would advise you seriously not to," he said."Because one of those little sparrows or goldfinch could turn around and go to the poultry farm and there could be a dead flock in no time at all."The Canadian Food Inspection Agency tracks the disease in farms and has recorded four infected properties in Nova Scotia, affecting about 12,000 chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese. There are no current outbreaks in the province.Bob Bancroft is a wildlife biologist and president of Nature Nova Scotia. (CBC)Alberta has been hardest hit in Canada with dozens of infected farms and the resulting deaths of more than a million birds this year.A count by the federal government says 100 wild birds have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza so far this year in Nova Scotia.Islanders asked not to put out bird feeders to prevent avian flu spreadThe province amended its Wildlife Act last spring to discourage people from feeding wild animals, but did not apply the act to backyard bird feeling. Still, a news release issued at the time said, "Nova Scotians should avoid feeding or handling wild birds and stop using bird feeders to prevent disease spread of avian influenza."The federal Department of the Environment and Climate Change says on its website that using bird feeders is still considered safe. But they should be removed from areas near poultry or other domestic animals. And it advises people to regularly clean feeders and bird baths with a solution of 25 millilitres of household bleach to two litres of water.Diane LeBlanc is president of the Nova Scotia Bird Society. (Sean Dempsey)LeBlanc says putting up feeders is a personal choice that people will have to make."Typically what we ask people to do is not keep feeders up in the late spring and summer warm months because those pathogens are more likely to spread in the warmer weather and there's no need — there's lots of food in the environment," she said.Bird feeders can help spread deadly avian flu, cautions N.S. wildlife biologist"When we get into the winter months, that's not as true ... there's not as much food in the environment.... So it's a complex situation."MORE TOP STORIES2 naval ships return to Halifax after NATO mine-clearing exercise in EuropeCape Breton police upgrade charge to murder after man dies in shootingBoy, 7, seriously injured after apartment staircase collapses in New GlasgowIWK says busy ER due to rhinovirus and RSV among kids spared in past years$35K in life-saving equipment stolen from N.S. fire departmentWith files from Maritime NoonCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

After all, who wants to do anything (other than stay in bed and watch reality TV) once the sniffles set in—let alone get dressed, mask up, and leave the house?If you end up spending the week in bed because you feel wiped out, fair enough—but if you have to go out anyway (say, to stock up on tissues and cough syrup) is getting the flu shot while sick a bad idea? After all, infectious disease experts say getting vaccinated as soon as possible should be a priority, since it takes a bit of time—up to two weeks—for your body to build up flu-fighting antibodies.So…can you get the flu shot while sick?It really depends on how sick you’re feeling. First, some important context: Flu season ramped up a bit early in the US this year; the virus has already caused an estimated 880,000 illnesses, 6,900 hospitalizations, and 360 deaths, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Those numbers are, in fact, pretty wild: The country hasn’t seen this many flu-related hospitalizations this early in the season in more than a decade, and flu activity is already high in many states.In other words, you’re going to want to get your flu shot ASAP—and mild cold symptoms shouldn’t necessarily stop you if you can get your appointment booked. “It is generally thought to be fine to get most vaccines, including the flu shot, if you have mild symptoms of an illness and no fever,” Cory Fisher, DO, a family medicine doctor at Cleveland Clinic, tells SELF. Specifically, you shouldn’t let a sore throat, headache, mild cough, or a stuffy or runny nose stop you from proceeding with your vaccination, he adds.Other symptoms, however, should give you some pause—namely a fever, intense body aches, and heavy fatigue. Basically, if you’re feeling awful enough to not go to school or work, you should consider holding off on getting the flu vaccine until you’re feeling a bit better, Dr. Fisher says.It’s not that getting vaccinated while sick will hurt you (it won’t!), but it might be in your best interest to wait because symptoms like a fever signal that your body is already working pretty hard to fight whatever’s ailing you, per the Cleveland Clinic. And you want your immune system to be fully ready to respond to the vaccine when you do get it.Plus, the flu shot itself can potentially cause side effects, so if your symptoms start to worsen, your doctor may have a harder time figuring out whether a prior infection is to blame or if you’re having a reaction to the vaccine. (Of course, you should take your health history into account before you get any vaccine, especially while sick. Always check in with your doctor first if you have a chronic condition or allergies.)Bottom line: If you’re just feeling slightly sniffly or like you’re on the upswing, it’s okay to go ahead and get your shot. But if you’re really feeling rundown, it’s probably best to wait a bit or at least talk to a doctor before you move forward.If you do need to wait, it’s still important to get your flu shot once you’re feeling like yourself again.We get it: The last thing you’ll want to deal with is the possibility of a sore arm and gnarly bout of fatigue, but most flu shot side effects (if you experience any at all) tend to last just a day, so it will be over before you know it.Keep in mind that staying up-to-date with all your recommended vaccines—including the new bivalent COVID-19 booster—is just one piece of staying healthy during cold and flu season, Dr. Fisher says. Wearing a mask in public, washing your hands thoroughly and frequently, trying to avoid people who are sick, and laying low at home when you’re really sick yourself can go a long way throughout the winter months.Related:Here’s Why a Post-COVID Cough Can Last So Miserably LongCan You Actually Catch the Same Cold Twice?Here’s Why Pfizer’s RSV Vaccine for Adults Is a Pretty Big DealMaggie O’Neill is a health editor based in New York.

The RA Ministry of Health reports this. "The best way not to get sick with the flu, as well as to avoid further complications of the disease, is vaccination. It should be noted that all polyclinics/ambulatory clinics and mobile vaccination points in the country are equipped with the seasonal flu vaccine. All those who have yet to receive the seasonal flu vaccination can apply and be vaccinated regardless of the place of registration. Vaccinations are carried out voluntarily, free of charge, within the framework of the state order, giving priority to risk groups, in particular: pregnant women, children from 6 months to 5 years old, people over 65 years old, people with chronic diseases, medical workers, people subject to military service, people in closed organizations and service staff," the statement said. In order not to get sick with acute respiratory infections and flu, as well as to avoid complications of the disease, the Ministry of Health once again urges: • get vaccinated against seasonal flu,• avoid contact with patients with flu-like symptoms,• if you are sick, stay at home;• if you are sick, call your local pediatrician, therapist, or family doctor, and do not self-medicate.• do not use antibiotics, as they are not indicated for the treatment of flu and acute respiratory infections;• dress according to the weather,• observe cough and sneeze etiquette,• drink as many fluids as possible;• frequently ventilate closed spaces,• observe personal hygiene.

The study, which is getting international attention, took a decade of health record data in Alberta and looked at the risk of stroke after getting vaccinated against influenza.“Across the study we did see a lower risk of stroke in that six-month time period post-influenza vaccination,” study author Dr. Jessalyn Holodinsky told Global News.The latest research builds on existing scientific knowledge of a connection between an influenza infection and stroke.“There’s a longstanding history between infections and stroke — upper respiratory tract infections are associated with stroke — so it was sort of natural to start to look at this,” Dr. Michael Hill said. Story continues below advertisement “In addition, there’s a relationship between influenza and myocardial infarction – heart attacks – and so drawing the links in with stroke was a natural next step.”Hill called it a “definitive study” and anticipated another one to follow.The research was published in The Lancet Public Health, a prestigious scientific journal.Holodinsky said the quality and depth of the data set the team was looking at produced some surprising results in the connection between the flu shot and stroke prevention. 2:02 Flu season set to make major COVID-era comeback “What I was surprised by was the magnitude. I wasn’t surprised that the effect existed but I was surprised by how strong the effect was and especially that the effect existed for all adults,” she said, noting there was a protective effect regardless of existence of chronic conditions.

Hill said the connection between stroke or heart attack and upper respiratory infections like influenza or strep could also apply to COVID-19.

Language rights take spotlight at Quebec Liberal Party convention Activist who climbed Jacques-Cartier Bridge speaks out “We know pathologically that some of the mechanisms of stroke are related to specific bacteria or viruses that will infect not only your lungs or your bronchioles, but also plaque in the carotid artery for example. So there are some mechanistic reasons to believe that preventing upper respiratory infections will also reduce your risk of ischemic events like stroke,” he said.For Holodinsky, the message from the data is clear.“What a great added bonus here too, that (the flu vaccine) might be influencing your cardiovascular risk profile as well,” she said. “I think this is great messaging for the public, especially with influenza vaccination season upon us right now, to go out and consider getting your influenza vaccination.”Slow uptakeAlbertans are going out to get vaccinated for influenza, but at a slower pace than in previous years. In the first week shots were publicly available, nearly 300,000 doses were administered. Story continues below advertisement “That’s about 6.5 per cent of the population. When comparing that to last year, we were over 10 per cent already at that same timeframe,” AHS Calgary Zone medical officer of health Dr. Karla Gustafson said. “So definitely some room for improvement with vaccine uptake.”Last flu season, 467,521 doses went into Albertans’ arms.One Calgary pharmacist said this early flu season is the busiest she’s had in recent memory, crediting awareness of vaccinations against COVID-19.

So it’s been a really busy year for us.”Kharoub’s pharmacy has been seeing between 70 and 80 customers per day to get a flu shot since they became widely available on Oct. 17, and more people in a wider age range than previous years.Hill said he is personally more concerned about influenza this fall and winter than COVID, because of how the flu hit other countries earlier this year.“They had quite a go of it in Australia and the southern hemisphere, and usually when it’s bad in the southern hemisphere, it’s then bad in the northern hemisphere,” Hill said. Story continues below advertisement “It’s not a perfect relationship but I think we could be in for quite a hit this winter.” 1:38 Trudeau says COVID-19, flu shots reduce ‘danger’ of needing other health measures this winter As of Oct. 16, Alberta had 47 active lab-confirmed cases of influenza A and influenza B. The previous week, there was only 28 cases of influenza. Through all of this flu season there were 138 total cases, with 21 people hospitalized and four in ICU.The medical officer of health said vaccination can lighten the load on already stressed hospitals across the province.“We do want to have that capacity in the health system to help people when they need it most and I’m sure that no one wants to be hospitalized with a respiratory virus,” she said. “So vaccine really is your best protection against that.”Gustafson understands any weariness around getting another vaccine, but said there’s no better time to get a shot.

This represents an early start to the flu season in this area. TBDHU recommends anyone who is eligible should get the annual flu shot. Starting today (November 1), all individuals who are 6 months or older can receive the flu vaccine. Flu shots are widely available from many pharmacies and primary care providers. Individuals 5 years or older who are coming to TBDHU clinics for their COVID-19 vaccine will also be offered the flu vaccine at the same time. “Flu is here, and it’s spreading quickly,” noted Dr. Janet DeMille, Medical Officer of Health. “Flu is a serious disease that results in hospitalizations and deaths every year in Ontario. The vaccine will help protect individuals and families against the flu. With COVID-19 and other viruses still circulating and the health care system under tremendous strain, it is particularly important that people protect themselves and others.” With the surge in flu cases, TBDHU is strongly recommending individuals who are at higher risk, as well as those who live with or care for them, to get their flu shot as soon as possible. To support this, starting today, individuals at higher risk will be able to walk in for a flu shot at the TBDHU COVID-19 vaccine clinic on the CLE grounds in Thunder Bay even if they don’t need a COVID-19 vaccine. This clinic will also continue to offer flu vaccines to children under 5 and their accompanying family members. Individuals at higher risk of serious complications from the flu include: People 65 years old or older People with chronic illnesses (such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease or lung disease) Children 6 months to 4 years old People who are pregnant Indigenous people In addition to getting the flu shot, there are other important measures that reduce the risk of spreading the flu, such as staying home when sick, washing hands frequently, and wearing a mask (especially indoors when around other people). With COVID-19 still circulating and new sub-variants expected, TBDHU continues to recommend that eligible individuals receive their COVID-19 vaccine fall booster. Individuals 5 years old or older can receive the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time. Residents of district communities should contact their community’s health care provider or a pharmacy to access the flu vaccine. TBDHU continues to offer COVID-19 vaccine clinics in district communities and is planning additional clinics in the Thunder Bay area to offer flu shots to those at highest risk and COVID-19 boosters to everyone who is eligible. Please check TBDHU’s Getting the Flu Shot page for more details as they become available.

Or if garden robins or pigeons in your local park are at risk "BirdWatch Ireland is very concerned by the increasing number of reports of sick and dead seabirds that it has been receiving in recent days. Gannets, in particular, appear to be badly affected." Picture: Danny Lawson/PA WireThu, 03 Nov, 2022 - 15:00Caroline Delaney    Avian influenza — or 'avian flu' or 'bird flu' — is in the news a lot at the moment. You might have seen distressing images of dead or sick seabirds on social media or in news reports. The latest update has seen poultry owners ordered to house their birds indoors from next week.It is an animal disease and it is rare for it to affect humans: we've asked the HSE as well as the Department of Agriculture and Birdwatch Ireland for some information. Is my health at risk from avian influenza? Avian Influenza (AI), commonly known as bird flu, is a notifiable animal disease and is a highly contagious viral disease affecting the respiratory, digestive and/or nervous system of many species of birds. It can also pose a threat to people and other animals in certain circumstances, but these types of infections are rare. The risk to public health is however considered to be very low. [HSE] I am not a poultry farmer but I have some pet ducks/hens and I love them. Are they a danger or are they in danger? Poultry flock owners have been issued with an order to house their birds indoors from Monday, November 7, due to a rising number of bird flu cases. All poultry and captive birds in possession must be confined in a secure building to which wild birds or other animals do not have access.All poultry owners (even if only 1 or 2 birds) should be registered with the Department — instructions on how to register are available.In addition, the biosecurity regulations introduced on September 19 apply to all flock owners no matter how small. Further information and guidance for members of the public and flock owners can be found on the Department’s website gov.ie — Avian influenza (bird flu) [Dept of Ag]With an increasing number of cases of wild bird infection seen along the coast, all keepers of poultry and captive birds should implement stringent biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading to poultry and captive birds. Poultry farmers and people who keep game birds or pets should be familiar with the signs of avian influenza, and should closely monitor their birds for signs of disease and report any suspicions to their local Regional Veterinary Office. [HSE] Is it safe to eat poultry or eggs now? Properly cooked poultry meat and eggs do not pose any food safety risk. [HSE]To date, no epidemiological data suggest that the disease can be transmitted to humans through properly cooked food (even if contaminated with the virus prior to cooking). Human cases are linked to close contact with infected poultry, and exposure to the virus during the slaughter and preparation of infected birds. Irish produced poultry are free of the avian influenza virus and all poultry products on sale in Ireland have a very low risk of carrying the highly pathogenic strain of the virus. Poultry and poultry products can be prepared and eaten as usual, provided that they are handled hygienically while raw, and cooked thoroughly prior to consumption. [FSAI]Are the wild birds in my garden at risk or could the pigeons on city streets and parks be a problem? Pigeons and most garden birds are less susceptible to HPAI and no cases of HPAI H5N1 have been confirmed in these species in Ireland to date. [Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]So what birds are affected? The Department (of Agriculture) carries out avian influenza surveillance in wild birds on a targeted list of species. This list of targeted wild birds species, most susceptible to HPAI, is drawn up by EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] based on species confirmed positive for the virus and adapted for Ireland in conjunction with NPWS [National Parks and Wildlife Service]. This is the current list of wild birds to be targeted for AI surveillance (H5 HPAI) in Ireland. [Dept of Ag]Really hoping #avianflu wont flatten this colony of seabirds on #SkelligMichael or any of our other colonies. https:/.co/QC1sFQ3JGm— BirdsMatter_ie (@BirdsMatter_ie) September 20, 2022 I like to feed wild birds and watch them in my garden. Can I still do this? From this Department’s perspective, it is most important that people ensure there is no contact between kept birds (poultry and pet birds) and wild birds. This is to mitigate the risk of kept birds becoming infected. Care should be taken when siting bird feeders not to place them close to where poultry or captive birds are located to reduce the risk of disease spread. I have a dog and we love beach walks — are these still ok? Do not pick up or touch sick, dying or dead poultry or wild birds, and keep any pets away from them [Dept of Ag]Keep pets away from wild birds. Consider keeping pets indoors or on leash in areas wild birds frequent. [HSE]My child loves to collect feathers on walks. Is this risky? Avoid untreated bird feathers (such as those found in the environment) and other bird waste. Maintain good personal hygiene with regular hand washing with soap and use of alcohol-based hand rubs. [Dept of Ag]What do I do if I see an injured bird? Do not touch sick or dead wild birds. Human cases of this strain of Avian Influenza are very rare. However, individuals should not touch sick or dead birds.Report sightings of sick or dead wild birds. People can report any sightings of sick or dead wild birds to the local Regional Veterinary Office or contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at 01-4928026.It is also important to note that potentially sick birds should not be brought to wildlife rehabilitators or animal rescues centres, as this could risk infecting the birds already in their care. [Birdwatch Ireland]ADVISORY NOTE FOR ALL!!High Incidence of Bird Mortality in Co. Wexford.Please do not approach, move or handle in anyway. Report to Avian Influenza Hotline on 01 6072512 and to Wexford County Council on 053 9196000, extension 5.Please retweet. pic.twitter.com/kghTGOl2jl— Wexford County Council (@wexfordcoco) September 15, 2022 I was walking and saw some dead birds. Could I spread the disease? Dr June Fanning, deputy chief veterinary officer at the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, explains the risks: “Avian Influenza is highly infectious to birds. Anyone travelling from an area known or suspected to be affected with avian influenza or where wild birds have been found dead should not come into contact with poultry or captive birds without prior cleaning and disinfection of clothing and footwear. It is vital that poultry owners and keepers of captive birds maintain the highest standards of biosecurity to protect their birds. Strict biosecurity remains the number one preventative measure to introduction of avian influenza into poultry and captive bird flocks."Have people here in Ireland been infected? What are the human health issues? Dr Keith Ian Quintyne, consultant in public health medicine, health protection, HSE Public Health Area A outlines the human health issues: “To date, no human cases of infection have been reported in Ireland or the EU. Even though the risk to human health is very low, human cases are reported periodically from China, and the UK has recently identified a single human case of avian influenza. Where human disease has occurred, it has tended to be mild. However, elderly people and vulnerable patients living with immunosuppression could be at greater risk of developing more severe disease.”* Here is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control factsheet on avian influenzaRead MoreBirdwatch Ireland criticises 'piecemeal approach' to avian flu deaths more outdoors articles Ancient DNA brings to life history of iconic aurochs, which were seen on cave wall paintings Irish climber who scaled Everest dies after accident in New Zealand Businesses to fund wildlife ponds, hedgerows and woodlands on Irish farms as part of ReFarm project More in this section Businesses to fund wildlife ponds, hedgerows and woodlands on Irish farms as part of ReFarm project Would a visit to Páirc Quaternary be better than Jurassic Park?
