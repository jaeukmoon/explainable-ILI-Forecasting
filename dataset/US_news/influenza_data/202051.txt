Their results highlight the importance of receiving the annual flu vaccine to induce the most protective immune response. The researchers found that most of the initial antibodies stimulated after both influenza infections and influenza vaccinations came from old B cells — a type of white blood cell that secretes antibodies — indicating the immune system’s memory plays a major role in how the body responds early on to a viral infection. These antibodies displayed higher reactivity toward strains of influenza that circulated during an individual’s childhood compared to more recent strains. The study, published December 10, 2020 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, provides those working on a universal influenza vaccine further understanding of how pre-existing immunity affects the development and performance of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies following infection and vaccination. Any effective universal influenza vaccine will depend on scientists identifying ‘conserved’ parts of the influenza virus that do not mutate over time and that antibodies can target to prevent infection. “Most interestingly, we found that people who were actively sick with influenza had old antibodies that predominantly targeted parts of the virus that don’t change — but those antibodies specifically targeted non-neutralizing sites,” said Haley Dugan, co-first author of the study and a PhD candidate in immunology. “When we tested these same antibodies in mice, they weren’t able to protect them from being infected with influenza.” In contrast, the researchers found that influenza vaccinations boost antibodies that tended to target conserved yet neutralizing regions of the virus, which suggests vaccinations can draw upon pre-existing immunity to prompt more protective responses. Vaccinated individuals also generated many antibodies that targeted new and mutated regions on the virus, suggesting these vaccine-induced antibodies are more adaptable. Immune system memory ensures a rapid and specific response to previously encountered pathogens. Vaccinations work by exposing the immune system to a small amount of virus, which causes B cells to develop a biological memory to the virus. If the body encounters the same virus later, the immune system is alerted to attack and eliminate the virus. But in order to be protected, the viral proteins of the infecting strain must typically match those of the strain used in the vaccine. The memory B cells are like keys that fit and bind to the locks — the viral proteins. These memory B cells can survive for decades, providing long-lasting protection from future infections. But if the virus mutates and is significantly different, the memory B cells can no longer recognize the viral proteins, potentially leading to infection.For this reason, the human body is pitted in an evolutionary arms race with the flu. Because influenza viruses rapidly evolve and mutate each season, our immune system has trouble recognizing the viral surface proteins on new influenza strains. As a result, our bodies often rely on old antibodies to fight new influenza strains; this is possible because some parts of the influenza virus that are critical to its structure or function do not change, remaining familiar to our immune system. Researchers now understand that specific structural and functional parts of the influenza virus that do not change are better for antibodies to target than others. Antibodies that bind to one of these neutralizing sites are able to prevent infection, while antibodies that target non-neutralizing sites often cannot. Scientists believe a person’s age, history of exposure to the influenza virus and type of exposure — either through infection or vaccination — all shape whether their immune system antibodies target neutralizing or non-neutralizing sites on a virus.In the UChicago study, scientists sought to address a major knowledge gap: Which conserved viral sites are preferentially targeted following natural infection versus vaccination in people, and how does pre-existing immunity play a role in shaping the landscape of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies? “For people who have caught the flu, their pre-existing immunity may make them susceptible to infection or increase the severity of their influenza symptoms if their antibodies are targeting ‘bad’ or non-neutralizing viral sites,” said co-first author and Immunology postdoctoral fellow Jenna Guthmiller, PhD.By contrast, vaccination largely induces neutralizing and protective antibodies, old and new, highlighting the importance of receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. “This study provides a major framework for understanding how pre-existing immunity shapes protective antibody responses to influenza in humans,” said Patrick Wilson, PhD, a professor of immunology and lead author of the study. “We need more studies to determine whether the targeting of specific neutralizing and non-neutralizing viral sites directly impacts a person’s likelihood of becoming ill.”The researchers are now examining how early exposure to the influenza virus in children shapes their immune response later in life as a follow-up to this work.“Preexisting immunity shapes distinct antibody landscapes after influenza virus infection and vaccination in humans” was written by Patrick Wilson, Haley Dugan, Jenna J.

Long-term exposure to cadmium, even at low levels, may undermine our defense system in the lungs, and people with high levels of the chemical may not be able to cope with influenza virus attacks, Park said. The study by researchers at U-M, the University of Southern California and the University of Washington is published in the December issue of Environmental Health Perspectives. “The associations we found need to be verified in other populations and also studied with respect to cadmium’s potential impact on COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality,” said senior author Howard Hu, professor and chair of USC’s Department of Preventive Medicine and an occupational/environmental physician. “Unfortunately, the human body finds it much more difficult to excrete cadmium than other toxic metals, and its presence in many nutritious foods means it is critical to continue reducing sources of environmental pollution that contribute to its presence in air, soil and water.” Early in the pandemic, as data was starting to come out of Wuhan, China, a large percentage of people dying from the coronavirus shared a few characteristics—they were male, smokers and older. That prompted Finnish researcher Matti Sirén, a co-author of the study, to reach out to Park and Hu, who a decade ago had conducted a comprehensive study on the impact of cadmium on chronic diseases, including lung and cardiovascular diseases. Interested in looking into the association between cadmium and COVID-19, but understanding that little data would be available to look at this link, the researchers instead focused on studying the potential association of cadmium to other viral infections: influenza and pneumonia. The researchers utilized data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988-1994 and 1999-2006. NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics and provides nationally representative survey data on the health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Nearly 16,000 participants in the two separate cohorts were used for the analysis. Cadmium was measured in urine in the first survey and blood in the second. And because tobacco has more than 3,000 chemical components, researchers also looked at cadmium levels in nonsmokers. After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol and hypertension, researchers found that patients with cadmium levels in the 80th percentile were 15% more likely to die of influenza or pneumonia compared to those in the 20th percentile. Among those who never smoked, the difference was even greater with a 27% higher risk of mortality among those in the 80th percentile compared to the 20th percentile. “We couldn’t directly look at cadmium body burden among COVID-19 patients in the early pandemic,” Park said. “Our motivation was to find a modifiable risk factor that can predispose people with COVID-19 infection to develop a severe complication and die of COVID-19. “COVID-19 may not be a one-time event. Our findings suggest that the public can benefit from reduced cadmium exposure when the next pandemic occurs. This cannot be done suddenly and takes time through policy changes.” In the meantime, Park said smokers should stop smoking. And everyone should be aware of the major sources of cadmium in their diets: cereal, rice, animal organs such as the liver and kidneys, soybeans and some types of leafy vegetables. There are many other sources of vitamins, he said. Cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage and broccoli, contain high levels of antioxidants but relatively low levels of cadmium. “This isn’t a recommendation for a draconian change in lifestyle, since many of these foods are typical staples of a balanced, nutritious diet, and their overall contribution to cadmium burden is likely modest,” Hu said. “Rather, the suggestion is to consider some shifts in choices. “Meanwhile, epidemiologists need to focus on the issue we raised. Increased scrutiny is needed of sources of cadmium exposure and surveillance of cadmium levels in the general population, and policymakers need to work on continuing to reduce environmental cadmium pollution.” The study was supported by the U-M’s Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease Center, a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Core Center.

In December 1918, preparations for the first Christmas without war in four years took place in the midst of the worst pandemic since the Black Death.The 1918-19 influenza, like Covid-19, came in waves. The deadliest began in autumn, peaked in late November and continued through the first weeks of December. It struck hundreds of millions and killed tens of millions worldwide.One quarter of Britons were ill with the virus and 225,000 died, most in the months and weeks before Christmas.But while there are similarities between the two pandemics – both are highly infectious respiratory diseases that spread in waves – there are also important differences in the contexts in which they developed, in efforts to control them, in their impact on healthcare systems and how people learned to live with them.People celebrating Christmas and other seasonal holidays in 1918 faced nothing like the restrictions people will face this year.The reasons for this difference are many, looking at a few can offer some lessons.The experience of the 1918 pandemic was intimately tied to the first world war, which not only facilitated its rapid spread but also significantly shaped the responses to it.Until the armistice in November 1918, winning the war had been more important than the battle against influenza.In Britain, public health, military and government officials counselled the nation to “carry on” in the face of the escalating and worsening pandemic.Britain’s chief medical officer of health, Sir Arthur Newsholme, issued the first official memorandum in October. It recommended a range of measures to slow influenza, including isolating the sick from the healthy, school and cinema closures, oral disinfection (gargling with antiseptics), and warnings against large “aggregations of people”.Mask-wearing was not among the recommendations.View image in fullscreenPeople wearing masks in London at the end of 1918 as illustrated in a Swiss newspaper, although the wearing of masks was not initially recommended. Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty ImagesNone of the measures was mandatory and responsibility for their implementation fell to local authorities, who adopted them in a piecemeal manner.Medical officers and local authorities in London took diverging approaches, with some closing cinemas and schools, while others hardly intervened. By contrast, in Manchester, the medical officer of health, Dr James Niven, developed a vigorous scheme of prevention and treatment, which likely mitigated the epidemic: whereas the second wave peaked in London in the second and third week of November, it peaked in Manchester in early December.There are a number of reasons why measures were not systematically introduced. War demands were important. Medical experts were uncertain about the identity of the epidemic: who it most affected, the nature and severity of symptoms, and how it killed did not conform to what was known about influenza.Most authorities thought that influenza was caused by a bacillus, but systematic testing was impossible because it was difficult to isolate from the sick and to grow in cultures.Public attitudes mattered. Influenza was widely viewed as little more than a burdensome but mostly mild malady. People who had already endured four years of wartime privations were unlikely to welcome or comply with severe restrictions.This was especially the case when the war ended. It is no coincidence that the second wave peaked after armistice, when thousands defied public health advice and massed together to celebrate in squares, streets, pubs, homes and churches across the country.Soon thereafter, decommissioned soldiers brought influenza back to Britain or carried it home to India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the US and beyond.As the epidemic continued through November and early December, hospitals were overwhelmed by the influx of the sick and dying. Most were understaffed because at least half of Britain’s nurses and doctors had been commissioned for the war effort.Those on hand could offer little more than nursing or palliative care: there were no effective treatments against influenza or the deadly pneumonic complications that accompanied the disease. While the sick were encouraged to seek medical attention, most suffered and died in their homes, under the care not of a doctor or nurse, but of a family member, friend or neighbour. Burials were halted in places because of shortages of caskets. By early December, a growing number of schools were closed, either as a precaution or because teachers and students had fallen ill. Just as now, schoolchildren were thought to be spreaders of infection, and school closures were viewed as a necessary but controversial measure.William Hamer, the chief medical officer of the London county council, opposed school closures on the grounds that “such action would simply release the children and allow them to congregate in places where danger of infection is greater”.In early December, Manchester decided to close all elementary schools until the new year. Such measures were a double-edged sword.Unlike today, children were not locked down in their homes. The majority simply ended up playing together on local streets or parks and, just as Hamer feared, further spreading the disease.By Christmas Day, the second wave had largely subsided. The lull offered time for reflection and gave rise to expressions of loss, anger and hope. Shadowed by the twin tragedies of the war and the pandemic, this was a Christmas like no other.Obituary pages of national and local newspapers, which had been filled with war deaths, were now also filled with influenza deaths. Stories abounded of young men who had survived the western front only to perish from influenza on their return.The Times reminded readers that “this plague … generally regarded with equanimity, is, it would seem, five times more deadly than the war.” It estimated that “some 6 million persons have perished of influenza and pneumonia during the past 12 weeks.”The number was a massive underestimate. Weeks later, the paper would revise the global figure upwards to 12 million, but even this figure was too low.Along with a collective sense of loss, the season also unleashed anger. Most of it was directed at the failure of public health authorities to prevent the pandemic.The Manchester Guardian’s medical correspondent decried that the epidemic “has revealed the relative helplessness of preventive medicine in the face of certain infections.”Newsholme and his department were especially targeted for their failure to coordinate an effective national response. There were calls for Lloyd George’s newly elected government to accelerate the creation of a ministry of health to put the nation’s preventive system on a better footing.The sharpest criticisms turned on the failure to recommend the general use of gauze masks to prevent the spread of infection. Critics questioned why mask-wearing on trains, omnibuses and public places had not been made a general measure. They pointed to the example of San Francisco, where a city-wide mask order had reportedly stamped out the epidemic.Mask-wearing became part of a public discussion about the medical and cultural changes needed to prepare for future epidemics. The Manchester Guardian wondered whether this measure said something about the British character: “It is possible that only our British self-consciousness has prevented us from taking the precaution of wearing germ masks during influenza epidemics.”As the second wave abated, there was some optimism that the worst was over. There was hope that a new influenza vaccine, which had been developed by the War Office and tested on military populations, would become widely available to the public.View image in fullscreenA man sprays the inside of a London bus with an anti-flu preparation in 1920. Photograph: HF Davis/Getty ImagesMade from a mixture of bacteria, the vaccine proved to be moderately effective against secondary infections like pneumonia, but did not protect against influenza. Nonetheless, demand was high and manufacturers rushed to supply local authorities.Influenza returned shortly after the new year. Although less widespread and severe, the third wave was likely seeded during the Christmas period. It was a stark reminder that this epidemic disease would remain a regular visitor.Ultimately, Britons and people around the world had to learn to live with influenza. Just as with Covid-19, this meant dealing with grievous loss, acknowledging systematic failures, and developing new ways of managing epidemics.The virus that caused such devastation in autumn 1918 circulated for decades in a milder form but still caused outbreaks and epidemics. Influenza deaths and illness became an accepted part of modern life, figuring into the rational calculus of health care and insurance systems, and the experiences of individuals, families and communities.Every pandemic is a step into the unknown. We need to bear in mind differences in the worlds in which influenza and Covid-19 emerged, in the state of medical and scientific knowhow, in health care infrastructures, and in capacities to respond.Looking backwards should remind us that each pandemic brings with it unique problems that require unique solutions.Britain and the world in 2020 are in a far better position to tackle a pandemic then ever before. But as 1918 shows, even with best available medicine and science, communities and nations have to learn to live with epidemic diseases. The challenge is to learn to live well with them; this is something few people were able to do in 1918.Michael Bresalier, Department of History, Swansea University.

Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. This plan will likely change over time, depending on whether your disease worsens or you go into remission.Medication, dietary changes, nutritional supplements, and surgery may all be necessary, according to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.[1]Per MedlinePlus, the goals of treatment for ulcerative colitis are:[2]Treating acute attacksInducing remissionProlonging disease remissionsEditor's PicksYour Total-Body Ulcerative Colitis Check-InHow much is ulcerative colitis impacting your life? Are your treatment and diet plans working for you? Here’s how to check in before your next checkup with your doctor.…Learn MoreDrug Therapy for Ulcerative ColitisMost drugs prescribed to treat ulcerative colitis work by suppressing the inflammation in your colon. This allows the lining of your colon to heal and reduces the severity of symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.[1]Typically, your doctor will prescribe one or more of the following drugs.Aminosalicylates These drugs are used to treat disease flares, and can help prevent future flares when taken as maintenance therapy.Because they work directly in the digestive system, aminosalicylates have a relatively low risk of negatively affecting other areas of the body.Corticosteroids Also known simply as steroids, corticosteroids are used to treat active disease.Because of their high risk of side effects, steroids are used only as a “bridge” to help UC symptoms while other, safer drugs are introduced. Steroids should not be taken for long periods of time.Immune System Suppressors These drugs work directly on the immune system to reduce inflammation. They’re used to treat disease flares, as well as to prevent future ones when taken for maintenance therapy.For many people with ulcerative colitis, immune system suppressors are combined with other classes of drugs, notes Mayo Clinic.[3]Biologics Biologic drugs are used to treat individuals with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Biologics are lab-made antibodies that target certain proteins in the body to stop them from causing inflammation.[1] On June 18, 2024, AbbVie pharmaceutical company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis.[4]Risankizumab-rzaa is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by helping to stop the inflammation process.[5]To date, Skyrizi has been approved for four different indications of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases:[6]Moderate to severe ulcerative colitisModerate to severe Crohn’s diseaseActive psoriatic arthritisModerate to severe plaque psoriasisIn September 2024, the FDA approved another monoclonal antibody, guselkumab (Tremfya), to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.[7] Tremfya is also approved to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and adults with active psoriatic arthritis.Small Molecules are chemical compounds taken orally that also work on the immune system, but act differently from biologics.These drugs are used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.Immunomodulators are a second-line drug for treating ulcerative colitis. These drugs limit inflammation at its source in the immune system.Other types of drugs your doctor may prescribe include:Antidiarrheal Medication This type of drug should be used only with caution to treat severe diarrhea, since it raises the risk of toxic colitis, a dangerous complication.[3]Pain Relievers Your doctor may recommend Tylenol (acetaminophen) for mild pain.Avoid ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and diclofenac (Voltaren), which can worsen ulcerative colitis symptoms.[2]Iron Supplements Taking supplemental iron may be necessary if you have chronic intestinal bleeding, since anemia is common in people with ulcerative colitis. It’s important to have your iron levels tested before taking supplements. Excess iron can be toxic to the liver, according to a study published in 2021 in BMC Gastroenterology.[8]Surgery for Ulcerative ColitisUlcerative colitis can be cured through surgery to remove the entire colon, but this course of treatment shouldn’t be taken unless it’s medically necessary.About one-quarter to one-third of people with ulcerative colitis eventually become candidates for surgery.[1]Surgery may be necessary in the following situations:[2]Disease that doesn’t respond to multiple types of drug therapySevere complications, like toxic colitis, a ruptured colon, or extensive bleedingAbnormal cells, or dysplasia, in the colon, which puts you at high risk for colon cancerSurgery for ulcerative colitis usually involves removing the entire colon and rectum. Women of childbearing age should speak to their doctors to see if preserving part of their rectum would be preferable.When your rectum is removed, continence is usually preserved. For example, a proctocolectomy — removal of your entire colon and rectum — may require an ileostomy. In this procedure, the surgeon creates a small opening in the abdominal wall and attaches the tip of the lower small intestine, the ileum, to the opening.Waste exits the body through this opening and must be collected in a pouch or bag.[1]In an alternative approach — called ileoanal anastomosis, commonly called J-pouch surgery — your surgeon may create an internal pouch out of the ileum and connect it to the anus. This allows you to pass stool fairly normally.[1]Editor's PicksTrust Your Gut: Regaining Control and Confidence With IBDUlcerative colitis and Crohn's disease can complicate your day-to-day, but you don't have to let it slow you down — use these strategies to keep living your life to the fullest.…Learn MoreHome Remedies for Ulcerative ColitisA number of lifestyle measures can help control ulcerative colitis symptoms and reduce the stress of living with this chronic condition.Check with your doctor before trying any of the following approaches to managing your disease.Eating Small, Frequent Meals Compared with eating three large meals each day, eating smaller meals four to five times a day lowers the likelihood of abdominal discomfort after eating.Staying Hydrated Drink plenty of fluids every day to keep hydrated, which is especially important during flares. Water is the best option, while alcohol and beverages with caffeine should be avoided, as they stimulate the intestines and can make diarrhea worse. Carbonated drinks should also be limited, as they produce gas.[3]Curcumin A component of the spice turmeric, this supplement has an anti-inflammatory effect, and some research suggests it may help when taken along with conventional medication. A review published in April 2021 in Pharmaceutics found that curcumin effectively tamped down inflammation related to ulcerative colitis.[9] It also noted that patients taking the anti-inflammatory drug mesalamine along with 3,000 milligrams (mg) of curcumin capsules achieved remission faster and recovered more quickly than those taking mesalamine and a placebo.Fish Oil These supplements, which contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, may help some people reduce symptoms or stay in remission. A review published in July 2021 in the journal Foods found that diets rich in omega-3s improved the inflammatory signals associated with ulcerative colitis, and people who ate an omega-3 rich diet were at a lower risk of ulcerative colitis.[10]Mind-Body Practices Regularly engaging in meditation, tai chi, or yoga may reduce the stress of living with ulcerative colitis, according to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.[11]Alternative Therapies for Ulcerative ColitisGiven the lack of a cure for ulcerative colitis and the difficulty of living with the disease, researchers continue to look for more and better treatments.Nicotine patches in combination with prescribed medicine for ulcerative colitis appear more beneficial than medicine alone, according to a review published in October 2020 in Cureus.[12]Why exactly it works remains unknown. A review published in October 2020 in BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies found several studies indicating that acupuncture may help relieve symptoms of ulcerative colitis.[13] This ancient Chinese practice can reduce stress and pain, and may be especially helpful in combination with your regular treatment.[3]Additional reporting by Ashley Welch and Jordan M.

In the current study, we used metagenomics to detect and characterise avian DNA and RNA viruses from wild Pacific black ducks, Chestnut teals and Grey teals collected at different time points from a single location. We characterised a likely new species of duck aviadenovirus and a novel duck gyrovirus. We also report what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first finding of an avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black ducks and a rotavirus F from Chestnut teals. Other viruses characterised from the samples from these wild ducks belong to the virus families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae. Some of the viruses may have potential cross-species transmissibility, while others indicated a wide genetic diversity of duck viruses within a genus. The study also showed evidence of potential transmission of viruses along the East Asian—Australasian Flyway; potentially facilitated by migrating shorebirds. The detection and characterisation of several avian viruses not previously described, and causing asymptomatic but potentially also symptomatic infections suggest the need for more virus surveillance studies for pathogenic and potential zoonotic viruses in wildlife reservoirs.

These viruses could become potential threats to other wild animals, poultry and possibly humans under the right set of circumstances2. Virome (virus community) analysis of potential reservoir bird hosts is expected to unveil the role of viruses causing acute or long-term asymptomatic infections and the diversity and range of viruses that infect wild birds. Virome analysis is also expected to aid in understanding the transmission and possible role of viruses on host health in the wild. Metagenomics of viruses, utilises the power of NGS for the discovery, analysis and characterisation of viruses, thereby enabling virome analysis and providing insight into viruses for which these birds act as a natural reservoir. The use of the metagenomic technique in bird samples can lead to the determination of the virome from an individual bird or a population, and the identification of various novel avian viruses3,5,6. Nevertheless, only a few studies have explored the viruses circulating among wild ducks in Australia3,4,5,6.In the current study, we collected fresh duck faecal samples from a single location at various time points. Metagenomics of viruses was carried out to detect and characterise avian viruses present in the sample of Australian wild ducks using a protocol optimised in our laboratory and described earlier3. We previously focused on avian parvoviruses and picornaviruses from these duck samples as they were found to be abundant compared to other avian viruses6. We also reported a reassorted low pathogenicity H9N2 avian influenza virus with intercontinental gene segments in Chestnut teal samples collected on August 20181. It was the first report of an H9N2 avian influenza virus in resident wild birds in Australia1. In the current study, we focus on the sequence characterisation of additional avian DNA and RNA viruses from multiple virus families that were present in the Australian wild ducks. We aimed to determine the abundance of the different viruses in Australian wild ducks and the factors that might influence the ecology of these viruses in relation to host species.ResultsWe have previously described viruses belonging to the virus families Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae from our duck samples as they had the most abundant virus reads generated6. Avian viruses belonging to virus families other than Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae are described here and were detected and characterised in samples from Pacific black ducks (PBD12.16, PBD05.18 and PBD08.18), Chestnut teals (CT08.18 and CT11.18) and Grey teals (GT11.18) (Table 1). From the Chestnut teal (CT05.18) and Wood duck (WD08.18) samples collected in May and August 2018, respectively, no other avian viruses were detected other than those previously described viruses belonging to Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae6.Table 1 Avian viruses detected and characterised from the duck samples.Full size tableDNA viruses characterised from the duck samplesTwo DNA viruses, in addition to the parvoviruses already described6, were detected and characterised from the duck samples, one belonging to the virus family Adenoviridae and another to Anelloviridae.Aviadenovirus from Pacific black duck (PBDAdV/PBD12.16)A brief account of this avian virus detected in this sample was provided earlier3. However, more nucleotide sequences were generated by resequencing the sample at a greater depth. A total of 37,832 nucleotides (out of ~ 43 kb) of adenovirus sequence was generated from seven consensus sequences of the virus with a coverage ranging from 2 to 4456 (Supplementary material 1 Row 1–7 and Supplementary material 2 Fig. S1). The seven consensus sequences of the Pacific black duck aviadenovirus encoded the dUTPase, ORF52, ORF2, ORF14, ORF12, IVa2, DNA polymerase, pTP, partial 52 K, complete pIIIa, penton base protein, pVII, pX, minor capsid protein VI, hexon, protease, DNA binding protein, 100 K, 22 K, 33 K, pVIII, U-exon, partial fibre, complete ORF22, ORF20, ORF56, ORF19 (lipase), partial ORF54, partial ORF19B and complete ORF53. The amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase showed that the PBDAdV/PBD12.16 was only 81.9% (1028/1255 amino acids) identical to the closest sequence in NCBI which is a Muscovy duck adenovirus 2 from France in the year 19777 (KJ469653.1), and only 81.5% (1024/1255 amino acids) identical to JF510462.1 Goose adenovirus 4 from Hungary8 (Fig. 1). The species demarcation criteria of the genus Aviadenovirus by ICTV is based on DNA polymerase phylogenetic distance (> 5–15% distance matrix), genomic organisation, RFLP analysis, host range, pathogenicity, cross-neutralization and ability to recombine9. From the PBDAdV/PBD12.16 consensus sequences generated here and based on the DNA polymerase phylogenetic analysis and host species; this virus can be considered potentially as a new species. BLASTP analysis of these protein sequences showed that some of them are more identical but still distant to their counterparts expressed by the KJ469653.1 Muscovy duck adenovirus 2 or the KR135164.1 Muscovy duck adenovirus 2, while others to that of JF510462.1 Goose adenovirus 4 (Supplementary Material 1 Column J).Figure 1Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the DNA polymerase of Pacific black duck aviadenovirus (PBDAdV/PBD12.16). The amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed by using the maximum likelihood method based on the LG + G model72 in MEGA771 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 20 amino acid sequences and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset contained a total of 936 amino acid positions. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap values and only bootstrap values at or above 60% are shown. Pacific black aviadenovirus is shown in blue and marked with a black triangle.Full size imageFrom the generated consensus sequences, 18 genes have been identified (IVa2–fibre) to be located in the central region of the Pacific black duck adenovirus genome. Thirty genes or ORFs (out of 34–36 genes) were found in total from the seven consensus sequences of the virus. The motifs and other sequence or amino acid features found such as bipartite nuclear localisation signals have been given in the Supplementary material 1 Column K.Gyrovirus from Grey teal (GTGV/GT11.18)A novel gyrovirus was found in the single Grey teal sample (GT11.18). Real-time PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing were carried out and were successful for the Grey teal gyrovirus for the region from 264th to 761st nucleotide. A near-complete genome of 1549 nucleotides long consensus sequences encoding complete VP1, VP2 and hypothetical VP3 protein of GTGV/GT11.18 was generated from the NGS reads of the sample with a coverage ranging from 2 to 105 (Supplementary material 1 Row 47). The phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 protein sequence of the Grey teal gyrovirus shows that it is distantly related to other currently known gyroviruses (Fig. 2). Gyroviruses were recently classified into the family Anelloviridae, and the species demarcation criteria of some of the genera in the family Anelloviridae are based on ORF1/VP1 (capsid) protein with a nucleotide divergence of > 35%10. Hence, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 protein sequence the Grey teal gyrovirus can be considered as a new virus species. The GTGV/GT11.18 was relatively most identical, but still distant, to MH378452.1 gyrovirus from Ashy storm petrel faecal sample from the US in 2012 with 55.2% (159/288 amino acids) identity only. The GTGV/GT11.18 was also distantly related to the Southern screamer gyrovirus (MH016740.1) from the US in 200711 with 52.4% identity only in the VP1 protein sequence.Figure 2Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the VP1 protein of Grey teal gyrovirus (GTGV/GT11.18). The amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed using the maximum likelihood method based on the WAG + G + I + F model73 in MEGACC74 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 22 amino acid sequences and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset contained a total of 233 amino acid positions. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap values and only bootstrap values at or above 60% are shown. Grey teal gyrovirus is shown in blue and marked with a blue diamond. (F) shows faecal samples.Full size imageThe VP1 protein of the GTGV/GT11.18 contained the motif 141WWRWA145, and also had a high number of basic amino acids, especially arginines in its N-terminal region. The minimal signature motif for the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPase) superfamily CX5R (46CSCGNFR52) and the motif 34WX7HX3CXCX5H54 was found in the VP2 protein, suggesting that this protein may exhibit PTPase function12,13. It is also to be noted that the VP3 protein did not have any apoptin conserved protein domains.RNA viruses characterised from the duck samplesThe RNA viruses, in addition to the picornaviruses already described6, detected and characterised from the duck samples belonged to the virus families Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae and Coronaviridae.Avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black duck (PBDORV/PBD08.18)From the Pacific black duck 08.18 sample, an orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae, was detected and characterised. All the 10 segments were detected and a total of 21,170 nucleotides (out of ~ 23 kb) of the consensus sequence of the Pacific black duck orthoreovirus genome were generated with a coverage from 2 to 336 (Supplementary material 1 Row 16–29). Table 2 provides the details on the avian orthoreovirus from the PBD08.18 sample along with the percentage identity to the closest relative of the nucleotide sequences and the proteins encoded by each segment. The analysis of the protein sequences showed that they were closely related to other avian orthoreoviruses with > 96% identity (for example, Fig. S2 of Supplementary material 2), except for the proteins p10, p17 and sigma C encoded by segment S1. However, the nucleotide sequences of the 10 segments of the PBDORV/PBD08.18 were about 84–96% identity to its closest relative, except for segment S1 (Table 2). The phylogenetic analysis of the assembled consensus sequence of the sigma C protein from segment S1 was most identical, but still distant, to the JX145334.1 Goose orthoreovirus sigma C protein from China in the year 200314 and JX478256.1 Pekin duck orthoreovirus sigma C protein from China in the year 200915 with 54.8% identity (187/341 amino acids) than to any other orthoreovirus sigma C proteins (Fig. 3). The partial p10 protein and complete p17 protein were most identical but still distant to MH520081.1 Mallard orthoreovirus p10 protein from Germany16 with 67.2% identity and to JX478256.1 Pekin duck orthoreovirus p17 protein from China15 with 52.1% identity, respectively (Table 2).Table 2 Details on the avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black duck 08.18 sample (PBDORV/PBD08.18).Full size tableFigure 3Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the sigma C protein of Pacific black duck orthoreovirus segment S1 (PBDORV/S1/PBD08.18). The amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed by using the maximum likelihood method based on the WAG + G + F model73 in MEGACC74 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 18 amino acid sequences and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset contained a total of 257 amino acid positions. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap values and only bootstrap values at or above 60% are shown. Pacific black orthoreovirus is shown in blue and marked with a black triangle. No orthologous sigma C protein was found in Broome ORV, Baboon ORV and Mahlapitsi ORV.Full size imageRotavirus G from Pacific black duck (PBDRVG/PBD08.18)Rotavirus G also belongs to the virus family Reoviridae and was detected and characterised from the PBD08.18 sample. All the 11 segments of the virus were detected and characterised. A total of 17,808 nucleotides (out of ~ 18 kb) of the consensus sequence of the Pacific black duck rotavirus G genome were generated with a coverage of 2–512 (Supplementary material 1 Row 30–40). It should be noted that all the segments have been named as per the rotavirus G NCBI RefSeq sequence (NC021580.1 to NC021590.1). Table 3 provides the details on the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 along with the percentage identity to the closest relative for each segment. Out of the 11 proteins encoded by the 11 segments of Pacific black duck rotavirus G, seven proteins were most closely related to their orthologous proteins of Grey teal rotavirus G from south west Victoria, Australia from 20175 with 87.2–99.6% identity (Table 3). Segment 7, encoding the NSP3 protein, was most closely related to the MK204407.1 Grey teal partial NSP3 protein (only 152 amino acids given) from Australia in the year 20175 with 64.9% identity. The complete NSP3 protein of the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 was most identical but still distant to KY689682.1 Turkey rotavirus G from the US in the year 201617 with 44.3% identity only. It should also be noted that the NSP4 protein was not generated from the Grey teal sample from Australia5 and hence was not available for comparison. The VP4 and the VP7 protein of the Pacific black duck rotavirus G were also distantly related to the orthologous proteins of Grey teal rotavirus G from Australia5. The nucleotide sequences of all the segments of the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 were only about 56–98% identity to its closest relative.Table 3 Details on the rotavirus G from Pacific black duck 08.18 sample (PBDRVG/PBD08.18).Full size tableFrom the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 and the VP6 protein (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3 of Supplementary Material 2), it is clear that the rotavirus G forms two different clades. Clade A includes the rotavirus G from chicken18, turkey17, avocet19 and pigeon while Clade B includes the rotavirus G from the Pacific black duck, Grey teal5 and Ruddy turnstone19.Figure 4Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the VP6 protein of Pacific black duck rotavirus G segment S6 (PBDRVG/PBD08.18). The amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed by using the maximum likelihood method based on the LG + G + F model72 in MEGACC74 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 16 amino acid sequences and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset contained a total of 371 amino acid positions. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap values and only bootstrap values at or above 60% are shown. Pacific black rotavirus G is shown in blue and marked with a black triangle.Full size imageVarious motifs found in the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 partial VP3 protein of segment 4 varied to those found in VP3 protein of the other rotavirus G. For example, in lieu of an EXXFXXXN motif in the N-terminal region18, the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 has an EXXFXXXS motif; and in lieu of an ALYXLSNXXN motif in the central region18, the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 has an ALYXISNXXN motif in the central region. Also, the putative guanylyl transferase KXTAMDXEXP and KXXGNNH motifs found in rotavirus A and C20 were not found in the Pacific black duck rotavirus G, as observed for other rotavirus G sequences18. The conserved domain HGXGHXRXV at 229 to 237 amino acid and histidine triad His-X-His-X-His-XX at 229–234 amino acid of the NSP2 protein that aid in the binding of nucleoside triphosphate21 was found in the NSP2 protein. The five fully conserved cysteine residues were found in the partial VP7 of the PBDRVG/PBD08.18 at the expected location, which in turns forms the disulphide bonds that is thought to stabilise the protein structure18.Rotavirus F from Chestnut teal (CTRVF/CT08.18)From the Chestnut teal 08.18 sample, a few good quality NGS reads of Chestnut teal rotavirus F were detected and characterised. The NGS reads were mapped to segment 7 of the virus encoding partial NSP3 protein. Further analysis led to the generation of a 647 nucleotides long consensus sequences with a coverage of 2–11 with a minimum mapping quality of 80 or higher (Supplementary material 1 Row 42). The partial NSP3 protein, which regulates the virus mRNA translation18, was relatively closely identical to the JQ920001.1 Chicken rotavirus F from Germany in the year 200318 with 88.8% (191/215 amino acids) identity.Avastrovirus from Pacific black duck (PBDAstV/PBD05.18) and Chestnut teal (CTAstV/CT11.18)From the Pacific black duck 05.18 sample and Chestnut teal 11.18 sample we detected and characterised two astroviruses that belong to the virus family Astroviridae and the genus Avastrovirus. A total of 3443 nucleotides (out of ~ 7 kb) of the consensus sequence of the Pacific black duck avastrovirus genome was generated. In comparison, a total of 4185 nucleotides of the consensus sequence for the Chestnut teal avastrovirus genome was generated (Supplementary material 1 Row 12–15 and 43–46 and Supplementary material 2 Fig. S4). The -1 ribosomal frameshift signal was found to be from the 79th to 85th nucleotides of the 738 nucleotides long consensus sequence encoding partial ORF1a and ORF1b of the PBDAstV/PBD05.18 and from the 1026th to 1032nd nucleotides of the 1,554 nucleotides long consensus sequence encoding partial ORF1a and ORF1b of the CTAstV/CT11.18. The phylogenetic analysis of the partial capsid protein (ORF2) encoding consensus sequence (PBDAstV/1297nt/PBD05.18) of the PBDAstV showed that it was most identical, but still distant to KJ020899.1 Duck astrovirus from China in 201322 with 83.1% (356/428 amino acids) identity only (Fig. 5). The phylogenetic analysis of the partial capsid protein (ORF2) encoding consensus sequence (CTAstV/1564nt/CT11.18) of the CTAstV showed that it was closely related to JX985715.1 Northern pintail astrovirus from China in the year 200923 with 98.0% (251/256 amino acids) identity (Fig. 5) while having only 85.2% identity (655/768 nucleotides) at the nucleotide level. The amino acid sequence of the partial capsid region of Chestnut teal astrovirus (CTAstV/1564nt/CT11.18) is only 41.4% identical to the Pacific black duck astrovirus partial capsid region (PBDAstV/1297nt/PBD05.18). Analysis of other proteins encoded by the consensus sequences of the duck avastroviruses showed differences in the identity to their closest relative (Supplementary material 1 Column J).Figure 5Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of the partial capsid protein (ORF2) of Pacific black duck avastrovirus (PBDAstV/1297nt/PBD05.18) and Chestnut teal avastrovirus (CTAstV/1564nt/CT11.18). The amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed by using the maximum likelihood method based on the LG + G model72 in MEGACC74 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 24 amino acid sequences and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The final dataset contained a total of 224 amino acid positions. The numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap values and only bootstrap values at or above 60% are shown. Pacific black avastrovirus is shown in blue and marked with a black triangle and Chestnut teal avastrovirus is shown in blue and marked with a brown square.Full size imageCalicivirus from Pacific black duck (PBDCV/PBD12.16)From the Pacific black duck December 2016 sample, we detected and characterised a duck calicivirus, belonging to the virus family Caliciviridae. A total of 4,710 nucleotides (out of ~ 8.3 kb) of the consensus sequence of the virus genome were generated. Five consensus sequences of 305 nucleotides, 1596 nucleotides, 331 nucleotides, 1129 nucleotides, and 1112 nucleotides encoding partial ORF1 were generated with a coverage from 2–90 (Supplementary material 1 Row 6–10). Another consensus sequence of 237 nucleotides long was generated encoding partial VP2 protein (Supplementary material 1 Row 11). These sequences had the characteristic motifs of a calicivirus at the expected location in the amino acid sequence (Supplementary material 1 Column K). The Pacific black duck calicivirus consensus sequences showed 96.3% to 97.2% identity at the nucleotide level (blastn) to the MK204392.1 Grey teal calicivirus from south west Victoria, Australia in the year 20175. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the partial ORF1 containing Helicase motif (PBDCV/1596nt/PBD12.16) and the RdRp region (PBDCV/1129nt/PBD12.16) showed these to be 100% identical to the MK204392.1 Grey teal calicivirus ORF1 protein. In comparison, the VP1 region (PBDCV/1112nt/PBD12.16) was 99.4% (368/370 amino acids) identical to the MK204392.1 Grey teal calicivirus ORF1 protein (Fig. S5 of Supplementary material 2), while being distantly related to the other caliciviruses with 36.2–45.6% (134–169/370 amino acid) identity only. However, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 region and genus demarcation criteria of the family Caliciviridae24, the calicivirus from the PBD12.16 sample belongs to the genus Nacovirus.Gammacoronavirus from Chestnut tealFrom the Chestnut teal 08.18 sample, a few good quality reads of gammacoronavirus were detected and characterised. Further analysis led to the generation of a short 382 nucleotides long consensus sequence with a coverage of 2–9 (Supplementary material 1 Row 41). The BLASTN analysis of the short consensus sequences shows that it is 100% identical to the MK204393.1 Grey teal gammacoronavirus from Australia in the year 20175. Further analysis of this virus was not carried out due to the low quantity and short consensus sequence.DiscussionPreviously, we described in detail the metagenomics methodology that can be used to detect and characterise both DNA and RNA viruses from bird faecal samples3. Using this method, we have now conducted a surveillance study of Australian wild ducks from which faecal samples were collected at different time points from a single location. As reported earlier1,3,4,6 and also shown in the current study, we were able to detect and characterise both DNA and RNA viruses. We were also able to characterise novel viruses from these ducks6.In the current study, details on the genome sequences of a duck aviadenovirus genetically different to currently known waterfowl aviadenoviruses and a novel gyrovirus are provided. We also report what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first finding of an avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black ducks and a rotavirus F from Chestnut teals, albeit being a short partial sequence from segment 7 of the rotavirus genome.The Pacific black duck aviadenovirus characterised here belongs to the genus Aviadenovirus. Adenoviruses belonging to the genus Aviadenovirus have been found in, but not limited to, chickens25, turkeys26, geese8, pigeons and ducks7. The abundance of the Pacific black duck aviadenovirus in the juvenile Pacific black ducks faecal sample (PBD12.16) might indicate active infection and shedding of the virus from these birds. Analysis of the virus proteins showed that some of them were more identical but still distant to their counterparts expressed by the KJ469653.1 Muscovy duck adenovirus 2, while others to that of JF510462.1 Goose adenovirus 4. Nevertheless, the Pacific black duck aviadenovirus was almost equidistant from both the viruses in the maximum likelihood tree generated. This analysis is consistent with our previous analysis of the PBDAdV/PBD12.16 virus, as reported from the very short sequences generated3 before resequencing of the sample. From the central region of the partial Pacific black duck aviadenovirus genome, 18 genes (IVa2–fibre) were found in total which are common to all adenoviruses and said to be inherited from a common ancestor of all known adenoviruses8. However, only a partial fibre gene sequence was generated from the NGS data, and hence at this point, it is uncertain if the PBDAdV/PBD12.16 have one fibre gene like the Fowl adenovirus 825 or two fibre genes like the Goose adenovirus 48. Among the ORFs, ORF2 contained Parvovirus NS1 superfamily domain at 2nd–191st amino acids, as seen in some of the other waterfowl aviadenoviruses8. As reported earlier6, in the PBD12.16 sample, we detected an adeno-associated virus which may utilise the Pacific black duck aviadenovirus as a helper virus for its replication. However, currently, how the ORF2 protein assists the adeno-associated virus replication is uncertain.A novel gyrovirus was found in the Grey teal 11.18 sample and was distantly related to other gyroviruses. Gyroviruses have been recently reclassified in the Anelloviridae family12. Gyroviruses have been found in cloacal, oral, and blood samples from birds27,28,29 and faecal samples of carnivorous mammals such as ferrets, cats and also humans30,31,32,33,34. However, the natural host of gyroviruses is thought to be birds. The finding of the GTGV/GT11.18 contributes to the wide genetic diversity of the gyroviruses. The Southern screamer gyrovirus (MH016740.1)11, the only other gyrovirus from a bird belonging to the order Anseriformes yet characterised, was distantly related to the Grey teal gyrovirus. Despite being very different to currently known gyroviruses, genetic analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of the VP1 protein is rich in basic amino acids and is a characteristic shared by all members of the Anelloviridae family12. The motif 173WWRWA177 in the VP1 protein of the GTGV/GT11.18 also appears to be conserved for all gyroviruses30. The VP2 of the GTGV/GT11.18 has the characteristic motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases which is the CX5R motif and the WX7HX3CXCX5H motif, that is conserved in other gyroviruses and anelloviruses12,13. A minimal signature motif with the configuration CX5R is highly conserved in all PTPases. PTPases catalyse the removal of phosphate from phosphotyrosine35 and may be important for the replication of the virus13. The VP3 protein of many gyroviruses, such as chicken anaemia virus, has some important motifs related to the induction of apoptosis in infected cells29,36,37,38. However, similar to some other gyroviruses from zoo and wild birds, no such related motif was found in the GTGV/GT11.18.Reoviruses were detected and characterised in both Pacific black ducks and Chestnut teals collected in August 2018, which suggest that these reovirus infections may be more common in winter compared to other seasons. Other reovirus seasonal distribution studies in humans and chickens also show reovirus infections to be high during colder months of the year39,40,41.The sigma C protein of the Pacific black duck orthoreovirus that forms part of the outer capsid and helps in host cell attachment of the virus particle42 was only 54.5% identical to its nearest homologous avian virus protein counterpart. This may be because of a specific host adaptation and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an avian orthoreovirus from Pacific black ducks and more widely from a wild duck in Australia. It is also to be noted that sigma C is the most variable protein of avian orthoreoviruses and antibodies to this protein can neutralise the virus infection43. Nevertheless, further studies are required to determine whether the Pacific black duck orthoreovirus can infect other closely related host species that can lead to reassortment. However, the analysis of the other encoded proteins of the virus suggests that this virus may infect closely related host species leading to reassortment.All the 11 segments of a Pacific black duck rotavirus G were detected and characterised from the PBD08.18 sample. The phylogenetic analysis of the VP6 protein, one of the most conserved proteins that form the intermediate layer of the capsid44, and the phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 protein that functions as the RdRp45,46 shows that rotavirus G forms two different clades. Clade B includes the rotavirus G from the Pacific black duck, Grey teal5 and Ruddy turnstone19 (all three viruses from Australia). In contrast, clade A includes the rotavirus G from chicken18, turkey17, avocet19 (from Australia) and pigeon (unpublished). The most diverse segments of PBDRVG/PBD08.18 were S3 (VP4 protein), S9 (VP7 protein) and S10 (NSP4 protein). VP4 and VP7 form part of the outer capsid and the genetic diversity may be due to host-related immune selection pressure. However, the NSP4, which act as a viral enterotoxin, is only 53.7% identical to its closest relative and could indicate the presence of a diverse group of rotavirus G in this wildlife population that may exhibit different patterns of virulence in these hosts.The complete genome of rotavirus F has only been molecularly characterised from chickens18, although partial sequences of the same have been detected and characterised from a pig (unpublished) and partridge47. The current study is the first to detect and characterise rotavirus F from a duck species, albeit only a partial segment being identified. This is due to the low amount of virus (0.0001% of NGS reads) present in the sample. The genetic diversity and evolution of rotavirus F are less understood due to the limited characterisation of the virus, and further studies involving more infected duck samples may help in its elucidation.The phylogenetic analysis of the avastrovirus from Pacific black ducks and Chestnut teals suggest that these viruses are quite different to one another with ~ 60% difference albeit being detected from the same location at different time points. This indicates the wide genetic diversity of the avastroviruses.The Pacific black duck orthoreovirus (except for the segment S1) and the Pacific black duck rotavirus G from the PBD08.18 sample, and the Chestnut teal avastrovirus from the CT11.18 sample showed conservation at the amino acid sequences while being more distantly related at the nucleotide level to their closest relatives, respectively. Taken together, this may indicate that there is significant evolutionary distanceime between a common ancestor of the viruses, but that conservation at the amino acid sequence of the protein is subjected to a strong selective pressure. The conservation of protein structure across different avian hosts may also indicate that these viruses may be capable of cross-species infection or that cross-species infection is part of their evolutionary history. The close relatedness of the Northern pintail avastrovirus detected from China23 to the Chestnut teal avastrovirus suggests that the migration of birds (likely migratory shorebirds) along the East Asian—Australasian Flyway could be important in the evolution of these viruses, as similarly observed for an avian paramyxovirus 6 characterised earlier from a Pacific black duck sample collected from the same site 18 months prior to this sample3.The Pacific black duck calicivirus is very closely related to the MK204392.1 Grey teal calicivirus from south west Victoria, Australia5. The Pacific black duck collection site is about 375 km away from the MK204392.1 Grey teal calicivirus collection site and was taken three months prior to the sample collected from the Grey teal. Both Pacific black duck and Grey teal are dabbling ducks found in Australia that may share habitat at any particular time point. Dabbling ducks can travel about 25 km to hundreds of kilometres per day48,49. Caliciviruses are thought to be transmitted through direct contact with an infected host or indirectly via oral-faecal route50. Thus, the calicivirus detected in the current study may indicate cross-species transmission and infection occurs between these related duck species.It should be noted that at the collection time, no clinical signs of disease were observed in the ducks and no close physical or extended examination such as post mortem or histopathological examination, was carried out. However, the high abundance of virus reads for some of the viruses from the bird samples may indicate an active infection and shedding of the virus. Aviadenoviruses can cause gizzard erosion or severe, often fatal cases of hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome or inclusion body hepatitis depending on the virus and the host species25,51,52. For viruses in the genus Gyrovirus, Chicken anaemia virus is so far known to be the only pathogenic member of that genus12 causing an economically important clinical and subclinical disease in young chickens, with a worldwide distribution53. Nonetheless, a gyrovirus was also sequenced from Northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and Southern screamers (Chauna torquata) with neurological clinical signs11,28, as well as from healthy birds11.Although avian orthoreoviruses have been associated with various disease conditions, a direct link between the virus and disease has been demonstrated only for viral arthritis syndrome or tenosynovitis in chickens42. However, avian orthoreoviruses were sequenced from diseased Muscovy ducks that had severe haemorrhagic and necrotic lesions in the liver and spleen54 and from Pekin ducks that had spleen necrosis55. Rotavirus G and rotavirus F were found in chickens with the runting-stunting syndrome; however, its role in the disease remains unclear56.Among birds, astroviruses have been associated with various diseases such as enteritis, hepatitis, nephritis and runting-stunning syndrome57,58,59. However, the pathogenicity of the viruses described in the current study is currently unknown, and further studies involving histopathological examinations are required for its elucidation. Nevertheless, all of the viruses described in the current study may spread through the faecal-oral route27,42,60 and may cause asymptomatic infections as observed of the wild ducks in the current study.The current study was carried out by sampling several representative bird species from a bird community at specific time points from a single location in an effort to comprehend virus diversity, abundance and seasonal prevalence. The Grey teal gyrovirus was the most abundant virus (414 reads at Q ≥ 20) from the GT11.18 sample and exceeded the two parvoviruses previously reported from this sample with 141 and 222 reads at Q ≥ 20 respectively6. The generation of the partial sequences of the other avian viruses from the duck samples described here may be due to various factors, including but not limited to, virus particle quantity, stage of infection and library preparation. Also, as stated earlier, the most abundant avian virus from each of the duck samples, except for the GT11.18 sample, was either an avian parvovirus or an avian picornavirus6. Future studies involving more extensive sample collection may lead to the complete genome elucidation of the viruses described here. However, the presence of motifs at the expected location in the generated virus consensus sequences suggests that they form part of a functional virus genome, although the description of each motif functions is beyond the scope of the manuscript. Furthermore, taken together with the previously described viruses1,3,4,6, the detection of more than one virus from each sample indicates co-infection, which could have a more significant health impact on the host when compared to infection with an individual virus.Detection and characterisation of several potentially pathogenic avian viruses, some genetically novel while others similar to those detected in other avian hosts, indicates further virus surveillance studies of wild ducks are warranted. Ducks being a natural reservoir of pathogenic and zoonotic viruses should be monitored continuously to detect any potential threat to other wildlife and humans. Future pathological studies on the pathogenicity of the characterised viruses will also aid in comprehending the host–virus relationship.Materials and methodsSample collectionThe current study uses the samples reported earlier6. Fresh wild duck faecal samples of Pacific black ducks (PBD), Chestnut teals (CT), Grey teals (GT) and Wood ducks (WD) were collected in May 2018 (late autumn), August 2018 (late winter), November 2018 and December 2016 (late spring/early summer) from Wallington, south-eastern Victoria, Australia. Pacific black ducks were captured in May 2018 (PBD05.18), August 2018 (PBD08.18) and December 2016 (PBD12.16 (described as MAD previously3)). Chestnut teal samples were collected in May (CT05.18), August (CT08.18) and November 2018 (CT11.18). Grey teal samples were collected in November 2018 (GT11.18) only, while Wood duck samples were collected in August 2018 (WD08.18) only. All samples were stored at − 80 °C within 1–3 h of collection until processing.Bird sample collection was approved under Deakin University’s Animal Ethics Committee project number B43–2016 and Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning permit number 1008206. The current study involving these samples were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.Virus enrichment from samplesVirus particles enrichment and virus nucleic acid extraction was carried out as per a previously optimised protocol in our laboratory3. Briefly, the faecal samples were subjected to various biophysical methods such as homogenisation (25 Hz for 2 min), centrifugation (17000×g for 3 min) and filtration using a 0.8 µm PES filter (17000×g for 1 min). The sample was then divided into two aliquots (aliquot A—ultracentrifuged, aliquot B—non-ultracentrifuged) as described earlier3. Both aliquots were then nuclease treated using benzonase and micrococcal nuclease (37 °C for 2 h), followed by nucleic acid extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen), as previously described3.Next-generation sequencing (NGS)cDNA synthesis and amplification was carried out using the SeqPlex RNA Amplification Kit (Sigma) as per the manufacturer’s instructions using the extracted virus nucleic acids from both aliquots of the samples. Next generation sequencing library preparation was performed using the Ion Fragment Library kit (Life Technologies) followed by quantification of libraries, as described earlier3. Libraries were then pooled and were loaded onto Ion 530 or 540 chips using the Ion Chef Instrument. Template preparation was carried out and then the chips were run on an Ion Torrent S5XL System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per company protocols and as described earlier3.NGS data analysesNGS data analyses were carried out as described earlier3,6,61,62. Two local BLAST datasets were created for all the available virus sequences and all RefSeq virus sequences from the NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database (Dec 2018), as described earlier6. BLASTN and TBLASTX query against the two virus reference sequence databases was performed with an e-value cut-off of 1 × 10−10 and 1 × 10–30. The query results files were converted into spreadsheet files, sorted by virus matches, a list of potential virus targets created and then viruses of interest were identified for each sample, as described earlier3,6.The NGS reads were mapped against reference virus genomes of interest using the TMAP plugin on the Ion Torrent server. The mapped reads were used to obtain full or partial consensus sequences of the viruses using Integrative Genomics Viewer software (IGV) (Broad Institute, MA, USA), as described earlier3,6,61,62. Contigs were generated from the AssemblerSPAdes 5.6.0 plugin on the Ion Torrent Server by using the NGS reads of each sample. The contigs were bioinformatically analysed to identify virus sequences as described above using the same e-value cut-offs. Virus contigs (> 500 nucleotides) were then used as references in TMAP plugin and trimmed to regions with a mapping quality of 80 or higher and a coverage depth of at least 2 unless specified, as described earlier3,6. Virus sequences were also generated by assembling overlapping sequences from contigs and consensus sequences by using MEGA7 and magicblast63. Final virus consensus sequences were then generated after subjecting the sequences again to TMAP and mapping using IGV, as described above.Grey teal gyrovirus PCR and Sanger sequencingReal-time PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing were carried out for Grey teal gyrovirus from the GT11.18 sample for the region from 264th to 761st nucleotide, as a potential indication of this virus being different from other gyroviruses was observed during NGS analysis. The GTGV/GT11.18 was the most abundant virus from the sample compared to the two parvoviruses previously reported6, and the region of PCR analysis had NGS reads with very low abundance. Primer-BLAST64 software was used to design two sets of primers (Micormon—Monash University, Victoria, Australia). FP1-GTGV-347nt (5′-CCCGGAAACCTGTACGAGTC-3′) RP1-GTGV-761nt (5′-TCTCCTGTAGTGGCGTCTGA-3′) and FP2-GTGV-264nt (5′-TCCTGTGGCAACTTTCGGAG-3′) RP2-GTGV-756nt (5′-TGTAGTGGCGTCTGAATCGG-3′) were used as the forward and reverse primers. The PCR master mix was prepared with 2X AmpliTaq Gold™ 360 Master Mix with 1 mM of each primer and 2 µl of DNA in a total reaction volume of 10 µl. The PCR reaction was carried out in QuantStudio™ Flex 6 real-time thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final step of 72 °C for 3 min. This is followed by a melt curve stage of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min and 95 °C for 15 s and a final hold at 4 °C. The two PCR products of ~ 434 bp size and ~ 512 bp size, respectively, were purified using the 2% Size Select E-Gel System (Thermo Fisher, USA). These products were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle v3.1 on a Hitachi 3500XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) as per the manufacture instructions.ORF prediction and motif analysisBasic Local Alignment Search Tool65,66 (BLASTN, BLASTX and BLASTP), NCBI ORFfinder67, ScanProsite68 and PSORT II69 were used for identifying open reading frames (ORFs), and features of the virus genomes such as promotors, motifs and nuclear-locating signals, as described earlier6. The presence of these features in their expected location was used as an additional confirmation of the generated consensus sequences.Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequencesRelevant related sequences were selected from the NCBI GenBank database. Nucleotide and protein sequences were aligned using Clustal-W70 in MEGA 771 software. MEGA7/MEGACC software was used to identify the best evolutionary model and the selected model was then used for generating the maximum likelihood tree with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The distance data between sequences were calculated using the same software. Data availability All sequences analysed have been deposited in NCBI GenBank under accession numbers MT894381-MT894428. Other datasets generated or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. ReferencesBhatta, T.

View all partners Languages Français English Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Many of us have heard: “Don’t go outside without a coat; you’ll catch a cold.” That’s not exactly true. As with many things, the reality is more complicated. Here’s the distinction: Being cold isn’t why you get a cold. But it is true that cold weather makes it easier to get the cold or flu. It is still too early to tell how weather impacts the COVID-19 virus, but scientists are starting to think it behaves differently than cold and flu viruses. As an associate professor of nursing with a background in public health, I’m asked about this all the time. So here’s a look at what actually happens. Many viruses, including rhinovirus – the usual culprit in the common cold – and influenza, remain infectious longer and replicate faster in colder temperatures. That’s why these viruses spread more easily in winter. Wearing a heavy coat won’t necessarily make a difference. The cold weather does have an impact on whether or not you catch a cold. Spencer Platt via Getty Images Virus transmission is easier when it’s cold More specifically, cold weather can change the outer membrane of the influenza virus; it makes the membrane more solid and rubbery. Scientists believe that the rubbery coating makes person-to-person transmission of the virus easier. It’s not just cold winter air that causes a problem. Air that is dry in addition to cold has been linked to flu outbreaks. A National Institutes of Health study suggests that dry winter air further helps the influenza virus to remain infectious longer. How your immune system responds during cold weather also matters a great deal. Inhaling cold air may adversely affect the immune response in your respiratory tract, which makes it easier for viruses to take hold. That’s why wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth may help. Also, most people get less sunlight in the winter. That is a problem because the Sun is a major source of vitamin D, which is essential for immune system health. Physical activity, another factor, also tends to drop during the winter. People are three times more likely to delay exercise in snowy or icy conditions. Instead, people spend more time indoors. That usually means more close contact with others, which leads to disease spread. Respiratory viruses generally spread within a six-foot radius of an infected person. When you are indoors, it is very likely that you are closer together than six feet. In addition, cold weather dries out your eyes and the mucous membranes in your nose and throat. Because viruses that cause colds and flu are typically inhaled, the virus can attach more easily to these impaired, dried-out passages. Spending more time indoors can increase the chances of catching a cold. Rawpixel via Getty Images What you can do While the bottom line is that being wet and cold doesn’t make you sick, there are strategies to help prevent illness all year long. Wash your hands often. Avoid touching your face, something people do between nine and 23 times an hour. Stay hydrated; eight glasses a day of water is a good goal, but that could be more or less depending on lifestyle and the size of the person. Eat a well-balanced diet. Dark green, leafy vegetables are rich in immune system-supporting vitamins; eggs, fortified milk, salmon and tuna have vitamin D. Stay physically active, even during the winter. Clean the hard, high-touch surfaces in your home often. If your nose or throat gets dry in the winter, consider using a humidifier. Get the flu vaccine. And one more important thing this year: When it’s your turn, make sure you get the COVID-19 vaccine.

I am getting conflicting information from my health care providers concerning flu shots. My primary care doctor says that the flu shots are contraindicated for West Nile victims; my pharmacist says the vaccinations are OK; and my hematologist is unsure. I would like to get a flu shot and a vaccination for COVID-19 when available. Please give me a definite answer.—P.H.L.Dear P.H.L.: West Nile virus was relatively unknown in the U.S. until 1999, when an outbreak occurred in New York, but WNV now has been found in all the continental states and Canadian provinces. It is an arbovirus, related to the Japanese encephalitis virus. As such, it can cause neurological symptoms, including meningitis and encephalitis. It may also cause an acute flaccid paralysis, similar to poliomyelitis. Only polio virus causes poliomyelitis, and polio only exists in the wild in Afghanistan and Pakistan now, but several viruses can cause symptoms that act similarly. Although many people recover partially or fully, a third of people with acute flaccid paralysis do not recover.There is no definitive answer on flu shots, because it’s an unusual situation and there are little data. However, I found no published information that would lead me to recommend against a flu vaccine in people with neurological compromise due to West Nile virus. I suspect your primary doctor is concerned because there is a syndrome from West Nile similar to Guillain-Barre, about which there is controversy about flu vaccines. It is very unlikely that you have paraplegia from a Guillain-Barre syndrome from West Nile. Even if you did, the benefits of influenza vaccine outweigh the risk, according to multiple studies.I cannot comment on any COVID-19 vaccine until efficacy and safety data from large studies are available, which is not the case as of this writing.Dear Dr. Roach: Is there a way to do a noninvasive, easily reversible vasectomy?—K.M.B.Dear K.M.B.: Vasectomy is a safe and highly effective procedure to assure permanent male sterility. Although the preferred technique in the U.S. is a no-scalpel vasectomy, in my opinion, it cannot be considered noninvasive. Minimally invasive is a more correct term.Complications are uncommon, and include infection and post-vasectomy pain syndrome (both less than 1% with the no-scalpel method). The overall rate of pregnancy after vasectomy is approximately 1 in 2,000.Vasectomy is for men who want permanent sterility: They are sure they never want children again. Men should not think of a vasectomy as a reversible procedure. Nevertheless, reversal of vasectomy is still sometimes attempted. In the best of hands, the success rate is 50% to 70%. Consequently, careful counseling is mandatory prior to vasectomy. Also, men need to know that although a successful vasectomy protects against pregnancy, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.Most men tolerate the procedure quite well. Some of my patients have noted post-procedure pain, but a few days of light activity and pain relievers is generally adequate. One or two have had unexpectedly high amounts of pain requiring more potent pain relievers for a few days.Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySite MapResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © 2024 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media NewspaperFlu numbers are down as COVID-19 cases surge in the U.S. Skip to contentLiveNewsWeatherTrafficWBTV InvestigatesOn Your Side TonightQC LifeSafety FirstSportsWBTV NewsAbout WBTVMeet the WBTV News TeamSubmit A News TipSend us your photos!TrafficLive Traffic CamsWatch LiveWeb Extra LinksNews AppsTriviaContestsCampaign 2024Election ResultsNewsNationalCabarrus CountyCatawba Co.Cleveland CountyGaston CountyHigh CountryIredell CountyMecklenburg CountyRowan CountySouth CarolinaUnion CountyCrimeHelene RecoveryHurricane HeleneEducationSubmit your first-day photos!High School SportsWeatherLatest VideoWatch Weather SpecialFirst Alert Weather HeadlinesLive RadarReport ClosingsHurricane3 Degree GuaranteeLive Traffic CamsPower OutagesHealthNational Health HeadlinesMedical MinuteCoronavirusVaccine TeamFitnessOpioid EpidemicQC KitchenWBTV RecipesMain DishesFamily RecipesSide DishesOn the GrillTasty Beverages!DessertsGood News and Good FoodLatest RecallsWBTV InvestigatesCATS InvestigationsTIMELINE: Off The RailsMedical DebtHomeowners InvestigationsConsumer SolutionsContact Us!ContestsOn TVCarolina CameraGood NewsGood QuestionOn Your Side TonightQC LifeProgramming ScheduleWBTV OriginalsCommunityDriving With Dedrick75th AnniversaryIn Our CommunityGantt Golden YearCarolina CameraHispanic Heritage MonthCalendarProject PinkAutism SpeaksForever FamilySponsor SpotlightOn-Air Talent Appearance RequestsSportsCarolina PanthersNASCARCharlotte MLSHigh SchoolThe Point AfterFootball Friday NightPowerNationZeam - News StreamsInvestigateTVWatching Your WalletGray DC BureauCircle CountryNEXTGEN TVDigital MarketingSponsoredFlu numbers are down as COVID-19 cases surge in the U.S. Flu VaccineBy Sophie Lewis | CBS NewsPublished: Dec. 19, 2020 at 6:19 PM ESTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedIn(CBS News) - Even as the COVID-19 pandemic surges across the United States, the number of people getting sick with the flu is reaching record lows. Experts say that’s partly thanks to higher vaccination rates during the pandemic.A record number of influenza vaccine doses are being produced and distributed in 2020, in an attempt to avoid a “twindemic.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 190.4 million flu vaccines have been distributed across the U.S. this season — the highest number of flu doses distributed in the U.S. during a single influenza season.Flu vaccination among adults rose 46% — from 31.1 million in 2019 to 45.3 million as of November 28.High vaccine rates, in combination with face masks, social distancing, school closures, stay-at-home orders and a lack of international travel, have led to a record low number of flu cases.Seasonal influenza activity in the U.S. remains lower than usual for this time of year, the CDC said, with .3% of specimens testing positive at clinical laboratories last week.“The unprecedented demand we’ve seen for flu shots this season, along with safety precautions everyone is taking to limit the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, wearing facemasks and frequently washing their hands, may be contributing to lower flu activity this season,” said Dr. Kevin Ban, Chief Medical Officer at Walgreens.Hospitals across the U.S. are nearing, or are at, capacity, but the lower rates of flu infection are helping to avoid further devastating pressures on the health care system. Resources typically used to handle an influx of flu cases in December can now be used to handle COVID patients instead.“Flu vaccination is especially important this season, as vaccination may help preserve medical resources and reduce the overall burden of respiratory illnesses on our health care system,” the CDC said.A similar phenomenon occurred in the Southern Hemisphere — now past its winter — which barely experienced a flu season this year.Experts are still advising that it is not too late to get the flu shot this year — and it could be more important than ever, with cases of both influenza and COVID-19 expected to surge following the holiday season.Copyright 2020 CBS News.

Now, researchers at EPFL in Switzerland have developed synthetic molecules that can kill the flu virus by mimicking human cells, and putting the squeeze on the virus when it attaches itself to the decoy.Current antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir (or Tamiflu), work by attacking the virus once it’s inside a host cell, and cutting off its ability to replicate and spread. The problem is, it has a very short window to work with – wait more than about 36 hours after infection, and its efficacy plummets. Plus viruses could develop resistance to it through widespread use.For the new study, the EPFL team set out to develop an alternative that ideally would be effective against a range of seasonal influenza strains and didn’t cause severe side effects in patients. The researchers modified a sugar molecule so that it mimics a cell membrane, which entices a flu virus to attach to it.“For antivirals to really work, they have to be virucidal – that is, they have to irreversibly inhibit viral infectivity,” says Francsco Stellacci, lead author of the study. “Once the virus is attached, our molecule exerts pressure locally and destroys it. And this mechanism is irreversible.”The team tested their molecules against several human and avian influenza strains, in mouse studies and in lab cell cultures. Throughout the first 24 hours of infection, the molecules showed constant efficacy, which the team says could mean that it works for longer than 36 hours in humans. In another test, the molecules were given 24 hours after infection, leading to a 90 percent survival rate for those mice. By comparison, none of the animals survived on a placebo or oseltamivir.The researchers say that this method could lead to new antiviral drugs that are effective against a wide range of different flu viruses. That would help solve one of the main challenges of treating the disease: how fast it mutates every year, requiring updated vaccines that often have varying success rates.Of course at this stage, the treatment has only been tested in mice and lab cell cultures, so there’s no guarantee that the results will carry across to human patients. In the meantime, other new antiviral drugs are progressing swiftly, such as baloxavir marboxil, which was granted FDA approval in 2018.The study was published in the journal Advanced Science.Source: EPFL Tags Infectious DiseasesInfluenzaVirusEPFLMoleculesDrugDrug delivery Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn 3 comments Michael Irving Michael has always been fascinated by space, technology, dinosaurs, and the weirder mysteries of the universe.

Here, experts from Avalere Health outline ongoing US and global vaccine development efforts, including the role of public-private partnerships in accelerating vaccine development. They will also focus on the broader context of respiratory disease prevention by evaluating the advancement toward other respiratory preventative products, including for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with an emphasis on the development of novel delivery mechanisms and mechanisms of action. INNOVATION IN vaccine development has significantly advanced in recent years. Ongoing US and global vaccine development efforts have leveraged decades of advancements in routine vaccine development and disease response. These efforts have laid the groundwork for innovation in COVID-19 vaccine development, which could catalyse opportunities for the broader pipeline of vaccines and prophylactic products, novel delivery mechanisms and increased global immunisation. Moreover, what is unique to global COVID-19 response efforts is that innovation has been spurred by unprecedented co-ordination across federal and global organisations and public‑private partnerships (PPPs), which together provide new considerations in scaling innovation.In this article, we will review the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and consider examples of several global, domestic and PPP efforts that are driving the COVID-19 vaccine‑related response. We will conclude with examples of innovation in vaccine development that may accelerate and shape the vaccine ecosystem in the near term.COVID-19 and novel vaccine developmentWith the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 and its eventual classification as a “public health emergency of international concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO), the start of 2020 was marked by worldwide investment in vaccine development programmes, rapid manufacturing scale-up and the establishment of new PPPs to drive research and development. Vaccine developers and manufacturers have announced over 200 candidates to prevent COVID-19 infection, including cell-based, protein‑based, nanoparticle, viral vector, DNA and RNA platforms.1 Many of these programmes involve PPPs and collaborations between biotechnology companies, global biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.The US Government (USG), WHO and other global organisations have leveraged lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to help shape their response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Historically, vaccine development is time- and resource-intensive; a conventional vaccine development process averages 10-15 years between drug discovery and licensure. The clinical development stage alone often runs between two and 10 years and the process is further prolonged by lengthy and sequential review and approval processes and long manufacturing lead times.2 Furthermore, approximately 15 percent of candidates that complete Phase III trials fail to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.3 By contrast, development of COVID-19 vaccines has been accelerated by leveraging similar mechanisms used in the recent H1N1 influenza and Ebola vaccine development processes, such as parallel development, manufacturing scale-up and innovative clinical trial designs.While the development and distribution processes for COVID-19 vaccines mirror those of the H1N1 and Ebola vaccine development processes, the portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines includes several new and innovative technologies (eg, mRNA and monoclonal antibodies [mAbs]) that will require unique infrastructure and distribution planning for storage, handling and equitable allocation. The approval and rollout of such vaccines may also have an impact on novel (non-COVID-19) products and technologies in the pipeline.Global COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distributionGlobally, several mechanisms have emerged to drive and scale COVID-19 vaccine development, as well as future procurement and distribution efforts:Operation Warp Speed (OWS)Operation Warp Speed is a joint effort in the US between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD), with additional partnerships across public and private sectors. OWS has funded and guided efforts to develop, manufacture and distribute COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, with the stated goal to “produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021.”4Development of COVID-19 vaccines has been accelerated by leveraging similar mechanisms used in the recent H1N1 influenza and Ebola vaccine development processes”As of November 2020, OWS has contracted with several manufacturers to simultaneously start manufacturing scale-up and production as candidates continue through the clinical phases of development, minimising the anticipated time lag between potential authorisation or approval and distribution. OWS has likewise contracted over $10 billion to support large-scale manufacturing, distribution and vaccine dose purchase.Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator: COVAX FacilityThe ACT Accelerator is a global collaboration between governments, civil society and industry to expedite development and equitable distribution of COVID-19 medical countermeasures and diagnostics. The COVAX Facility – the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator co-ordinated by Gavi, WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) – is a financing and procurement mechanism for pooling demand and resources to support COVID-19 vaccine procurement and equitable access. CEPI is leading COVAX’s COVID-19 research and development efforts, which has accumulated over $1.4 billion in commitments from governments to support nine candidates as of September 2020.5 COVAX aims to distribute two billion doses to member countries by the end of 2021, with a primary focus on 92 low- and middle‑income countries (LMIC) that may not otherwise have the necessary resources to individually purchase COVID-19 vaccines.European Commission (EC): EU vaccines strategyThe goal of the EC is to ensure safe, affordable and accessible COVID-19 vaccines for all in the EU, once available, and to ensure the vaccine is a global public good. All Member States will have access to COVID-19 vaccines at the same time and in quantities based on respective population size. As of October 2020, the EC has secured three contracts that allow for the purchase of up to 800 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and has concluded exploratory talks for additional agreements.What is unique to global COVID-19 response efforts is that innovation has been spurred by unprecedented co-ordination across federal and global organisations and public-private partnerships”In preparation for a potential vaccine launch, Member States are directed to ensure vaccination services have adequate capacity to deliver COVID-19 vaccines, including a skilled and trained workforce, medical and protective equipment, secure cold chain and transport and storage capacity. Member States are expected to make vaccines easily accessible and affordable for target populations and to build public trust by clearly communicating the benefits, risks and importance of COVID-19 vaccines. The EC has stated that non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and mask wearing, will continue to serve as the main public health tools, including throughout the initial vaccination rollout phases.Innovation in respiratory preventive productsThese novel development, procurement and distribution pathways may benefit other innovative products in the pipeline. In recent decades, researchers and developers have advanced clinical development programmes for a range of new vaccine and prophylactic products, such as mAbs – some of which are nearing market launch. There are also advanced vaccine candidates in development for RSV, which causes significant burden in vulnerable populations, such as infants and older adults, resulting in over 50,000 hospitalisations among children under five years old and 14,000 deaths among adults over 65 annually in the US.6 The pipeline also includes vaccines for cytomegalovirus (CMV), norovirus and emerging infectious disease threats, including Ebola and COVID-19, signalling growth in the number of diseases considered to be vaccine preventable.Advancements in influenza vaccine technologiesNovel influenza vaccine technologies are likely to alter the current influenza vaccine market landscape by significantly increasing competition and targeting specific populations. In addition to existing cell-based and recombinant vaccines, the introduction of other novel non-egg-based vaccines may enable faster production timelines and fewer supply disruptions, enhancing pandemic response.New technologies may also offer increased protection against influenza. There have been efforts to develop vaccines for specific populations (eg, older adults) to induce stronger immune responses. Additionally, the introduction of a universal influenza vaccine could, depending on the product, provide longer-lasting protection against more influenza strains than those included in seasonal products. A universal influenza vaccine may address challenges in matching each season’s vaccine with circulating virus strains.7 The co‑occurrence of the 2020–21 influenza season with the COVID-19 pandemic underlines the urgency of innovation in this space.Novel delivery mechanismsNon-injectable and needle-free vaccine technologies may significantly increase uptake by offering alternatives for consumers who fear needles and younger patients for whom receiving an intramuscular injection may be difficult. Recently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the US re-established its recommendation for an intranasal influenza spray for the 2018‑2019 season. Possibilities for self-administering influenza vaccines, whether using a patch or other device, have also entered the pipeline and present additional opportunities to reshape the market, increase access and improve uptake. A heat-stable, potentially painless vaccine may increase consumer willingness to be vaccinated and additionally improve access, particularly during major outbreaks. Reducing the need to be vaccinated in a physician’s office or pharmacy eases the burden on consumers and decreases the risk of exposure to influenza and other infectious diseases.ConclusionVaccine innovation has experienced a unique, unprecedented acceleration in recent years, driven most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic”Vaccine innovation has experienced a unique, unprecedented acceleration in recent years, driven most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic. Major organisational efforts such as OWS and COVAX have accelerated the vaccine development process, while leaps in technology have created more possibilities for treatable therapeutic areas and methods of administration. Looking ahead, federal and global organisations and PPPs could drive these advancements to impact new products in terms of preventable diseases, methods of administration and global access.

What's our business? I work with my brother Ady on the family farm in Leicestershire, which was set up by our parents in 1971. He has three young sons. The farm consists of both free-range and colony laying hens. We also pack and market both our own eggs and those from contracted producers. The business services all sectors of the market, including major retailers, the food service sector and local shops. Both Ady and I have a keen interest in seeing the business grow and see a real future in farmers working more closely with the retail sector to promote product growth and hopefully maintaining increasing margins. How does avian influenza affect us? We take the risk of AI very seriously in our business, and animal welfare is of utmost importance. As such we’re making some changes to ensure our birds are still happy and healthy while housing measures are in place. Hens are creatures of habit and pretty active so we had to make sure that bird welfare was maintained from the moment the birds are brought inside. We anticipate there will be a settling in period while the birds acclimatise to the new arrangements and we have invested in enrichments to keep the birds happy. I’m going to trial some supplemental pecking blocks from two different suppliers to see what the birds make of them. I think it’s important to look at how effective different products are at entertaining the birds and enriching their environment. I’ve also bought 40 plastic inflatable footballs to put in the sheds for the birds to play with. Interestingly they seem to like the red ones but aren’t so keen on the green, yellow and blue ones. When we had to house the birds in 2016-17 I put road cones in the poultry houses, the hens particularly love the reflective bands on them and will happily peck away at them. We also strung up hay nets over the litter area (ones with small holes about one inch in diameter otherwise they get emptied too easily) filled with bales of lucerne. The height at which they’re hung is important, too low and the birds will go through the contents quickly and they’ll also lean on them to lay; too high and they won’t reach it! They need to have to stretch so they work for it and to keep them entertained. The added benefit of the lucerne is that it adds fibre into their diet. Scratch area The scratch area in the poultry house is very important so extra litter has been added giving the hens something to play and dust bath in. It also makes for a cleaner environment. Scattering grit around the floor can also help encourage natural scratching behaviour and help keep the hens occupied. We'll be walking the sheds more frequently throughout the day to move the birds around, especially in the morning to discourage the birds from congregating around the pop-holes. Increasing the number of enrichments means we may get more floor eggs so by walking through the birds we’re gently moving them around and discouraging them from settling in corners. Although the floor eggs are harder to find with all the extras ‘toys’ in the sheds, time spent in with the birds allows us to keep an eye on their behaviour, so if they’re getting a bit overzealous with their dust bathing we bring in a distraction. Each shed will have its challenging areas and a producer will always know where they are, we’re paying a lot of attention to what is going on in our poultry houses to help manage the birds. For us, it is the narrower scratch areas in flat deck houses which have proved more challenging in keeping the birds entertained. Maintaining good bird health and welfare and keeping AI out with tightened biosecurity is our priority, there is no one size fits all approach but with a bit of thought and spending time observing the birds, poultry keepers can establish what works best for their own flock.

Getting a flu shot will help you keep influenza at bay. © Shutterstock. Written by Editorial Team |Updated : December 15, 2020 12:27 PM IST A flu shot during pregnancy can be termed as a smart move. Yes, that's right! It is absolutely safe to get it if you are a mummy-to-be. This vaccination will not only protect the mother but even the baby as well. Getting a flu shot will help you keep influenza, that is flu, at bay and avoid dangerous complications like pneumonia. So, don't miss that shot during pregnancy. Are you a would-be-mother? Haven't thought of taking a flu shot yet? Then, it is the right time to consult your doctor and take it. Influenza (flu) can invite severe illness in pregnant mothers particularly because pregnant mothers' immunity is lesser when compared to the ones who aren't. While good immunity will cause no sickness or a mild flu, the reduced immunity in pregnant mothers' can make them require hospitalization and make them fall prey to serious complications. Therefore, the need for a vaccine to not just protect pregnant mothers but also to protect their unborn babies. Now, one would wonder, as to how does it protect the babies, even before they are born? When the mother receives the flu vaccine, the protective defense mechanism develops in the mother in the form of antibodies. These antibodies cross the placenta and thus the baby has its defense mechanism ready too.

MárquezDecember 15, 2020In the face of the globalization of infectious diseases, a good example is the H5N1 avian influenza virus. (Gloszilla Studio | Shutterstock)Zoonosis, comes from the Greek words, zoo: animal and nosos: disease. Its meaning in veterinary infectology and epidemiology, as well as in human public health, refers to infectious-contagious diseases transmitted by animals to the human being, either by direct contact, through contaminated foods or through various types of vectors. There are numerous written, archaeological and paleontological testimonies demonstrating the presence of diseases that affected mainly domestic animals and primitive man, since the most remote old times. It is reasonable to think about and admit that various pathogenic agents have colonized and been established with a morbid vocation in higher mammals, during the long and patient evolutionary process of the species. The study of lesions found in fossils in archaeological areas of human settlements and in tombs of ancient civilizations allow modern microbes hunters to diagnose with relative precision and safety many of those infectious and parasitic processes. In addition, there are written testimonies of some references of animal and human disorders. The interpretation of clinical descriptions through signs and symptoms is hardly certain, especially when it comes to literature texts describing epidemics and epizootics. Thus, medical science historians do not always agree on their diagnosis over time. Terms such as “epidemics,” “pests,” “malignant fevers,” “miasmas,” “contagious emanations,” etc., are too general, if they are not accompanied by more precise clinical descriptions. Anthropozoonosis The current certainty of the existence of infectious-contagious diseases common to animals and humans neither imply nor mean that we were previously aware of this reciprocal contagion, that is, of anthropozoonosis. Anthropozoonosis is defined as infectious diseases that are naturally transmitted from humans to vertebrate animals. The experience acquired through the diachronistic-historical analysis of epizootiology and the epidemiology of many infectious entities shows that the behavior of microbial populations − prions, viruses, bacteria, fungi and pathogenic parasites and their hosts − frequently change, so signs and symptoms of clinical manifestations and the evolution of outbreaks could have changed over time. Pathogens of zoonotic origin According to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), of the 1,415 pathogens affecting humans, 61 percent are of zoonotic origin and therefore have a direct relationship to veterinary public health activities. Let us remember Pasteur's phrase in the cursed fields of Poullit-le Fort in 1881, during the first immunization of animals with a live attenuated bacterin to live bacteria immunization against anthrax: “The germ is nothing, the circumstances are everything.” And the research of the other giant of German bacteriology, Robert Koch, with the Vibrio Cholera in Calcutta, India in 1883, which showed that dirt, filth, overcrowding and overpopulation trigger the bacillus Vibrius colericus. Manifestations and consequences on the population of Europe and the Americas of the cases of human influenza, exanthematic typhus and treponematoses were radically different from how they were known before the discovery of the American continent. These diseases, as a result of the movements of human and animal populations between the Old and New Continent, profoundly altered the biocenotic balances mainly of the Americas and, to a lesser extent of Europe. New species and strains of pathogenic microbes and completely “naive” hosts were introduced, i.e. immunologically susceptible, both in relation to animal and human infectious diseases. Avian influenza and unified health Finally, given the irreversible, accelerated and massive process of globalization experienced by humanity at the beginning of the 21st century, and in the face of the globalization phenomenon of infectious diseases, what a better example, than the H5N1 virus of avian influenza of Asian origin. The moment will come when we will not talk more about animal health or human health, treating them as distinct and separate entities or disciplines, but we will talk about a “unified health”: One World, One Health! Other diseases and overpopulation Of all the contagious diseases that humankind currently suffers, perhaps the oldest of them is malaria. The hemoprotozoa that parasitize chimpanzee and gorilla hematocytes are practically indistinguishable from those that affect humans. Thus, it is assumed that humans acquired malaria parasites at the evolutionary time of the separation of humans from the upper primates. Epidemic diseases such as bubonic plague, cholera, smallpox, yellow fever and influenza are apparently germs of late arrival in the human body, resulting from overcrowding in urban areas. Germs that have caused big pandemics require overpopulation in urban areas to reach an epidemic state. Malaria, on the contrary, has an endemic status. While humans remained as a non-sedentary hunter-gatherer, they remained free of communicable diseases, except malaria. When humans became sedentarized because of agricultural and pastoral activities, they organized themselves into tribal systems, and began living in villages, towns and cities. In this way, it became easy prey to infectious diseases. The path to zoonosis The other widespread concept is to consider that most infectious diseases suffered by humanity are of zoonotic origin. Then, they reached the second evolutionary phase, when the pathogen manages to adapt and achieve such virulence capacity that can be horizontally transmitted, loosing the animal origin reservoir in its life cycle. From the infectology point of view, health care has been changing over time among different civilizations. Infectious diseases that affected primitive humans in settlements of little demographic concentration were initially parasitic, fungal and bacterial. As humans organized into increasingly complex industrialized societies and inhabited urban areas with a higher population concentration since the 19th century, contagious diseases have, above all, become viral-type conditions. Return of diseases? With the development of public health, the discovery of antimicrobials such as sulphonamides and antibiotics, and with the development of preventive vaccines, human life expectancy considerably increased as of the second half of the 20th century. The demographic explosion and the aging of urban societies have led to a turning point in preventive and mass therapeutic medicine, with new pathologies, such as heart disease and cancer, in addition to the challenging problems that geriatrics poses. During the preceding centuries, devastating pandemics served as great regulators of human population and as arbiters of the forms of society. While it is true that large pests, such as bubonic plague, smallpox, and cholera, have given way, even though smallpox has been declared by the World Health Organization as missing, pathogens that cause these contagious diseases can return. If they have once emerged, they can sprout again. Four possible scenarios facing humanity The emergence of new strains of previously known pathogens or new highly virulent pathogenic agents, provided with impregnable defensive and evasion mechanisms. Such is the current case of retroviruses responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). An atomic catastrophe, which leads to the annulment and collapse of all our current infectious disease control systems, such as sewage treatment and conduction systems, mass production of vaccines and insecticides. Such a catastrophe could lead to the reintroduction of typhus, cholera or smallpox germs. Possibility of the emergence of new pathogens by mutation or genetic recombination of diseases that are currently under good control, showing new modalities of extreme virulence, of great horizontal transmission capacity or of antibiotics resistance. Revival of pandemic diseases of antiquity, due to immunosuppression processes. Main diseases transmitted by birds to humans The most important known avizoonoses are: Psittacosis or chlamydia (Chlamydia psittaci) Salmonellosis (S. typhimurium, S.

There are now concerns for the other swans present in the creek," he added.He said water pollution had been considered as a possible cause of the deaths and testing for lead poisoning had been carried out, but this had been ruled out.Image source, Ian SImage caption, Ryde Canoe Lake is home to a number of wildfowl speciesAn Isle of Wight Council statement confirmed that after several reports of dead swans in the area of Ryde Canoe Lake, tests on the remains of one showed avian influenza was present."As birds will move about this is not confined to any one location but could be present wherever wild birds gather," it said.Footpaths around the lake have been cordoned off as a precaution.Kay Ounsworth, of the Isle of Wight Bird Rehabilitation group, said an outbreak was the "last thing the island needs"."We're a small farming community and, if it is bird flu, people could easily walk from the lake and spread it through farm land."The lake is known to be home to wildfowl including Canada geese, tufted ducks and mallard as well as white and black swans.Following an increases in cases of H5N8 bird flu nationally, an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) was put in place across England meaning all commercial and domestic bird keepers are required by law to take a range of biosecurity precautions including keeping their birds indoors. There are numerous strains of bird flu. Most are low risk to humans, or are not easily caught and spread by humans.Members of the public are also advised not to touch dead or visibly sick wild birds to prevent spreading the disease.Related topicsFarehamRydeHampshire & Isle of WightMore on this storySwans culled after bird flu outbreakPublished14 December 2020Hens in Britain to be kept indoors due to bird fluPublished5 December 2020Bird flu killed wild birds in south west EnglandPublished11 November 2020Dutch and German farms cull flocks over bird fluPublished5 November 2020Thousands of birds culled at farm hit by avian fluPublished2 November 2020Related internet linksDefraThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.From other local news sites500 teeth removed from children in Southampton every yearExternalSouthern Daily EchoBusy road set to shut for four nights â hereâs whenExternalSouthern Daily Echo'I think we need a bit of positivity, a bit of cheer!' says Sandra GidleyExternalHampshire ChronicleLegendary Irish duo Foster and Allen bringing 50th anniversary tour to HampshireExternalHampshire ChronicleAndover recruitment firm issues warning after 'wake-up call' for UK managersExternalAndover AdvertiserEmotional Remembrance Sunday service in Havant as people remember fallen soldiers - picturesExternalPortsmouth TodayInformation about BBC links to other news sitesTop storiesLive.Â Trump allies back Senate leader contender, while House control hangs in the balanceMoscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacksPublished13 hours agoNation falls silent as King leads Remembrance ceremonyPublished12 hours agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilHologram in Amsterdam window aims to solve sex worker's cold case murderStrictly's Chris McCausland praised for 'poignant' blackout dance imitating blindnessElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Mattel 'deeply regrets' porn site misprint on Wicked dolls2Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron3Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards4Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'5âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director6Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacks7'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'8Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale9Nation falls silent as King leads Remembrance ceremony10MTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

Your private vet or your local Animal and Plant Health Agency office will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.“Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks or gulls, falcons or other birds of prey, or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, should be reported to the Defra (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) dead wild bird helpline.“Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.”The Scottish Government said in light of evidence from the Continent and ongoing high numbers of findings among wild bird populations in England, the risk of incursion of avian influenza has been increased to very high for wild birds, medium for poultry with high biosecurity, and high for poultry with poor biosecurity.Scottish rural affairs minister Mairi Gougeon said: “With the recent disease confirmations in wild and captive birds in the UK, it is not unexpected for avian influenza to be found in birds here in Scotland.“We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds.”Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say – November 11UK News|1 hour agoGovernment says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitismUK News|1 hour agoStarmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorationsUK News|5 hours agoSFA chief tells of emergency eyecare surgery before key Euros matchUK News|5 hours agoDrivers handed £4.1m Dartford Crossing fines by mistakeUK News|5 hours agoMost popular1Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|17 hours agoFollow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.
