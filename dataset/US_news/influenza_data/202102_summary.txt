1. The study monitored the circulating strains and genetic variation of influenza A and B viruses in Thailand between July 2017 and March 2020.
2. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple clades/subclades of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were circulating simultaneously and evolved away from their vaccine strain, while the influenza B virus did not show significant genetic divergence from the vaccine strain.
3. The predominant circulating strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 belonged to 6B.1A1 (2017-2018) and 6B.1A5 (2019-2020), with additional amino acid substitutions.
4. Clades 3C.2a1b and 3C.2a2 viruses co-circulated in A(H3N2), and a clade 3C.3a virus was found in 2020.
5. Antigenic drift was observed in epitopes of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and the influenza B virus, suggesting potential changes in antigenic properties.
6. The computed antigenic relatedness of A(H3N2) indicated a significant decline in 2019 and 2020, while the circulating influenza B virus remained antigenically similar to its vaccine strain.
7. These findings offer insights into the genetic divergence from vaccine strains and may contribute to vaccine updating efforts.
8. The study highlights the importance of monitoring genetic and antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses for effective vaccine development and public health response.
