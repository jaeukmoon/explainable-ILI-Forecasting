Credit: V. Summersby/Springer Nature LimitedIAMI was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in eight countries. The 2,571 trial participants were assigned to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine or saline placebo, administered shortly after hospital admission for MI (99.7% of patients) or high-risk stable coronary heart disease (0.3%). Of note, the trial was halted before reaching the prespecified sample size owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.At 12 months, influenza vaccination was associated with a 28% reduction in the risk of a composite of all-cause death, MI or stent thrombosis (the primary outcome) compared with placebo (5.3% versus 7.2%; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52–0.99, P = 0.040). Influenza vaccination also reduced by 41% both all-cause mortality (2.9% versus 4.9%; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.89, P = 0.010) and cardiovascular mortality (2.7% versus 4.5%; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39–0.90, P = 0.014). Finally, an exploratory meta-analysis including data from this trial and from three previous smaller randomized trials showed a 50% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death at 1 year in patients receiving influenza vaccination.We have, for the first time, confirmed … in a well-powered trial … that the influenza vaccine works and saves lives after MI“These findings suggest that a flu shot in hospital to patients treated for MI should be implemented,” says Fröbert. Looking to the future, Fröbert highlights the need for a better understanding of the potential mechanisms. “The influenza vaccine seems to do more than protect against influenza,” he explains, “and many indications from animal and some human studies suggest that the vaccine modulates inflammation (important in MI) and prevents (indirectly) thrombosis”.

Continue Cancel Health Protect Yourself From Deadly Flu Complications How influenza can become life-threatening and what to do to protect yourself By Beth Howard, AARP Comments En español Published September 10, 2021 Fuse/Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Last year’s flu season was one of the lightest on record — a rare silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the 2021-2022 season could be a doozy, especially for older adults — who are more prone to flu and its complications. “This year, schools and businesses are open and people are out and about, and not all are following mask guidelines,” says Joseph Gastaldo, M.D., system head of infectious diseases at OhioHealth, a health care system in central Ohio. Depending on the severity of the flu season, between 750,000 to 1 million people are hospitalized each flu season in the U.S., and 30,000 to 80,000 people die from it, notes Ryan Oyer, M.D., an infectious disease specialist for Kaiser Permanente in Denver. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 90 percent of these deaths and 50 to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur among people 65 and older. How sick becomes sicker Influenza itself can be deadly in vulnerable patients due to difficulties in breathing and dehydration. But complications like pneumonia are the real killers. It starts with inflammation. “Influenza sets up an inflammatory response in the body, to fight off the infection,” says William Schaffner, M.D., professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. That causes the aches, pains and respiratory distress that make you feel like you’ve actually been in battle. The flu virus also attaches to — and infects — the cells lining the mucous membranes in the back of the throat, nose and bronchial tubes, Schaffner explains. Normally, these cells eject infectious agents out of the body through the nose or mouth, or they are swallowed. But when impaired by the flu, they allow the bacteria to slip down into the bronchial tubes and trigger a secondary infection in the lungs. Unfortunately, lying in bed makes people, especially frailer folks, more susceptible to pneumonia. “We don’t cough as vigorously when we do that,” Schaffner notes. “We don’t clear our secretions as well when we’re lying down.” And things can get worse from there. Once infection sets in, the bacteria can clog up the air sacs in the lungs. That not only makes it hard to breathe but can allow bacteria to escape into the bloodstream, causing an infection called sepsis and, ultimately, leading to organ failure. “When that happens in people of advanced age or who have underlying illnesses, you have fatality rates that can be somewhere between 10 and 20 percent, despite the fact that we have good antibiotics,” Schaffner says. Even after you recover from the flu, you may not be out of the woods. Inflammation related to the disease can also affect various organ systems independently, similar to the way experts have seen long-haul symptoms linger in COVID-19 patients for weeks or months. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT “The inflammatory response continues for a period of time,” Schaffner says. It can involve the blood vessels that feed the heart, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke for weeks or months. In rare cases, the blood vessels feeding the brain may be affected, triggering encephalitis. Know your risk factors for severe flu Age plays a big role in determining who gets sick and how ill they become. “As you age, your immune system ages, too,” OhioHealth’s Gastaldo says. “As you get older, your recovery rate and your body’s ability to heal itself is slower and not as robust as it is when you’re in your 20s and 30s.” Older people are generally less likely to spike a fever, a sign that the body is mounting an immune response. What’s more, vaccines don’t work as well as you age. And seniors are more likely to have other illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, obesity and diabetes, which worsen the flu and its repercussions. The strain of flu virus also influences the seriousness of illness. Kaiser Permanente’s Oyer says there are generally two major types that circulate in the U.S. — influenza A and influenza B. Influenza A viruses (which are further categorized into strains such as H3N2 and H1N1) tend to cause more severe illness. But not all influenza A viruses cause the same severity of sickness. H3N2 viruses tend to be more aggressive than the H1N1 variety, Oyer says, but this is not always true. “The 1918 Spanish flu killed 50 to 100 million people, and it was an H1N1 virus,” he says. “Generally speaking, however, we expect that in years in which influenza-A H3N2 viruses predominate, there will be more complications and hospitalizations than years when influenza-A H1N1 or influenza B viruses predominate.” How to protect yourself If you think you’re coming down with the flu, experts advise seeking medical treatment immediately. Editor’s note: This article was updated in September 2021 with new information about the 2021-2022 flu season. When to go to the hospital The flu can make you feel miserable and weak. But how do you know you’ve made a turn for the worse and need help — stat?! Being short of breath after little or no exertion is one red flag. “Struggling to breathe when you’re eating or finding it hard to have a normal conversation because you’re short-winded — those are clues that you need to seek help,” says OhioHealth’s Joseph Gastaldo, M.D. The same goes for uncontrolled fever, especially if it disappears but later returns. “Fever is potentially dangerous in older people,” Gastaldo says. That’s because it leads to sweating and dehydration, which can reduce the amount of blood in the body and put strain on the heart. The CDC also recommends that you seek immediate care if you experience any of the following symptoms with the flu: Persistent pain/pressure in the chest or abdomen Dizziness and confusion Seizures Not urinating Extreme muscle pain Severe weakness or unsteadiness Cough that improves but then returns or worsens Worsening of chronic medical conditions %{postComment}% Beth Howard is a North Carolina–based health and lifestyle writer.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Right now, there’s just one virus on everyone’s minds: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But humanity is plagued by many respiratory viruses, such as influenza A (IAV) and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), which cause hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. Most of these viruses – apart from influenza and SARS-CoV-2 – have no vaccines or effective treatments. A recent study from the University of Glasgow has discovered what happens when you get infected with some of these viruses at the same time, and it has implications for how they make us sick and how we protect ourselves from them. For many reasons, respiratory viruses are often found during winter in the temperate regions of the world, or the rainy season of equatorial regions. During these periods, you’ll probably be infected with more than one virus at any one time in a situation called a “co-infection”. Research shows that up to 30% of infections may harbour more than one virus. What this means is that, at some point two different viruses are infecting the cells that line your nose or lungs. We know that co-infection can be important if we look at a process called “antigenic shift” in influenza viruses, which is basically caused by virus “sex”. This sometimes occurs when two different influenza strains meet up inside the same cell and exchange genes, allowing a new variant to emerge. Co-infection can create a predicament for viruses when you consider that they need to compete for the same resource: you. Some viruses appear to block other viruses, while some viruses seem to like each other. What is driving these positive and negative interactions during co-infections is unknown, but animal studies suggest that it could be critical in determining how sick you get. The University of Glasgow study investigated what happens when you infect cells in a dish with two human respiratory viruses. For their experiments, they chose IAV and RSV, which are both common and cause lots of disease and death each year. The researchers looked at what happens to each virus using high-resolution imaging techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy, that their labs have perfected over the years. They found that some of the human lung cells in the dish contained both viruses. And, by looking closely at those co-infected cells, they found that the viruses that were emerging from the cell had structural characteristics of both IAV and RSV. The new “chimeric” virus particles had proteins of both viruses on their surface and some even contained genes from the other. This is the first evidence of this occurring from co-infection of distinct respiratory viruses. Chimera – after which hybrid viruses are named – were mythical creates with parts from different animals. I, Sailko/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA Follow-up experiments in the same paper showed that these new chimeric viruses were fully functional and could even infect cells that were rendered resistant to influenza, presumably gaining access using the RSV proteins could even get into a broader range of human cells than either virus alone could. Potentially, this could be happening during natural co-infections during the winter. Why we need to study chimeric viruses Studying disease-causing pathogens is extremely important and helpful for creating vaccines and treatments, yet safety is still paramount. It’s important to point out that the researchers in this study did not perform any genetic engineering between two viruses and only modelled what is already happening in the real world, but using safer laboratory strains of viruses under lab conditions. We know about the significant role co-infection can play in a virus’s life, such as during influenza antigenic shift or the curious case of hepatitis D virus borrowing bits of the other viruses, such as hepatitis B, to spread. Nevertheless, the work by the University of Glasgow researchers has significant implications for our understanding of how other very different respiratory viruses might interact, antagonise and even promote each other’s infections in the ecosystem of our nose and lungs. Together, this work shows the complex and often messy interactions between viruses during the winter. Undoubtedly, future work will explore how this co-infection affects transmission, disease and immunity – things that aren’t easy to determine in a dish.

Sept. 7, 2021 SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. — Slippery Rock University is hosting a COVID-19 vaccination clinic, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sept. 17, at the Russell Wright Alumni House on the corner of Morrow Way and Campus Drive. The COVID-19 vaccine will be available to all SRU students, faculty and staff, as well as an influenza vaccine for faculty and staff. Students wanting the flu vaccine can get their shots at a separate clinic, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sept. 16, in the parking lot outside of the Alumni House. There is no charge for either clinic. "We can't stress enough how important it is for everyone to be vaccinated," said Kris Benkeser, director of student health and wellness. "Vaccines are the single most effective way for people to protect themselves and others and to keep our campus safe and functioning during these turbulent times when the health of our community is at stake." In partnership with Giant Eagle Pharmacy in Slippery Rock, SRU is providing the COVID-19 vaccination for those needing their first shot; their second dose, including those who received their first dose at SRU's Aug. 19 and 22 clinics; or those who are immunocompromised and require a third dose after being previously vaccinated. Participants will have the choice of shots produced by one of the three major pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson or Moderna. BENKESER Flu shots, which are annually available to SRU employees through on-campus clinics, will also be administered for SRU employees during the Sept. 17 clinic, courtesy of Giant Eagle Pharmacy, and employees can receive both the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same appointment. The Sept. 16 flu vaccine clinic for students is hosted by Student Health Services. Registration is required for the Sept. 17 clinic and there are separate online forms for students and faculty and staff to complete to schedule an appointment. Participants are required to download and complete the vaccine administration form to bring to their appointment. Students can also upload their proof of COVID-19 vaccination to the Student Health Portal to receive $50 in meal-plan flex dollars through Sept. 10. There is no registration required for the Sept. 16 clinic for students. Students can also contact Student Health Services at 724.738.2052 to schedule an appointment to receive their flu shot if they cannot attend the Sept. 16 clinic.

Policy-ish Public Health Twitter The Coronavirus Crisis Here are the key reasons to get a flu shot — now Updated October 13, 202110:16 AM ET Originally published September 7, 20215:00 AM ET By Fran Kritz Enlarge this image Cristina Spanò for NPR Cristina Spanò for NPR With all the talk about COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, it's easy to forget that another dangerous respiratory virus is poised to strike — the flu. Experts worry that we could be heading into a big flu season, especially if enough Americans do not get their annual flu shot, which is now widely available. "We are worried the incredibly low influenza rates that we saw last season could create a rebound influenza epidemic this year," says Dr. Mark Roberts, director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. Most years as many as 12,000 to 52,000 people die from the flu in the U.S. But the unusually mild flu season last year means that fewer people have immunity to strains likely to be circulating this winter. That could lead to anywhere from 100,000 to 400,000 additional hospitalizations for influenza, according to two recent computer modeling studies done by Roberts and his colleagues. Sponsor Message Health Where Did The Flu Go? Homebound Kids Shape A Mild Season Shots - Health News Hospitals brace for an onslaught this winter, from flu as well as COVID "It could be really bad — and it could be really bad at a time when there's still quite a bit of COVID-19 filling up our hospitals," he says. Getting the flu shot remains the single most powerful action a person can take to fend off the days- or weeks-long, wracking muscle aches, fever and sometimes deadly respiratory infection that is influenza. "Two reasons make getting vaccinated against the flu the wise choice," says Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases. "First, it's been proven year after year that you're in better shape to fight off the flu if you get the vaccine. Second, by getting vaccinated against the flu, you help protect the people around you." Here's a guide to getting yourself vaccinated against the potentially fatal virus. I heard that the flu essentially disappeared last year. Do I really need a flu shot this year? Yes. Last year saw a record-low number of flu cases, likely thanks to widespread mask wearing, remote work and school, and physical distancing. But this year, experts fear that the reopening of schools, decreased adherence to pandemic precautions and surging delta variant infections could create a double whammy: a very serious flu and COVID-19 season. Already, cases of RSV, yet another serious respiratory virus in children, are spiking. "This suggests that flu will be back [too]," says L.J Tan, executive director of the Immunization Action Coalition. Sponsor Message Who should get a flu shot? Anyone 6 months and older, unless your doctor has specifically recommended that you not get a flu shot because of a prior, rare, severe reaction, says Dr. Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer in the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When's the best time to get the flu shot? Why not now? Flu season starts in October in the U.S. While there's some concern that immunity might wane before the end of flu season in May if you get the vaccine too early, there's not enough data to know the optimal time to get the shot, Grohskopf says. The CDC says aim to get your flu vaccine by the end of October. By then, cases will have started to mount, and many people will be just a few weeks away from travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas. That said, "getting vaccinated at any time during the flu season [can] still be beneficial," says Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah Health. Will the flu vaccine definitely keep me from getting the flu? No. No vaccine is 100% effective. But if you do get the flu, the vaccine is likely to reduce your chance of getting very sick, being hospitalized or dying, Pavia says. Before last year, tens of thousands of people were hospitalized or died from the flu each year, usually people who weren't vaccinated. Can I get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time? Absolutely. The CDC had previously recommended spacing out the timing of the COVID-19 vaccine and other immunizations because the vaccines were so new, but "that guidance has changed," says Grohskopf. The CDC now says it's safe to get both vaccines at once, she says. "The body's immune response and side effects are generally the same as when getting one vaccine alone." If you do get two shots on the same day, expect to get each vaccine in a different arm, which may reduce any pain and swelling that might occur. Sponsor Message What about my COVID-19 booster shot — can I get that at the same time as my flu shot? Right now, third doses of COVID-19 vaccine are authorized for many people. If you qualify, you can get that extra dose and the flu shot on the same day. The delta variant is making me anxious about going to the doctor's office or pharmacy for a flu shot this year. Are there other choices? If you're concerned, aim for an off hour and call to make sure the provider (as well as you) will be masked. If you're still worried, check with local clinics to see if there are any outdoor flu shot clinics in your area. How do I make sure I get the right flu shot for me and my family? "While the most important thing is to get any flu shot, there are some specialized flu shots for specific groups," says Pavia. The key is usually age. Kids 8 and younger who are getting the flu shot for the first time need two doses, given a month apart, says Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. Strong immunity doesn't kick in until two weeks after the second shot, "so parents should be scheduling these shots now," she says. Immune systems weaken with age. That's why the CDC recommends that adults 65 and older get vaccinated with one of two souped-up flu shots: either the Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine or the FLUAD Quadrivalent vaccine. Both are designed to elicit a more robust immune response. If neither is available, then any flu shot is a good choice. I'm pregnant. Should I get a flu shot? Yes. And if you're in your third trimester, the CDC advises you get a flu shot ASAP so you can pass on the protection to your newborn from Day 1. "Babies can't get the flu shot until they are 6 months old but are protected by their mother's antibodies from a flu shot — if she gets the shot — until 6 months, when they can get their own flu vaccine," says Grohskopf. Just be sure to get the shot, not the nasal spray. Sponsor Message I have an allergy to eggs and heard I can't get a flu shot. Is that true? Not really, says the CDC's Grohskopf. It's true that most flu shots and one nasal spray flu vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration are manufactured using egg-based technology, so they contain a small amount of egg proteins. But studies of both the nasal spray and the shots found that allergic reactions are very rare. Two egg-free vaccines are available: Flublok Quadrivalent (for people 18 and older) and Flucelvax Quadrivalent (which is approved for age 2 and up this season). But the CDC says people with a history of egg allergy can get any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine. If you have a history of severe allergic reaction to eggs, the CDC recommends you get your shot at a location where the staff can treat you if a rare allergic reaction does occur. I'm willing to take my chances, so why should I get the flu vaccine? With the pandemic still raging, skipping the flu shot is a much riskier proposition, says Dr. Bernard Camins, an infectious disease physician at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. "You could get the flu and need care but find hospitals overwhelmed because of COVID, or get the flu and get COVID. And especially if you are not vaccinated against the coronavirus, [you] run the risk of your immune system being overwhelmed by two viruses at the same time." Getting back-to-back infections could result in more serious illness, since the first infection may have already weakened your lungs, says Dr. Priya Nori, an infectious disease specialist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. If I'm already vaccinated against COVID-19, does getting the flu shot mean I'm doubly protected and no longer have to wear a mask? Not at all. "Don't stop the public health measures," says Pavia. Distancing, wearing a mask and washing your hands, especially after coughs and sneezes, can improve the chances that you and others will not get the flu — or COVID-19. flu shots COVID-19 vaccine coronavirus pandemic flu season booster shots Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorCleveland Clinic Begins Appointment-Only Flu Vaccination Clinics Across Northeast OhioLocations:Abu Dhabi|Canada|Florida|London|Nevada|Ohio|NewsroomNews ReleasesMedia ResourcesNews & ViewsAboutContact UsSearchSeptember 7, 2021/News ReleasesCleveland Clinic Begins Appointment-Only Flu Vaccination Clinics Across Northeast OhioHospitals are preparing for a heavier flu season than last yearMedia ContactAlana Wyche | 216.346.0363Katie Ely | 216.906.5597Media Downloadsimages: 0video: 0audio: 0text: 0As flu season approaches, Cleveland Clinic is offering appointment-only community flu vaccination clinics at numerous locations across Northeast Ohio.Patients can schedule an appointment at one of our clinics by phone or via MyChart. Patients can also receive the flu vaccine at most scheduled in-person office visits with a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant. In addition, patients can call their primary care physician’s office to schedule a flu vaccination appointment. More information on how to receive your flu vaccination can be found at: www.clevelandclinic.org/flu.“Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory infection that can cause mild to severe illness,” said Steven Gordon, M.D., chair of the Department of Infectious Disease at Cleveland Clinic. “Like COVID-19, the best way to prevent the spread of influenza is by getting vaccinated. “Getting vaccinated and taking simple preventive measures will help keep ourselves, our loved ones and our communities safe as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and we enter flu season.”Our experts agree that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it’s even more important to receive the flu vaccine to reduce your risk of the flu and to avoid a surge in hospitalizations. Precautions have been put into place to ensure the safety of patients and caregivers as these vaccinations are provided to patients. Safety measures include distanced furniture in common areas, appropriate personal protective equipment for caregivers, frequent disinfecting, and screening patients for COVID-19. More information about Cleveland Clinic’s commitment to safety can be found here.Infectious disease experts recommend everyone six months and older get vaccinated every year. The flu is contagious and can cause serious respiratory infection. The timing of seasonal flu activity is unpredictable and can vary, but most typically occurs between October and May. After vaccination, it can take two to four weeks for the antibodies that protect against the influenza virus infection to develop in the body.Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk for developing flu complications, such as adults age 65 and older, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions, and children younger than age five. Yearly vaccination provides the best protection against flu throughout the season.The 2020-2021 flu season was mild due to protection measures taken because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is predicting an increase in flu cases this upcoming season as many public health measures have been relaxed.The same precautions that protect against COVID-19 also will help protect from the flu – proper hand hygiene, social distancing, staying home when sick and wearing masks. In addition, there are prescription antiviral medications that can be used to treat influenza illness.Symptoms of the flu include fever, dry cough, headache, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite.About Cleveland ClinicCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.

On Thursday, the company briefed investors on its future plans, which include a vaccine to combat both COVID-19 and influenza. (Hassene Dridi/Reuters)Social SharingModerna Inc. said on Thursday it was developing a single-dose vaccine that combines a booster dose against COVID-19 and a booster against flu."Our number-one priority as a company right now is to bring to market a pan-respiratory annual booster vaccine, which we plan to always customize and upgrade," chief executive officer Stéphane Bancel said.The company said the benefits of a pan-respiratory vaccine would be immense, pointing to Centers for Disease Control data that indicates there were over 400,000 hospitalizations due to influenza in the U.S. in the last pre-pandemic year, with the seasonal flu representing an average economic burden of $11 billion US annually. The drugmaker already had several influenza vaccine candidates in development. The new vaccine combines the experimental flu shot that is furthest along with its COVID-19 vaccine.Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine received its emergency authorization for people aged 18 and older in Canada and the United States in December 2020. The vaccine was approved by Health Canada for those 12 to 17 in late August, and the company is in an ongoing mid-stage trial testing its authorized COVID-19 vaccine in children aged six months to less than 12 years.The Massachusetts-based drugmaker signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government in Ottawa in early August to build an mRNA vaccine manufacturing plant in Canada.WATCH | Canada will purchase different Moderna vaccines 'for a number of years to come':Government will purchase different types of Moderna vaccines 'for a number of years to come,' says industry minister3 years agoDuration 5:30Innovation, Science and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne joins Power & Politics to discuss an agreement with U.S. drugmaker Moderna to build an mRNA vaccine production facility in Canada.Novavax Inc. said on Wednesday it had initiated an early stage study to test its combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine.Its trial, to be conducted in Australia, will enrol 640 healthy adults between the ages of 50 and 70 and who have either been previously infected with the coronavirus or given an authorized COVID-19 vaccine at least eight weeks prior to the study.Participants will receive a combination of the company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373, and its influenza shot NanoFlu, along with an adjuvant or vaccine booster."Combination of these two vaccines … may lead to greater efficiencies for the health-care system and achieve high levels of protection against COVID-19 and influenza with a single regimen," Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax, said in a statement.Novavax trial results expected in first half of 2022Novavax had said in May it expects seasonal influenza and COVID-19 combination vaccines to likely be critical in combating emerging COVID-19 variants.

(Ashley Kenney/Photo editor) By Noah DaneshSept. 6, 2021 3:18 p.m.Dr. Chaitali Mukherjee, the new executive director of the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center, spoke with Daily Bruin reporter Noah Danesh about COVID-19 safety protocols for the upcoming fall quarter. In this month’s briefing, Mukherjee discussed vaccine requirements, COVID-19 testing, the immunization fair, quarantine policies and more. COVID-19 vaccination The University of California requires all students to receive COVID-19 vaccinations for the fall quarter, and students must submit their vaccine record to the Ashe Center patient portal. To be considered fully vaccinated, students must receive either a single-dose vaccine or the second dose of a two-dose vaccine two weeks prior to the start of the quarter, Mukherjee said. She added that students who do not verify their vaccine status online will be restricted from some campus services and could have their classes dropped on Oct. 4. Students with extenuating circumstances who must arrive on campus without being fully vaccinated should reach out to the Ashe Center to show documentation that they have a plan to get vaccinated. The Ashe Center has already verified more than 38,000 student COVID-19 vaccine records – with each record being manually verified, Mukherjee said. Only a few hundred students have requested medical or religious exemptions. Students who still need to get vaccinated should visit vaccines.gov to find a location to receive a vaccine, she added. In certain circumstances, students can contact the Ashe Center to schedule an appointment to receive a vaccination when they arrive on campus. Students who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection should still get fully vaccinated to lower the likelihood of reinfection, particularly with the increased spread of the delta variant and other variants of concern. The Ashe Center and UCLA Dashew Center for International Students and Scholars are working together to help international students with travel preparations and to ensure students remain updated on their COVID-19 vaccination status, Mukherjee said. International students are encouraged to come to the United States as early as possible prior to the start of the fall quarter in order to get the vaccine and undergo a period of self-quarantine, she added. COVID-19 testing Students who are fully vaccinated and asymptomatic will no longer be required to undergo regular COVID-19 surveillance testing, Mukherjee said. However, students will continue to have access to free testing using vending machines located throughout the campus. Students who are unvaccinated with a vaccine exemption will be required to conduct testing twice a week. Mukherjee said students living in on-campus housing will receive a COVID-19 test immediately upon arriving on campus for the fall quarter, regardless of vaccination status. They will receive an additional test five to seven days after arrival. Quarantine protocol Following updated Los Angeles County Department of Public Health guidelines for institutions of higher education, fully vaccinated students who are exposed to someone with COVID-19 in a classroom can enter a modified quarantine. As long as the student remains asymptomatic, they will be allowed to go to and from class during the 10-day quarantine. If the student receives a negative COVID-19 test three to five days after the exposure, they can be released from the modified quarantine, Mukherjee said. Vaccine booster shots Mukherjee said she encourages people who are immunocompromised and vulnerable to receive a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they are able to. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend those who are immunocompromised receive a third dose 28 days after their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration could soon authorize booster doses for everyone eight months after being fully vaccinated. Booster shots aim to enhance antibody levels, which can decrease over time. Mukherjee said any booster shot requirement at UCLA would take effect after FDA authorization, in line with the UC’s latest vaccine policies. She noted that many students received their vaccinations in April, so widespread booster shots may not be necessary until the end of fall quarter. Immunization requirements The Ashe Center recommends that students fulfill all vaccination requirements prior to arriving on campus. UC immunization policy requires students to be vaccinated against transmissible diseases, including the seasonal influenza virus. The deadline to receive the flu vaccine is Nov. 1. If students need assistance in fulfilling immunization requirements, all required immunizations – including the COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine – will be available at the Immunization Requirement Fair at the John Wooden Center from Sept. 20 to Oct. 1. This year, students must make an appointment in advance through the Ashe Center patient portal and the fair will not accept walk-ins, Mukherjee said. Delta variant Mukherjee said that there are no major changes planned for UCLA’s policies in the fall in light of the delta variant. However, she added that COVID-19 cases are being monitored at UCLA and in the region in case any modifications to protocols are required. Mukherjee said she is optimistic about the start to fall quarter. “We are really looking forward to reopening and welcoming the students back,” she said. “We are feeling really great about the trajectory of the safety here with increased vaccine compliance such that we can reopen with a lot of confidence.” Share this story:FacebookTwitterRedditEmailNoah DaneshCOMMENTSFeatured ClassifiedsMore classifieds »Related PostsAboutContactSubmitAdvertiseStaffStonewallEditorial BoardPrivacyComment PolicyCommunity GuideCopyright © 2024 Daily BruinPharmacy technicians can administer flu vaccine under national protocol for England -

Vaccination 07 September 2021 By Corrinne BurnsAdvertisement Advertisement Copy link to page Download PDF There are parts of the protocol that pharmacy technicians will not be able to perform, including assessment of the person being vaccinated, obtaining informed consent and providing adviceShutterstock.comPharmacy technicians will be permitted to administer flu vaccines in England during the 2021/2022 flu season, The Pharmaceutical Journal has learned.The national protocol for administration of inactivated influenza vaccine, published by Public Health England (PHE) on 1 September 2021, sets out procedures for flu vaccination for this winter’s flu season.The protocol states that the clinical superviser, who takes overall responsibility for delivery of the protocol, “must be a registered doctor, nurse or pharmacist trained and competent in all aspects of the protocol”.However, on 7 September 2021, PHE confirmed to The Pharmaceutical Journal that pharmacy technicians can now prepare and administer the flu vaccine under the protocol. This follows a national protocol for COVID-19 vaccinations, published in December 2020, under which pharmacy technicians are able to administer COVID-19 vaccines.There are parts of the flu vaccine protocol that technicians cannot perform — assessment of the person being vaccinated, obtaining informed consent and providing advice — which must be done by a pharmacist, doctor or nurse.Victoria Steele, superintendent pharmacist at LloydsPharmacy, said the multiple welcomed “the change in protocol to allow pharmacy technicians to deliver vaccinations within a pharmacy setting”.“We are reviewing the guidance and will be considering how best we use our pharmacy teams to deliver our flu services,” she said.Liz Fidler, president of the Association of Pharmacy Technicians UK, said she was “pleased” that pharmacy technicians were included in the national protocol for influenza vaccination, but “disappointed that pharmacy technicians are not enabled to complete the whole process, including consent, for which they have the skills and knowledge as a registered profession to undertake”.She went on to describe it as “a missed opportunity at a time of need”.An expansion of the scope of patient group directions (PGDs) in October 2020 allowed a wider range of registered healthcare professionals (HCPs) to supply and administer COVID-19 and flu vaccines. Under the guidelines, pharmacy technicians can administer vaccines under supervision, but cannot undertake clinical assessments or obtain consent.“This inhibits the profession, as under the national protocol, consent needs to be obtained from a HCP on the PGD list,” Fidler said. “This can mean the process is not as straight forward as it can be, and not an effective use of another HCPs time.” Last updated 8 February 2022 15:44CitationThe Pharmaceutical Journal, PJ, September 2021, Vol 307, No 7953;307(7953)::DOI:10.1211/PJ.2021.1.104269 Please leave a comment Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment.You may also be interested in UK’s first potential norovirus vaccine to be trialled by UK government partnership with Moderna MMR vaccination coverage in England has declined for fifth consecutive year UK government announces mpox vaccination programme Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement About us A to Z subjectsServices Services Advertising and branded content Subscribe Supported contentSupport Support Article access rules Community guidelines For authors and referees Website FAQs Using the new PJ Logging in as a RPS member Preferences and newsletters How to use the PJ app PJ app FAQs Technical supportPublications Publications The Pharmaceutical Journal International Journal of Pharmacy Practice Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology Journal of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research RPS Pharmacy & Pharmacology ReportsPartners Partners Pharmaceutical Press MedicinesComplete Pharmacy Knowledge ONtrack Pharmacy Knowledge Student PJ JobsContact Contact Contact us Permissions and reprintsFollow us Follow us Social media and communities hub Download our app Cookie policy Terms and conditions Subscription T&Cs Copyright Privacy Policy Acceptable use policy © 2024 Royal Pharmaceutical SocietyHow a Flu Shot Can Help You Stay out of the Hospital Javascript is not enabled.

Continue Cancel Health Stay Out of the Hospital with a Flu Shot Timing and dosage can be key; here's what to ask for By Barbara Stepko, AARP Comments En español Published September 10, 2021 Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Each year, about one-third of adults 65 and over don’t get an influenza vaccine. It’s a troubling statistic, says Gregory Poland, M.D., an infectious disease expert and director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group: “If someone asked me, ‘What could I do that would increase the chances that I would not live through Christmas?’ I’d say, ‘Don’t wear your seat belt, don’t get a flu vaccine, and ignore the COVID recommendations.’” Indeed, an annual flu vaccine is crucial. “We need it annually because the [virus] strains are slightly different each year,” says Kristin Christensen, M.D., an internal medicine specialist affiliated with Penn Medicine, in Philadelphia. Researchers try to predict what will be the most prevalent strains in any given flu season and update the vaccine accordingly; this year, every vaccine that’s available will protect against four strains of influenza. The vaccination is especially important for older adults, whose immune systems naturally weaken with age. This puts them at high risk of developing serious complications from flu, particularly pneumonia, which can be life-threatening. According to the CDC, in recent years about 70 to 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in people 65 years and older, and 50 to 70 percent of hospitalizations have occurred among those in this age group. What’s more, says Poland, “An older person hospitalized with influenza runs about a 12-fold increased risk of heart attack and about a sixfold increased risk for stroke,” since flu increases the risk of these cardiovascular events. The particularly severe 2017-2018 flu season resulted in 810,000 hospitalizations and 61,000 deaths in the U.S. Sixty-seven percent of hospitalizations occurred in people age 65 and older that season; they also accounted for 83 percent of deaths. Last flu season, of course, was different. Rates of influenza during the 2020-2021 season were significantly lower than usual. For one thing, COVID-19 precautions — such as masks and social distancing, working from home, and reduced international travel — meant fewer opportunities for the flu to spread. Now that people are returning to a more “normal” life — ditching their masks, returning to offices and schools, gathering at sporting events, hopping on planes — health care experts warn that the virus could very well return to pre-pandemic levels. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT Lower immunity levels from last year’s nearly nonexistent flu season could also hurt us. “Since there was no flu last year, we don’t have any of that natural acquired immunity in our population this year. So that just means we have many more people susceptible which could fuel transmission if and when the season really picks up steam,” says Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin and director of the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. Which shot to get Those 65 and older should get one of two vaccines specifically targeting their vulnerable age group: Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD. Fluzone High-Dose gives you four times the amount of influenza antigens — the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against flu viruses — compared to the standard dose. The other option, FLUAD, contains an added adjuvant — a substance designed to boost your immune response. Talk to your health care provider about which is right for you. A flu shot can also help you avoid pneumonia, another respiratory infection that can sometimes piggyback on a system weakened by flu. According to new research, people who got a flu shot earlier this year may be less likely to suffer a severe COVID-19 infection down the road. In one such study, published in the journal Plos One, researchers analyzed the electronic medical records of 74,754 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and found that those who had gotten the flu vaccine during the previous six months were less likely to have had health complications related to their COVID-19 infection. Doctors typically recommend getting your shot between September and the end of October. Meyers recommends getting your shot on the earlier side this year, where possible. “We don’t know exactly if, when, or how large or how severe this flu season is going to be. But with RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], we saw an unusually early surge in transmission, and the same might happen with flu. Because of that uncertainty, people should absolutely vaccinate, and vaccinating early could provide more protection for individuals and for communities regardless of if and when the virus starts spreading widely.” In terms of timing, Christensen notes it’s also important to consider when you’ll receive the flu vaccine’s full protection. “After you get the shot, it takes about four to six weeks to build immunity against the flu. Then you get about six months of immunity out of each flu vaccine before the immunity starts to wane.” For this reason, he says, getting your shot in, say, August, could be too early, since protection could wear off while flu is still widespread. Even if you’re vaccinated, there’s a possibility you could get the flu. You may be exposed to a virus that is not included in the seasonal flu vaccine, since many different flu strains circulate every year. (The overall effectiveness the vaccine ranges from 40 to 60 percent during the years when the vaccine and flu strains match.) AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT “We decide on which strains are going to be in the vaccine no later than February or March. But by the time October and November come around, you can have a new influenza virus that is the predominantly circulating strain,” Poland says. “The public might say, ‘The vaccine didn’t work.’ Well, they’re right. But it’s because the virus changed.” Even so, a flu vaccination may lessen the severity of illness if you do get sick. A 2017 study found that the vaccine reduced deaths, ICU admissions and the length of hospital stays among flu patients. And know this: “Wearing masks, as well as practicing social distancing and hand sanitation, are as effective for the flu as they are for the coronavirus,” says Poland. What to know about the flu vaccine Who needs it: All adults, no matter what their age. Be sure to let your health care provider know if you’ve had a severe reaction to the flu shot in the past, are allergic to eggs (the flu vaccine is most commonly grown in them) or have (or have had) Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). On rare occasions, people may develop this disorder, in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes temporary paralysis in the days or weeks after getting the vaccination. (Studies suggest, however, that it’s more likely that a person will get GBS after getting the flu itself rather than the vaccination.) If you have a fever, you’ll likely be asked to wait until your temperature is back to normal before you get the vaccine. How often: Once a year (the sneaky virus itself changes every year). Flu season typically begins in October and ends in March; the CDC recommends rolling up your sleeve by the end of October, since it takes about two weeks after a vaccination for flu-fighting antibodies to develop in the body. Why you need it: The flu can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death — and older adults are the most vulnerable. Studies show that a vaccination can reduce the risk of falling ill by as much as 40 to 60 percent. What’s Ahead: Flu + Covid Shots Experts tell us it’s safe — as well as potentially time-saving — to get any upcoming COVID booster shot at the same time as your flu shot. What’s more, drug companies are currently working on combination vaccines designed to (down-the-road) tackle the flu and COVID, two very different viruses, in a single dose. Vaccine developer Novavax has combined its flu vaccine, NanoFlu — still in the testing phase — with the COVID-19 vaccine. The shot produced antibodies against both viruses. Moderna is also developing a vaccine targeting both flu and COVID-19 — with plans to develop a “triple-whammy” respiratory vaccine that combines seasonal flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) protection with a single injection. And Sanofi and Translate Bio have started a trial of a mRNA flu shot which targets a particularly nasty strain of the virus — H3N2 — associated with more severe illness, especially among those considered at-risk, such as older adults and younger children.

The West African nation initially confirmed the outbreak in 3 out of the 16 regions of the country – Greater Accra, Volta and the Central regions. But the spread has continued to the Ashanti, Western, Western North, and the Upper West regions. “Having the spread under control means 3 things. Early reporting, early detection & diagnosis and early containment. 2 and 3 are under Veterinary services which we are doing so. Early reporting is the role of farmers. For control we are, just that some farmers are not playing their parts,” a Risk Communicator at the Veterinary Services Directorate, Dr Benjamin Sasu told GhanaFact. ??????: ?????????? ???????? ??????????? 54 farms across 7 regions affected According to the latest update, more than 13,000 birds have been affected by the virus in the last one week across the 7 regions, with total birds affected more than 130,000. The Ashanti region leads the chart in terms of birds affected with 67,930 cases, followed by Greater Accra and the Central region. Meanwhile, the Greater Accra region has the most farms affected. Regional breakdown of Bird Flu outbreak as of September 6, 2021 Regions Farms Total death recorded Greater Accra 32 33,972 Ashanti 12 67,930 Central 5 15,707 Western North 1 5,999 Western 1 3,000 Volta 2 2,894 Upper West 1 1,438 Total 54 130,940 The Veterinary Services Directorate said some affected birds died naturally, while others were destroyed as part of efforts to contain the virus. Breakdown of birds affected across 7 regions Regions Natural death Depopulated Greater Accra 18,5888 15,384 Ashanti 14,306 53,624 Central 5,036 10,671 Volta 668 2,226 Western North 1,100 4,899 Western 1,000 2,000 Upper West 1,216 222 Total 41,914 89,026 There has been no human infection in Ghana yet since all samples taken from people directly working with the affected birds in Ghana didn’t yield a positive result for the virus. To ensure public safety, citizens are advised to: Report any unusual death of domestic poultry and wild birds to the nearest veterinary office and public authorities. Avoid the handling of dead birds with bare hands at all cost. Consume only well-cooked poultry meat and poultry products. First Bird Flu outbreak in Ghana Ghana first detected cases of Bird Flu in 2007 when the H5N1 virus was confirmed on a small scale poultry farm near the port city of Tema. Consequently, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture declared the Tema Municipality an Avian Influenza infected area and banned the movement of live birds within and out of the municipality until the virus was contained. The country has since recorded cases of bird flu disease in 2015, 2016 and 2018.
