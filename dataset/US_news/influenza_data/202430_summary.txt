H5N1 Outbreak in Cows: There has been an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in cows in the United States.

Transmission to Mammals: Researchers found that the H5N1 virus from cows can infect mice and ferrets.

Efficiency of Airborne Transmission: Airborne transmission of the H5N1 virus from infected ferrets to uninfected ferrets was not very efficient.

Spread within the Body: The virus spread beyond the respiratory system to organs and tissues such as mammary glands and muscle in infected mice and ferrets.

Transmission through Milk: The virus was found in the mammary glands of infected lactating female mice, and some of their nursing pups became infected, suggesting transmission through milk.

Potential Risk to Public Health: If the H5N1 virus from cows were to spread through the human population, it could pose a significant risk to public health.
