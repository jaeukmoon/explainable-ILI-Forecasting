We generated a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine bearing the HA of H1N1 A/California/07/09 that is unable to bind to its α(2,6)-linked SA receptor (H1Y98F-VLP) and compared its immunogenicity and efficacy to a wild-type H1-VLP (H1WT-VLP) in mice. The H1Y98F-VLP elicited significantly stronger and more durable antibody responses (hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization titers) and greater avidity maturation, likely attributable to improved germinal center formation. H1Y98F-VLP also resulted in a robust population of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells that correlated with antibody responses. Compared to H1WT-VLP vaccination, mice immunized with H1Y98F-VLP had 2.3-log lower lung viral loads and significantly lower pulmonary inflammatory cytokine levels 5 days post-challenge. These findings suggest that abrogation of HA-SA interactions may be a promising strategy to improve the quality and durability of influenza vaccine-induced humoral responses.

However, influenza vaccines have remained largely unchanged since their introduction in the mid-1940s1,2 despite significant year-to-year and strain-to-strain variation in effectiveness3,4. This inconsistency raises doubts about whether current vaccines would be suitably effective in the context of a pandemic and highlights the need for novel and more reliable approaches to influenza vaccination.Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is a trimeric glycoprotein on the surface of all influenza viruses that initiates infection by binding to sialic acid (SA) receptors on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells5. Antibodies that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HA can block this initial interaction with the host cell and are the basis for the most widely used correlate of protection for influenza infection6,7. HA proteins are therefore the major and, in some cases, the only antigens in all commercial influenza vaccines8. The binding properties of influenza HA are strain-specific and have been extensively studied in the context of disease severity and transmissibility5,9,10,11. However, the implications of HA binding properties on influenza vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy have not been investigated despite the presence of SA receptors on the surface of cells throughout the body12,13,14.We previously demonstrated that the strain-specific binding properties of influenza HA influence the pattern of interaction of HA-bearing virus-like particles (VLP) with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro15. These interactions were driven by differential expression of α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA on human PBMC and strongly influenced downstream innate immune activation15, raising the possibility that the binding properties of HA may be important modulators of influenza vaccine immunogenicity.In the current work, we sought to determine whether HA-SA interactions influence vaccine responses in vivo. We generated a plant-based HA-VLP vaccine bearing H1 (A/California/07/2009) that was unable to bind SA and compared its immunogenicity and efficacy to the wild-type (WT) H1-VLP using a murine model. Mutation of H1 binding was achieved by a single amino acid substitution from tyrosine to phenylalanine at residue 98 (Y98F, H3 numbering), which prevents HA-SA interactions by eliminating the hydroxyl group required for hydrogen bonding with SA. This mutation was originally described by Martín et al. using H3 (A/Aichi/2/68)16 but has subsequently been shown to prevent SA binding of many influenza A HAs, including H1 (A/California/07/2009), due to its position within a conserved region of the RBD17. This mutation does not affect the integrity of the RBD or HA folding17,18 making the H1Y98F-VLP a good candidate for studying the possible impact of HA-SA interactions on vaccine responses. Herein, we demonstrate that elimination of HA-SA interactions significantly improves both the immunogenicity and efficacy of a plant-based H1-VLP vaccine.ResultsGeneration and validation of H1Y98F-VLPVLP composed of a plant-lipid bilayer studded with the WT H1 (H1WT-VLP) or Y98F H1 (H1Y98F-VLP) were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana as previously described using a 2X35S/CPMV160/NOS expression system19,20,21 (Fig. 1a). Expression of HA in crude leaf digests was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 1b). Following purification, VLP preparations were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized using Coomassie G-250 staining to evaluate the protein composition and purity (Fig. 1c). HA was predominantly expressed in its uncleaved form (HA0), however, faint bands corresponding to cleaved HA (HA1 and HA2) and HA dimers were observed. The purity of the HA-VLP products was determined by analysis of the densitometry profile of each protein band and was comparable between formulations (~95%). VLP size (~100 nm) and morphology were consistent with previous reports20,22 and were unaffected by the Y98F mutation (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1: Y98F mutation abrogates SA binding without affecting HA expression or VLP structure.Wild-type (WT) H1 (H1WT) and Y98F H1 (H1Y98F) were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. a Representation of the H1WT (top) and H1Y98F (bottom) expression cassettes. 2X35S/CPMV160 promoter, double 35S promoter fused to the 5′ UTR of a cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) expression enhancer; SpPDI signal peptide from alfalfa protein disulfide isomerase, NOS nopaline synthase terminator signal. b Expression of HA was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of crude leaf extracts followed by immunoblot analysis. Commercially available recombinant H1 expressed in HEK-293 cells (recH1, Immune Technologies) was included as a positive control (1 µg). 1° ab: rabbit polyclonal anti-H1 1:500 (Cat.

Images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 Spirit transmission electron microscope. Scale bar = 100 nm. e Sialic acid (SA) binding was evaluated based on hemagglutination of turkey red blood cells following incubation (30 min) with serial two-fold dilutions of H1WT- and H1Y98F-VLP (starting at 1:150 and 1:10, respectively). SA binding was further quantified by SPR. f SPR sensorgram showing the binding response of H1WT- (red) and H1Y98F-VLP (blue) to α-2,6 SA captured on a streptavidin-coated chip surface. g Relative binding of H1Y98F-VLP when adjusted for HA content.Full size imageWith multiple active HA trimers on their surface, H1WT-VLPs are capable of mediating hemagglutination by binding to SA on the surface of red blood cells (RBC). Introduction of the Y98F mutation prevented hemagglutination, indicating that SA binding was greatly reduced or abolished (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, H1Y98F-VLP failed to agglutinate human PBMC (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Incubation of PBMC with H1Y98F-VLP dramatically reduced polyclonal B cell activation that occurs following binding of the H1WT-VLP15,23 and increased T cell activation (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d), indicating that reduced binding can modulate downstream immune responses. To confirm that the Y98F mutation inhibits HA-SA interactions on a molecular level, we measured binding of H1WT- and H1Y98F-VLP to immobilized SA by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The slope of the association curve was 1.66 resonance units per second (RU/s) for H1WT-VLP and 0.3 RU/s for H1Y98F-VLP (Fig. 1f). Importantly, H1Y98F-VLP was tested at a much higher concentration than H1WT-VLP (44x). When the slopes were adjusted for HA content, a 99.6% reduction in binding was attributable to the Y98F mutation (H1 0.59 RU/s; Y98F H1 0.002 RU/s) (Fig. 1g). Taken together, these data suggested that H1Y98F-VLP was an appropriate tool to evaluate the role of HA-SA interactions in the context of influenza vaccine responses.H1Y98F -VLP elicits stronger and more durable humoral responsesTo establish whether HA-SA interactions influence the humoral immune response to vaccination in mice, we measured the development of H1-specific antibodies in sera following vaccination with 1 dose of H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F-VLP (3 µg HA/dose) or an equivalent volume of PBS (placebo). Total H1-specifc IgG was measured by ELISA and functional antibodies were quantified using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay to measure antibodies that block the binding of live virus to avian RBCs24 and the microneutralization (MN) assay to measure antibodies that prevent infection of Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells25. Antibodies were quantified at 21 days post-vaccination (dpv) to characterize pre-challenge humoral responses and on a monthly basis (1–3 m, 7 m) to evaluate the kinetics and durability of the antibody responses.Immunization with H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F-VLP resulted in comparable H1-specific IgG titers by ELISA at all time points (Fig. 2a) but there were marked differences in antibody functionality. Most notably, vaccination with H1Y98F-VLP resulted in significantly higher HI and MN titers at 21 dpv (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 2b–c). Titers increased until 3 months post-vaccination (mpv) in both groups but were consistently higher among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP. Furthermore, H1Y98F-VLP resulted in improved durability of HI titers, which declined dramatically between 3 and 7 mpv in mice vaccinated with H1WT-VLP. As a result, HI titers were >4-fold higher among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP at 7 mpv (p = 0.029) (Fig. 2b). MN titers were better maintained in the H1WT-VLP group at 7 mpv but still declined in 4/8 animals and remained significantly lower than in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (p = 0.029) (Fig. 2c). H1-specific antibodies were not detected in the placebo group.Fig. 2: H1Y98F-VLP elicits a more robust and durable antibody response.Mice were vaccinated (IM) with H1WT- or H1Y98F-VLP (3 µg/dose). Sera were collected at day 21 (left panel) or on a monthly basis (right panel) to measure (a) total H1-specific IgG by ELISA, (b) hemagglutination inhibition titers and (c) microneutralization titers. d Avidity indices of sera obtained 2–7 mpv following incubation with 8 M urea. e H1-specific IgG-producing plasma cells (PC) in the bone marrow measured by ELISpot. Representative wells from each group are shown on the right. f Spearman’s rank correlation technique was applied to evaluate the relationship between the frequency of PC and IgG titers (left), HI titers (middle) and MN titers (right). Error bars represent the mean ± SEM. At day 21, N = 40–70/group and data are pooled from six independent experiments. For long-term studies, N = 7–8/group. Statistical significance between vaccine groups was determined by Mann–Whitney test (*p < 0.033, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Statistical significance between time points within the same group was determined by two-way ANOVA with the Geisser-Greenhouse correction and Sidak’s multiple comparisons (♦p < 0.033).Full size imageVaccination with H1Y98F-VLP also resulted in better IgG avidity maturation. Although H1-specific IgG titers plateaued around 2 mpv, IgG avidity significantly increased between 2 and 3 mpv in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (p = 0.03). As a result, IgG avidity was ~3-fold higher in the H1Y98F-VLP group at 3 mpv and this difference was maintained until 7 mpv (p = 0.014) (Fig. 2d). No avidity maturation occurred beyond 2 mpv in mice vaccinated with H1WT-VLP.Sustained production of high avidity IgG is thought to be mediated by plasma cells (PC) residing in the bone marrow (BM)26. To evaluate whether these cells contribute to the improved durability of antibody responses in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP, we quantified H1-specific IgG-producing BM PC at 7 mpv by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. Few H1-specific BM PC were detected in the placebo group (2 ± 1 PC/1 × 106 cells). H1-specific BM PC were detected in both vaccine groups and the frequency was higher among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2e). Interestingly, the frequency of H1-specific BM PC seemed to correspond with the durability of antibody responses: MN titers declined between 3 and 7 mpv in all mice with <10 PC/1 × 106 BM cells and were maintained in animals with ≥10 PC/1 × 106 BM cells regardless of vaccine group (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the frequency of H1-specific BM PC significantly correlated with IgG (rs = 0.704, p = 0.003), HI (rs = 0.604, p = 0.015) and MN titers (rs = 0.657, p = 0.007) at 7 mpv (Fig. 2f).Although adults typically receive a single dose of inactivated influenza vaccine each year, children who are immunologically naïve to influenza require two doses for an adequate immune response27. Because laboratory mice are immunologically naive, we evaluated the humoral responses in mice given two doses of H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F-VLP administered 21 days apart. By 28 days post-boost, HI titers were significantly higher among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (p = 0.02) (Supplementary Fig. 2a) and a similar trend was observed in MN titers (Supplementary Fig. 2b). While no significant differences were observed regarding H1-specific IgG titers (Supplementary Fig. 2c) immunization with two doses of H1Y98F-VLP resulted in significantly higher IgG avidity (Supplementary Fig. 2d, p = 0.03 at 4 M and 6 M urea) and H1-specific IgG-producing PC in the BM by 28 days post-boost (p = 0.02) (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Once again, the frequency of BM PC was strongly correlated with IgG titers, HI titers, MN titers, and IgG avidity in both vaccine groups (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Improved humoral responses were also observed among mice vaccinated with two doses of a plant-based non-binding H1Y98F-VLP based on the H1 A/Idaho/07/2018 sequence (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c) and human cell culture-produced H1Y98F trimers based on the H1 A/Brisbane/02/2018 sequence (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that HA-SA interactions broadly impact humoral responses to H1.H1Y98F-VLP improves germinal center reactionsThe germinal center (GC) is central to the development of high avidity antibodies and long-lived PC. To determine whether differences in the GC account for improved antibody responses to H1Y98F-VLP, we evaluated GC kinetics in the draining popliteal lymph node (LN) following footpad injection of H1WT- or H1Y98F-VLP. The frequencies of GC B cells (CD19+GL7+Fas+) and TFH cells (CD3+CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+) were evaluated by flow cytometry at 3 day intervals 7–19 dpv (see Supplementary Fig. 5 for full gating strategy). Both VLPs resulted in similar frequencies of GC B cells at all time points and peaked at 13 dpv (Fig. 3a). However, striking differences in TFH frequencies and kinetics were observed (Fig. 3b). H1Y98F-VLP resulted in more rapid induction of TFH cells that were maintained until 19 dpv. In contrast, the H1WT-VLP resulted in a gradual expansion of TFH cells until 13 dpv followed by a rapid decline. As a result, the frequency of TFH cells was significantly higher among H1Y98F-VLP-vaccinated mice in early and late GCs (7 dpv p = 0.017; 19 dpv p = 0.03). No increase in GC B cells or TFH cells was observed at any time point among control mice injected with PBS (Supplementary Fig. 6).Fig. 3: H1Y98F-VLP promotes enhanced germinal center selection.Mice were immunized with 0.5 µg H1WT- or H1Y98F-VLP in the right hind limb footpad and popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) were harvested at indicated time points. The mean frequency (±SEM) of (a) CD19+Fas+GL7+ GC B cells and (b) CD3+CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ TFH cells was determined by flow cytometry. Representative plots showing GC B cell and TFH gating are shown on the right. To identify H1-specific GC B cells, freshly isolated cells were incubated with 1 µg/ml H1Y98F-VLP (30 min, 4 °C) and cognate GC B cells were detected following staining with anti-H1 FITC. c Representative plots and d mean frequency (±SEM) of HA+ cells among GC B cells. Data are pooled from three independent experiments, n = 7–13/group at each time point. Statistical significance between groups at each time point was determined by Mann–Whitney test (*p < 0.033).Full size imageGiven the importance of TFH cells in avidity maturation of GC B cells, we next sought to determine whether vaccination with H1Y98F-VLP results in improved recognition of the H1 antigen among GC B cells. Antigen-specific GC B cells were distinguished based on their ability to bind H1Y98F-VLP in vitro and were detected using fluorescently labeled anti-H1. This strategy allows for reliable detection of cognate B cells while avoiding SA-mediated interactions with non-cognate cells. H1-specific GC B cells were quantified prior to vaccination and at intervals corresponding to early (7 dpv), peak (13 dpv) and late (19 dpv) GC evolution (Fig. 3c, d). Prior to vaccination GC B cells were rare in all groups (<1% of B cells) and did not bind the H1Y98F-VLP probe (Fig. 3c). Following vaccination, H1-specific GC B cells were readily detected in both vaccine groups, however, H1Y98F-VLP resulted in an increased frequency of these cells within the GC at all time points. This effect was most pronounced at 19 dpv when the frequency of H1-specific B cells in the GC was ~30% higher among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP compared to H1WT-VLP (p = 0.011) (Fig. 3d). Among non-GC B cells (CD19+GL7−Fas−), the frequency of H1-specific cells was similar between vaccine groups and was comparable to pre-vaccination levels (Supplementary Fig. 7). Taken together, H1Y98F-VLP favors a more antigen-specific GC response characterized by improved maintenance of TFH cells and expansion of H1-specific GC B cells.CD4+ T cell response to H1Y98F-VLP correlates with antibody responsesAntigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the spleen and BM were quantified by flow cytometry following vaccination with H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F -VLP. Freshly isolated cells were stimulated with H1WT-VLP (18 h) or a pool of 131 overlapping peptides (15aa) spanning the H1 sequence (6 h) and responding cells were characterized as antigen-experienced (CD44+) CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2, IFNγ and/or TNFα (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for full gating strategy). The frequencies of H1-specific CD4+ T cells observed following stimulation with either the H1WT-VLP or the H1 peptide pool were highly correlated (rs = 0.5344, p < 0.0001) and had similar cytokine signatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). However, the magnitude of the response was greater upon stimulation with the H1WT-VLP, allowing for more reliable identification of rare populations. Thus, functional signatures were evaluated in cells stimulated with H1WT-VLP.A single 3 µg dose of H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F-VLP elicited significant populations of H1-specific CD4+ T cells in the spleen compared to placebo at 28 days post-vaccination (p = 0.01 and p = 0.009, respectively). There were no differences in the magnitude or functional signatures between vaccine groups (Fig. 4a). Both vaccines elicited significant populations of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells (H1WT p = 0.009; H1Y98F p = 0.01) and IFNγ single-positive cells compared to the placebo group (H1WT p = 0.02; H1Y98F p = 0.002). In contrast, vaccination with two 0.5 µg doses 21 days apart resulted in marked differences in CD4+ T cell signatures between vaccine groups (Fig. 4b). In the spleen, the IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− population continued to account for the majority of polyfunctional cells. However, this population was significantly larger in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (p = 0.01). Conversely, IFNγ+ cells were more prevalent among H1-specific CD4+ T cells elicited by H1WT-VLP. It should be noted that the frequency of IFNγ+ cells was low in both groups despite substantial IFNγ+ populations elicited by a single 3 µg dose of either vaccine. This discrepancy likely reflects the lower antigen dose in the two-dose regimen, as the magnitude of the CD4+ T cell response to a plant-based H1WT-VLP is dose dependent in humans28. As expected, IFNγ+ and polyfunctional populations were markedly increased in mice that received two 3 µg doses, but functional signatures remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 10). With the exception of the frequency and relative proportion of single-positive IL-2 CD4+ T cells, similar signatures were also observed following vaccination with H1WT- and H1Y98F-VLPs targeting H1 A/Idaho/07/2018 (Fig. S3d, e).Fig. 4: H1Y98F-VLP elicits robust CD4+ T cell responses with enhanced recruitment of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells to the bone marrow.Splenocytes and BM immune cells were stimulated for 18 h with 2.5 µg/ml H1WT-VLP. Flow cytometry was used to quantify H1-specific CD4+ T cells in a splenocytes isolated at 28 days post-vaccination (3 µg) and in b splenocytes and c BM immune cells at 28 days post-boost (0.5 µg/dose). Background values obtained from non-stimulated samples were subtracted from values obtained following stimulation with H1WT-VLP. a–c The left panel shows the mean frequency (±SEM) of CD4+ T cells expressing CD44 and at least one of IL-2, TNFα or IFNγ. The right panel shows the individual cytokine signatures of responding CD4+ T cells obtained by Boolean analysis. Color-matched pie charts depict relative distributions of cytokine-producing CD4+ T cell populations and IFNγ+ populations are highlighted by a green arc. Statistical significance was determined by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons (total response) or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons (cytokine signatures) (*p < 0.033, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001). Spearman’s rank correlation technique was applied to evaluate the relationship between (d) the frequency of H1-specific CD4+ T cells in the spleen and BM, e the frequency of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ- CD4+ T cells in the spleen and IgG avidity index (4 M urea) and f the frequency of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells in the BM and HI titer (*p < 0.033, **p < 0.01).Full size imageAntigen-specific CD4+ T cells were also measured in the BM, which serves as a major reservoir for long-term maintenance of memory CD4+ T cells following vaccination29. Immune cells were isolated from bilateral femurs 28 days post-boost and evaluated in parallel with splenocytes. Overall, cytokine signatures in the BM resembled those observed in the spleen. However, only the H1Y98F-VLP resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of H1-specific CD4+ T cells compared to the placebo group (p = 0.03) (Fig. 4c). The frequency of H1-specific CD4+ T cells in the BM strongly correlated with the frequency of responding cells in the spleen in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (rs = 1.00, p = 0.0167) but not H1WT-VLP (rs = −0.1, p = 0.95), suggesting that a defect in recruitment contributes to the low frequency of H1-specific CD4+ T cells in the BM of H1WT-VLP-vaccinated mice (Fig. 4d). Similar to the spleen, the response to H1Y98F-VLP was dominated by IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells and IFNγ-expressing cells were virtually absent. Conversely, nearly 30% of BM CD4+ T cells elicited by H1WT-VLP were IFNγ+, and IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− cells were underrepresented in the BM compared to the spleen (24 vs. 32% of responding cells) (Fig. 4c).Given that CD4+ T cells with the IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− phenotype have been shown to correlate with antibody responses to a number of vaccine antigens30,31, we sought to determine whether expansion of this population correlated with improved avidity maturation and functional antibody titers among mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP. In the spleen, the frequency of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− cells correlated with IgG avidity maturation in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (rs = 0.6809, p = 0.0355) but not H1WT -VLP (rs = 0.07976, p = 0.8355) (Fig. 4e). However, in the BM, this T cell population was strongly correlated with HI titers in both vaccine groups (rs = 0.7957, p = 0.008) (Fig. 4f). This population also significantly correlated with MN titers (rs = 0.7431, p = 0.0169) and IgG avidity (rs = 0.8293, p = 0.0045), but not total IgG (rs = 0.3598, p = 0.3054). Taken together, these findings suggest that enhanced recruitment of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells to the BM may contribute to improved functional antibody responses in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP (Fig. 4f).H1Y98F-VLP results in reduced viral load and pulmonary inflammation following homologous challengeIn a study to compare protection following vaccination with H1WT- and H1Y98F-VLP, mice were challenged with 1.6 × 103 times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of H1N1 (A/California/07/09) 28 d post-vaccination with a single dose of 3 µg H1WT- or H1Y98F-VLP or an equivalent volume of PBS. Infection resulted in substantial weight loss (17.3 ± 1.3% at day 5) and 64.3% mortality in the placebo group. Consistent with previous reports32, vaccination with H1WT-VLP resulted in complete protection from lethal infection. Similarly, all mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP survived and there was no significant difference in post-infection weight loss between the vaccinated groups (4–6% at day 5) (Fig. 5a). However, significant differences in the rate of viral clearance and pulmonary inflammation were observed.Fig. 5: H1Y98F-VLP improves viral clearance and reduces pulmonary inflammation upon lethal challenge.Female Balb/c mice were challenged with 1.6 × 103 TCID50 of H1N1 (A/California/07/09) 28 days post-vaccination with 3 µg H1WT- or H1Y98F-VLP or an equivalent volume of PBS. a Mean weight loss (left) and survival (right) were monitored for 12 dpi (n = 12–14/group, error bars represent SEM). Mice weighing <80% of their pre-challenge weight were euthanized. A subset of challenged mice (n = 9/group) were euthanized at 3 dpi and 5 dpi for evaluation of the viral load and pulmonary inflammation. b Viral titers in the supernatant of lung homogenates calculated using the Karber method and reported as TCID50/100 µl supernatant (GMT ± 95% CI). c Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatant of lung homogenates measured by multiplex ELISA (mean ± SEM).

Statistical significance for b and c were determined by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons.

Vaccination with H1Y98F-VLP, but not H1WT-VLP, resulted in a decrease in the viral titer compared to placebo at 3 dpi (p < 0.001). In both groups, viral titers were inversely correlated with HI and MN titers (HI rs = −0.695, p = 0.001; MN rs = −0.7067, p = 0.001). By 5 dpi, viral titers in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP were nearly 2-log lower than mice vaccinated with H1WT-VLP (p = 0.03) and there was no significant difference between the placebo and H1WT-VLP-vaccinated mice (p = 0.31).Lung homogenates were evaluated by multiplex ELISA (Quansys) to quantify several cytokines (TNFα, IFNγ, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α and RANTES) implicated in influenza-mediated acute lung injury (Fig. 5c, d)33,34. Baseline levels were established using lung homogenates from mock-infected mice. Overall, vaccination with either H1WT-VLP or H1Y98F-VLP resulted in reduced cytokines and chemokines compared to the placebo group at 3 dpi, but there were no significant differences between the vaccinated groups. However, by 5 dpi there was a marked divergence in pulmonary inflammation and all cytokine/chemokine levels except for TNFα were significantly lower in the H1Y98F-VLP vaccinated mice compared to the H1WT-VLP group. Strikingly, mice vaccinated with H1WT-VLP exhibited a significant increase in IFNγ compared to 3 dpi (p = 0.005) with levels nearing the placebo group (1570 ± 315 and 1887 ± 367 pg/ml, respectively). IFNγ levels correlated with the viral titer (rs = −0.7050, p = 0.001) in both vaccinated groups and remained near the baseline in mice that received H1Y98F-VLP (172 ± 46 pg/ml). IL-1β, MIP-1α and RANTES levels followed similar trends. Consistent with these findings, histopathological evaluation of lungs collected at 4 dpi revealed that mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP had less pulmonary inflammation compared to H1WT-VLP-vaccinated mice and more closely resembled mock-infected animals (Fig. 5e). Together, these findings suggest that while both vaccines protected from lethal influenza infection, mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP were better able to control and clear the virus and exhibited reduced influenza-associated lung inflammation.DiscussionVaccination is the most effective strategy to prevent influenza-associated morbidity and mortality, however, vaccine effectiveness is often limited by variable immunogenicity and rapidly waning protection35,36. We have demonstrated that SA binding properties of influenza HA influence vaccine responses and that ablation of HA-SA interactions can improve the quality and durability of immune responses in mice. Non-binding H1 mutants were generated using the previously described Y98F mutation, which prevents SA binding without affecting antibody recognition of the globular head or RBD17. Although historically used as probes to identify HA-specific B cells17,23,37 and more recently in studies targeting the generation of stem-specific antibodies38,39, the Y98F mutation was not thought to influence immunogenicity. By directly comparing H1WT and H1Y98F antigens in vaccination and challenge models, we have demonstrated that HA-SA binding can have significant impact on influenza vaccine responses.Antibodies that mediate HI have long been shown to provide protection and are widely considered to be a good predictor of vaccine efficacy. Thus, the induction of high HI titers is important for licensure of influenza vaccines in many jurisdictions40,41,42. MN titers also correlate with protection and provide useful insight into the functional neutralizing capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies43. In this study we demonstrated that ablation of HA-SA binding has broad impact on the humoral response to vaccination. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a strong correlation between HI and MN titers43 and pre-infection antibody were inversely correlated with pulmonary peak viral load (3 dpi) in both vaccine groups, suggesting that these antibodies play a direct role in controlling infection. While viral titers in the lungs do not always correlate with morbidity44,45, the strong inverse correlations between viral titers and pulmonary inflammatory cytokines and infiltrates suggest that the viral load is a good reflection of disease severity in this model. The improved functional antibody response elicited by H1Y98F-VLP is therefore likely to have played an important role in reducing the severity of infection.Our data suggest that eliminating HA-SA binding may also improve the durability of the antibody response to influenza vaccines. Vaccine-induced HI titers typically decline rapidly post-vaccination46,47,48,49, consistent with our observations in mice that received H1WT-VLP. In sharp contrast, HI and MN titers in mice vaccinated with H1Y98F-VLP were maintained at peak levels until 7 mpv. While the mechanisms underlying this observation are under further investigation, improved specificity and longevity of the GC reaction and an increase in HA-specific PC in the BM likely play an important role. BM PC can persist for decades following antigen exposure in humans and are thought to mediate long-term maintenance of serum antibody titers following vaccination18,50. Our finding that increased frequencies of BM PC correlate with HI, MN, and total IgG titers at 7 mpv suggests that this population is central to the durability of humoral response elicited by H1Y98F-VLP. Weisel et al. have shown that long-lived PC in the BM arise from late GC B cells (18–20 days) after a prolonged period of somatic hypermutation and avidity maturation51. The increased HA-specific BM PC we found in the H1Y98F-VLP group is therefore likely a reflection of the increased HA-specific B cells and TFH cells in the GC of these animals at 19 dpv.Although influenza vaccine developers have focused primarily on humoral responses, antigen-specific T cells undoubtedly play important roles in protection and often generate more broad and cross-reactive responses than antibodies52. CD4+ T cells support both B cell affinity maturation and CD8+ T cell responses and can mediate protection in a murine vaccination/challenge model in the absence of neutralizing antibodies53. Previous studies have demonstrated that plant-based H1WT-VLPs elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses in both mice and humans with increased CD4+ T cell polyfunctionality compared to inactivated vaccines32,54,55,56,57. The overall pattern of CD4+ T cell responses in this study was consistent with previous reports and was not compromised in the absence of HA-SA interactions. However, there were no differences between vaccine groups after a single dose, suggesting that enhanced viral clearance in this model was driven primarily by the better humoral response to the H1Y98F-VLP vaccine. Interestingly, two doses of H1Y98F-VLP resulted in significant expansion of the IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− population, which was strongly correlated with humoral responses. Others have demonstrated that this population is comprised of Th1 cells and a population of primed but uncommitted T helper cells (Thpp) with high proliferative and differentiation potential58. Thpp cells are frequently generated in primary responses to antigens including influenza58, thus, it is not surprising that both vaccines elicited similar frequencies of IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells after a single dose. However, subsequent exposure to influenza HA typically results in expression of IFNγ58,59. Expansion of the IFNγ− population in the spleen upon boosting with H1Y98F-VLP but not the H1WT-VLP is reminiscent of the CD4+ T cell responses to protein vaccines such as hepatitis B, diphtheria and tetanus, that are dominated by Thpp cells and elicit robust and durable antibody responses30,31,60. The Thpp bias induced by the “non-binding” HA and concomitantly higher HI titers were also observed with H1 A/Idaho/07/2018, suggesting that the impact on CD4+ T cells could broadly influence H1 humoral responses.To our knowledge, Thpp cells have not been described in the BM and it is unknown whether this population is a common feature of other protein vaccines. However, BM CD4+ T cells are a major reservoir for long-lasting immunity and are known to provide efficient help to B cells29,61. Thus, enhanced homing of CD4+ T cells to the BM may contribute to the enhanced durability of the responses we observed following H1Y98F-VLP vaccination. Interestingly, IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells in the BM significantly correlated with HI titers, MN titers and IgG avidity, but not total IgG titers. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ− CD4+ T cells play a role in B cell selection, giving rise to antibodies with increased avidity and functional capacity.Beyond the possibility that Y98F HAs behave similarly to traditional protein vaccines, the mechanisms underlying their improved immunogenicity are not yet clear. However, a likely contributor is better trafficking to the draining LN in the absence of SA binding. Terminal α2,3 and α2,6 SAs are widely distributed throughout the body, including on skeletal muscle cells12,62,63. Thus, the H1WT-VLP and recombinant WT HAs may be more likely to be sequestered at the site of injection or en route to the draining LN due to HA-SA interactions. In support this hypothesis, previous work has demonstrated that while eGFP-labeled H5-VLP can be detected in the popliteal LN 10 min after footpad injection64, a substantial eGFP signal remains at the site of injection for up to 24 h. Soluble eGFP was not retained in the footpad, suggesting that SA binding may contribute to injection site retention65. Although depot-type adjuvants that “trickle” antigen into the draining LN can enhance affinity maturation through prolonged antigen availability in the GC66, the rapid decline in TFH cells suggests that this is not occurring in mice vaccinated with H1WT-VLP. It is possible that H1WT-VLPs retained at the injection site are degraded prior to delivery to the draining LN. Thus, retention of H1WT antigen at the site of injection may reduce the concentration of antigen delivered to draining LN without providing sustained antigen presentation. In addition, HA-SA interactions may limit immune recognition of important neutralizing epitopes on the globular head of HA through steric hindrance. Ongoing investigations aim to characterize the impact of SA binding on trafficking of the H1 antigen to the draining LN and epitope specificity of the immune response.In addition to these mechanistic studies, we are also evaluating the generalizability of these findings with respect to different influenza strain HAs and different production platforms. The fact that a H1Y98F-VLP targeting an antigenically distinct H1 (A/Idaho/07/2018) has similar immune effects suggests that eliminating HA-SA interactions may be a promising strategy to improve immunogenicity of vaccines against current and emerging strains of influenza. Confirmatory studies with additional non-binding VLPs (e.g.: H3N2 and B strains) will be required to evaluate the broad generalizability of this approach. The fact that improved humoral responses were observed with soluble H1Y98F trimers (A/Brisbane/02/2018) suggests that this strategy may confer similar benefits across recombinant vaccine platforms. Although egg-based propagation of influenza A strains bearing Y98F HA has been described16, mutations that restore HA binding may limit the viability of this approach in platforms requiring the growth of live virus67. Finally, since receptor-binding proteins are often targets of choice for viral vaccines and many of the receptors for these viruses have wide tissue distribution, our observations raise the possibility that manipulation of non-cognate binding interactions may have application beyond influenza vaccines. For example, SA binding is a common feature of many viruses and vaccine antigens including the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of mumps virus68, the VP8* domain of bovine-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine strains69, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein70.Taken together, we have demonstrated that altering the binding of HA to its SA receptor can have a significant impact on influenza vaccine-mediated immunity and viral clearance in mice. Elimination of the HA-SA interaction may be a simple, effective and readily implemented strategy to improve both the quality and durability of influenza vaccine responses. Although there is still much to learn mechanistically, if these findings are confirmed in human studies, the use of non-binding HAs may make an important contribution to the development of next-generation influenza vaccines.MethodsH1WT and H1Y98F expression cassettesThe sequences encoding mature WT and Y98F HA0 A/California/07/2009 fused to alfalfa PDI secretion signal peptide (PDISP) were cloned into 2X35S/CPMV160/NOS expression system using PCR-based methods. To generate the H1WT expression cassette, the PDISP-A/California/07/2009 coding sequence was amplified using primers IF-CPMV(fl5′UTR)_SpPDI.c (5′-TCGTGCTTCGGCACCAGTACAATGGCGAAAAACGT-TGCGATTTTCGGCT-3′) and IF-H1cTMCT.S1-4r (5′-ACTAAAGAAAATAGGCCTTTA-AATACATATTCTACACTGTAGAGAC-3′). To generate the H1Y98F expression cassette, the PDISP-A/California/07/2009 coding sequence with the mutated Y98F amino acid (H3 numbering) was amplified first using primers IF-CPMV(fl5′UTR)_SpPDI.c and H1_Cal(Y91F).r (5′-AAATCTCCTGGGAAACACGTTCCATTGTCTGAACTAGGTGTT-TCCACAA-3′), and second using primers H1_Cal(Y91F).c (5′-AGACAATGGAACGTGT-TTCCCAGGAGATTTCATCGATTATGAGGAGCTA-3′) and IF-H1cTMCT.S14r. The PCR products from both amplifications were mixed and used as a template for amplification using primers IF-CPMV(fl5′UTR)_SpPDI.c and IF-H1cTMCT.S14r. The final amplification products were assembled into the pCAMBIA binary plasmid containing 2X35S/CPMV160/NOS and linearized by digestion with SacII and StuI restriction enzymes using the In-Fusion cloning system (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).Protein expression and VLP purificationVLPs were produced by transient transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying H1WT or H1Y98F expression cassettes. Briefly, N. benthamiana plants (41–44 days old) were vacuum infiltrated in batches and the aerial parts of the plants were harvested and frozen (−80 °C) after 7 days of incubation. To extract and purify VLPs, frozen plant leaves were homogenized in 1 l of extraction buffer [50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) with 0.04% (w/v) Na2S2O5]/kg biomass. The homogenate was pressed through a 400 µm nylon filter and the fluid was retained. Filtrates were clarified by centrifugation (5000 × g) and filtration (1.2 µm glass fiber, 3 M Zeta Plus, 0.45-0.2 µm filter) and then concentrated by centrifugation (75,000 × g, 20 min). VLPs were further concentrated and purified by ultracentrifugation over an iodixanol density gradient (120,000 × g, 2 h). VLP-rich fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM NaPO4, 65 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween 80 (pH 6.0). This clarified extract was captured on a Poros HS column (Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 50 mM NaPO4, 1 M NaCl, 0.005% Tween 80. After washing with 25 mM Tris, 0.005% Tween 80 (pH 8.0), the VLPs were eluted with 50 mM NaPO4, 700 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween 80 (pH 6.0). Purified VLPs were dialyzed against formulation buffer (100 mM NaKPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80 (pH 7.4)) and passed through a 0.22 µm filter for sterilization. Protein concentrations were determined using PierceTM micro BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysisTo confirm HA expression, 2 g of biomass were homogenized in 4 ml extraction buffer with 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and the crude extracts (25 µl/sample) were separated a Criterion XT 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Successful transfer was confirmed using ponceau red staining followed by de-staining with water. Membranes were blocked overnight (4 °C) with 5% skim milk in TBST (tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-H1 (Cat. No. IT-003-SW, Immune Technology) diluted 1:500 in TBST + 2% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Membranes were then incubated for 1 h (RT) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cat. No. IT-200-01, Immune Technology) diluted 1:20,000 in TBST + 2% skim milk. Bands were developed using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) and detected on X-ray films. For VLP composition and purity analysis, purified VLP products (5 µg/sample) were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel as described above followed by staining with biosafe Coomassie G-250 (Bio-Rad). Gels were imaged using ChemiDocTM XRS + system (Bio-Rad). See Supplementary Fig. 11 for unmodified gel and blot images.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)VLP samples were diluted to 100 µg/ml in PBS and 5 µl of each were placed on 200 copper grids (Agar Scientific) for 45 s. Grids were washed 2x (1 min each) with 5 µl distilled water followed by two incubations with 1.5% uranyl acetate. Excess fluid was removed and samples were left to air dry. Grids were imaged on a Tecnai G2 Spirit Twin 120 kV Cryo-TEM (FEI) equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera model 895 (Gatan).Surface plasmon resonanceBinding of VLP to biotinylated ɑ-2,6 sialic acid glycans (6′-sialyl(LacNAc)-PEG-biotin) was quantified by SPR using a BiacoreTM 8 K system (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Biotinylated synthetic glycan (Sussex Research Laboratories Inc.) was immobilized to a Series S sensor chip SA at a minimum target of 400 resonance units (RU) in the test flow cells. VLPs were diluted in HBS-EP + Buffer (assay running buffer) and injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min (120 s contact time) at 4 °C. H1WT-VLP was diluted 150x and 100x (2.5 and 4 µg/ml) and H1Y98F-VLP was diluted 10x and 5x (88 and 176 µg/ml). The standard curve included 8 dilutions ranging from 10 to 0.08 μg/ml. The flow was initially directed over a mock surface to which no protein is bound, followed by the biotinylated glycan. Response from the protein surface is corrected for the response from the mock surface (surface reference). Data analysis was performed using BiacoreTM 8 K Insight Evaluation Software (version 2.0.15.12933) using concentration analysis mode (fitting function linear analysis). The slope of the association curve was measured for each VLP and normalized for HA content. Relative binding was calculated based on the adjusted slopes, with the H1Y98F-VLP assigned a value of 100%.Vaccination and sample collectionAll animal procedures were carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, as approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University. Female Balb/c mice (8–10 weeks old, Charles River Laboratories) were immunized by injection into the quadricep muscle with VLP formulations containing 0.5–3 µg HA (50 µl total in PBS). Mice were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on day 21 (when indicated). To evaluate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses mice were euthanized on day 28 (one-dose) or day 49 (28 days post-boost) by CO2 asphyxiation. A small group of mice were maintained for 7 months to evaluate long-term immunity and sera were collected monthly.Blood was collected from the left lateral saphenous vein before each vaccination and by cardiac puncture at study endpoints. Sera were obtained by centrifugation of blood in microtainer serum separator tubes (Beckton Dickinson) (8000 × g, 10 min) and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Spleens were collected in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium (Wisent). Single cell suspensions were prepared by passing spleens through a 70 µm strainer (BD Biosciences) and RBC were lysed using ACK buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM NA2EDTA, pH 7.4). Cells were washed in HBSS and then resuspended in RPMI (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), 1 mM penicillin/streptomycin (Wisent) and 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) (complete RPMI, cRPMI). Femurs were collected in cRPMI, sterilized in 70% ethanol (2 min) and rinsed with HBSS. Femurs were cut at one end and BM was extracted by centrifugation (8000 RPM, 30 s). Single cell suspensions were obtained as described for spleens.To evaluate GC responses mice were vaccinated in the right hind limb footpad with 0.5 µg VLP (30 µl total in PBS). Draining popliteal LN were collected at indicated time points and digested with collagenase D (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and DNaseI (10 µg/ml; Sigma) (40 min, 37 °C, shaking at 220 RPM) prior to mechanical dissociation as described for spleens.Antibody titer measurementTotal HA-specific IgG was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). U-bottom, high-binding 96-well plates (Greiner) were coated overnight (4 °C) with 2 µg/ml recombinant HA (Immune Technologies) or HAWT-VLP (Medicago Inc.) diluted in 100 mM bicarbonate/carbonate buffer at pH 9.6 (50 µl/well). For the standard curve, wells were coated with two-fold dilutions of purified mouse IgG (Sigma) starting at 2000 ng/ml. Wells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20 (Fisher Scientific) (150 µl/well). Heat-inactivated sera diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer were added to plates in duplicate (50 µl/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. HA-specific IgG was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cat. No. 1036-95; Southern Biotech) diluted 1:20,000 in blocking buffer (75 µl/well, 30 min, 37 °C) followed by incubation with 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethyl benzidine substrate (Millipore) for 15 min (RT). Development was stopped after 15 min using 0.5 M H2SO4 (50 µl/well) and the optical density was measured at 450 nm (EL800 microplate reader; BioTek Instruments Inc.). To evaluate the avidity of HA-specific IgG, wells containing bound antibody were incubated with urea (0M–8M) for 15 min and re-blocked for 1 h prior to detection. Avidity index (AI) = [IgG titer 2–8 M urea/IgG titer 0 M urea].To measure antibodies that mediate HI sera were diluted 1:4 in receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE; Denka Seiken) and incubated 18–20 h at 37 °C. Sera were inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C then further diluted to 1:10 with PBS. Two-fold serial dilutions of RDE-inactivated sera were added to a V-well microtiter plate (25 µl/well) and incubated for 30 min with 4 HA units of virus (25 µl/well) at RT. 50 µl of 0.5% turkey RBCs was added to each well and incubated 30 min at RT. Wells were examined visually for RBC teardrop formation upon plate tilting, indicating inhibition of hemagglutination25. Titers are reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution to inhibit hemagglutination. Titers below the limit of detection (<10) were assigned a value of 5 for statistical analysis.To measure antibodies that mediate MN MDCK cells (ATCC CCL-34) were seeded into flat-bottom 96-well plates (50,000/well) in HyClone SFM4MegaVir medium (Cytiva) supplemented with 10 µg/ml gentamicin (Gibco Life Technologies), 100,000 U/ml penicillin G (Gibco Life Technologies) and 20 µg/ml glutamine (Wisent). Two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated sera (56 °C, 30 min) were incubated with 100 TCID50 of virus for 2 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) and then added to the MDCK monolayers with 1x TPCK (tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone)-treated trypsin. Plates were incubated for 3 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) and then medium was removed from each well and replaced with fresh MegaVir with 1x TPCK-treated trypsin. Cells were observed for cytopathic effects (CPE) for 3–5 days and the MN titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution to prevent CPE. Titers below the limit of detection (<10) were assigned a value of 5 for statistical analysis.ELISpotHA-specific IgG antibody secreting cells (ASC) were quantified by ELISpot (Mouse IgG ELISpotBASIC, Mabtech). Sterile PVDF membrane plates (Millipore) were coated with Anti-IgG capture antibody and blocked according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To quantify in vivo activated ASCs, wells were seeded with 250,000 (BM) or 500,000 (splenocyte) freshly isolated cells and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. HA-specific ASCs were detected according to the manufacturer’s guidelines using 1 µg/ml biotinylated HA (immune tech, biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin). To evaluate memory ASCs, freshly isolated cells were polyclonally activated with 0.5 µg/ml R848 and 2.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-2 (1.5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates) for 72 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). Activated cells were re-counted and the assay was carried out as described above.Flow cytometryTo identify total GC B cells and TFH cells, freshly isolated cells from the popliteal LN (1 × 106 cells/200 µl) were washed 1x with PBS in a 96-well round-bottom plate (350 × g, 7 min, 4 °C) and labeled with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience) (20 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed 3x followed by incubation with Fc Block (1 µl/sample; BD Biosciences Cat. No. 553142) for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were incubated for an additional 30 min upon addition of the surface cocktail containing the following anti-mouse antibodies: anti-CD3 Alexa Fluor 700 (1 µl/sample; Biolegend Cat. No. 100216), anti-CD4 V500 (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 560782), anti-CD19 PE-CF594 (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 562291), anti-Fas PE (2.5 µl/sample; Thermo Fisher Cat.

No. 135230), anti-CXCR5 biotin (2 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 551960). Cells were washed 2x followed by incubation with streptavidin BV421 (BD Biosciences) for 40 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3x and fixed for 30 min (Fix/Perm solution, BD Biosciences) prior to acquisition. To quantify H1-specific GC B cells, cell suspensions were incubated with 1 µg/ml H1Y98F-VLP for 1 h prior to surface staining and VLP-bound cells were detected using anti-H1 FITC (1 µl/sample; Immune Technologies Cat. No. IT-003-001M5-FITC) using the above panel omitting anti-CXCR5 and anti-PD-1. For the full gating strategy, see Supplementary Fig. 5.To identify antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, freshly isolated splenocyte or BM immune cell suspensions (1 × 106/200 µl in a 96-well U-bottom plate) were stimulated with 10% cRPMI (negative control), 2–2.5 µg/ml homologous HAWT-VLP (18 h), or a pool of overlapping peptides (15aa) spanning the HA sequence (6 h, BEI resources) (37 °C, 5% CO2). Golgi Stop and Golgi Plug (BD Biosciences) were added 5 h before the end of the stimulation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed 2x with PBS (320 × g, 8 min, 4 °C) and labeled with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience) (20 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed 3x followed by incubation with Fc Block (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were incubated for an additional 30 min upon addition of the surface cocktail containing the following antibodies: anti-CD3 FITC (1 µl/sample; Thermo Fisher Cat. No. 11-0031-86), anti-CD4 V500 (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 560782) anti-CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5 (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 551162), anti-CD44 BUV395 (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 740215) and anti-CD62L BUV373 (0.5 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 612-833). Cells were washed 3x and fixed (Fix/Perm solution, BD Biosciences) overnight. For detection of intracellular cytokines, fixed cells were washed 3x in perm/wash buffer (BD Biosciences) followed by intracellular staining with the following antibodies (30 min, 4 °C): anti-IL-2 APC (1 µl/sample; Biolegend Cat. No. 503810), anti-IFNγ PE (1 µl/sample; BD Cat. No. 562020) and anti-TNFα eFluor450 (1 µl/sample; Invitrogen Cat. No. 48-7321-82). Cells were washed 3x in perm/wash buffer and then resuspended in PBS for acquisition. For the full gating strategy, see Supplementary Fig. 8.All flow cytometry was conducted using a BD LSRFortessa or BD LSRFortessa X20 cell analyzer. Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland).ChallengeMice were challenged with 1.6 × 103 times the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of H1N1 A/California/07/09 (National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada) diluted in HyClone SFM4MegaVir (Cytiva) supplemented with 10 µg/ml gentamicin (Gibco Life Technologies), 100,000 U/ml penicillin G (Sigma) and 20 µg/ml glutamine (Wisent). Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and infected by intranasal instillation (25 µlare). Mice were monitored for weight loss for 12 days post-infection and were euthanized if they lost ≥20% of their pre-infection weight (humane end-point). A subset of mice in each group was sacrificed 3–5 days post-infection (dpi) and lungs were harvested for evaluation of viral load and inflammation.Preparation of lung homogenatesLungs were individually homogenized in an equal amount (wt/wt) of complete MegaVir (see above) using micro-tube homogenizer for 3 min. Solid tissue was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and supernatants were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.Lung viral loadInfectious virus titers in the supernatant of lung homogenates were determined by TCID50. MDCK monolayers were prepared in 96-well plates as described above. Lung homogenates were serially diluted (1:10) in complete MegaVir media (see above) supplemented with 2 mg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) and applied to MDCK monolayers for 1 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). Diluted homogenates were then removed from the wells and replaced with fresh MegaVir-trypsin. Cells were incubated for 4 days (37 °C, 5% CO2) and then evaluated for CPE. The TCID50 was calculated using the Karber method71.Multiplex ELISAPulmonary cytokines in lung homogenates obtained from infected and non-infected mice were measured using the Q-PlexTM mouse cytokine screen (16-plex, Quansys Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.HistologyWhole lungs were inflated with 10% formalin (Fisher Scientific) and then fixed for ≥24 h in 10% formalin. Fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin (Leica), cut into 4 µm sections, and applied to glass slides. Slides were washed with xylene (Chaptec) and then immersed in ethanol for 10 min. Slides were rinsed with distilled water and then briefly submerged in 50% Harris hematoxylin (HHS-32; Sigma) diluted in distilled water. Slides were rinsed under running tap water, washed 10x with ethanol, and then stained with eosin-phloxin B [100 ml 1% eosin Y (Sigma), 10 ml phloxin B (Sigma), 780 ml ethanol, 4 ml glacial acetic acid (Fisher Scientific)]. Slides were immersed in ethanol for 10 min, dried, and then submerged in xylene for 10 min. Slides were fixed with two drops of acrytol (Leica) with a coverslip. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described32. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Primo Star light microscope equipped with an AxioCam ERc5s (Zeiss) camera.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

After Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe cases may develop into acute lung injury. Immune factors act as an important role during infection and inflammation. However, the molecular immune mechanisms still remain unclear. We aimed to explore immune-related host factors and core biomarker for severe infection, to provide a new therapeutic target of host factor in patients. Methods: Gene expression profiles were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus and the Seurat R package was used for data process of single-cell transcriptome. Differentially expressed gene analysis and cell cluster were used to explore core host genes and source cells of genes. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis to explore potential biological functions of genes. Gene set variation analysis was used to evaluate the important gene set variation score for different samples. We conduct Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test plasma concentrations of Lipocalin 2 (LCN2). Results: Multiple virus-related, cytokine-related, and chemokine-related pathways involved in process of IAV infection and inflammatory response mainly derive from macrophages and neutrophils. LCN2 mainly in neutrophils was significantly upregulated after either IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infection and positively correlated with disease severity. The plasma LCN2 of influenza patients were elevated significantly compared with healthy controls by ELISA and positively correlated with disease severity of influenza patients. Further bioinformatics analysis revealed that LCN2 involved in functions of neutrophils, including neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation involved in immune response, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Conclusion: The neutrophil-related LCN2 could be a promising biomarker for predicting severity of patients with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and may as a new treatment target in severe patients. Introduction Respiratory virus infection represented by influenza and COVID-19 poses a serious threat to global health. Several influenza pandemics happened since the last century, including Spanish influenza in 1918, Asian influenza in 1957, Hong Kong influenza in 1968, and swine influenza in 2009, which have caused serious damage to the global economy and human health (Ziegler et al., 2018). SARS-Cov-2 (Li et al., 2021), a new coronavirus, first reported in 2020 by China, has been spreading around the world for nearly 2 years. By December 31, 2021, a total of 281,808,270 confirmed cases and 5,411,759 deaths have been reported globally by WHO. As the virus evolves, new strains emerge gradually, such as alpha, beta, delta, and omicron, which make the existing vaccine less effective (Callaway, 2021). Options for the treatment of both influenza and COVID-19 are currently limited. Moreover, the effect of antiviral therapy is affected by the timing of administration and emergence of drug-resistant strains (Lampejo, 2020). Common respiratory viruses including Influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-Cov-2 belong to RNA virus, and they have limited protein-coding capacity and rely on host factors for replication to complete the life cycle. Meanwhile, expression of host factors is altered by virus stimulation during the process of virus infection. Interaction between hosts and the virus determines prognosis of the disease (Ito et al., 2011; Mahler et al., 2021). Although an effective immune response is indispensible for eliminating virus, exaggerated response characterized by the so-called “cytokine storm” can trigger severe immune pathological damage (Karki et al., 2021; Rappe et al., 2021). Changes in the expression levels of host factors and abnormal immunity, such as cytokine storm (Liu et al., 2016; Guo and Thomas, 2017), lymphopenia (Cheng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020b), and T cell exhaustion (Valero-Pacheco et al., 2013; Diao et al., 2020), during virus infection have been reported. Because of the conserved feature, host factors targeting therapy offers a new approach for the treatment of respiratory viral infection, and it is expected to limit viral replication, alleviate immune-mediated damage, and decrease mortality in severe infection hosts. In recent decades, series host factors have been found to have potential therapeutic value. However, the accurate key molecules and origin cells of host factors remain unclear. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently emerged as a powerful method to identify cell types and analyze functional status at single-cell level (Dal Molin and Di Camillo, 2019). scRNA-seq is widely used in various fields including cancer (Suvà and Tirosh, 2019), developmental biology (Griffiths et al., 2018), and microbiology (Imdahl and Saliba, 2020) and has become a promising research tool in the fields of life sciences. scRNA-seq results of COVID-19 find that changes of host factors including EN-RAGE, TNFSF14, oncostatin M, ANXA1, FPR1, and S100A8/9 are correlated with disease severity, revealing the possible pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and potential host therapeutic targets (Arunachalam et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2021). To systematically identify the role of host factors in respiratory virus infection, we analyzed the public transcriptomics data of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection to further understand changes in host functions and identify important host factors in mice and human. We found that Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) increased in influenza and COVID-19 and positively correlated with disease severity of infected patients, which was associated with neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil associated inflammation, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation by bioinformatics functional analysis. The plasma LCN2 of clinical influenza patients was elevated significantly compared with healthy controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and positively correlated with disease severity of influenza patients. Therefore, neutrophil-related LCN2 might be an early biomarker for predicting severity of disease and provide a new method for therapy targeting of host factor in patients with severe IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods Dataset Acquisition The scRNA-seq data, microarray data, and RNA-seq data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)1 were included in this study for analysis. The selection criteria of mice datasets were as follows: (1) inclusion lung tissue or whole-blood samples from IAV infection and control mice within 3 days post infection (dpi), datasets involved with other factors (drug intervention and gene knockout) were excluded; (2) every group of dataset contained at least three reduplicate samples; and (3) with the mature of sequencing technology, datasets were selected in 2019–2021. On the basis of these criteria, GSE80011 and GSE124404 were obtained. However, GSE107947 was the only scRNA-seq data of influenza mice in GEO. Given that administration of aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 to K18-hACE2 mice could simulate the real situation well (Fumagalli et al., 2022), GSE184657 was the only dataset included in subsequent analysis of SARS-CoV-2. The scRNA-seq data (GSE107947) of four lung samples of mice were composed of one control sample, two influenza samples (A/PR/8) at 48 hours post infection (hpi), and one influenza sample at 72 hpi, containing 3,840 CD45-negative (CD45-) cells and 3,840 CD45-positive (CD45 +) cells. The microarray dataset (GSE80011) contained three influenza (A/WSN/33) and three control lung samples of mice at 24 hpi. The RNA-seq profiles (GSE124404) of six blood samples included three control mice and three mice with influenza (A/PR/8) at 48 hpi. The RNA-seq profiles (GSE184657) contained four mice with SARS-Cov-2 infection and two control mice at 6 dpi. The datasets of patients met the following criteria: (1) lung tissue or whole-blood samples from IAV and SARS-Cov-2 infection; (2) datasets contained at least 30 samples; and (3) patients contained various severity classifications. The clinical whole-blood samples of patients with influenza and COVID-19 were composed of GSE111368 and GSE157103. The severity of patients with influenza was divided into mild, moderate, and severe on the basis of whether supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation was required. We acquired 130 healthy control samples, the earliest acute stage samples of 94 patients with pH1N1 infection and 44 paired convalescent samples for analysis from GSE111368. The COVID-19 dataset (GSE157103) contained 100 patients, which were recorded clinical information, such as need for admission into the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation support, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score. Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Processing The Seurat R package 4.0.0 was used for data filtering, statistical analysis, and exploration of the scRNA-seq data. We used the same rigorous method to process data of CD45- cells and CD45 + cells separately. First, we discarded low-quality cells on the basis of the quality control standards that every cell expressed > 200 genes and genes expressed in > 3 cells. Then, the gene expression of remaining cells was normalized, and 2,000 highly variable genes from each sample were identified by the vst method. All genes were scaled, and the principal component analysis was conducted. The cells were clustered by unsupervised clustering (resolution = 0.5) and visualized by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) using the top 10 principal components. Last, we annotated cell types through known marker gene in each cluster of CD45- cells and CD45 + cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found using the FindMarkers in Seurat R package. Differentially Expressed Genes, Functional Enrichment Analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Gene Set Variation Analysis To estimate the difference among different groups, DEGs were identified using the limma package in R software (version 4.0.4) and selected with the commonly used thresholds of fold change (FC) > 2 and adj. p value < 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using clusterprofiler package in R software and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) between patients with high LCN2 and low LCN2 with the R package clusterprofiler. To investigate intensity of response to virus and inflammatory response pathways in different cell types, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) with GSVA R package. Patients and Clinical Information The clinical study of patients with IAV infection included 25 healthy controls and 43 influenza patients from the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine of China-Japan Friendship Hospital during influenza season of 2017–2021. The study was approved by China-Japan Friendship Hospital Ethics Committee (approval no. 2018-120-K86). The patients must meet the following criteria: (i) reverse transcription PCR testing of an appropriate respiratory tract sample was positive; (ii) the time from onset of influenza-like symptoms was ≤14 days; (iii) acute blood samples within 48 h after hospitalization were able to obtain; and (iv) age was > 18 years old. In accordance with the upper classification criteria of severity, severe influenza was defined with respiratory failure that needed invasive mechanical ventilation. Moderate influenza was defined with damage of respiratory function that required supplemental oxygen therapy, including nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and/or non-invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Mild influenza was defined without supplemental oxygen. Forty-three influenza patients contained eight mild patients, 19 moderate patients, and 16 severe patients. Important clinical information including age, sex, and incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were obtained from medical records. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Lipocalin 2 expression levels of plasma were measured using the human LCN2 enzyme immunoassay kit (Elabscience, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analysis The Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test (t-test or wilcox test in R 4.0.4) was used to compare two group differences, as appropriate. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001 represent significant statistical differences. Results Inflammatory Response Mainly Derives From Macrophages and Neutrophils After IAV Infection According to quality control standards, 1,228 cells were excluded, and 6,452 cells were included in the scRNA-seq data GSE107947. These cells consisted of 3,211 CD45- cells and 3,241 CD45 + cells using flow cytometry sorting technology. To examine the host immune response characteristics in a cell type–specific manner, 3,211 CD45- cells and 3,241 CD45 + cells were subjected to tSNE on the basis of highly variable genes using the Seurat package. These cells were successfully classified into 10 different clusters unbiased separately (Supplementary Figure 1). These clusters of CD45- cells were assigned to three different cell types (Figure 1A), and these clusters of CD45 + cells were annotated to six different cell types (Figure 1B) on the basis of well-known marker genes (Supplementary Figure 2). The CD45- cells included endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and epithelial cells. CD45 + cells contained T cells, B cells, mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DC). To illustrate immunological changes after influenza infection, we analyzed the dynamic change of relative proportions of immune cells in the lung tissue of mice (Figure 1C). After influenza infection, the percentage of MPS, neutrophils, and DC significantly increased, whereas that of B cells significantly decreased. In addition, the percentage of NK cells and T cells at 72 hpi decreased slightly compared with that at 48 hpi. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Immune landscape associated with IAV infection.

GSVA scores of response to virus (G) and inflammatory response (H) in different cell types. Neutrophils and macrophages were important immune cells that were involved in the important human host mechanism against microorganisms. In this study, neutrophils significantly increased at 48 hpi, and macrophages rose noticeably at 72 hpi. Interferon-stimulated genes (Ifit1, Rsad2, and Isg15), and chemokine (Cxcl10, Ccl2, and Ccl4) were significantly upregulated in neutrophils and macrophages (Figure 1D). GO enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were related to antiviral immune-related biological processes and cytokine/chemokine related molecular function in neutrophils (Figure 1E). The function analysis of macrophages was also related to leukocyte migration, antiviral immune, and cytokine/chemokine activity (Figure 1F). It is well known that a large number of cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) are produced in the process of inflammatory response and cytokine storm was correlated with disease severity and worse prognosis (Tisoncik et al., 2012). However, what kind of cells is mainly involved in the inflammatory response remains unclear. We evaluated GSVA score of response to virus and inflammatory response among all cell types. The results revealed that MPS and neutrophils showed a higher expression level in both response to virus and inflammatory response pathways (Figures 1G,H). It suggests that these cells may mediate hyper-inflammatory features and are an important source of cytokine storm after influenza infection. Expression of Lipocalin 2 in Neutrophils Was Upregulated After IAV Infection in Mice To screen key genes in influenza, difference analysis was performed between control mice and IAV infection mice at 48 and 72 hpi. Top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes at 48 and 72 hpi were selected to take the intersection, and six overlapping upregulated genes were filtered, including Rsad2, Cxcl10, Saa3, Irf7, Il1rn, and LCN2 (Figure 2A). Rsad2, Cxcl10 (Yang et al., 2020), Saa3 (Ather et al., 2018), Irf7 (Hatesuer et al., 2017), and Il1rn (Schmitz et al., 2005), which have been reported in influenza, whereas the role of LCN2 in influenza was still unknown. We explored the distribution of LCN2 among all cell types using tSNE and found LCN2 mainly expressed in neutrophils (Figure 2B) and partially expressed in CD45- cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Moreover, expression of LCN2 in neutrophils was upregulated after influenza infection (Figure 2C), and it was also upregulated in little other myeloid cells (Supplementary Figure 4). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Identification and validation of key genes in IAV infection in public dataset.

(C) LCN2 expression level of neutrophils in different groups. (D,E) Validation of LCN2 in IAV infection. To verify this finding, the expression levels of LCN2 in mice infected with influenza virus were assessed with another two datasets (GSE80011 and GSE124404). The microarray dataset GSE80011 contained three influenza and three control lung tissues of mice at 24 hpi. As shown in Figure 2D, the expression levels of LCN2 was significantly higher in the lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus, compared with that of the controls (Log2FC = 3.06, adj. p value = 0.0005). Meanwhile, the expression level of LCN2 in peripheral blood samples of mice infected with influenza virus was also upregulated (Log2FC = 2.75, adj. p value = 0.0003) (Figure 2E). Lipocalin 2 Expression Level in Peripheral Blood Positively Correlated With Disease Severity of Influenza Patients We further investigated expression characteristics of LCN2 in patients. Ninety-four acute stage samples and 44 paired convalescent samples in GSE111368 dataset were involved in the analysis. The acute stage samples collected from 39 mild patients, 28 moderate patients, and 27 severe patients according to whether need supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation. Compared with healthy controls, influenza-infected patients showed significantly higher level of LCN2 in peripheral blood leukocytes (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the expression level of LCN2 positively correlated with disease severity (Figure 3B). Paired samples revealed that the expression level of LCN2 declined at convalescent stage (Figure 3C). Expression of LCN2 was not influenced by age (Figure 3D) and gender (Figure 3E). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Correlation between LCN2 and clinical features of IAV infection in public dataset. (A) Expression level of LCN2 in healthy controls and patients with IAV infection (GSE111368). (B) Expression level of LCN2 in patients with mild, moderate, and severe influenza. (C) Expression level of LCN2 in acute and convalescent patients with IAV infection. (D) Association of patients’ age with expression level of LCN2. (E) Expression level of LCN2 in female and male patients with IAV infection. To further clarify the expression level of LCN2 and its correlation with disease severity, we enrolled 43 patients with influenza infection, including eight mild patients, 19 moderate patients, and 16 severe patients. The protein level of LCN2 in plasma samples in acute phase was detected using ELISA. We found that the concentration levels of LCN2 in influenza patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (Figure 4A). Consistent with the above analysis, patients with severe illness had significantly higher LCN2 levels than those with mild or mild-moderate disease (Figures 4B,C). Patients with ARDS exhibited higher levels of LCN2 than those without (Figure 4D). Collectively, these findings suggested that plasma levels of LCN2 were positively correlated with severity of IAV infection and may be a clinically relevant biomarker for predicting severity of patients with IAV infection. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. The association between LCN2 and disease severity in clinical patients with IAV infection. (A) Serum LCN2 levels in healthy controls and patients with IAV infection. (B,C) Serum LCN2 levels in patients with mild, moderate, and severe influenza. (D) Serum LCN2 levels in ARDS and non-ARDS patients with IAV infection. Lipocalin 2 Was Involved in Functions of Neutrophils in Influenza Patients Because LCN2 was upregulated after influenza infection and correlated with disease severity, we further explored the possible function of LCN2. The influenza patients were equally divided into high-LCN2 group and low-LCN2 group on the basis of the median expression level of LCN2 in GSE111368. A total of 91 DEGs from the influenza patients with high LCN2 were identified by comparing with low LCN2. This total included 62 upregulated genes and 29 downregulated genes, which were indicated in the volcano plot shown in Figure 5A. The top 50 upregulated genes of DEGs were represented as a heatmap (Figure 5B). GO and KEEG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs in LCN2-high samples identified an enrichment of genes in pathways related to neutrophils inflammation (neutrophil degranulation and neutrophil activation involved in immune response and antimicrobial humoral response) and NET formation (Figure 5C). Using GSEA analysis, we also found that LCN2 was associated with NET formation in influenza (Figure 5D). FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Functional analysis of LCN2 in patients with IAV.

Similar Expression Pattern of Lipocalin 2 Was Found in Patients With COVID-19 and Mice COVID-19 has some similarities in the course of disease development as influenza. The dataset GSE184657 showed the expression level of LCN2 in the lung tissues of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher (Log2FC = 2.93, p = 0.0414) than that of the control at 6dpi (Supplementary Figure 5). Compared with patients in general wards, patients with COVID-19 at ICU showed higher level of LCN2 (Figure 6A). Similarly, the expression level of LCN2 was higher in patients who needed mechanical ventilation than those without (Figure 6B). APACHE II and SOFA scores, used to stratify the severity of illness, showed a positive correlation with the expression level of LCN2 in in leukocytes from whole blood (Figures 6C,D). Similarly, we found that LCN2 was involved in functions of neutrophils in patients with COVID-19, including neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation involved in immune response, and NET formation (Figures 6E–G).

Discussion Increasing evidence indicates that excessive immune response leads to immune-mediated damage and affects disease process and prognosis (Guo et al., 2021; Karki et al., 2021; Rappe et al., 2021). This emphasizes the importance of host factors in predicting clinical progression and prognosis in patients with viral infectious diseases. In this study, we found that a neutrophil-associated host factor LCN2 was significantly elevated and associated with severity in both influenza and patients with COVID-19 by integrated public data analysis. The increase of serum LCN2 level in clinical influenza patients was verified by ELISA and positively correlated with disease severity of influenza patients. Further bioinformatics functional analysis showed LCN2 might influence disease development by affecting neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil activation, and NET formation. In acute respiratory virus–infected patients, hyper-inflammatory responses involving the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF) impair the function of lung and lead to severe complications (Andreakos et al., 2021). However, it is unclear which types of cells are responsible for the release of large number of cytokines in critical patients. Previous research has shown that inflammation-related factors (IL-1, TNF, CXCL1, CXCL2, S100A8, and S100A9) predominantly express in neutrophils, and neutrophils infiltration largely account for lethal influenza infection (Brandes et al., 2013). In this study, we found that immune response pattern transformed from early antiviral response into inflammatory response gradually with the elimination of influenza virus in the lung tissue. In addition, the inflammatory response was mainly mediated by neutrophils and mononuclear macrophages. These results are consistent with previous report (Zhang et al., 2020a) and suggest that neutrophils may play an important role in the development of severe disease in patients infected with IAV. Lipocalin 2, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or 24p3, is a secretory glycoprotein involved in various inflammatory processes (Kjeldsen et al., 2000), which is found in various cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells, and adipocytes. Given that LCN2 is readily detected in plasma, urine, central nervous system, and various body fluids, it has been found to be associated with a variety of diseases (Moschen et al., 2017). In patients with adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), neutrophil-derived LCN2 is higher than healthy control in plasma and liver tissue, and it could serve as a potent biomarker for identifying liver damage caused by hyper-inflammatory state of AOSD (Jia et al., 2021). LCN2 is also upregulated in serum and liver tissue of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), and serum LCN2 levels could be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may be participate in the transition from NAFL to NASH by mediating inflammation. Besides, LCN2 has been demonstrated as a biomarker for inflammatory bowel disease (Thorsvik et al., 2017), vascular dementia (Llorens et al., 2020), neuropsychiatric lupus (Mike et al., 2019), and subarachnoid hemorrhage outcome (Yu et al., 2021). The level of LCN2 could predict disease severity and survival in acute kidney injury (Bennett et al., 2008; Kümpers et al., 2010). Research studies have revealed that LCN2 is also involved in infectious diseases. LCN2 attenuates bacterial growth by binding and sequestering the iron-scavenging siderophores to prevent bacterial iron acquisition (Goetz et al., 2002). LCN2 from both neutrophils and local epithelium can combat Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in mice (Cramer et al., 2017). Genetic deletion of LCN2 gene in neutrophils reduces the bactericidal effect of NETs (Li et al., 2018). However, Warszawska et al. (2013) report that LCN2 deactivates macrophages through an IL-10/STAT3-dependent mechanism and worsens pneumococcal pneumonia outcomes, which may be due to differences cell subset and bacterial strain. Besides, LCN2 can be as a biomarker of systemic inflammation in infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (Sawatzky et al., 2019) and as a biomarker of inflammation, monocyte activation, and cardiac stretch during activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in human immunodeficiency virus (Bogorodskaya et al., 2019). In this study, we found that neutrophil is one of the main drivers of inflammatory response after virus infection. As an important functional gene of neutrophil, LCN2 was upregulated in both plasma and lung tissue after IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma LCN2 level was positively associated with disease severity. Therefore, neutrophil-related LCN2 might serve as a potential biomarker for predicting disease severity in both patients with influenza and COVID-19. Meanwhile, we also found that the difference between mild and severe clinical patients had not multiplied obviously compared with the difference in mice. This difference may be caused by time point of clinical infection patients, and patients come to the hospital only when the apparent symptoms appear, as neutrophils are generated enriched at early infection and LCN2 is mainly expressed in neutrophils. Lipocalin 2 is involved in various biological processes, including immune inflammatory response and iron homeostasis (Xiao et al., 2017). LCN2 acts as a scavenger of bacterial siderophores and has antibacterial activity against siderophores dependent bacteria (Saiga et al., 2008). In addition, LCN2 can also interact with LCN2 receptor 24p3R of neutrophils to activate ERK pathway and regulate neutrophil migration and adhesion (Schroll et al., 2012). In the study, functional analysis demonstrated that LCN2 was associated with NET formation, which may reveal that LCN2 influences the development of disease through NETs. NETs, composed of a scaffold of DNA with histones and cytotoxic neutrophil-derived proteins, are released by neutrophils to contain invading microbes during infection and inflammation (Brinkmann et al., 2004). NETs were originally thought to eliminate bacteria but, now, are proved to protect against many viral pathogens, including influenza virus, RSV, and dengue virus (Schönrich and Raftery, 2016). NETs capture viral particles through the NETs structure and eliminate the virus through high concentration MPO and defensin or prevent the spread of the virus (Brinkmann and Zychlinsky, 2007). Therefore, the appropriate level of LCN2 possesses a protective role in mild virus infection (Watzenboeck et al., 2021). Nevertheless, NETs not only can eliminate invading pathogens but can also harm the host as well. The high level of NETs is able to kill epithelial and endothelial cells (Saffarzadeh et al., 2012). The level of NETs is higher in severe than that in mild influenza patients and is significantly associated with APACHE II score, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and patient survival rate of clinical influenza patients (Zhu et al., 2018). The high level of NETs is also closely associated with thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 (Middleton et al., 2020). At present, the role and exact molecular mechanism of LCN2 are still unclear and need to be further explored in severe viral infection. There are limitations in this study. In the validation of clinical samples, we only detected the expression level of LCN2 in the plasma of patients, whereas the expression level of LCN2 in the alveolar lavage fluid of patients is unclear. In recent years, because there are fewer patients with influenza and COVID-19 in China, the sample size is small. In future studies, we will try to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients as much as possible and increase the sample size of the study to improve the stability of the results. Conclusion In conclusion, we identify that a host factor LCN2 associated with neutrophils through comprehensive analysis of public database and data from clinical influenza patient samples could be used as potential biomarkers of predicting severity of patients with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a new direction for targeted treatment of host factor in respiratory virus infection. However, the specific mechanism of LCN2 is still unclear, which needs to be further verified by molecular biology experiments.

REUTERS/Tingshu WangWhy was the emergence of the coronavirus at the end of 2019 months or more than a year of absence of other respiratory viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus?Virologist scientists are still comparing the figures of the decline in infections of other diseases while the coronavirus predominated and are looking for answers to understand the behavior of viruses, especially that of SARS-CoV-2.An intriguing theory may help explain why influenza and COVID-19 viruses never predominated simultaneously: the so-called Twindemia in English (Twin is twin and demia comes from illness). Several specialists argue that it was not only masks, social distancing or other pandemic restrictions that caused the flu and other respiratory viruses to disappear while the coronavirus reigned and to re-emerge as it receded.According to several experts, exposure to a respiratory virus can put the body's immune defenses on high alert, preventing other intruders from accessing the airways. This biological phenomenon, called viral interference, can limit the number of respiratory viruses circulating in a region at any given time.“My intuition, and my feeling based on our recent research, is that viral interference is real. I don't think we're going to see the peak of flu and coronavirus at the same time,” explained Dr. Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale Medical School.On an individual level, he said, there may be some people who end up infected with two or even three viruses at the same time. But at the population level, according to this theory, one virus tends to outperform others.Still, he warned, “the health care system may become overloaded long before the upper limit of circulation is reached, as the Ómicron wave has shown.” Viral interference can help explain the patterns of infection seen in large populations, including those that may arise as coronavirus becomes endemic. But research is in its infancy and scientists are still struggling to understand how it works.“During the first two years of the pandemic, large-scale COVID-19 prevention measures such as wearing a mask, lockdowns, distancing, ventilation, among others, helped reduce the transmission of the influenza virus and other respiratory viruses around the world. But since the end of last year, after the advance of vaccination against COVID-19, there was more intense citizen mobility and there was a return in the circulation of the influenza virus,” Leda Guzzi, of the Communication Commission of the Argentine Society of Infectology, explained to Infobae.According to the infectiologist Pablo Bonvehí, head of Infectology at CEMIC, “the increase in influenza cases is probably explained by multiple factors. In other South American countries, such as Chile, Peru, Colombia and Brazil, cases mainly with the subtype Influenza A H3N2″ also rose. The expert, a member of the Vaccine Commission of the Argentine Society of Infectious Diseases and the Scientific Committee of the Vaccinate Foundation, added: “This circulation of the influenza virus was not normal so early. Nor was it normal that the virus did not circulate in 2020 and 2021 when the coronavirus circulation predominated. Now the subtype Influenza A H3N2 began to circulate, which was predominant in the Northern Hemisphere. Surely this change is related to the fact that there are no more restrictions on travel abroad. Having not been in contact with the flu virus for the past two years, people are more susceptible to acquiring the infection. There are also more cases of bronchiolitis and those affected by other respiratory viruses.”Since 2020, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there were fewer cases of seasonal flu than in previous years. “Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Argentina, influenza virus activity has remained low,” the official alert said. However, from the first week of last December until now, an increase in the number of cases of influenza, mainly Influenza A H3N2, has been detected. During the first six weeks of this year (that is, January and the first half of February), 166 cases of influenza were recorded in the National Health Surveillance System of the National Health Portfolio. Within this total, virus subtypes were analyzed in 100 cases and it was identified that 99% corresponded to the subtype Influenza A H3N2 and 1% to the subtype “Influenza A H1N1″ (which was the predominant one in the 2009 pandemic).There are at least 100 viruses that can cause the common cold, but only four that cause seasonal flu. Many people who get a cold assume they have the flu, but experts always say the same thing about how to tell the difference: “Flu makes you feel like a truck hit you.” The fever, discomfort, and headaches of a severe case of influenza are generally worse than a case of respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, or any of the common cold viruses.Many experts attributed the flu-free season to masks, social distancing, and restriction of movement, especially for young children and older adults, who are at the highest risk of getting a serious flu. Influenza figures rose a year later, in the 2021-2022 season, when many countries had dispensed with restrictions, but the numbers were still lower than the pre-pandemic average.The notion that there is a kind of interaction between viruses first emerged in the 1960s, when poliomyelitis vaccines, containing weakened polioviruses, significantly reduced the number of respiratory infections. The idea gained ground in 2009: Europe seemed ready for a sudden surge in swine flu cases by the end of that summer, but when schools reopened, rhinovirus colds seemed to somehow disrupt the epidemic of flu.“That led many people at the time to speculate about this idea of viral interference,” Dr. Foxman said. Even in a typical year, rhinovirus peaks in October or November and then again in March, at either end of the flu season. Last year, a team of researchers set out to study the role of an existing immune response in defending against the influenza virus. Because it would be unethical to deliberately infect children with the flu, they gave children in the Gambia a vaccine with a weakened strain of the virus. Virus infection triggers a complex cascade of immune responses, but the first defense comes from a set of non-specific defenders called interferons. Children who already had high levels of interferon ended up with much less influenza virus in their bodies than those with lower levels of interferon, the team found.The findings suggested that previous viral infections prepared children's immune systems to fight the influenza virus. “Most of the viruses we saw in these children before they were given the vaccine were rhinoviruses,” said Dr. Thushan de Silva, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Sheffield in England, who led the study. This dynamic may partly explain why children, who tend to have more respiratory infections than adults, seem less likely to be infected with the coronavirus. The flu can also prevent coronavirus infections in adults, said Dr. Guy Boivin, a virologist and infectious disease specialist at Laval University in Canada.Recent studies have shown that coinfections with influenza and coronavirus are rare, and people with an active influenza infection were nearly 60 percent less likely to test positive for coronavirus, he added. RSV, rhinovirus and influenza have coexisted for years, noted Dr. Nasia Safdar, an expert in health-related infections at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Eventually, that's what will happen to this one too: it will become one of the many that will circulate,” said Dr. Safdar about the coronavirus. Some viruses can attenuate the effects of others, he said, but the patterns may not be obvious.By looking at coronaviruses from the common cold, some researchers have predicted that SARS-CoV-2 will become a seasonal winter infection that could well coincide with the flu. But the pandemic coronavirus has already shown itself differently than its cousins. For example, it is rarely seen in co-infections, while one of the four coronaviruses of the common cold is frequently seen as a co-infection with the other three.KEEP READING:COVID-19 and the flu: how to differentiate the symptoms of each diseaseIt is possible to get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time: how serious is it for our body?

Study: Determining Existing Human Population Immunity as Part of Assessing Influenza Pandemic Risk. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock Background Based on its genetic constitution, the influenza A virus can efficiently transmit influenza to humans. The lack of HAI antibodies against the HA of a new virus could facilitate disease transmission and give rise to a pandemic. Further, the development of novel influenza vaccines requires more than seven months, much slower than the viral transmission. Thus, a novel vaccine would be unable to prevent an influenza pandemic, as was observed during the influenza (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. Such delays in global preparedness warrant risk assessment for anticipating the health threats of future pandemics. Determining the population-level immunity is an essential aspect of risk assessment. About the study In the present study, researchers modeled the impact of the pre-pandemic population-level immunity against the H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) pandemic of 2009 on an exemplary basis to evaluate the pandemic risk of five SIVs in China. The basic reproduction number (R0) was used in case every virus would transmit efficiently in humans, and age-specific HAI titers against the SIVs were determined. The authors had previously evaluated the impact of the HAI titers on the effective reproduction number (Rt) of the H2N2 influenza viruses. The present study is an expansion of their previous work by using the HAI titers to evaluate the population-level immunity to SIVs. The participants were selected from households identified by random dialing of digits. Population data were obtained from the most recent census of Guangzhou (2015) and Hong Kong (2016). A total of 173 sera were obtained from Guangzhou and Hong Kong residents between December 6th, 2013 and March 29th, 2014, as part of a community-level cohort study. In addition, an age-specific panel of 180 anonymous sera was obtained from individuals diagnosed with non-infectious and non-respiratory illnesses who were hospitalized between February 9th and March 31st, 2015. Five H1 and H3 subtypes of SIV were used as antigens for the HAI assays-Triple-reassortant internal gene (TRIG) H1-lineage virus A/swine/Hong Kong/NS301/2013, Eurasian avian (EA) H1 swine virus A/swine/Hong Kong/NS4003/2016, a Binh Duong-like seasonal H3N2 swine virus A/swine/Hong Kong/4348/2016, H1N1pdm09-like swine H1N1 virus A/swine/Hong Kong/1436/2016 and a virus generated by the team viz. EA-lineage A/swine/Guangdong/104/2013 (H1N1) (GD104). HAI titers were determined based on the highest serial dilution of the samples required to prevent complete hemagglutination. In addition, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) were also evaluated. The team constructed a transmission matrix based on the social contact matrices of the United Kingdom (UK) and Hong Kong to assess population immunity. The R0 and Rt required to give rise to a pandemic were determined for the SIVs and HAI data were used as inputs for the transmission matrix. Data on A/California/4/2009 HAI titers were retrieved from two surveys conducted in Hong Kong between November and December 2008 and between July and August 2009 prior to the onset of the first pandemic of 2009 in Hong Kong. In addition, HAI titer data of the H2N2 pandemic strain A/Singapore/1/57(H2N2) were also retrieved from a Hong Kong survey conducted in 2011. Results Among the 353 serum samples obtained, low seroprevalence was observed for the A/swine/HK/NS301/2013, A/swine/HK/NS4003/2016, and A/swine/GD/104/2013 viruses with a slight decrease in R0 by just 20%. Related StoriesWastewater surveillance detects influenza and H5 viruses from human and animal sourcesUS study uncovers antiviral resistance in swine-origin influenza, urging enhanced pandemic surveillanceA call for robust H5N1 influenza preparedness and responseThe smallest R0 required to cause a pandemic was 1.22 to 1.24, indicating that the existing population immunity in the Chinese population would be inadequate to prevent H1N1 and H1N2 transmission. On the contrary, for the human-origin and seasonal H3N2 virus, the existing population immunity could decrease R0 by 47% and therefore decrease the pandemic risks. Among the sera with HAI titers exceeding 40, no substantial differences were noted across ages in the seroprevalence for A/Sw/GD/104/2013 (H1N1), A/Sw/HK/NS4003/2016 (H1N1), A/Sw/HK/1436/2016 (H1N1) and A/Sw/HK/NS301/2013 (H1N2). A significant difference was noted in the seroprevalence of the A/Sw/HK/4348/2016 (H3N2) virus in individuals aged 41 to 50 years. The overall seroprevalence in both the cities was similar, and thus, their data were combined to determine population immunity. Among the sera with HAI titers exceeding 10, low seroprevalence was noted for the H1N1 EA and the H1N2 TRIG viruses. Contrastingly, 41% of the samples had HAI titers exceeding 40 to H1N1pdm09-like virus. The seroprevalence and GMTs were the highest in the participants aged below 30 years. About 67% of the participants had titers exceeding 40 for the seasonal H3N2 virus. In the sensitivity analysis, the social contact matrix of the UK and the transmission matrix of the present study yielded similar results with a statistically significant difference only for the A/swine/HK/1436/2016 (H1N1) strain. Conclusion To summarize, the study findings showed that the A/Sw/HK/NS4003/2016 and A/swine/Shandong/1207/2016 SIV strains were identical (98%) amino acid (aa) similarity. Both these viruses could pose significant pandemic threats. Contrastingly, the pandemic risk of the Binh Duong-lineage H3N2 virus was low.

Smith | Milwaukee Journal SentinelShow Caption Hide Caption Wisconsin Humane Society is caring for a bald eagle that might be sick the avian fluWisconsin Humane Society employees captured a sick bald eagle from a Bay View lawn on Friday, April 8. The eagle might be sick with the avian flu.Sue Liedtke, USA TODAY HandoutInitial tests on the bald eagle that died last week after it was found grounded in Bay View indicate it was suffering from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to the Wisconsin Humane Society.An influenza strain called EA H5N1 is circulating among domestic and wild birds in North America. Wildlife and agriculture officials have described it as the worst avian flu outbreak in nearly a decade.The disease is known to kill raptors such as eagles as well as waterfowl, corvids (blue jays and crows) and many other classes of birds.The eagle in Bay View was thought to be one of a pair that constructed a nest this year in the urban neighborhood on Milwaukee's south side.It was found April 8 unable to fly. Wildlife rehabilitators with the Wisconsin Humane Society collected the bird and provided supportive care at the organization's Milwaukee facility.More: Highly pathogenic avian influenza found in wild birds in several Wisconsin counties, including a bald eagleMore: Avian flu has been found in these three Wisconsin counties. What this means for birds and humans.However the bird was euthanized April 9 after its condition deteriorated significantly.Initial test results on the eagle released Friday by the WHS show it was "presumed positive" for HPAI.A second confirmatory avian influenza test is underway to determine the virus strain; results are expected in the coming days.Influenza strains H5 and EA H5N1 have been documented in 33 states as of Friday, according to the National Wildlife Health Center of the U.S. Geological Survey.At least 23 million birds have died due to the outbreak, mostly through depopulations at poultry farms.Through Thursday the virus had been found in seven poultry flocks in Wisconsin, according to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection."As avian influenza continues to affect poultry in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, we're reminding flock owners that strong biosecurity is our best defense against this devastating disease," said Dr. Darlene Konkle, state veterinarian. "We urge everyone working around poultry to increase their biosecurity measures and continue reporting signs of illness to help us ​prevent spread of the virus."It's much more difficult to determine how many wild birds are affected. But in addition to the Bay View bald eagle, H5N1 has been linked to the deaths of wild birds in Milwaukee County (Canada goose), Columbia County (lesser scaup), Dane County (bald eagle and Cooper's hawk), Grant County (red-tailed hawk) and Polk County (trumpeter swan).The Department of Natural Resources has requested the public to contact the agency with reports of birds that show tremors, circling movements or holding their heads in an unusual position, all symptoms of HPAI.Reports can be made to the DNR Wildlife Hotline by email to DNRWildlifeSwitchboard@wi.gov or by leaving a voicemail message for a return phone call at (608) 267-0866.Eagles made headlines earlier this spring when four nests, including two with egg laying and tending, were documented in Milwaukee County. Until this year, Milwaukee was the only county in the state without a confirmed bald eagle nest.The Bay View pair did not lay eggs but constructed a stick structure in a tree on a private property. The birds became star attractions in the neighborhood.The other eagle in the Bay View pair, presumed by many observers to be a male due to its smaller size than the bird that died, was seen in the vicinity of the nest through Tuesday, said nearby resident Suzanne Jurva."We were keeping track of him," Jurva said. "He looked really good. All we can do is hope he is healthy and avoids this terrible virus."Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

(Georgia DNR) Highly pathogenic avian influenza confirmed in more than 30 states and threatens wild, commercial bird populations Highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed in three bald eagles in Georgia Thursday. This is the first time the virus has been confirmed in the species in the state. The University of Georgia’s Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Diseases Study first detected the disease in the dead eagles found in Chatham, Glynn and Liberty counties in March. Based in UGA’s College of Veterinary Medicine, the cooperative provides wildlife disease expertise to state and federal fish and wildlife agencies, including the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed more than 660 cases in wild birds just this year, including 11 cases in Georgia. Nationwide, tens of millions of domestic birds have also died from the disease or been culled after known exposures to keep the virus from decimating commercial flocks. The virus is considered to be a low risk to humans, and to date there have been no human cases reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following the initial detection, samples were sent to the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa for confirmation, which was received this week. David Stallknecht “We don’t know what the future holds, but worst case scenario: The virus becomes established in our wild bird populations,” said David Stallknecht, director of the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study. “If it is maintained in wild birds, it will continue to threaten wild bird and commercial poultry health. With bird migration it may even spread to Central America and South America.” Frequently referred to as HPAI or high-path, the virus has been detected in more than 50 countries on multiple continents. It’s previously been found in commercial poultry flocks, backyard chickens and wild waterfowl and has the ability to infect other animals as well. This year, the virus is hitting birds of prey hard. But only in certain areas. “Raptors being infected with HPAI is not something that is unique,” Stallknecht said. “But the scale of it is absolutely unique. We have also detected it in numerous raptors in other states, and there is an outbreak going on in Florida right now involving hundreds of black vultures. Mortality due to HPAI has been documented in numerous species of geese, ducks, gulls and pelicans. However, not all infected birds die.” Some ducks, for example, have no apparent illness when infected. That may be the result of some built-in immunity to HPAI from exposure to less pathogenic flu viruses (i.e., “low path”) that commonly occur in waterfowl. Eagles and other raptors that eat ducks aren’t typically exposed to these low-pathogenic viruses, which may leave them more vulnerable to HPAI. This virus is cause for concern, but it’s not cause for panic.” —Bob Sargent, Georgia Department of Natural Resources HPAI is also likely responsible for substantial decreases in nesting success for coastal bald eagles in Georgia this season. “On the coast, the numbers are pretty sobering,” said Bob Sargent, one of the program managers for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Sargent recently completed a survey of bald eagle nests in Georgia. “What we found is the nest success rate for those coastal birds was over 30% lower than it normally is. You can’t say definitively that high-path caused all those nest failures, but clearly it’s played a substantial role in that remarkably substantial drop.” On average, about 70% to 80% of Georgia’s bald eagle nests succeed, meaning at least one eaglet fledges. (Eagles typically lay two eggs.) On one of Sargent’s routes in northeast Georgia last week, he found that number was closer to 90% for birds nesting in that region of Georgia’s interior. Overall, it appears that this year’s success rate for the more than 150 nests not located in the six coastal counties will be at least 70%—a normal year. Over the past few decades, the U.S. bald eagle population has made a remarkable recovery. In the 1960s through the 1970s, the U.S. had fewer than 500 nesting pairs of bald eagles in the Lower 48. Georgia didn’t have a single successful bald eagle nest in the state from 1971 through 1980. Now, the population in the Lower 48 has soared to more than 315,000 birds, and there are more than 200 nesting pairs in Georgia. “This virus is cause for concern, but it’s not cause for panic,” Sargent said. “The eagle population has come a long way since the 1970s. The eagle population is not in crisis.” If you see a sick or dead eagle that doesn’t appear to have been injured, contact the Department of Natural Resources. “We are hoping that this will run its course without doing too much damage here in Georgia,” said Tina Johannsen, assistant chief of game management for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. “This particular disease kills a lot of birds really quickly if they get it. We appreciate the public being our eyes and ears out there, particularly in remote areas. “If you see something that seems unusual, particularly if it’s more than one dead bird in a location, don’t handle it. Call us, and we can give you advice on the best thing to do for it.” College of Veterinary Medicine Columns Research FacebookXPinterestLinkedIn You may also like Health & Wellness High levels of

About Staff Advertisements/Payment Portal More The Saint Anselm Crier Open Search Bar Search this site Submit Search Flu done it?: Influenza on campusCourtesy/MYPBCLIFEInfluenza reaches Saint Anselm Campus Thomas DeRoche, Medical CorrespondentApril 16, 2022The influenza (Flu) virus is spreading on Saint Anselm College’s campus. Cases on campus continue to rise. Why the Flu shot was not as effective this year. The Flu and COVID are very similar in how they are transmitted as well as the symptomology. Because of this, it is impossible to know if someone is infected without a test. Both are spread through droplets containing the virus when a person coughs, talks, or sneezes. Just as a person is a “close contact” for COVID, meaning they were within six feet of an infected person for fifteen or more minutes, the same rule applies to the Flu. Common symptoms of the Flu are fever (temperature greater than 100.4 F), chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle or body aches, headache, and difficulty breathing. This is not an exhaustive list and symptoms can vary between individuals. Some people may be asymptomatic, while others may require hospitalization. For students with Flu-like symptoms, “the most important thing to do is to self-isolate and wear a mask, until 24 hours fever-free” Maura Marshall, Director of Health Services, said in an email. Masks, social distancing, and handwashing are the most effective ways to stop the transmission of the virus. During the first year of the pandemic, Flu activity was “unusually low” despite high levels of testing according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This is in part due to mask-wearing, social distancing, and handwashing, but it is also due to a record number of Influenza vaccines having been administered in 2020. While fewer cases is a good thing, limited data on common variants made it difficult for health experts to make the vaccine. Twice a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) meets to review the data on the Flu to make a recommendation on the composition of the vaccine. According to the CDC, “preliminary estimates indicate that vaccination did not reduce the risk of mild or moderate illness from Flu A viruses, which circulated most commonly during the 2021-22 flu season.” Despite this, it is still important to get the flu vaccine every year to protect yourself as well as others. Students are strongly encouraged to not attend classes and keep a 6-foot distance from their classmates if they have a fever greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit and one or more symptoms, according to the Saint Anselm Influenza Protocol.

Here, we found that human nasal commensal S. epidermidis promoted protease–protease inhibitor balance in favor of the host and prevented influenza A virus (IAV) replication in the nasal mucosa and lungs. A relatively higher induction of Serpine1 exhibited in S. epidermidis-inoculated nasal epithelium and S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 significantly decreased the expression of serine proteases. Furthermore, the transcription of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and Serpine1 was biologically relevant in S. epidermidis-inoculated nasal epithelium, and the induction of uPA might be related to the sequential increase of Serpine1 in human nasal epithelium. Our findings reveal that human nasal commensal S. epidermidis manipulates the cellular environment lacking serine proteases in the nasal epithelium through Serpine1 induction and disturbs IAV spread to the lungs at the level of the nasal mucosa.

The respiratory epithelium produces antiviral and chemotactic molecules that initiate immune responses by rapid recruitment of innate effector cells and have their own unique mechanisms to prime antiviral immune responses in the respiratory tract against influenza viruses3. Additionally, adequate immune interactions in respiratory epithelial cells are critical to disturb the cellular entry of influenza viruses and can prevent the spread of these viruses to the respiratory tract4. To enter into the airway epithelial cells for the initiation of virus infection, influenza viruses require the maturation cleavage of viral surface glycoproteins, and the maturation cleavage depends on host cell proteases for activation of the viral protein5. In this regard, the reduction of airway protease represents an attractive host-cell targeting antiviral strategy in the respiratory tract, and serine protease inhibitors have been reported to suppress influenza virus replication with the inhibition of intracellular invasion by targeting host serine proteases6,7,8.The respiratory mucosa is in direct contact with the respiratory epithelium and constantly exposed to inhaled pathogens, which directly impact the mucosal immune mechanisms of the respiratory epithelium9,10. Importantly, the colonizing microbiome in the human respiratory mucosa is subject to mediate mucosal immune defense mechanisms, and studies on the reaction of the mucosal microbiome to the inhaled pathogens within the host increasingly consider the contribution of immune responses11,12,13,14. Inhaled respiratory viruses encounter the host’s immune system for the first time in the nasal passage, and the microbial characteristics of the nasal mucus are closely related to the mechanisms of initial immune responses15,16. Thus, insights into the microbiota of the human nasal mucosa can provide fundamental information regarding an individual’s susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and factors contributing to related immune mechanisms17,18. Our previous study identified that Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most abundant commensal present in the nasal mucus of healthy humans and showed that the S. epidermidis that were isolated from healthy nasal mucus accelerated the clearance of influenza virus from the nasal epithelium15. In addition, the inoculation of the human nasal commensal S. epidermidis into an in vivo nose limited influenza virus-caused lung infection via interferon-related innate immune responses. Complex host–microbe interactions have made it difficult to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of colonization. However, it has been proven that the serine proteases secreted by a subset of S. epidermidis inhibits biofilm formation and nasal colonization of inhaled nasal pathogens19. In this study, we aimed to elucidate other antiviral mechanisms of S. epidermidis and prelude that S. epidermidis, a major symbiont in healthy nasal mucus, might have the ability to induce specific serine proteases, resulting in the activation of serine protease inhibitors. Here, our data uncover another capacity of S. epidermidis to potentiate antiviral innate immune responses in the nasal epithelium through the induction of the serine protease inhibitor Serpine1, driven by urokinase plasminogen activator. S. epidermidis creates an intracellular environment lacking serine proteases in the nasal epithelium and inhibits viral invasion into nasal epithelial cells. Our results indicate that a beneficial commensal S. epidermidis promotes protease–protease inhibitor balance in favor of the host nasal mucosa and provides a biological antiviral arsenal against influenza virus spread.ResultsNasal microbiota may be critical for the suppression of influenza A virus (IAV)-caused lung infectionWe first assessed whether the nasal microbiota could be important when considering its antiviral protective properties using a murine model of IAV-caused lung infection. The nasal cavities of C57BL/6 (B6) mice (N = 5) were inoculated with 30 μL of an antibiotic cocktail (composed of vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole) on days 1, 2, and 3 to eliminate nasal microbiota completely (Supplementary Fig. 1), followed by IAV [2,130 pfu/30 μL, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] infection on day 7 (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1: Nasal microbiota might be critical for the suppression of IAV-caused lung infection.A Schematic of the mouse model experimental design with depletion of the nasal microbiome. The mice (N = 20, group 1 (n = 5): abx (−) IAV (−), group2 (n = 5): abx (+) IAV (−), group 3 (n = 5): abx (−) IAV(+), group 4 (n = 5): abx (+) IAV (+)) were used in these experiments and ten mice were infected with IAV (2,130 pfu) at the indicated time points. The change in B the mean body weight (analyzed by repeated measure two-way ANOVA), and C survival rate of IAV-infected mice (analyzed by Kaplan–Meier with log-rank test) was compared according to the inoculation of intranasal antibiotics. Ten mice were used and five (abx (+), IAV (+)) were infected with IAV (2,130 pfu). The B6 mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota before IAV infection exhibited over 10% of weight loss than IAV-infected mice without abx administration, resulting in the death of all the mice at 8 days after IAV infection. Lung samples from uninfected mice (abx (+), IAV (−)) and IAV-infected mice that survived up to 7 dpi were collected. D IAV PA mRNA levels in the mice lung tissue (red dot: abx (+), IAV (–), black dot: abx (+) IAV (+)) and E viral titers from the BAL fluid of IAV-infected mice (red dot: abx (+), IAV (−), black dot: abx (+) IAV (+)) were assessed at 7 dpi. F H&E-stained micrographs were also generated from lung sections obtained at 7 dpi. Micrographs shown are representative of lung sections from five mice (red dot: abx (+), IAV (−), black dot: abx (+) IAV (+)) (Scale bar 10 uM). The micrographs were used to assess inflammation and tissue damage and to calculate a histological score. Real-time PCR and plaque assay results are analyzed by Mann–Whitney U-test and presented as mean ± SD values from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. mice without antibiotics treatment. (Abx antibiotics).Full size imageThe body weights and survival rates of the infected B6 mice were monitored for 14 days. The IAV-infected mice exhibited a significant decrease in mean body weight, with an 80% survival rate until seven days postinfection (dpi) compared to the mice without antibiotic administration and IAV infection. The B6 mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota before IAV infection exhibited a more significant weight loss (below 15 g until 7 dpi) than IAV-infected mice without antibiotic administration, resulting in the death of all the mice after IAV infection (Fig. 1B, C). As compared with thee infected with IAV alone (3.2 × 103), those inoculated with antibiotics preceding IAV infection showed higher IAV polymerase acidic protein (PA) gene levels (3.4 × 104) in lung tissue (Fig. 1D) and higher viral titer (4.8 × 104 with antibiotics) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (Fig. 1E). IAV-infected mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota also had more severe pathologic findings in the lungs, with significantly higher histologic scores (Fig. 1F).These findings demonstrate that IAV-caused lung infection progressed more seriously when the nasal microbiota was eliminated before infection and that the nasal microbiome could contribute to immune responses against IAV infection in the respiratory tract.Pretreatment with human nasal commensal S. epidermidis suppresses IAV-caused infection in the lungs and nasal mucosa in vivoWe next sought to explore whether the human nasal commensal S. epidermidis exhibited antiviral protective properties against IAV infection in a murine model in vivo. The nasal cavities of B6 mice (N = 5) were inoculated with human nasal mucus–derived S. epidermidis on day 5, which was 2 days after depletion of the nasal microbiota (days 1, 2, and 3) using 30 μL of antibiotics. Then, the S. epidermidis–inoculated B6 mice were infected with IAV (2130 pfu/30 μl, PBS) 2 days after S. epidermidis inoculation (day 7) (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2: Human nasal mucus–derived S. epidermidis suppressed the viral spread and replication in IAV-infected mice.A Schematic of the mouse model experimental design for intranasal S. epidermidis inoculation and IAV infection. The mice (N = 20, group 1 (n = 5): S. epidermidis (−) IAV (−), group2 (n = 5): S. epidermidis (+) IAV (−), group 3 (n = 5): S. epidermidis (−) IAV (+), group 4 (n = 5): S. epidermidis (+) IAV (+)) were used in these experiments. The mice were inoculated with S. epidermidis (3.2 × 106 CFU/30 µl PBS) and infected with IAV (2,130 pfu/30 ul PBS) at the indicated time points. The changes in (B) the mean body weight (analyzed by repeated measure two-way ANOVA) and survival rate (C) of IAV-infected mice (analyzed by Kaplan–Meier with log-rank test) were compared according to the inoculation of S. epidermidis. 20 mice were used and ten were infected with IAV (2,130 pfu). IAV-infected mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota exhibited over 30% decrease in mean body weight until eight days but the mean body weight of nasal microbiota-depleted B6 mice that were treated with S. epidermidis before IAV infection exceeded 20 g until 8 days after infection. Lung samples from uninfected mice and mice that survived up to 7 dpi were collected. D B6 mice were inoculated with human nasal mucus–derived S. epidermidis before IAV infection, and H&E-stained micrographs were also generated from lung sections obtained at 7 dpi (Scale bar 100 uM). Micrographs shown are representative of lung sections from five mice and were used to assess inflammation and tissue damage and to calculate a histological score. B6 mice were inoculated with human nasal S. epidermidis before IAV infection, and IAV PA mRNA levels in the mouse lung tissue 9 (E) and nasal mucosa (F) were assessed at 7 dpi. Levels of IAV NP were monitored in lung tissue (G) and nasal mucosa (H) using western blot analysis, and representative results are shown. I Viral titers were also measured in the BAL fluid of IAV-infected mice following S. epidermidis inoculation. In the next independent experiments, ten mice were used to measure the colonies and FemA mRNA levels of S. epidermidis according to IAV infection. J S. epidermidis CFUs were determined at 7 dpi in the NAL and BAL fluid of IAV-infected mice following S. epidermidis inoculation. K FemA mRNA levels of S. epidermidis were measured in the nasal mucosa and lung tissue of IAV-infected mice at 7 dpi following S. epidermidis inoculation. Real-time PCR, plaque assays, colony count, and ELISA results are analyzed by Mann–Whitney U-test and presented as mean ± SD values from three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. mice infected with IAV alone.Full size imageThe results revealed that IAV-infected mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota exhibited a significant decrease in mean body weight with a 20% survival rate until 14 days. Interestingly, the nasal microbiota-depleted B6 mice that were treated with human nasal S. epidermidis before IAV infection maintained their body weight even after IAV infection, and the mean body weight of these mice exceeded 20 g until seven days after infection, resulting in a 100% survival rate after IAV infection as the mice without IAV infection and S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 2B, C). Nasal microbiota-depleted B6 mice with only an S. epidermidis intranasal inoculation did not show any weight loss and also exhibited a 100% survival rate. As compared with the IAV-infected mice with intranasal antibiotic administration, S. epidermidis exposure also resulted in attenuated pathologic findings in the lungs of IAV-infected mice, with significantly lower histologic scores (Fig. 2D).Human nasal S. epidermidis also demonstrated antiviral potential by suppressing viral replication in the lungs and nasal mucosa of IAV-infected mice. The data revealed that B6 mice infected with IAV and inoculated with S. epidermidis had lower IAV PA messenger RNA (mRNA) levels (2.7 × 102) in the lung tissue (Fig. 2E), and lower IAV PA mRNA levels (0.4 × 103) were also observed in the nasal mucosa (Fig. 2F). Moreover, the IAV nucleoprotein (NP) level was significantly reduced in the lungs and nasal mucosa of IAV-infected mice that were inoculated with human nasal S. epidermidis relative to in the IAV-infected mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota (Fig. 2G, H). In addition, viral titers were also significantly reduced in the nasal lavage (NAL) and BAL fluid of IAV-infected mice with inoculation with human nasal S. epidermidis (Fig. 2I). While the viral titer was relatively higher in BAL fluid accompanied by higher IAV mRNA levels in the lung tissue of IAV-infected mice with depletion of the nasal microbiota, it was rather decreased a lesser extent in the NAL fluid of IAV-infected mice following inoculation of S. epidermidis despite the fact that IAV replication was suppressed in the nasal mucosa and the lungs.As a next step, we assessed the distribution of bacteria in S. epidermidis-inoculated mice by comparing colony-forming units (CFUs) in NAL and BAL fluid. Whereas substantial numbers of S. epidermidis CFUs were observed in the NAL fluid, the levels of S. epidermidis cells in the BAL fluid were under the limits of detection (Fig. 2J). We also found that mRNA levels of the FemA gene in S. epidermidis were minimally detected in the lungs of mice after nasal inoculation with S. epidermidis (Fig. 2K).These findings suggest that human nasal microbiome S. epidermidis suppresses IAV replication not only in nasal mucosa but only the lungs of IAV-infected mice and the number of extracellular IAV particles is estimated to be reduced to a lesser extent in NAL fluid, which is thought to be related to inhibition of cellular entry of the virus at the level of the nasal mucosa.Human nasal commensal S. epidermidis promotes the induction of serine protease inhibitors in the nasal epitheliumTo determine whether cellular entry of IAV might be suppressed in the nasal epithelium via human nasal commensal S. epidermidis, S. epidermidis were inoculated to normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells. First, mRNA levels in the cell lysate and the colony count in the supernatant were assessed at different time points postinfection following the inoculation of S. epidermidis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that S. epidermidis FemA mRNA levels increased significantly from eight hours postinfection, with the highest levels observed at 1 dpi (5.8 × 105; Fig. 3A). The number of S. epidermidis CFUs was also significantly increased in the supernatant of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells until one day after inoculation (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3: Human nasal commensal S. epidermidis promoted the induction of serine protease inhibitor in the nasal epithelium.NHNE cells from five healthy volunteers were inoculated with human nasal S. epidermidis at an MOI of 0.25. A FemA mRNA levels, normalized to cellular GAPDH transcript levels, were monitored by real-time PCR. B S. epidermidis CFUs were determined at 1 dpi in the supernatant of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells.

F Serpine1 and Serpine2 mRNA levels, normalized to cellular GAPDH transcript levels, were monitored by real-time PCR (blue bar: Serpine1; red bar: Serpine2). G The intracellular protein level of Serpine1 was measured in the cell lysate of S. epidermidis–inoculated NHNE cells using western blot analysis. H The secreted protein level of Serpine1 was measured in the supernatant of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells using ELISA. I Heatmap depicting the expression levels of genes related with serine-type peptidase inhibitor activity differentially expressed in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells depending on the cellular subset. J Serpine1 mRNA level, normalized to cellular GAPDH transcript levels, was monitored by real-time PCR over 1 day after IAV infection following S. epidermidis inoculation. K, L The neutralizing antibody for Serpine1 was administered to NHNE cells one hour before S. epidermidis inoculation, and then the cells were infected with IAV for 1 day. IAV mRNA and NPs of IAV were compared in IAV-infected NHNE cells after S. epidermidis inoculation depending upon the neutralization of Serpine1. Results are presented as mean ± SD values from five independent experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. mock-infected NHNE cells.Full size imageThen, we investigated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to clarify S. epidermidis-induced genes related with the cellular entry of IAV in the nasal epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 2). As compared with NHNE cells, there were 5036 DEGs based on the cutoff criteria (adjusted p < 0.05, fold change ≥ or <1.5 and normalized data (log2) ≥ or <2.0) in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells at 1 dpi. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of scRNA-seq data by DAVID using cell lysates from the S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells to confirm the effect of S. epidermidis in restricting host entry of IAV. The GO analysis showed that DEGs linked with biological processes were mainly enriched in “entry into host cells,” “entry into other organism involved in symbiotic interaction,” “entry into the host,” “viral entry into a host cell,” and “entry into host cells of other organism involved in symbiotic interaction” (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table 1). We also performed GO enrichment analysis of scRNA-seq data by EnrichR using cell lysates from the S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells and confirmed similar results about DEGs and GO categories with DAVID analysis (Supplementary Table 2).Among 5036 DEGs, 19 genes were classified into the GO category linked with serine-type peptidase inhibitor activity. The scatterplot data of DEGs showed that both Serpine1 and Serpine2 genes increased the most among all genes linked with serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells (Fig. 3D), and we confirmed increased normalized Serpine1 and Serpine2 expression in basal cells of nasal epithelium (Fig. 3E). The scRNA-seq data also revealed that the basal level of Serpine1 (normalized data (log2): 3.723) was significantly higher than that of Serpine2 (normalized data (log2): 1,216) in NHNE cells (Table 1). As a next step, we studied the expression kinetics of the human Serpine1 and Serpine2 genes as well as protein production in NHNE cells following inoculation with S. epidermidis. PCR results showed that Serpine1 mRNA was significantly upregulated until 24 h, but the induction of the Serpine2 gene was relatively lower in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells (Fig. 3F). Consistent with the induction of Serpine1 gene expression, intracellular and secreted levels of Serpine1 protein were significantly elevated in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells, with the highest levels observed 24 h after inoculation (Fig. 3G, H). The heatmap of serine-type peptidase inhibitor transcript activity showed that the increase of Serpine1 transcripts was the most significant in secretory-like (15.4-fold over control) and suprabasal cells (12.4-fold over control) (Fig. 3I and Supplementary Table 3).Table 1 Differential expression gene (DEG) linked with serine-type peptidase inhibitors in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells.Full size tableTo assess the effects of S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 expression on the susceptibility of the nasal epithelium to IAV infection, NHNE cells were inoculated with S. epidermidis at an MOI of 0.25 and then infected with IAV 8 h after inoculation (MOI 1). Interestingly, PCR results revealed that Serpine1 mRNA was also upregulated in IAV-infected NHNE cells (1.2 × 104 ± 4.3 × 103) at 1 dpi and Serpine1 gene expression was also induced by S. epidermidis inoculation (1.1 × 104 ± 3.1 × 103). However, the Serpine1 gene expression level was more highly induced in NHNE cells with S. epidermidis inoculation following IAV infection (3.9 × 104 ± 5.2 × 103; Fig. 3J). Subsequently, the IAV PA mRNA level was assessed in the cell lysate of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells following IAV infection depending on the neutralization of Serpine1 in NHNE cells. The increased IAV PA mRNA level (1.3 × 103) was completely reduced in the cell lysate of IAV-infected NHNE cells with S. epidermidis inoculation (1.8 × 102), but the cell lysate of IAV-infected NHNE cells treated with Serpine1 neutralizing antibody exhibited increased IAV mRNA level (2.4 × 102) again regardless of S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 3K). Western blot analysis similarly revealed that IAV NP level was not reduced in IAV-infected NHNE cells that were treated with Serpine1 neutralizing antibody before S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 3L). As a next step, Serpine1 blocking peptide was inoculated into the nasal cavity of B6 mice (2.5 ug/5 ul) at 1 day prior to antibiotics treatment and then, S. epidermidis was inoculated with inoculated to the mice two days before IAV (2130 pfu/30 μl, PBS) infection. Both IAV PA mRNA and NP levels were assessed in the nasal mucosa of S. epidermidis-inoculated B6 mice following IAV infection depending on the neutralization of Serpine1 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The increased IAV PA mRNA level (2.7 × 103) was completely reduced in the nasal mucosa of IAV-infected B6 mice with S. epidermidis inoculation (3.2 × 102), but the IAV-infected mice treated with Serpine1 neutralizing antibody exhibited increased IAV mRNA level (2.8 × 103) again regardless of S. epidermidis inoculation (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Western blot analysis similarly revealed that IAV NP level was not reduced in the nasal mucosa of IAV-infected mice that were treated with Serpine1 neutralizing antibody before S. epidermidis inoculation (Supplementary Fig. 3c).These findings indicate that nasal commensal S. epidermidis-regulated antiviral immune responses might be specially mediated by serine protease inhibitor in the nasal epithelium and that S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 production might be involved in disturbing cellular entry of IAV in nasal epithelium. S. epidermidis induced Serpine1 expression in NHNE cells via interactions with an increase in urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)At last, we examined how S. epidermidis induced Serpine1 expression in the nasal epithelium and whether S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 might be involved in the decrease of host proteases in NHNE cells.Among 5036 DEGs, 20 genes were classified into the GO category linked with serine-type peptidase activity, and the scatterplot data of DEGs showed that PLAU (urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)), HtrA serine peptidase1, and TMPRSS11E were more significantly elevated in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells 24 h after inoculation (Fig. 4A). Our data also showed that PLAU gene expression was more highly induced among the DEGs linked with serine-type peptidases in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells (Table 2). A protein–protein interaction network of 39 DEGs linked with serine-type peptidase and serine-type peptidase inhibitors was constructed using the STRING online database and visualized by Cytoscape. Connectivity MAP analysis revealed the more characteristic protein–protein interaction (PPI) between Serpine1 and PLAU (STRING database score: 0.999), and these two genes showed a more significant influence on maintaining the stability of the PPI network (Fig. 4B). The heatmap data revealed that the induction of PLAU gene expression was more significant in secretory-like and suprabasal cells as was also true with the expression of Serpine1 (Fig. 4C). Next, NHNE cells were transfected with scrambled short hairpin (sh) RNA (cont shRNA) and uPA shRNA to suppress a transient expression of PLAU in NHNE cells before S. epidermidis inoculation. Interestingly, an increase in the Serpine1 mRNA level in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells (3.2 × 104) with the transfection of cont shRNA was significantly attenuated in NHNE cells with transfection of uPA shRNA (4.8 × 103) before S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 4D). Western blot results revealed that S. epidermidis-induced protein levels of Serpine1 were also reduced in NHNE cells with transfection of uPA shRNA (Fig. 4E). We also found that IAV PA mRNA levels increased again in IAV-infected NHNE cells with transfection of uPA shRNA despite inoculation of S. epidermidis (Supplementary Fig. 4). These findings suggest that the nasal commensal S. epidermidis induces Serpine1 production via an increase of uPA in the nasal epithelium and that a sequential induction of uPA and Serpine1 might be related with inhibition of cellular entry of IAV in nasal epithelium.Fig. 4: Staphylococcus epidermidis-induced Serpine1 expression was regulated by increase of uPA production and suppressed the activity of intracellular serine protease.A Scatterplots indicating enriched genes related with serine-type peptidase.

C Heatmap depicting the expression levels of genes related with serine-type peptidase inhibitor activity differentially expressed in S. epidermidis–inoculated NHNE cells depending on a cellular subset. D Serpine1 mRNA and E protein levels were monitored by real-time PCR and western blot analysis following S. epidermidis inoculation at 1 dpi with transfection with cont shRNA and uPA shRNA. F Serpine1 (blue bar) and PLAU mRNAs (red bar) were compared in NHNE cells after S. epidermidis inoculation. G ELISA results showed the secreted protein levels of Serpine1 (blue bar) and uPA (red bar) in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells. H The intracellular protein levels of HAT and Serpine1 were measured in the cell lysate of S. epidermidis–inoculated NHNE cells at 4, 8, and 24 h using western blot analysis. I The mRNA levels of proteases, such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F, and KLK5, which were targeted by Serpine1, were measured using the cell lysate of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells at 4, 8, and 24 h. Western blot results are representative of five independent experiments. Real-time PCR and plaque assay results are presented as mean ± SD values from five independent experiments. *p < 0.05 vs. mock-infected NHNE cells.Full size imageTable 2 Differential expression gene (DEG) linked with serine-type peptidase in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells.Full size tableIt has been reported that PLAU might be a major target of Serpine1 in the inhibitory mechanism of IAV infection in the respiratory epithelium8. Both PLAU mRNA and secreted protein levels of uPA gradually decreased in the cell lysate and supernatant of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells from 24 h after inoculation (Fig. 4F, G). S. epidermidis reduced the expression of other serine proteases identified as established targets of Serpine1 in the respiratory epithelium; notably, human airway trypsin (HAT) decreased immediately in the cell lysate of NHNE cells after S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 4H). We also found that transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS)2, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F, and KLK5, expression levels were gradually reduced in NHNE cells after S. epidermidis inoculation (Fig. 4I). In contrast, we were able to detect the gradual increase in the Serpine1 gene and protein expression in NHNE cells until 72 h after S. epidermidis inoculation. These data showed that S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 expression might be correlated with the reduction of airway proteases needed for IAV cellular entry to the nasal epithelium.DiscussionOur study revealed that S. epidermidis, which is abundant in healthy human nasal mucus, might be significantly associated with the induction of the serine protease inhibitor Serpine1 in the nasal epithelium and could restrict the spread of IAV to the lungs. Following inoculation of S. epidermidis, one of the serine proteases’ uPA induction stimulated Serpine1 production in the nasal epithelium and an increase in Serpine1 production reduced airway serine proteases, thereby skewing the protease–protease inhibitor balance of the nasal mucosa in favor of the host. This study highlights Serpine1 as a nasal commensal-regulated antiviral immune component in the healthy nasal mucosa and presents the role played by S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 against the cellular invasion of IAV in the nasal epithelium.The respiratory mucosa is the first target organ for environmental pathogens, and recent works have highlighted the critical role of the respiratory mucosa as a barrier for restricting invasion of the host by respiratory virus20,21,22,23,24. The compositional differences in the respiratory microbiome have drawn increased interest, and the importance of the respiratory microbiome, especially in immune protection, has been significantly recognized18. Human respiratory viruses first encounter host defense mechanisms in the nasal epithelium, and host protection can be conferred by a specialized innate immune system of the nasal epithelium capable of combating invasion by respiratory viruses25,26. There is also growing evidence that a microbiome community resides in the human nasal mucus and exhibits the potential for antiviral immunity. Our previous study revealed that S. epidermidis is the most abundant commensal organism in the healthy human nasal mucus, and the presence of S. epidermidis strengthens the frontline antiviral immune defense response in the respiratory tract through the modulation of interferon-dependent innate immune mechanisms in the nasal mucosa15. The current study also demonstrated that IAV-caused lung infection was more serious when the nasal microbiome was eliminated and that S. epidermidis can contribute to boosting immune responses, thereby suppressing acute IAV lung infection. We determined that additional studies are needed to demonstrate how the nasal commensal S. epidermidis mediates antiviral immune mechanisms and to define the clear mechanism of host–bacterial commensalism to impede the spread of respiratory viruses. The colonies of S. epidermidis were not found in the lungs but only in the nasal mucosa after intranasal inoculation. Therefore, we estimate that the S. epidermidis might contribute to potentiate antiviral immune responses at the level of the nasal mucosa and disturb viral spread to the lungs of IAV-infected mice.To enter the airway epithelial cells, influenza, parainfluenza, and coronaviruses depend on trypsin-like serine proteases of the human airways for maturation of the viral protein involved in cell membranes5,6,27. Among several respiratory viruses, the mechanism of intracellular invasion to the respiratory epithelium by airway proteases has been well uncovered for influenza viruses. IAV maturation involves the cleavages of its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) and cleavage by serine proteases is required for the cellular invasion or spread of IAV7,8. Therefore, HA cleavage has been proposed as a target for antiviral therapy and the mediators that could induce anti-protease activity can be used as a new therapeutic option against IAV infection in the respiratory tract.An interesting point we noticed among the results of this study is that the viral titer was significantly higher in BAL fluid than in NAL fluid from IAV-infected mice. However, when comparing the viral titer in mice inoculated with S. epidermidis prior to IAV infection, a relatively large number of IAV particles was observed in NAL fluid and the viral titer was completely reduced in BAL fluid in response to inoculation of S. epidermidis, even though S. epidermidis reduced IAV replication in both the nasal mucosa and lung tissue. We assume that human nasal commensal S. epidermidis inhibited the intracellular invasion of IAV in the nasal epithelium and the mechanism by which IAV enters the nasal epithelium might be disturbed in the presence of S. epidermidis, which resulted in less spread of IAV from the nasal epithelium to the lungs of IAV-infected mice. Therefore, whether the nasal commensal S. epidermidis allowed the baseline serine protease inhibitor levels to be boosted and inhibited IAV replication through the induction of serine protease inhibitors in the nasal epithelium is our active inquiry and we extended our research through RNA-seq data and in vitro study using cultured human nasal epithelial cells.Our scRNA-seq findings exhibited that the RNA levels of the serine protease inhibitor Serpine1 were significantly induced in the cell lysate of S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells and Serpine1 induction was present more dominantly in secretory-like and suprabasal cells in the nasal epithelium. This observation was supported by in vitro studies revealing that the human nasal commensal S. epidermidis induced Serpine1 gene expression and proteins in the cell lysate and supernatant of NHNE cells. Previously, it has been reported that Serpine1 inhibits multiple serine proteases with varying efficiencies, and HAT, TMPRSS families, and uPA-which are involved in extracellular IAV glycoprotein cleavage-are also targets of Serpine1 in the airway5,8. We found that S, epidermidis-induced Serpine1 expression showed an inverse correlation with the expression of airway proteases such as HAT, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F, TMPRSS2, and KLK5, and the neutralization of Serpine1 activity exhibited higher IAV replication in S. epidermidis-inoculated nasal epithelial cells. These findings suggest that nasal commensal S. epidermidis has a distinctive antiviral strategy against IAV that is involved in the induction of serine protease inhibitors and turns the host nasal epithelium into an airway protease-deficient environment.Serine protease inhibitors may be considered an emerging broad therapeutic group against multiple respiratory viruses that rely on these enzymes for their replication, and the clinical evidence are already available to suppress influenza viral replication through the inhibition of serine proteases28,29. We also propose that targeting serine proteases has a strong impact in reducing the spread of IAV from the nasal epithelium, thus identifying S. epidermidis-induced Serpine1 as an influence on the development of antiviral biologics to suppress IAV-caused lung infections. Therefore, our additional research focused on verifying how S. epidermidis induced Serpine1 expression in the nasal epithelium, and our data highlight that the upregulation of Serpine1 expression by S. epidermidis during IAV infection depends upon uPA induction in NHNE cells. Although the expression of other host proteases decreased in S. epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells, both mRNA and protein levels of uPA were significantly increased in response to S. epidermidis. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine whether the induction of uPA by the nasal commensal S. epidermidis is linked with the change in cellular environment to Serpine1 induction. Our scRNA-seq data provided evidence that a close protein–protein interaction between uPA and Serpine1 was observable in S epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells. Furthermore, the significant increase in Serpine1 expression in S epidermidis-inoculated NHNE cells was not observed with knockdown of the transient expression of uPA. The expression of uPA increased by S. epidermidis could be involved in Serpine1 induction, but, finally, uPA expression began to decrease from 24 h onward after inoculation with S. epidermidis. The current findings indicate that S. epidermidis-induced uPA is responsible for the sequential increase in Serpine1 expression, which results in reduced serine proteases in the nasal epithelium and thus may impede IAV spread to the respiratory tract.Here, we described that the nasal commensal S. epidermidis suppresses IAV invasion to the nasal epithelium through uPA-dependent Serpine1 production and influences the serine protease-deficient cellular environment. This intimate association of S. epidermidis and the amplification of serine protease inhibitors could potentially benefit the host respiratory tract and prevent IAV spread to the lungs through the downregulation of airway proteases at the level of the nasal mucosa.MethodsEthics statementParticipation in this study was voluntary, with written informed consent obtained from all human subjects prior to enrollment. The institutional review board (IRB) of the Seoul National University College of Medicine approved the protocol for this study (IRB #C2012248 [943]). In vivo experiments with C57BL/6 J mice were carried out according to guidelines approved by the IRB of the Seoul National University College of Medicine (IACUC #2016–0093).Nasal mucus microbiome characterizationThe mucus from the middle turbinate of healthy volunteers was collected individually using sterile 3 M Quick swabs (3 M Microbiology Products, St. Paul, MN, USA) from four subjects using a rigid 0-degree endoscope in an operating room. The swabs with mucus were fixed in a fixative solution and transported immediately to the laboratory for identification and subsequent microbial analysis. For bacterial colony isolation, the mucus was placed on lysogeny broth plates. After two days of incubation, bacterial colonies were obtained from the lysogeny broth plates and the species of each colony were identified using GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencing by 16 S ribosomal RNA gene amplification15. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (N1–N4) were isolated from four individuals, and all four strains isolated were used in this study (Supplementary Fig. 5).Viruses and reagentsInfluenza A virus strain A/Wilson–Smith/1933 H1N1 (IAV A/WS/33; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) was used in this study to induce acute viral lung infection. Virus stocks were grown in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a viral growth medium according to a standard procedure30. Briefly, after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were harvested and spun by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min to remove cellular debris. Virus stocks were titrated on MDCK cells using a tissue culture infectious dose assay and stored at −80 °C. Control shRNA (cat # sc-108080) and uPA shRNA (cat # sc-36779) lentiviral particles were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas USA).Cell culturePassage-2 NHNE cells (1 × 105 cells/culture) were seeded in 0.25 mL of culture medium on Transwell clear culture inserts (24.5 mm, with a 0.45-mm pore size; Costar Co., Cambridge, MA, USA). Cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of basal epithelial growth medium and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing the previously described supplements. Cultures were grown while submerged for the first 9 days. The culture medium was changed on day 1, then on every other day thereafter. An air–liquid interface (ALI) was created on day 9 by removing the apical medium and feeding the cultures from the basal compartment only. The culture medium was changed daily after the establishment of the ALI. An antifungal agent, fungizone (1 ml/1,000 mL media; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was added after filtering the media. All experiments described here employed cultured nasal epithelial cells at 14 days after the creation of the ALI31.Real-time PCRNHNE cells were infected with WS/33 (H1N1) for 10 and 30 min; 8, 2, and 8 h; and 1, 2, and 3 days, respectively, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technology, Seoul, Korea). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA with random hexamer primers (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Amplification was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, amplification reactions had a total volume of 12 μL and contained 2 μL of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotide primers (final concentration of 800 nM), and TaqMan hybridization probe (200 nM). Real-time PCR probes were labeled at the 5′ end with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the 3′ end with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). To quantify the cellular viral level and host gene expression, cellular RNA was used to generate cDNA. The IAV level was monitored by performing quantitative PCR of the PA gene (segment 3) with forward and reverse primers and the probes 5′-ggccgactacactctcgatga-3′, 5′-tgtcttatggtgaatagcctggttt-3′, and 5′-agcagggctaggatc-3′, respectively. Primers for human or mouse Serpine1 (assay ID Hs00167155_m1, Mm00435858_m1), Serpine2 (assay ID Hs00299953_m1, Mm00436753_m1), TMPRSS11E (assay ID Hs01070171_m1, Mm01212186_m1), TMPRSS11F (assay ID Hs01592083_m1, Mm00812591_m1), TMPRSS2 (assay ID Hs01122322_m1, Mm00443687_m1), and KLK5 (assay ID Hs01548153_m1, Mm01203811_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the PE Biosystems ABI PRISM® 7700 sequence detection system. Thermocycling parameters were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and 60 °C for 1 min. Target mRNA levels were quantified using target-specific primer and probe sets for IAV WS/33 (H1N1), Serpine1, Serpine2, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F, TMPRSS2, and KLK5. All PCR assays were quantitative and used plasmids containing the target gene sequences as standards. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and all real-time PCR data were normalized to the level of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1 × 106 copies) to correct for variations between samples.Quantification of secreted proteinsSecreted human urokinase plasminogen activator and Serpine1 were quantified using human urokinase plasminogen activator (DY1310) and human Serpine1 (DY1786) DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively. The working range of the assays was 62.5 to 4000 pg/mL.Viral titer determinationViral titers were determined using a plaque assay. Virus samples were serially diluted with PBS. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in twelve-well plates were washed twice with PBS, then infected in duplicate with 250 μL/well dilution of each virus. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to facilitate virus adsorption. Following adsorption, a 1% agarose overlay in complete MEM supplemented with TPCK trypsin (1 μg/mL) and 1% fetal bovine serum was applied. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C, and cells were fixed with 10% formalin at 2 dpi.Western blot analysisThe IAV NP, HAT, and Serpine1 protein levels were assessed using western blot analysis. IAV NP antibody (molecular weight 61 kDa, primary antibody 1:500) was purchased from Fitzerlard (North action, MA, USA, Cat #10R-2121). Human HAT antibody (molecular weight 46 kDa, cat# MAB2695-SP, primary antibody 1:500), anti-β-actin antibody (molecular weight 42 kDa, primary antibody 1:500), and human Serpine1 neutralizing antibody (cat #AF-1786) were purchased from the R&D system (Minneapolis, MN, USA). In addition, a human Serpine1 antibody (molecular weight 45 kDa, primary antibody 1:500) was purchased from Abcam (Waltham, MA, USA, cat #ab66705) and mouse Serpine1 blocking peptide from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA, cat #MBS8309331). San Diego, CA, USA). The NHNE cells were lysed with 2× lysis buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH of 6.5, 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Cell lysate (30 μg of protein) was electrophoresed in 10% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH of 7.5, 150 mM of NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibody (1:500) in Tween-Tris–buffered saline (TTBS) (0.5% Tween-20 in TBS). After washing with TTBS, the blot was incubated for one hour at room temperature with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA) in TTBS and was visualized using an ECL system (Amersham, Little Chalfont, England). The full uncropped scans of the western blots included in the results of the present study are provided in supplementary Fig. 6.Murine infection modelMale C57BL/6 J (B6) mice (Orientalbio, Seoul, Korea) aged seven weeks (and weighing 19–23 g) were used as wild-type (WT) mice. The B6 mice used in the study were like other commercially available strains of inbred mice. For inoculation of the nasal microbiome, S. epidermidis (3.2 × 106 CFUs in 30 μL of PBS) were delivered into the nasal cavity of WT mice and, for viral infection, IAV (WS/33, H1N1; 2130 pfu in 30 μL of PBS) was inoculated into WT mice by intranasal delivery. After euthanizing the mice, BAL fluid was obtained from the lungs by lavaging with 1,000 μL of 0.5-mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid in PBS following cannulation of the trachea. The collected BAL fluid was used for ELISA for measuring secreted protein levels and plaque assay to determine the viral titer. Mouse lung tissue was also harvested for real-time PCR, microarray, and immunohistochemistry analyses.Immunohistochemistry and histologic analysisLung tissue was fixed in 10% (vol/vol) neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded tissue slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Histopathologic analysis of inflammatory cells in H&E-stained lung sections was performed in a blinded fashion using a semi-quantitative scoring system as described previously32. Lung sections from at least five mice were examined. Briefly, peribronchiolar inflammation was scored as follows: zero points, normal; one point, a few cells; two points, a ring of inflammatory cells one layer deep; three points, a ring of inflammatory cells two to four cells deep; or four points, a ring of inflammatory cells more than four cells deep (maximum possible score = 8 points). The histological score for PBS/PBS control mouse lung tissue was always zero points. At least six separate areas from similar sections within a single mouse were assessed, and at least five mice were assessed. PMNs were counted by an examiner who was blinded to the experimental group and expressed as the number of cells per high-power field.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)Library construction was performed using 10 × chromium single-cell 3’ version 3.1 reagent kits (10 × Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Samples were sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and preliminary sequencing results were converted to FASTQ files using the Cell Ranger pipeline (10× Genomics). We followed the 10× Genomics standard sequence protocol by trimming the barcode and unique molecular identifier end to 26 bp and the mRNA end to 98 bp, respectively. Then, the FASTQ files were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38). Subsequently, we applied Cell Ranger for preliminary data analysis and generated a file that contained a barcode table, a gene table, and a gene-expression matrix. We used WinSeurat version 2.1 (Ebiogen Inc., Seoul, Korea), based on Seurat version 3, for quality control, analysis, and exploration of scRNA-seq data33,34. Data mining and graphic visualization were performed using ExDEGA (Ebiogen Inc).The original scRNA-seq data of the NHNE cells with S. epidermidis inoculation are available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE167509.Statistical analysesFor in vitro study, at least three independent experiments were performed with cultured cells from each donor, and the results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) values of triplicate cultures. Differences between treatment groups were evaluated by repeated measure two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-test was used to analyze scRNA-seq data. We present the in vivo results of real-time PCR, plaque assays, and ELISA as mean ± SD values from five individual mice and statistical analyses were performed by Mann–Whitney U-test. The survival rate of IAV-infected or S. epidermidis-inoculated mice were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier with log-rank test. GraphPad Prism (version 8; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for these statistical analyses and differences were considered significant at p value < 0.05.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Some farms have had to kill more than 5 million chickens at a single site, with a goal of destroying the birds within 24 hours to limit the spread of the disease and prevent animals from suffering. Left unchecked, avian influenza can decimate flocks within days.“The faster we can get on site and depopulate the birds that remain on site, the better,” Minnesota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said.The outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds. So far this year, there have been outbreaks in 24 states.Iowa, has been the hardest hit, with about 13.3 million chickens and turkeys killed. It is the nation's leading producer of eggs and ranks seventh in turkey production.Other states with sizable outbreaks include Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Indiana.More: Iowa wildlife officials assessing bird flu's impact on eagles, hawks, other wild birdsPreferred techniques include foam, gas, with ventilation shutdown a last resortFarms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques “may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free.”Iowa producers, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's oversight, use methods "that will lead to the fewest number of birds suffering the terrible effects of this disease," the Iowa Department of Agriculture said in a statement, though it did not specify those techniques.One of the veterinary association's preferred methods is to spray water-based firefighting foam over birds as they roam around the floor of a barn. The foam kills the animals by cutting off their air supply.When foam won't work because birds are in cages above floor level or it's too cold, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends sealing up barns and piping carbon dioxide inside, rendering the birds unconscious before they suffocate.More: Bird flu pushing up egg prices, shrinking supplies as Iowa, nation head into Easter, PassoverIf one those methods won't work because equipment or workers aren't available, or when the size of a flock is too large, the association said a last resort is a technique called ventilation shutdown. In that scenario, farmers stop airflow into barns, which raises temperatures to levels at which the animals die. The USDA and the veterinary association recommend that farmers add additional heat or carbon dioxide to barns to speed up the process and limit suffering by the animals.That was the technique a national animal rights group, Direct Action Everywhere, said northwest Iowa egg operation Rembrandt Enterprises used to kill 5.3 million hens last month. The group — controversial for tactics that include covert filming inside livestock facilities— said the method is demonstrably inhumane and constitutes animal cruelty. It distributed video it said shows live but lethargic hens in cages in an otherwise depopulated barn, and a still-live chicken, barely able to move, at a site where dead birds were composted.Direct Action Everywhere, based in California, contends that all the methods for quickly killing birds are inhumane, but it is particularly opposed to ventilation shutdown, which it said can take hours and is akin to leaving a dog in a hot car."It is a slow and painful death characterized by asphyxiation," the group said in a news release.Rembrandt didn't immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.More: Bird flu outbreak in a Hamilton County turkey operation is Iowa's 15th, county's secondAnimal rights groups contend all recommended poultry-killing techniques are inhumaneIn 2020, Direct Action Everywhere likewise documented the use of ventilation shutdown at a Grundy County hog facility, where animals were destroyed because pandemic shutdowns of meatpacking plants left the operators with nowhere to send them for processing. Trespassing and other charges filed against Matt Johnson, an activist affiliated with the group, ultimately were dismissed.Last year, animal rights groups delivered a petition signed by 3,577 people involved in caring for animals, including nearly 1,600 veterinarians, that urged the veterinary association to stop recommending ventilation shutdown as an option.Opponents of the standard techniques for depopulating poultry facilities said firefighting foam contains harmful chemicals and essentially drowns birds, causing chickens and turkeys to suffer convulsions and cardiac arrest as they die. They said carbon dioxide is painful to inhale and detectible by the birds, prompting them to try to flee the gas.“We have to do better. None of these are acceptable in any way,” said Sara Shields, director of farm animal welfare science at Humane Society International.More: 5.3 million laying hens to be destroyed as bird flu reported at fourth Iowa facilityKaren Davis, of the nonprofit group United Poultry Concerns, urged the veterinary association to stop recommending all of its three main options.“They’re all ways that I would not choose to die, and I would not choose anybody else to die regardless of what species they belong to,” Davis said.Shields said there are more humane alternatives, such as using nitrogen gas, but those options tend to be more expensive and could have logistical challenges.Sam Krouse, vice president of Indiana-based MPS Egg Farms, said farmers feel miserable about using any of the options.“We pour our lives and livelihoods into taking care of those birds, and it’s just devastating when we lose any of those birds,” Krouse said. “Everything that we’re doing every day is focused on keeping the disease out and making sure that we’re keeping our hens as safe as possible.”Des Moines Register reporter Donnelle Eller and the Associated Press contributed to this article.

When epidemiologists use the word “endemic,” they mean that a disease is occurring “at an expected level in a location during a period of time,” explains epidemiologist René Najera, editor of The History of Vaccines, an online resource by The College of Physicians of Philadelphia.“Endemic” also doesn’t mean that a disease has ceased to be harmful. Malaria, tuberculosis and influenza are all serious and potentially fatal endemic diseases that occur every year. Since the 1940s, countries have built robust international health networks that identify flu strains in order to keep them under control, and avoid the kind of devastation that happened during the 1918 pandemic. This is something epidemiologists and virologists have argued is necessary for COVID-19, and will continue to be necessary if and when the virus becomes endemic.READ MORE: See all pandemic coverage here.The Spanish Flu Was Deadlier Than WWIWATCH: The 1918 Flu Was Deadlier Than WWIEarly Flu Detection SystemsIn 1946, the United States established the Communicable Disease Center, or CDC, in Atlanta, Georgia. Now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC’s initial focus was preventing the spread of malaria. Two years later, the newly-formed United Nations—created as a result of World War II—established the World Health Organization, whose constitution asserts that “Governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples.”An early concern of the World Health Organization, or WHO, was the flu, says Wenqing Zhang, director of the WHO’s Global Influenza Program. The 1918 influenza pandemic had led to an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide. During World War II, the U.S. Army, remembering how the flu had devastated troops during World War I, began funding research into a flu vaccine. In the early 1940s, an Army-supported research team at the University of Michigan led by Thomas Francis Jr. and Jonas Salk (of the polio vaccine) developed the first viable flu vaccine. In 1945, flu vaccines became available for civilians.In 1952, the WHO ​​established the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System in order to collect flu data from different countries and coordinate global efforts to combat the flu. This was a period in which the U.S. military—which was stationed all over the world—and other countries’ militaries were monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, and the WHO’s flu program attempted to use countries’ monitoring stations to look at the big picture. Within a few years, the CDC’s Influenza Division became a collaborating center with the WHO program.Initially, the WHO’s flu program looked for signs and symptoms of influenza and apparent spikes in flu cases, Najera says. Finding the right vaccine to treat those cases was a more difficult matter. Bivalent flu shots could vaccinate against two strains of flu at a time, but discovering what type of flu strains were circulating, and what type of vaccine composition would best treat an outbreak, was still something scientists were learning to do. During the 1950s and ‘60s, they began to make some headway.Identifying New OutbreaksEd Clark/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images<em>Dr. Maurice Hilleman, pictured center, talking with his research team as they study the flu virus in a lab at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, 1957.</em>The first post-World War II flu pandemic occurred relatively early in the WHO’s flu program’s existence. Yet, according to Maurice Hilleman, the microbiologist who sounded the alarm about the outbreak, the WHO missed the pandemic’s early signs. In April 1957, Hilleman read about a flu outbreak in Hong Kong that had started a couple of months before in East Asia. After obtaining samples of the virus from a U.S. Army Medical General Laboratory in Zama, Japan, he realized that it was a new strain capable of turning into a pandemic.Which is what it did. The 1957 pandemic killed an estimated 1.1 million people around the world, and very likely would’ve killed many more if not for Hilleman, who jump-started work on a vaccine that became available that year. Hilleman went on to develop more than 40 vaccines and receive the National Medal of Science for his contributions to public health.When the next flu pandemic hit in 1968, the WHO’s flu surveillance program was more effective at detecting it. In July 1968, the National Influenza Center at the University of Hong Kong identified a flu strain that was spreading in the region. Scientists at the World Influenza Center in London and the CDC in Atlanta received samples of the virus. The scientists who analyzed it found that the virus, like the 1957 one, was a unique strain that could cause a pandemic. They relayed this information to the WHO, which in August issued a warning that a new flu pandemic was starting.With this information and warning, vaccine-makers were able to develop vaccines specific to this virus strain. Like all pandemics, the 1968 one left a devastating toll, killing an estimated one million people. Still, the sharing of information globally led to the development of strain-specific vaccines that helped prevent infection and severe illness in many people.Identifying the Right Vaccine for the WorldAndreas Rentz/Getty ImagesThe H1N1 swine flu vaccination pictured on a vaccination card on October 26, 2009 in Berlin, Germany.During the 1970s and ‘80s, scientists started to gain a better understanding of the flu. They could see that different strains were prominent during different flu seasons, meaning that vaccines should specifically target the strains in circulation in order to be effective. In 1973, the WHO made its first formal recommendation for which strains new flu vaccines should target, Zhang says.In 2007, an international resolution gave the WHO more authority to tell collaborating countries which flu vaccines they should distribute for that year based on circulating strains, and also what to do if the WHO detected a growing flu pandemic—things like increasing vaccine production, increasing testing, enforcing of travel restrictions, etc. (Zhang notes, however, that the WHO cannot force a country to use certain vaccines).The H1N1 outbreak in 2009 “was the first test of these international health regulations,” Najera says. Although ​​the virus killed an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 people, early detection and the relative availability of tests and vaccines helped prevent the pandemic from becoming worse. (In comparison, the WHO estimates there are 290,000 to 650,000 influenza-related respiratory deaths each year.) Ironically, many people who avoided the flu that year may not have realized how they benefited from global health systems doing their job.“That is the issue with public health,” Najera says. “When things go right, nobody notices.”By: Becky LittleBecky Little is a journalist based in Washington, D.C.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) Read More By JOSH FUNK Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Two cases of bird flu have been confirmed in U.S. zoos, but officials said they won’t order widespread euthanasia of zoo birds the way they have on farms.U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Mike Stepien declined to release any details about the zoo cases Thursday, including which two zoos were involved.Many zoos across the country have closed down their aviaries and moved birds inside whenever possible to help protect them from avian influenza that officials believe is primarily being spread by the droppings of wild birds.At many zoos, penguins might be the only birds visitors can see because they are generally kept inside behind glass where they are shielded from the virus.Nearly 27 million chickens and turkeys have been slaughtered in 26 states to limit the spread of bird flu during this year’s outbreak. Officials order entire flocks to be killed when the virus is found on farms. Stepien said zoos work with state veterinary officials when the virus is found, but unlike farms, zoos are generally allowed to isolate and treat an infected bird as long as they take precautions to protect the other birds in their collections. Health officials emphasize that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize food safety because infected birds aren’t allowed into the food supply and properly cooking meat and eggs to 165 degrees Fahrenheit will kill any viruses. The disease also doesn’t represent any immediate public health threat, and no human cases have been found in America.This year’s outbreak is the worst one since 2015 when roughly 50 million chickens and turkeys were slaughtered because of the virus. Stepien said that there were very few bird flu cases in captive wild birds in 2015 and none in large zoos, and no wild birds at zoos were euthanized that year.

OVs could induce immune responses through the dual mechanisms of selective tumor killing without destroying normal tissues and induction of systemic antitumor immunity. In this study, we successfully rescued a chimeric oncolytic influenza virus carrying a human CTLA4 antibody in the background of the A/PR/8/34 (PR8) virus. The chimeric virus, called rFlu-huCTLA4, contained the heavy and light chains of the human CTLA4 antibody in the PB1 and PA segments of the PR8 virus, respectively. The first-generation hemagglutination (HA) titers of the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus ranged from 27 to 28, which could be passaged stably in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos from P1 to P5. The morphology and size distribution of the chimeric virus were consistent with those of the wt influenza virus. The rFlu-huCTLA4 virus could effectively replicate in various cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. ELISA assay revealed that the secreted huCTLA4 antibody levels in chicken embryos increased gradually over time. Furthermore, MTS and crystal violet analysis showed that the selective cytotoxicity of the virus was higher in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 and Huh7) than in normal liver cells (MIHA). In vivo experiments displayed that intratumoral injection with rFlu-huCTLA4 reduced tumor growth and increased the survival of mice compared with the PR8 group. More importantly, in the rFlu-huCTLA4 group, we found that CD4+ and CD8 +T cells were significantly increased in tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the chimeric oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4 could selectively destroy hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo and may provide a promising clinical strategy for targeted immunotherapy of HCC with the oncolytic flu virus.IntroductionPrimary liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, of which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for about 90% of primary liver cancer and is a global health problem (1, 2). Until now, the clinical treatment of liver cancer mainly includes radiofrequency ablation, liver transplantation, hepatectomy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and systemic therapy. However, one of the main therapeutic strategies for advanced HCC is still molecular targeted drugs represented by sorafenib (3). However, the curative effect of liver cancer is not satisfactory, and the 5-year survival rate was very low (4–6). Therefore, many researchers focus on the research of liver cancer drugs to provide many alternative strategies for the clinical treatment of liver cancer (7–9). Novel treatment strategies to improve the treatment efficacy and the survival rate of HCC are urgently needed.As one of the new immuno-oncology therapies with the most potential (10), oncolytic virus (OV) is a genetically engineered or naturally occurring virus that could selectively kill tumor cells by activating the immune system without damaging the normal tissues (11, 12). It has been shown that OVs could selectively infect tumor cells and multiply in tumor cells, which cause cell fragmentation and death, then release and spread to infect nearby tumor cells. OVs induced immunogenicity of the target cells and produce an antitumor immune response in vivo (13). Currently, investigations on several OVs are encouraging, including vaccinia, coxsackie, adenovirus, reovirus, human herpesvirus 1, and measles, which have been extensively explored and tested in clinical trials for various advanced cancers (14–16). On November 1, 2021, Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited announced that Delytact (Teserpaturev/G47Δ), the third-generation HSR-1 oncolytic virus product, is the first approved oncolytic virus product for the treatment of glioblastoma. It is also the fourth oncolytic virus product approved for listing in the world at present (17). The drug made the world realize the great potential of OVs and greatly promoted the development of oncolytic virus therapy.Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) is one of the important immune checkpoints, which is a transmembrane receptor on T cells. TCR/MHC (Signal 1) and CD28B7 (Signal 2) co-stimulated T cells to activate. Antigen-presenting cell B7 (including B7-1 and B7-2) bonded the CTLA4 targets on T cells to inhibit T-cell function. Anti-CTLA4 antibodies could block the binding of CTLA4 and B7 to activate T cells (18–21). Previous studies showed that in vivo administration of CTLA4 antibodies enhanced antitumor immunity, which has promoted CTLA4 antibodies as immunotherapy for cancer (22–24). As a representative sample of the anti-CTLA4 antibody, ipilimumab has been approved for melanoma therapy by the FDA in 2010, which is an immunomodulatory monoclonal IgG1 antibody directed against the cell surface antigen CTLA4 (25). In addition, tremelimumab is an IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits CTLA4, which has been investigated in several clinical trials and has potential as the next generation of anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy agents (26–28).In recent years, there have been many studies on targeted and immunotherapy of liver cancer, but few of them have shown unique advantages. Therefore, we innovatively carried out the study on the chimeric huCTLA4 oncolytic virus. In line with this study, we previously reported the generation of a recombinant influenza virus rFlu-CTLA4 encoding mouse the CTLA4 antibody. The rFlu-CTLA4 virus exhibits selective cytotoxicity in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in a HepG2 homograft mouse model (29). Due to the low sequence homology of human and mouse CTLA4 antibodies, a chimeric influenza virus encoding the human CTLA4 antibody was generated using reverse genetics. Here, we utilized PB1 viral segments to express the heavy chain and PA viral segments to express the light chain of the human CTLA4 antibody, respectively. Subsequently, the oncolytic efficacy of rFlu-CTLA4 for HCC was investigated in vitro and in vivo.Materials and MethodsCells and VirusesHuman hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2 and HuH7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The normal liver cell line MIHA was obtained from Cell Bank, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). COS I cells and MDCK cells were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences; these cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The use of the cell lines was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital. Wild-type influenza virus A/PR/8/34(PR8) was grown in 9–11 day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos (Beijing Laboratory Animal Center, China).Rescue of Chimeric Oncolytic Virus Expressing the Human CTLA4 AntibodyThe sequences of heavy chain and light chain of the huCTLA4 antibody were obtained from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI). After optimization, the gene sequences of the huCTLA4 antibody were synthesized by Shanghai Shenggong Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. The recombinant plasmids pFlu-huCTLA4-Basicity polymerase 1(PB1) and pFlu-huCTLA4-Acidity polymerase(PA) were cloned into the pHW2000 vector. Rescue of the chimeric oncolytic virus was performed according to the Effectene transfection kit’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Briefly, pFlu-huCTLA4-PB1, pFlu-huCTLA4-PA, and the other six plasmids of the PR8 backbone, pHW191-Basicity polymerase 2(PB2), pHW194-Hemagglutinin(HA), pHW195-Nucleoprotein(NP), pHW196-Neuraminidase(NA), pHW197-Matrix protein(M), and pHW198-Non-structural protein(NS), were diluted to 200 ng/μl, then COS I and MDCK cells were co-transfected. After 72h, the allantoic fluid of the chimeric rFlu-huCTLA4 virus was harvested, and the virus titer was determined in HepG2 cells.Real-Time PCR IdentificationThe chimeric oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4 RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid. Then, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified by PB1 and PA universal primers of the influenza A virus. The primers of PB1 are given below:Bm-PB1-1:5′TATTCGTCTCAGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGC3′;Bm-PB1-2: 5′ATATCGTCTCGTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGCATTT3′.The primers of PA were Bm-PA-1: 5′TATTCGTCTCAGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGTACT3′; Bm-PA-2: 5′ATATCGTCTCGTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGTACTT3′. The PCR products were sequenced and compared with pHW192-PB1, pHW193-PA, pHW197-M, and pHW198-NS of the PR8 virus for agarose gel electrophoresis.Electron MicroscopeThe morphological characteristics and size distribution of rFlu-huCTLA4 were investigated with the electron microscope. The chimeric virus was amplified from the chicken embryo and purified by 30%~60% sucrose gradient centrifugation. Then, the viral morphology and size were observed using the transmission electron microscope after negative staining.Virus Growth CurveThe replication ability of rFlu-huCTLA4 was examined on HepG2 and MDCK cells at different time points. The supernatants of 12-, 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96-h cells were collected, and the virus titers were measured at the indicated time point.Antibody Purification and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayThe 9–11-day-old SPF chicken embryos were infected with rFlu-huCTLA4 and incubated at 37°C for 72 h to harvest allantoic fluid. The antibody is concentrated on the protein G column. The secreted human CTLA4 antibody levels in eggs at the indicated time point were detected with an ELISA Kit (Jianglai Biotec, Shanghai).Cell Viability TestMIHA, HepG2, and Huh7 were respectively spread into 96-well cell boards with a cell number of 1 × 104 cells per hole. The cells were inoculated with rFlu-huCTLA4 at MOI (0.1, 1, 2, 3). After 48, 72, and 96 h. MTS reagent was added to determine the OD value at 490 nm by an enzyme-linked detector.MIHA, HepG2, and Huh7 cells were planted in 24-well plates. Then the cells were covered with monolayers inoculated with rFlu-huCTLA4 at MOI (0.1, 1, 2, 3). The cells were infected with rFlu-huCTLA4 at MOI values of 0.1, 1, 2, and 3, and negative control was set up. After 48, 72, and 96 h, 1% crystal violet dye was added after the supernatant was discarded, then the results were recorded and analyzed.Next, we examined the effect of rFlu-huCTLA4 on MIHA and HepG2 cell apoptosis with flow cytometry. The MIHA and HepG2 cells were infected with rFlu-huCTLA4 at MOI of 0.1 and 1. After 48 h, the cells were harvested according to the instructions of the apoptosis kit and detected within 30 min with flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).Animal ExperimentsAll animal experiments were performed under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Ethics Committee of the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. All facilities were accredited by the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital.Mouse hepatoma H22 cells were inoculated into the groin of BALB/c mice to establish a subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model. BALB/c mice bearing tumor were divided into 3 groups (8 in each group). Mice were treated when the tumor volume reached about 100–150 mm3. Mice were intratumorally injected with PBS, PR8, and rFlu-huCTLA4 at 3 × 106 TCID50/100 µl every other day for 7 times.The PDX mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma was implanted into the right back of NPI mice with the size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm. When the tumor grew to 80~150 mm3, every 8 mice were divided into a group and given 3 × 106 TCID50/100 μl for 7 days. The vital signs, survival condition, and tumor volume of mice were observed. When the mice were killed on the 40th day, the tumor tissue was separated and weighed, and observed on pathological sections of the tumor, liver, and lung by HE staining.T Lymphocyte ActivationTo explore the effect of rFlu-huCTLA4 on the immune system of tumor-bearing mice, spleens of mice were taken on the 7th day after the last inoculation and put into PBS (pH 7.4). The spleen was ground into single cells in PBS containing 2% FBS. Filtration was carried out through a 200-mesh filter, centrifuged at 2,000 r/min for 10 min, and resuspended with PBS. Then CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, and CD69+ antibodies 1 µl each were added to separate the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+CD69+) and helper T cells (CD4+CD69+). Then they were put under 4°C for 30 min then detected by flow cytometry.PathologyThe immunohealthy mice were sacrificed after 7 days post virus administration of the last time; the tumors were isolated and fixed with 4% (ml/ml) formaldehyde solution, repaired, dehydrated, dipped in wax, embedded, sectioned, and stained with HE. The growth of tumor cells was observed under the microscope.Statistical AnalysisAll data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analyses comparing two groups were performed using Student’s t-test. Three or more groups were compared using analysis of variance, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.ResultsDesign and Characterization of Recombinant Virus rFlu-huCTLA4The heavy and light chains encoding the huCTLA4 antibody were constructed on PB1 and PA fragments of the PR8 virus, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1A, the recombinant PB1 and PA were cloned into the pHW2000 vector, then co-transfected with the remaining 6 skeleton plasmids to MDCK/COSI-cocultured cells. The recombinant plasmids pFlu-huCTLA4-PB1 and pFlu-huCTLA4-PA were successfully constructed with the sizes of 5,982 and 5,853 bp (Figure 1B). The sequence of the recombinant plasmid was consistent with the expected sequence, which indicated that the recombinant plasmid was successfully constructed. The recombinant plasmids pFlu-huCTLA4-PB1 and pFlu-huCTLA4-PA and the other six backbone plasmids pHW191-PB2, pHW194-HA, pHW195-NP, pHW196-NA, pHW197-M, and pHW198-NS of PR8 were transfected into cocultured cells of COS I and MDCK by RG, and the transfection was identified by 8 plasmids (Figure 1C).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Construction and identification of the recombinant plasmid. (A) Schematic diagram of the experimental model: plasmid construction strategy of recombinant oncolytic influenza viruses pFlu-huCTLA4-PB1 and pFlu-huCTLA4-PA. The recombinant plasmid was co-transfected with the remaining 6 skeleton plasmids into MDCK/COSI cocultured cells, and the recombinant oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4 was saved and the huCTLA4 antibody was produced with the replication of the recombinant virus. (B) Identification of recombinant plasmids pFlu-huCTLA4-PB1 and pFlu-huCTLA4-PA by agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) Identification of 8 transfected plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis.Identification of Recombinant Oncolytic Virus rFlu-huCTLA4To determine the morphology of the chimeric virus, we observed with the electron microscope that the majority of rFlu-huCTLA4 was spherical. The virus envelope was wrapped on the surface of the nucleocapsid, and there were cilia on the surface of the envelope (Figure 2A). The shape and structure of the rFlu-huCTLA4 were consistent with those of the wild-type influenza virus. In addition, the size distribution of the chimeric virus particles was 80~120 nm (Figure 2B).FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Identification of recombinant oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4. (A) The red arrow indicates the virus with regular shape and size, consistent with the morphology and structure of the influenza virus. (B) The size of the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus is mainly between 80 and 120 nm. (C) rFlu-huCTLA4 was continuously amplified in eggs for 5 generations. The titer of hemagglutination was 28~29 and the titer of the virus was 108~9 TCID50/ml after five generations on a chicken embryo. It could be passaged stably in the chicken embryo. (D) Growth curve of the recombinant virus. The HA titer of the recombinant virus increased to 27 from 12 to 72 h and decreased to 26 at 96 h. (E) Identification of the rFlu-huCTLA4 gene fragment by RT-PCR. (F) The antibody content of huCTLA4 detected by ELISA increased gradually with time (***P<0.001, note: the dotted line represents the lowest detection line).Using reverse genetics, we successfully generated the recombinant oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4. The hemagglutination titer of the first-generation recombinant oncolytic virus, rFlu-huCTLA4, was 27~28. After five generations on a chicken embryo, the titer of hemagglutination was 28~29 and TCID50 of the virus was 8~9LogTCID50/ml (Figure 2C).rFlu-huCTLA4 was diluted 10-1 times to infect HepG2 and MDCK cells. The virus titers were measured in supernatant collected from infected cells at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results showed that the HA titer of the recombinant virus increased to 27 from 12 to 72 h and decreased to 26 at 96 h (Figure 2D). Meanwhile, we found that the virus titer had a similar trend, reaching a peak of 109 TCID50/ml at 72 h.The RNA of the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus was extracted from the allantoic fluid by the TRIzol method. After reverse transcription into cDNA, PB1 and PA fragments were amplified by PCR and compared with pHW192-PB1 and pHW193-PA of the PR8 virus. The amplified PB1 and PA fragments of rFlu-huCTLA4 were 2,964 and 2,771 bp, respectively, and the amplified fragments of pHW192-PB1 and pHW193-PA were 2,565 and 2,466 bp, respectively (Figure 2E). The PB1 and PA fragments of rFlu-huCTLA4 were consistent with the expected size, indicating that the recombinant oncolytic virus was successfully rescued.The concentration of the purified antibody was 4.9 ng/ml detected by NanoDrop, and the antibody content was detected with the huCTLA4 antibody ELISA kit. The results showed that no antibody was detected in PBS and PR8 groups, but elevated huCTLA4 antibody levels were detected over time in the rFlu-huCTLA4 group. The huCTLA4 antibody levels of each embryo were 0.17 ± 0.02, 0.27 ± 0.02, and 0.45 ± 0.03 µg at 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively (Figure 2F).The Selective Toxicity of Recombinant Virus to Various Hepatoma Cell LinesThe rFu-huCTLA4 was used to infect MIHA, HepG2, and Huh7 cells at 0.1, 1, 2, and 3MOI. The cell viability was detected by MTS after 48, 72, and 96 h of infection. The results showed that the effect of rFlu-huCTLA4 on MIHA cells had no significant change, but the killing power of rFlu-huCTLA4 on HepG2 and Huh7 increased significantly with the time and dose increases. It was demonstrated that rFlu-huCTLA4 can selectively kill hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It was notable that rFlu-huCTLA4 at 1 MOI caused a significant decrease in HepG2 cell activity than 0.1 MOI after 72 h of viral infection. However, no obvious difference was observed in Huh7 cells (Figure 3A).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Selective cytotoxicity of rFlu-huCTLA4 on different hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in vitro. (A) MTS showed that rFlu-huCTLA4 had no effect on MIHA but had a selective killing effect on HepG2 and Huh7. The activity of HepG2 cells at 1, 2, and 3 MOI was significantly lower than that at 0.1 MOI 72 h after infection; however, Huh7 cells only 2 and 3 MOI decreased significantly compared with 0.1 MOI cells. (B) The rFlu-huCTLA4 recombinant oncolytic virus detected by crystal violet can significantly inhibit the activity of hepatoma cells but has no effect on normal hepatocytes, which is consistent with the results of MTS. (C) Flow cytometry showed that recombinant oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4 could induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. At MOI of 1, the effect of apoptosis of HepG2 cells was more significant than that of MIHA. (**P<0.01,***P<0.001).To further clarify the oncolytic effect of the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus on hepatoma cell lines and normal liver cells, the crystal violet test was performed. Inconsistent with the MTS assay, crystal violet staining showed that the virus could effectively and specifically kill hepatoma cells without damaging normal liver cell lines, in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B).Next, we examined the cell apoptosis of rFlu-huCTLA4 on MIHA and HepG2 cells with flow cytometry. As the flow cytometry result shown in Figure 3C, the apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells at MOI 0.1 and 1 was 7.84 ± 0.17% and 26.76 ± 0.26%, respectively, and 3.45 ± 0.1% in the control group after 48 h postinfection.T-Cell Activations Induced by rFlu-huCTLA4 In VivoBALB/c mice were used to construct a subcutaneous tumor-bearing model of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma H22 cells to detect the systemic antitumor immune response. The involvement of cytotoxic T cells (CTL, CD8+ T cells) and helper T cells (CD4+ T cells) is the most critical factor in tumor immunotherapy. CD8+ T cells can be targeted to kill cancer cells, while CD4+ T cells can maintain and enhance the underlying immune function. In addition, CD69+ is the earliest induced cell surface glycoprotein, which is the early activation state of T cells and participates in T-cell immune activities. Spleen is an important immunomodulatory organ in the body and contains a large number of lymphocytes, which can be used to detect T-cell activation status. Thus, T-cell activation in the spleen was further analyzed on day 7 after the last drug treatment. The percentage of CD8+ CD69+ T cells in the spleen of mice was examined and analyzed with flow cytometry. Results showed that the percentage of CD4+ CD69+ T cells in the spleen of rFlu-huCTLA4-treated mice increased significantly to 38.7%, which was higher than that in PBS- (16.8%) or PR8-treated (18.4%) mice. Meanwhile, the rFlu-huCTLA4 treatment effectively increased the percentage of CD4+ CD69+ T cells in the rFlu-huCTLA4 treatment group (Figures 4A, B). As shown in Figures 4C, D, the percentage of CD8+ CD69+ T cells in the spleen of rFlu-huCTLA4-treated mice increased significantly to 23.9%, which was higher than that in PBS- (7.55%) or PR8-treated (12.4%) mice. Neither PBS injection nor PR8 treatment promoted the activation of CD8+ CTL in the spleen. These results showed that T-cell infiltration in the spleen of mice was enhanced and activated after rFlu-huCTLA4 treatment.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 rFlu-huCTLA4 caused potential cancer immunotherapy in the H22 cell tumor-bearing model. Flow cytometric analysis of infiltrated CD4+CD69+ T cells (A, B) and CD8+ CD69+ T cells (C, D) in the spleen of the tumor-bearing BALB/c mice with rFlu-huCTLA4 treatment. The percentage of CD4+ CD69+ T cells and CD8+ CD69+ T cells in the spleen of tumor-carrying BALB/c mice treated with rFlu-huCTLA4 was higher than that of the PBS group and PR8 group. (***P<0.001).Pathological Changes of the Tumor-Bearing Model of Mice Treated With rFlu-huCTLA4After 7 days of the last inoculation, the liver, lung, and tumor tissues of mice were isolated and the tumor tissue sizes of each group were compared. We found that the tumor sizes in the rFlu-huCTLA group were significantly smaller than those of the PBS and PR8 groups (Figures 5A, B). The liver, lung, and tumor tissues of the mice were stained with pathological HE staining, and the results are shown in Figure 5C. As expected, no viral load was detected in all tissues of mice in the PBS control group. Meanwhile, we performed HE staining of the tumor tissue of mice and found that tumor sites in the rFlu-huCTLA4 group exhibited significant necrosis, with pyknosis and fragmentation of nuclei and more chronic inflammatory cell infiltration into the interstitium. On the contrary, no obvious cancer cell necrosis was observed in the tumor site of mice in the PBS group and the PR8 group.FIGURE 5 Figure 5 The tumor was isolated and the pathological changes observed. (A, B) After 7 days of inoculation, the tumor tissue of mice was isolated, and the tumor tissue of the rFlu-huCTLA4 group was significantly smaller than that of the PBS and PR8 group. (C) After being inoculated with rFlu-huCTLA4, obvious necrosis and dissolution were observed in tumor pathological sections of mice, and no abnormality was observed in liver and lung tissues. Also, there was no significant change in PBS and PR8 groups. (**p<0.01).Oncolytic Effect of rFlu-huCTLA4 Virus in the PDX ModelAs seen in Figure 6A, the tumor volume of PDX mice inoculated with PBS or rFlu-huCTLA4 was measured every 2 days. The tumor volume of mice in the rFlu-huCTLA4 group increased more slowly than that of the PBS group. After 40 days post administration, there was a significant difference in tumor volume of mice between the control group and the experimental group (p < 0.01). The tumor volume and weight of the rFlu-huCTLA4 group were significantly smaller than those of the control group (Figures 6B, C). The high viral load was detected in the tumor tissues of mice in the rFlu-huCTLA4 group, whereas no virus was found in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, or brain tissues (Figure 6D). The results showed that rFlu-huCTLA4 could significantly decrease the tumor volume and weight in the liver cancer PDX animal model as indicated by higher viral loads and obvious pathological alterations.FIGURE 6 Figure 6 Oncolytic effect of recombinant virus rFlu-huCTLA4 in vivo. (A) PBS, PR8, and rFlu-huCTLA4 were injected respectively. The tumor volume was measured every 2 days, and the difference was significant (p < 0.01). rFlu-huCTLA4 could significantly inhibit the growth of the tumor. (B) 40 days later, the PDX mice were killed, tumors were isolated, and tumor volume was measured. rFlu-huCTLA4 significantly inhibited tumor volume growth. (C) Weighing the tumor, rFlu-huCTLA4 significantly inhibited tumor weight growth. (D) The heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and tumor tissue were isolated and viral load measured. (**P<0.01,***P<0.001).DiscussionAlthough there are many clinical treatment strategies for liver cancer, the efficacy of these drugs is still far from satisfactory due to many reasons: (1) the occultness of liver cancer, the late stage when it is discovered; (2) individual differences in patients’ sensitivity to drugs; and (3) drug resistance of molecularly targeted drugs and other reasons. Researchers have focused on the immunotherapy of liver cancer. To enhance the sensitivity of the body to targeted drugs such as sorafenib, they have made various attempts and made some progresses, but there is still a gap from bench to clinical application (30, 31).OVs are a novel oncologic agent with considerable flexibility that could induce tumor cell death while promoting congenital and tumor-specific adaptive immune responses (32). Up to now, four oncolytic virus products have been approved worldwide, and approximately 180 oncolytic virus projects are under development worldwide (https://ClinicalTrials.gov). CTLA4 plays a key role in regulating immune response and inducing self-tolerance. CTLA4 controls T-cell activation in several ways, which is important for protecting autoimmunity (33). This inhibitory molecule defends autoimmunity not only by inhibiting the activation and function of autoreactive T cells but also by inhibiting the differentiation of Th17 and promoting the proliferation of Treg cells (34). Therefore, the CTLA4 pathway regulates the balance between autoreactive T cells and Treg, and the decrease of CTLA4 expression or function may lead to the occurrence of autoimmune diseases (35, 36). The CTLA4 antibody can effectively block the expression of CTLA4, can effectively and specifically inhibit cellular and humoral immune responses in vitro and in vivo, with very low toxicity, and is considered a promising new immunosuppressive drug (37). In particular, ipilimumab approved by the FDA for clinical treatment in the United States has achieved good efficacy in the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma and other tumors (38).At present, the popular accepted explanation for the mechanism of oncolytic viruses is given below. The most of viewpoints are that oncolytic viruses proliferate massively in tumor cells through self-replication to lysis tumor cells and then release more oncolytic viruses to cause the tumor lysis. Then, a large number of virus-pathogen-related molecular patterns (PAMP) and cell-derived DAMPs are released, which attract and activate antigen-presenting cells (APC). The tumor-related antigen is activated, after entering the draining lymph nodes from the periphery, and differentiate into mature DC. The virus antigen was presented through MHC I and class II to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which stimulate the body to produce T-cell responses to produce tumor-specific immune responses for tumor regression. Herein, the mechanism of action of the Flu-huCTLA4 virus selectively killing cancer cells was needed to be explored in our deep investigations, for example, the inclusion of additional mechanistic studies (immune cell depletions, etc.).In this study, we firstly constructed the recombinant PB1 and PA plasmids of influenza virus and successfully rescued the chimeric oncolytic virus carrying the human CTLA4 antibody rFlu-huCTLA4 using reverse genetics. The HA titer of P1-generation rFlu-huCTLA4 was 27~28, and the viral titer was 108~9 TCID50/ml. The chicken embryo passage experiment showed that the HA titer was stable at 28~29 from P1 to P5. The morphology of the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus was consistent with the influenza virus, and the size of the virus was distributed between 80 and 120 nm. ELISA assays showed that the huCTLA4 antibody level in each chicken embryo was 0.45 ± 0.03 g at 72 h post vaccination. The virus titers in HepG2 and MDCK cells began to increase at 12 h, reached the peak value of 27 at 72 h, and decreased to 26 at 96 h postinfection. Flow cytometry displayed that rFlu-huCTLA4 could induce HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, especially at the value of 1 MOI; HepG2 cell apoptosis rates were more significant than those of MIHA cells. The oncolytic virus, rFlu-huCTLA4, has been confirmed to have a clear role in targeting killing of hepatocellular carcinoma by HepG2 cells in vitro. We will explore the broad-spectrum killing effect in Huh7 cells and other types of tumors in our subsequent studies. H22 model mice bearing tumors shows that the rFlu-huCTLA4-treated group activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells in the spleen of mice, suggesting that rFlu-huCTLA4 can trigger the mechanism of immune system activation in vivo. In particular, activation of CD8+ T cells can directly kill targeted cancer cells, which may confer effective antitumor ability with rFlu-huCTLA4. Liver PDX mice showed that the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus could significantly inhibit tumor growth of mice in vivo. Of course, this study has several limitations. For example, the antitumor mechanisms of action of OVs remain to be fully elucidated. Whether the oncolytic virus rFlu-huCTLA4 has a broad-spectrum killing effect on other solid tumor cells remains to be further investigated in the following research. The rFlu-huCTLA4 virus with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in terms of therapeutic efficacy in in vitro and in vivo HCC models warrants further studies in the future. In conclusion, we have successfully generated the rFlu-huCTLA4 virus and confirmed its oncolytic efficacy to target hepatoma cells.OVs will play a critical role in cancer treatment in the future and has a good promising potential in cancer vaccine development. However, there are still some problems faced with clinical application, such as the selection of the optimal virus for oncolytic virus therapy, as well as the optimal dose, route of administration, and regimen which need further research. Another challenge is to optimize the use of oncolytic viruses in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy drugs in oncology therapy to achieve a better clinical therapeutic effect.Data Availability StatementAll datasets generated for this study are included in the article.

These belong to either of two lineage-restricted subsets, cDC1 or cDC2 cells, which have been linked to priming of functionally distinct CD4 T cells. However, recent studies have identified plasticity in cDC2 cells with overlapping functions with cDC1 cells, while the converse has not been reported. We genetically engineered a vaccine adjuvant platform that targeted the cholera toxin A1 (CTA1) ADP-ribosylating enzyme to CD103+ cDC1 and cDC2 cells using a single-chain antibody (scFv) to CD103. Unexpectedly, intranasal immunization with the CTA1-svFcCD103 adjuvant modified cDC1 cells to effectively prime Th17 cells, a function previously limited to cDC2 cells. In fact, cDC2 cells were dispensible, while cDC1 cells, lacking in Batf3−/− mice, were critical. Following intranasal immunizations isolated cDC1 cells from mLN exclusively promoted Rorgt+ T cells and IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 production. Strong CD8 T cell responses through antigen cross presentation by cDC1 cells were also observed. Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed upregulation of Th17-promoting gene signatures in sorted cDC1 cells. Gene expression in isolated cDC2 cells was largely unaffected. Our finding represents a major shift of paradigm as we have documented functional plasticity in cDC1 cells.

These cells are CD11chigh and MHCIIhigh and migrate from the mucosal membrane to the draining lymph node after taking up antigen2. In this way antigen recognition following nasal immunization is mediated by migratory DCs that present processed peptides on MHC I or II molecules to naïve T cells in the T cell zone of the mediastinal lymph node (mLN)3,4,5. On the other hand, in steady state migratory DCs help maintain tolerance via induction of regulatory T cells in the draining lymph node6. Three main populations of migratory DCs have been identified and these belong to the classical DCs (cDCs), which are phenotypically distinct and have been linked to unique APC functions7,8,9. Differential surface expression of CD103 and CD11b provide the basis for lineage separation into CD103+ CD11b−, termed cDC1 cells, and CD103+ CD11b+ or CD103− CD11b+, which are cDC2 double (cDC2DP) or single positive (cDC2SP) cells, respectively. The development of cDC1 and cDC2 cells is strictly controlled by gene expression as pre-DCs develop into these subsets in the bone marrow and they appear to be stable end-stages of differentiation with distinct transcriptional profiles10,3,11,12,13,14 The cDC1 cells, expressing Irf8, Batf3, Id2, and Nfil3 genes, are known to cross-present MHC I-restricted peptides and, hence, stimulate CD8 T cells, but also CD4 T cell priming is effective as Th1 responses are induced15,16,17. The cDC2 cells, expressing Irf4, Sirpα, and Zeb2 genes, on the other hand, can be divided into Klf4- or Notch2-dependent functional subsets and these prime CD4 T cells and promote Th2 and Tfh/Th17 differentiation, respectively11,14,16,18,19. Thus, immune responses against infection can be dependent on access to a specific cDC-subset in the tissues and, for example, protection against Toxoplasma gondii or Schistosoma manosni parasite infections require cDC1 and cDC2 cells, respectively20,21. Moreover, studies of protection against C. rodentium showed that cDC2 cells are required for IL-23 production whereas this function could not be replaced by cDC1 cells, supporting the notion that cDC1 cells are largely non-reduntant with cDC2 cells22. On the other hand tissue localization and environmental cues may define cDC-subset functions, because, for example, Th2 responses were stimulated by cDC2DP cells in the small intestine, while this was done by cDC2SP cells in the colon12,21. A recent study indicated that cDC2 subsets can change APC-function following adjuvant modulation23. It was demonstrated that cAMP-inducing agents, such as cholera toxin (CT) adjuvant, caused plasticity in Klf4-dependent cDC2 cells by repressing Irf4-expression, leading to a Th17- rather than Th2-promoting activity, a function normally associated with Notch2-expressing cDC2DP cells16,23,24. Moreover, cDC2 cells expressing Tbet have been reported to support Th1 cell development, which speaks in favor of functional plasticity in the cDC2 subset12. By contrast, functional plasticity was not observed with cDC1 cells following exposure to cAMP-inducing substances23. Thus, our current understanding of migratory cDCs is that they exhibit strict lineage commitment, but it appears that functional plasticity exist only among cDC2 cells, whereas it has not been described for cDC1 cells. So, for example, no study has demonstrated that cDC1 cells can induce Th17 responses, albeit Zelante et al reported that lung CD103+ DCs could prime Th17 cells, but no distinction between cDC1 and cDC2DP cells was made25.To improve vaccine efficacy different strategies have been employed and efforts have focused on targeting vaccines to DCs26. The targeting has been achieved in many different ways, employing specific targeting elements, such as lectins or specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs), or different antigen formulations, of which nanoparticles are a good example27,28. Whereas, the nanoparticles most often do not secure binding to a specific subset of DCs, conjugation of antigens to anti-CD103 or DEC205- Mabs can achieve selective targeting to cDC-subsets5,29,30,31. However, to be effective at priming of T cells most of the targeting strategies have required complementing toll like receptor (TLR)-ligand or anti-CD40 Mab stimulation32. Hence, targeting of vaccines to cDCs has not been found sufficient for improving vaccine efficacy without employing added adjuvant capacity to the formulation.We have previously developed a fusion protein that accommodates the adjuvant activity of the enzymatically active CTA1-subunit of CT and a dimer of a D-targeting moiety, derived from Staphylococcus aureus proteinA33. The CTA1-DD adjuvant was developed to circumvent the toxic side effects of CT, including the accumulation in the brain that is associated with facial nerve paralysis following intranasal administration34. This fusion protein exerts comparable adjuvant effects to those found with intact CT35. In particular when given intranasally (i.n) CTA1-DD strongly augments cell-mediated as well as humoral immune responses4. Antigenic epitopes coupled or genetically fused to the CTA1-DD fusion protein or simply admixed with the adjuvant acquire strongly enhanced immunogenicity36. For example, the CTA1-3M2e-DD fusion protein, which carries the influenza M2e peptide, when given i.n, stimulates strong heterosubtypic protection against influenza virus infection37. The present study was undertaken to unravel how targeting of the adjuvant active CTA1-enzyme to CD103+ DCs could influence the immune response and which cDC subsets are responsible for the adjuvant effect. The choice of CD103-targeting was based on the fact that this membrane molecule allows for effective antigen uptake into the cDC and that it could potentially bind to both the cDC1 and cDC2DP subsets29. Therefore, we designed and expressed new fusion proteins with a single-chain antibody specific for CD103 (scFvCD103). The CTA1-scFvCD103 platform was then equipped with well defined peptides that were genetically fused into the molecule (CTA1-peptide-CD103) and used to analyze the peptide-specific T cell responses. This way we can now provide compelling evidence that CTA1 targeted to CD103+ cDCs changes the function of cDC1 cells to effectively prime for Th17 responses.ResultsThe CTA1-CD103 fusion protein binds specifically to CD103+ dendritic cellsTo achieve targeting of the CTA1-adjuvant to cDCs we fused the CTA1-encoding gene to the scFvCD103 gene and also incorporated gene segments encoding the MHC class I and/or class II-restricted peptides from ovalbumin; the SIINFEKL (I)- and/or p323 (II)-peptides, respectively (Fig. 1a, b)35. These constructs were then compared to our original CTA1-DD constructs, carrying the same inserted peptides, with regard to their ADP-ribosylating ability. We found that both the CTA1-II-CD103 and the CTA1-II-DD constructs exerted ADP-ribosylation, fully compatible with that of the CT-holotoxin (Fig. 1c). As expected, the CTA1R9K-mutation in both constructs obliterated the enzymatic activity completely (Fig. 1c)33. The binding-specificity of the fusion proteins to CD103+ DCs was assessed by using flow cytometry of migratory DCs (CD11chighMHC IIhigh) isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) from wild-type (WT) or CD103−/− mice. Both -DD and -CD103 targeted constructs bound migratory DCs, but the CTA1-II-CD103 fusion protein failed to bind DCs from CD103−/− mice (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1). Of note, the CD103-constructs bound more effectively to CD103+ DCs than -DD constructs (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, freshly isolated DCs from the mLNs demonstrated binding of -CD103 constructs to both cDC1 (CD103+CD11b−) and cDC2 double-positive (cDC2DP)(CD103+CD11b+) subsets, while -DD constructs in addition bound cDC2 single positive (cDC2SP)(CD103- CD11b+) cells (Fig. 1e). Again the CD103-targeted construct bound better to cDC1- than to cDC2DP cells, because of higher density of CD103 molecules on cDC1 cells, and more effectively than -DD fusion proteins (Fig. 1e). No binding to B cells in the mLN was observed, demonstrating that these CTA1-adjuvants, indeed, targeted migratory cDCs and preferentially cDC1 cells (Fig. 1e).Fig. 1: The scFv CD103 fusion protein specifically binds CD103+ DCs populations.Schematic representation and in silico model of the adjuvant active fusion proteins; CTA1-II-DD, CTA1-I/II-DD, CTA1-II-CD103, and CTA1-I/II-CD103 molecules, carrying the MHC I-restricted SIINFEKL-peptide and/or class II-restricted p323-peptide from ovalbumin (a).

The ADP-ribosylating activity of CT holotoxin and the CTA1-enzyme or mutant CTA1R7K in the respective fusion proteins as assessed by the agmatine in vitro test. (c). Binding-specificity of the fusion proteins was assessed in vitro by gating on migratory DCs (MHC IIhigh CD11chigh) from mesenteric LN (MLN) from WT or CD103−/− C57Bl/6 mice and flow cytometry with labeled DC-relevant Mabs (CD11c, MHC-II, CD103, CD11b) and labeled anti-Flag Mab to detect the fusion proteins used at 1 μM conc (d). Similar to D, but this in vitro analysis used WT migratory DCs or B cells (CD19+) from mediastinal LN (mLN) to assess the ability of the fusion proteins (MFI of labeled anti-Flag Mabs) at 1 and 0.1 μM concentrations to bind the different DC-subsets; CD103+CD11b−, CD103+CD11b+, CD103−CD11b+ or B cells using flow cytometry (e). Results are representative of three independent experiments with mean values±SD for means of triplicate cultures (d, e). Statistical significance was calculated using student t test with p value * p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Full size imageCD8 T cell responses and cytotoxicity are enhanced by the CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvantBecause cDC1 cells (CD103+CD11b−) are known to cross-present and prime MHC class I-restricted CD8 T cell responses we investigated whether the CTA1-I/II-CD103 and CTA1-I/II-DD fusion proteins could stimulate SIINFEKL-specific CD8 T cell responses7. To this end C57Bl6 mice (Ly5.2+) were adoptively transferred with OT I T cells (Ly5.1+) that were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) prior to i.v injections. Firstly we identified to what extent targeted migratory CD103+ CD11b− DCs in the mLN carried SIINFEKL-peptide following i.n immunizations. We found that CD103-targeting of the CTA1-adjuvant induced a threefold higher surface expression of the SIINFEKL/MHC I complex in cDC1 cells compared to that provided by DD-fusion proteins, as assessed by flow cytometry and a labeled SIINFEKL/MHC I complex-specific Mab (Fig. 2a). Subsequently, we observed that priming of OT I cells was also more effective in the draining mLN following i.n immunizations with CD103- as compared to DD-constructs (Fig. 2b). We found that 90% of the OT I cells were primed, whereas an equimolar dose of the DD-construct was less effective, albeit much more effective than an equimolar dose of ovalbumin (Fig. 2b). The more effective priming of OT I cells resulted in higher frequencies of IFNγ-producing cells and enhanced cytotoxicity in vivo, as assessed by dividing the number of labeled target cells with control cells lacking the SIINFEKL-peptide (Fig. 2c, d). Intranasal immunizations with CTA1-II-CD103, without the SIINFEKL peptide, failed to stimulate cytotoxicity in OT I cells (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2: The CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant acts through cross-presenting cDC1 cells effectively priming CD8 T cells and CTLs.C57Bl/6 mice were i.n. administered with 5μM of OVA, CTA1-I/II-DD or CTA1-I/II-CD103, and 20 h later the frequency of migrating CD103+ CD11b− cDC1 cells expressing SIINFEKL-peptide + MHC I complexes in the mLN was assessed using flow cytometry and a labeled complex-specific Mab and an isotype control Mab. MFI values are given as means±SD of three independent experiments (a). An adoptive transfer model with CFSE-labeled OT-I TCR Tg donor CD8 T cells (CD45.1+) injected into WT C57Bl/6 (CD45.2+) mice followed by a single i.n priming immunization with an equimolar dose (SIINFEKL peptide) of ovalbumin (OVA), CTA1-I/II-DD or CTA1-I/II-CD103. At 4 days post-immunization CD45.1+ OT I CD8 T cell proliferation was assessed in freshly isolated mLN cells by flow cytometry. The CFSE-dilution profiles were determined and values are given as the mean frequency ± SD of proliferating OT I cells of all CD8 T cells, proliferation index, and frequency of responding OT I CD8 T cells, as indicated (see M & M section) Representative dot-blots of three independent experiments giving similar results and values are given as means ± SD of 3–5 mice in each group (b). Determination of SIINFEKL-specific IFNy-ELISPOTs in OT I CD8 T cells stimulated with recall ovalbumin at 5 days following i.n immunizations with the fusion proteins.

Induction of CTL responses in C57BL6 mice following i.n. immunization with a 5 μM dose of OVA, CTA1-I/II-DD, CTA1-I/II-DD, or CTA1- II-CD103 (control w/o SIINFEKL peptide) fusion protein. After 1 week mice were injected i.v. with CFSE-labeled splenocytes pulsed with 1 μM SIINFEKL peptide (Target cells) or un treated control splenocytes (Bystander cells). After 20 h freshly isolated mLN (mediastinal lymph node) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for specific lysis of peptide expressing target cells . Values are means ± SD of two independent experiments giving similar results with 2–3 mice per group (d). Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test (a, b, c) or Student’s t test (d). ns; not significant; p values *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageCD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant augments protection against influenza virus infectionNext we evaluated the adjuvant ability of the CTA1-enzyme when CD103- or DD-fusion proteins were used for i.n immunizations of Balb/c mice against influenza virus infections38. We have previously established that i.n immunizations with the CTA1-M2e-DD fusion protein effectively stimulate M2e-specific lung resident memory Th17 cells, which provided strong heterosubtypic protection against a live influenza virus challenge infection, while CTA1-DD adjuvant alone did not protect37. To this end we developed a CTA1-M2e-CD103 fusion protein to compare the protective properties of CD103- and DD-fusion proteins. In initial experiments using flow cytometry we tested the binding ability of M2e-constructs to isolated cDC-subsets from mLN and observed very similar binding properties to those we observed with the OVA-peptide carrying constructs, and, again, we identified a higher binding of the CD103-constructs to cDC1 cells (Figs. 3a, 1e). Following i.n immunizations in Balb/c mice we found that CD103-targeting was much superior to the DD-constructs in preventing a lethal influenza virus infection (Fig. 3b). Indeed, while 100% of the mice survived after i.n immunizations with CTA1-M2e-CD103 only 40% survived infection with the highly virulent A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) strain (4 × LD50 dose) in the CTA1-M2e-DD immunized group (Fig. 3b). The stronger protection correlated with a higher frequency of M2e-tetramer binding Th17 cells (rorγt+) in the lungs in CD103- compared to DD- fusion protein immunized and challenged mice (Fig. 3c). As previously documented no M2e-specific CD8 T cells or Th1 cells were stimulated by the i.n immunization and a significant proportion of the M2e-specific Th17 cells were CD44+, CD11a+ and CD69+, indicative of lung resident memory cells, as we recently reported (Fig. 3c) 38,39,40. By contrast, no difference between specific serum anti-M2e IgG or local bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) IgA antibody titers was detected in -CD103 and -DD- fusion protein immunized mice (Fig. 3b). Neither did testing of functionality in M2e-specific serum IgG antibodies, using an established cell-based ELISA as a replacement for assessing ADCC capacity, show a difference between -CD103 and -DD constructs (Supplementary Fig. 2A)41,42 Thus, it appeared that CD103-targeting was more effective than DD-constructs at promoting M2e-specific lung Th17-responses, which was associated with better protection against a live influenza virus infection, a mechanism partly dependent on IL-17 production, as demonstrated in our previous publications (Omokanye et al MI 2022) 37.Fig. 3: M2e-tetramer specific CD4 T cell protection against influenza virus infection following i.n immunizations with CTA1-M2e-CD103 fusion protein.Assessment of the binding ability of the M2e-specific fusion proteins -CD103 and -DD at 1 μM to bind to the three DC-subsets freshly isolated from mLN of Balb/c mice; CD103+CD11b− (cDC1), CD103+CD11b+ (cDC2DP), CD103-CD11b+ (cDC2SP) in vitro using a labeled anti-Flag antibody to detect MFI of the bound fusion proteins to the different cDC subset populations as determined by flow cytometry (a). Balb/c mice were i.n immunized three times with 5μM of CTA1-M2e-CD103 (n = 10) or CTA1-M2e-DD (n = 10) and immune protection was determined 3 weeks after the final immunization by a live challenge infection with 4× LD50 of a highly virulent mouse-adapted PR8 strain37. The frequency of surviving animals and changes in body weight was monitored over time. Anti-M2e IgG2a (most protective antibodies) in serum and IgA in BAL after the challenge infection in one representative experiment of three giving similar results was assessed by ELISA and given as log10 titers ± SD (b). Representative FACS plots of M2e-tetramer-specific lung CD4 T cells isolated from i.n immunized or naïve control mice, as indicated. Prior to the challenge infection, the frequency of M2e-specific CD4 T cells that were CD69+ or CD69- and the representation of Th17 cells (rorγt+) is given as % ± SD of all M2e-specific CD4 T cells (n = 3). Results are from three independent experiments giving similar results (c). Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 post-test analysis: ns; not significant, p values **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageTo extend the analysis we went on to compare the adjuvant efficacy of the -CD103-and -DD-based fusion proteins, using a fixed dose of soluble protein antigen, tetanus toxoid (TT) or NP-chicken gammaglobulin (NP-CGG) and decreasing doses of admixed adjuvant. In contrast to the M2e-specific responses these admixed protein immunogens together with CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant gave between 35 and 100-fold stronger antibody responses than -DD constructs (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Interestingly, even a dose as low as 0.014 μM of CD103-adjuvant was effective (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Therefore, we concluded that the CD103-targeting strategy for CTA1-adjuvant appeared significantly more efficacious at augmenting immunogenicity of admixed proteins compared to targeting with DD-constructs.Enhanced priming of Th17 cells in draining lymph nodes following i.n immunization with CD103-targeted fusion proteinsTo follow up with a more detailed investigation of Th17-priming after i.n immunizations we employed ovalbumin-specific (p323) OT II TCR transgenic CD4 T cells in an adoptive transfer model43. Similar to the M2e-specific CD4 T cell response, experiments with OT II cells confirmed that CD103-targeting of the CTA1-adjuvant effectively stimulated CD4 T cell proliferation in vivo (Fig. 4a). As expected, an enzymatically inactive mutant CTA1-molecule (CTA1R9K-II-CD103) was ineffective at stimulating OT II cell proliferation, in agreement with our previous studies (Fig. 4a)37. Noteworthy, the CD103-targeting itself did not exert adjuvant functions, attesting to that it was the enzymatic activity of CTA1 that was crucial for adjuvanticity. Interestingly, CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant was more effective at retaining a strong priming ability even at 4 days following immunization (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the CD103-targeted fusion protein effectively promoted a Th17 cell response in OT II cells in the mLN, albeit Tbet+ Th1 cells were also induced (Fig. 4c). Also Th2 and Tfh cells were induced but less frequent than in OVA-only or DD-construct immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). Roughly 65% of the CD4 T cells were Th17 cells while Th1, Th2 and Tfh cells together comprised 35% (Supplementary Fig. 3D). ELISPOT-detection of IL-17 SFC or cytokine assessments in culture supernatants from isolated OT II cells from mLN of i.n immunized mice confirmed a strong IL-17A response, while IFNγ producing cells were 3-fold lower, but still augmented compared to an equimolar dose of ovalbumin (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 3C). A complementing gene expression analysis of isolated OT II cells from mLN of fusion protein i.n immunized mice attested to a prominent Th17 cell mRNA signature with upregulated expression of rorc, rora, IL-17a, and IL-22 compared to that found with OT II cells from OVA-only immunized mice (Fig. 4e)44. Taken together, CD103-targeting of the CTA1-adjuvant favored Th17 cell differentiation in mLN following i.n immunizations.Fig. 4: The CD103-targeted adjuvant effectively primes Th17 cells following i.n immunizations.Adoptive transfer i.v of CFSE-labeled OT II TCR Tg CD4 T cells (CD45.1+) to WT C57Bl/6 mice (CD45.2+) was followed by a single i.n immunization with 5 μM OVA, CTA1-II-DD or CTA1-II-CD103 the next day (equimolar doses of p323). On day 5 mice (n = 5) were analyzed for OT II cell proliferation in the mLN (mediastinal lymph node) by assessing the dilution of CFSE-label by flow cytometry. The enzymatically inactive CTA1R9K-II-CD103 fusion protein was evaluated for its adjuvant activity. The frequency of expanding OTII cells of all CD4 T cells is given as mean % ±SD of 3–5 mice in each group and pooled data from three independent experiments is shown. a The ability to prime OT II CD4 T cells in the draining mLN at different days post-immunization was assessed as in a. OTII cells were injected i.v. on days 1, 4, or 8 after i.n immunizations with the fusion proteins and values are given as means ±SD of 5 mice in each group (n = 2) (b). The differentiation into Th17 or Th1 OT II cells in the mLN following i.n immunization is given as the frequency of rorγt+, CCR6+ or Tbet+ of all OT II CD4 T cells. Values in each category are given as mean % ±SD of all OT II cells, as indicated, and these are representative of three independent experiments with 2–6 mice in each group (c). IL-17A and IFNγ-specific ELISPOT analysis of OT II CD4 T cell recall responses to p323 peptide was performed in triplicates by freshly isolated mLN cells following a single i.n immunization of the respective fusion protein.Values are given as mean±SD SFC/105 cells of three independent experiments with 3-5 mice per group (d). Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest (a, b) or Student’s t test (c). p values are given as; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. Finally, OT II cells from i.n immunized mice were subjected to a total RNAseq analysis using pooled samples from mLN from three mice. The heat map shows relative expression of Th17-relevant genes (rorc, rora, IL-17a, IL-22, Ccr6) in the different groups; OVA, CTA1-I/II-CD103 and CTA1-I/II-DD. This is a representative analysis of two independent experiments giving similar results (e).Full size imageThe CTA1-adjuvant is acting through cDC1 cells in CD103-targeted fusion proteinsTo address which subset of CD103+ DCs, cDC1 or cDC2DP cells, that the CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant was acting through we undertook experiments in genetically defined mice lacking distinct cDC subsets. To this end we employed Batf3−/− mice, lacking cDC1 cells, and huCD207/DTA mice, which have been found to be deficient in cDC2DP cells in the small intestinal lamina propria (LP) and MLN45,46. In addition, CD103-/- and WT C57Bl/6 mice were also included in the analysis. We confirmed that Batf3−/− mice lack cDC1 cells in the mLN and the huCD207/DTA mice did not have cDC2DP cells in the migratory cDC populations at this inductive site (Fig. 5a). Conversely, Batf3−/− mice had migratory cDC2DP cells and huCD207/DTA mice had intact cDC1 (XCR1+CD11b−) cells in the mLN (Fig. 5a). Moreover, CD103−/− mice had cDC1 (XCR1+CD103-) cells in the mLN. The cDC2SP (CD103-CD11b+) DC subset was present in all three mouse strains (Fig. 5a). We predicted that if the CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant was dependent on the cCD1 cells it would not work in Batf3-/- nor in CD103−/− mice for priming of OT II T cells. Following a single i.n immunization after adoptive transfer of OT II CD4 T cells we found that, indeed, CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant failed to stimulate OT II T cells in Batf3−/− as well as in CD103−/− mice (Fig. 5b). Whereas DD-constructs effectively primed OT II CD4 T cells in CD103−/− mice, they, unexpectedly, failed to do this in Batf3−/− mice, suggesting that also DD-constructs preferentially mediated their priming activity through cDC1 cells (Fig. 5b). Importantly, when CT or LPS + CpG adjuvants were used in Batf3−/− mice the proliferative response in OT II cells to i.n immunizations with OVA was significant, attesting to that cDC2-mediated CD4 T cell priming appeared intact in these mice (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 4a)47. Moreover, both CTA1-adjuvants effectively primed OT II CD4 T cells in the absence of cDC2DP cells in the huCD207/DTA mice (Fig. 5b). The dependence on cDC1 cells was further confirmed in bone marrow (BM) chimeric littermate WT mice (50% Batf3−/− and 50% CD103−/− or WT BM) that hosted both cDC1 and cDC2 cells, but lacked expression of CD103 on cDC1 cells (Fig. 5c). In these mice DD-constructs were effective, while -CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant failed to function (Fig. 5c). With regard to cross-presentation we found that, priming of OT I CD8 T cells was lost in Batf3−/− mice with both CD103- and DD-targeted SIINFEKL-carrying constructs (Fig. 5d). Taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrated that the targeted CTA1-adjuvants mediated their enhanced priming effects on CD4 T cells through cDC1 cells, while cDC2DP and cDC2SP cells appeared to be dispensible.Fig. 5: The CTA1-II-CD103 adjuvant effect is mediated via cDC1 cells.Mice with different restrictions in their DC-subset repertoire were immunized i.n following adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled OT II cells (CD45.1+) according to the protocol used for Fig. 4. WT C57BL/6, transgenic CD103−/−, BATF3−/− or huCD207/DTA mice and littermate controls were immunized with 5 μM CTA1-II-DD (blue) or CTA1-II-CD103 (red) and migratory DCs (MHChigh, CD11chigh) and OT II cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry after 20 h (cDCs) and 4 days (OT II cells), respectively. DC-subsets were identified using Mabs specific for CD103, CD11b and XCR1, as indicated. Representative dot-blots of DCs in mLN (mediastinal lymph node) following i.n immunizations are given for each mouse strain (a). OT II cell proliferation (dilution of CFSE labeling) was determined following a single i.n immunization and values are given as mean % ±SD of OT II cells of all isolated CD4 T cells in the respective group (n = 3–5) and representative of three independent experiments giving similar results . Control experiments in Batf3−/− mice for detection of cDC2-mediated OT II cell priming using OVA + CT- or LPS+CpG adjuvants given i.n (right panel). Values represent % OT II cells undergoing significant proliferation in response to adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted (PBS) responses to OVA (Histograms in Supplementary Fig. 4A (b). Bone marrow chimeric cDC1 (CD103−/−) and cDC2 (CD103+/+) mice were generated by reconstituting irradiated littermate C57Bl/6 mice with 50/50% BM from Batf3−/− and CD103-/- or WT mice (7.5 million BM cells /per mouse). The distribution of XCR1+ cells among cDC1 cells from reconstitutions with CD103−/− or WT BM (n = 4) is shown in the dot-blot. Following adoptive transfer of OT II cells (CD45.1+) into the chimeric mice and i.n immunizations as in a we show mean % ±SD of responding OT II cells of all isolated CD4 T cells in mLN of the respective group (n = 3–5) in two independent experiments (c). Adoptive transfer of OT I cells into mice with different cDC-deficiencies as in a, followed by i.n immunization with the fusion proteins and assessments of the efficiency of cross-presentation and priming of MHC class I restricted CD8 T cell responses. OT I cell (CD45.1+) responses were determined and values are given as mean % ±SD of all isolated CD8 T cells in the respective group (n = 3–5); pooled data from three independent experiments giving similar results (d). Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest and p values are given as; * p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageIsolated cDC1 cells from intranasally immunized mice effectively induce Th17 cell differentiation ex vivoBecause of the outcome of these in vivo experiments we turned to more rigorously controlled in vitro experiments. Given that our results suggested that cDC1 cells were mediating the effect of CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant we asked if highly enriched migratory cDC1 cells from the mLN following i.n immunization could drive OT II CD4 T cell proliferation and Th17 differentiation ex vivo (Fig. 6a). Indeed, only cDC1 cells from immunized mice stimulated cell division (CFSE-dilution) and Th17 (rorγt+) cell differentiation, whereas cDC1 cells from unimmunized mice failed to do so (Fig. 6b). Thus, only cDC1 cells exposed to the fusion protein in vivo could activate the OT II cells, strongly supporting the observations in WT and Batf3−/− mice that cDC1 cells are the critical mediators of Th17 responses in our model system. Importantly, we observed no Tbet+ OT II CD4 T cells in the cultures and no IFNγ was produced (Fig. 6c). Rather, enriched cDC1 cells from i.n CTA1-II-CD103 immunized mice stimulated significant levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22, indicative of Th17 cells, as well as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23, cytokines that drive Th17 development (Fig. 6d). In vitro cultures enriched for cDC1 cells from mLN from unimmunized mice developed rorγt+ OT II CD4 T cells only when CTA1-II-CD103 fusion protein was added to the cultures (Supplementary Fig. 4B). In addition, enriched cDC1 cells from mLN together with Eα-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells cultured with Eα-DD antigen and CTA1-II-CD103 or other adjuvants; Poly I:C, LPS and CpG, revealed that only the CTA1-adjuvant induced rorγt+ Th17 cells in vitro (Fig. 6e)5. By contrast, the TLR-dependent adjuvants stimulated IFNγ production, indicative of Th1 (Tbet+) responses, as predicted (Fig. 6e)48. CD4 T cells without co-culture with cDC1 cells failed to respond to the different stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Thus, highly enriched cDC1 cells responded to the ADP-ribosylating CTA1 adjuvant with Th17 priming, while TLR-dependent adjuvants promoted Th1 and IFNγ-responses in vitro.Fig. 6: CTA1-exposed cDC1 cells are potent inducers of Th17 differentiation.Single cell suspensions of immunized or unimmunized mLN (mediastinal lymph node) mononuclear cells were highly enriched (>90%) for cDC1 (CD103+, CD11b−) cells by positive selection using biotinylated XCR1 Mabs at 20 h following an i.n dose of 5 μM CTA1-II-CD103. The enrichment strategy is shown with untreated cDCs from unimmunized mice and sorted cDC1 cells from mLN of immunized mice (a). Enriched migratory cDC1 cells (MHChigh, CD11chigh XCR1+) from unimmunized or immunized mice were incubated in triplicates for 3 days with freshly isolated OT II T cells (1:10) labeled with CFSE and the histogram shows proliferating OT II cells in cultures with cDC1 from immunized or unimmunized mice and values are given as mean % ±SD of pooled cDC1 cells from 3–5 mice in each group and two independent experiments (b). The frequencies are given as mean % ±SD of Th17 (rorγt+) and Th1 (Tbet+) CD4 T cells on day 3 in these cultures of proliferating OT II cells with unimmunized as opposed to immunized cDC1 cells (c). Cytokine production, as indicated, in these cultures with unimmunized or immunized cDC1 cells is given in pg/ml ±SD for each group (d). In vitro triplicates cultures with enriched cDC1 cells from unimmunized mice were co-cultured with naïve Eα-peptide-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells (1:10) and 1 μM Eα-peptide together with or without different adjuvants added simultaneously; CTA1-II-CD103 (1 μM), Poly I:C (10 μg/ml), LPS (10 μg/ml), CpG (2.5 μg/ml) or unstimulated (\), as indicated. The frequency of Rorγt+ or Tbet+ Eα-specific TCR Tg CD4 T cells in cultures was determined on day 3 and the frequency of intracellular IFNγ+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry using labeled specific antibodies. Two independent experiments (I and II) are shown giving similar results (e). Statistical significance was calculated using ANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest and p values are given as; ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageSingle cell RNAseq analysis reveals strong transcriptional impact on cDC1 cells of CTA1-adjuvantWe investigated to what extent migratory DCs changed gene expression profiles as a consequence of CTA1-adjuvant targeting using the 10X Chromium platform and single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) analysis49. To this end C57Bl/6 mice received a single i.n dose of CTA1-II-CD103 or CTA1-II-DD and FACS-sorted migratory DCs in the mLN were subjected to scRNAseq analysis. The gene expression profiles were compared with those of migratory DCs from unimmunized PBS-treated control mice. To secure that we analyzed DCs that had bound the fusion protein we used fusion proteins that carried an Eα-peptide, so that we could identify the targeted cells as they expressed Eα-peptide/MHC II complexes using labeled Yea-Mab (anti-Eα peptide /MHC II complex) and flow cytometry5. This way we exclusively analyzed migratory DCs targeted by CTA1-adjuvant in the mLN and compared their gene expression profiles with those obtained from cDCs from unimmunized PBS-treated control mice. Of note, the isolated control cDCs from unimmunized mice represent naturally activated migratory cells12. After 24 h following i.n administration of 50 μM doses of CTA1-Eα-CD103 or-DD we isolated and FACS-sorted Yea-Mab+ DCs into high purity. After quality control and filtering we used the Seurat R toolkit to perform unsupervised clustering of the DCs based on differentially expressed genes (DEG) and the data was visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) in two dimensions (Fig. 7a, b)50. We analyzed a minimum of 500 cells in each category. The migratory DCs were distributed in five clusters and a distinct separation of cDC1 and cDC2 cells into these clusters was evident using published gene lists defining the subsets (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Fig. 5A, B)12. A striking observation was that migratory cDC1 cells underwent a more dramatic change following binding with CTA1-adjuvant than the corresponding cDC2 cells (Fig. 7a–c). Thus, both CD103- and DD-targeted cDC1 cells were found in clusters 3 and 4, while cDC1 cells from unimmunized mice were restricted to cluster 1 and 2 (Fig. 7a, b). By contrast, cDC2 cells were found in cluster 0 and both CTA1-exposed and control migratory DCs inter-mingled in this cluster (Fig. 7b, c). Hence, the most dramatic shift occured in cDC1 cells, while cDC2 cells appeared less affected by the CTA1-adjuvant. The heat-map of the top 25 differentially regulated genes in migratory DCs from control or CTA1-treated mice also identified that cDC1 cells were the most affected, as evident in clusters 3 and 4 as opposed to gene expression in clusters 1 and 2 (Fig. 7d). Even though -CD103 constructs were found to be more effective than DD-constructs at targeting cDC1 cells, the difference in gene expression profiles was minimal between the two with only Rgs-1, Cd83, Rel and Ccr7 genes differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, both targeting constructs were effective at promoting CTA1-mediated immunomodulation of cDC1 cells, while cDC2 cells were less affected (Fig. 7e). A set of the 10 most significantly DEG were identified in cDC1 cells and these genes were linked to activation and CD4 T cell priming functions (Fig. 7e). Of note, Stat4, Scin and Cytip genes have all been associated with DC activation/migration and Fabp5 gene expression has linked fatty acid metabolism to Th17 differentiation 51,52.Fig. 7: Single-cell RNAseq analysis of migratory DCs in mLN following i.n immunizations with a CD103-targeted adjuvant.Migratory cDC-subsets that had been exposed to a single dose i.n of 50 μM CD103 or -DD constructs with incorporated Eα-peptide were identified by labeled Yea-Mab that binds Eα−peptide + MHC class II (I-Ab)39. This strategy secured that only cDCs exposed to CTA1-adjuvant in vivo were included in the analysis and these were compared to cDCs from unimmunized mice. Migratory cDCs were sorted by FACS and subjected to a scRNAseq analysis using the 10× Chromium platform. Cluster analysis was performed using Seurat and the UMAP-representation of the cDC-subsets from naïve PBS, CTA1-II-DD or CTA1-II-CD103 treated mice is depicted and the cluster or treatment distributions of individual cDCs is given (a, b). Distribution of cDC1 and cDC2 cells among the analyzed cDCs, according to the UMAP, based on cDC1 and cDC2 subset-restricted gene definitions (c). Heat map showing the 25 top DEG in the different clusters of migratory cDCs following immunization (d). Top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in CTA1-exposed (DD- + CD103 constructs) as opposed to unimmunized cDC1 (left panels) and cDC2 subsets (right panels) (e).Full size imageWe generated a pseudotime trajectory of gene expression in cDC1 cells using the Monocle 3 program (Fig. 8a–c)53. This analysis indicated that cDC1 cells had developed a gene expression profile that could represent a transition of function from the unmanipulated cDC1 cells to those exposed to the CTA1-adjuvant (cluster 3 and 4). (Fig. 8a–d). Strikingly, when subsetting on cDC1 cells and applying a selection of critical genes known to be driving Th17 cell differentiation we observed a clear increase in such genes along the pseudotime trajectory (Fig. 8e)54,55. Indeed, genes encoding co-stimulatory and Th17-promoting factors (IL-1b, IL-6, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Tnfsf4 (Ox40L), Tnfrsf9 (CD137) IL-12b (p40), Timd4, Cd80, Cd86) were distinctly up-regulated in adjuvant exposed, as opposed to unimmunized control, cDC1 cells (Fig. 8d, e, Supplementary Fig. 5D). An extended gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using a gene list taken from a publication of human inflammatory DCs, reported to promote Th17 responses, was performed with the list of co-differentially upregulated genes found in CTA1-exposed cCD1 cells55. The GSEA showed significant enrichment of DEG that previously have been linked to Th17 promoting activity (Fig. 8f). To further the analysis, the subsetted cDC1 population was analyzed for genes that change across the pseudotime. Genes were then grouped into modules using Louvain community analysis. Several activation and signaling pathways were involved as the cDC1 transitioned from the PBS cluster state to the most active CTA1-exposed cells (cluster 3) and this was seen with the modules showing most dramatic changes in gene expression (Fig. 8g–h, Supplementary Excel files). For example, modules hosting Stat3, Rel, Irf8, Crem and Stat4 and genes encoding activation, cell adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules (Anxa5, Bhlhe40, Cd86, Cd200, Cytip, Itga4, Flrt3, Scin, Tnfaip8, ox-40l) or genes involved in cell division, motility and survival (Cd81, Cd83, Ccr7, Map4k4) and cytokine and chemokine relevant genes (Anxa2, Il-12b, Map3k14) were significantly up-regulated in CTA1-adjuvant exposed cDC1 cells (cluster 3 and 4), consistent with a strong CD4 T cell and Th17 priming function (Fig. 8i). Furthermore, genes linked to metabolism were upregulated in these modules; Slc27a3, Fabp5 gene, fatty acid metabolism, and Ass1, L-arginine and urea metabolism, Calm1 ans S100a10, involved in calcium metabolism (Fig. 8i)51,52,56,57,58,59. Antigen-cross presentation has been linked to a high expression of Serpinb9, which was clearly up-regulated in cDC1 cells in CTA1-exposed cluster cells (Fig. 8i)60. Thus, exposure to CTA1-adjuvant dramatically changed the gene expression pattern in cDC1 cells leading to stimulatory functions that promoted Th17-differentiation in primed CD4 T cells as well as an improved ability to cross-present and stimulate CD8 T cell responses.Fig. 8: Pseudotime trajectory of differentially regulated genes in CTA1-exposed CD103-targeted cDCs reveals plasticity of cDC1 cells and ability to induce Th17 cells.The continued scRNAseq analysis explored the data set using Monocle 3 with which we established a developmental trajectory of the CTA1-exposed cDC1 cells. The data set from Seurat was analyzed in Monocle 3 and depicted in the UMAP plot (a) and as represented after using the gene signatures of cDC1 and cDC2 cells, as in Fig. 7e (b). We undertook a pseudotime trajectory analysis of the data with starting node in cluster 0 (c). The distribution of cDC1 cells in the UMAP following different i.n immunizations was depicted (d). The expression level of a Th17-promoting gene signature (IL-1b, IL-6, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Tnfsf4(Ox40L), Tnfrsf9(CD137), IL-12b(p40), Timd4, Cd80, Cd86) was employed to follow gene expression from naïve PBS to CTA1-exposed cDC1 cells along the trajectory (e). An extended gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using a gene list taken from a publication of human inflammatory DCs, reported to promote Th17 responses, was compared with the list of co-differentially expressed genes found in CTA1-exposed cDC1 cells55 (f). The distribution of gene modules which significantly vary across pseudotime is depicted (g–h). Selected genes from the modules in g are represented in the trajectory of cDC1 cells (i).Full size imageDiscussionPreviously published studies have indicated that the two lineage-specific cDC-subsets are to be viewed as functionally specialized and largely non-reduntant because the cDC1 subset promotes Th1 cell development and cross-presentation to CD8 T cells, while cDC2 cells are responsible for Th2 and Th17/Tfh cell priming1,10,11,12,16,17,21,61,62. However, the present study challenges this notion by demonstrating that cDC1 cells can, under certain conditions, prime Th17 cells as we show following i.n immunizations with the CTA1-peptide-CD103 fusion protein. We provide unequivocal evidence demonstrating that the CTA1-peptide-CD103 fusion protein, indeed, acts through cDC1 cells and not through cDC2DP cells, albeit the latter cells also express CD103. Several lines of evidence support this interpretation of our results; 1) Batf3-deficient mice, which lack cDC1 cells, fail to respond to the fusion protein, 2) in vitro cultures of naïve CD4 T cells with highly enriched cDC1 cells from i.n immunized mice respond with Th17 development and IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 production, 3) highly enriched cDC1 cells produce IL-1β, Il-6 and IL-23 upon stimulation with the fusion protein in vitro, and finally 4) a scRNAseq analysis of freshly sorted cDC1 and cDC2 cells revealed that cDC1 cells, rather than cDC2 cells, undergo extensive CTA1-enzyme dependent modifications of gene expression, some which have been linked to a Th17 priming function in earlier studies23,51,55,63,64. This ability of CTA1-adjuvant appears to be quite unique as CpG, poly I:C and LPS, exerting their actions via Myd88/TRIF-signaling pathways and different Toll-like receptors (TLRs), promote Th1 differentiation, in agreement with previous reports48,65. The CTA1-adjuvant effect on cDC1 cells was dependent on its ADP-ribosylating ability since an enzymatically inactive mutant did not exert adjuvant function, which we have also reported earlier35. Thus, the present study has unraveled that functional plasticity can be exhibited by cDC1 cells, which were found to prime for Th17 cell differentiation. Using an ADP-ribosylating CD103-targeted CTA1-adjuvant we achieved M2e-specific Th17 differentiation and strong protection against influenza virus infection.In earlier work we targeted antigen to CD103+ APCs via conjugation to anti-CD103 Mab and found that both CD4 and CD8 T cells could be effectively primed29. Exploiting the CD103-targeting element for delivery of a strong mucosal adjuvant, such as CTA1, was, therefore, a natural next step in this strategy. Apart from antigen-delivery we achieved a strong immunoenhancement of the APC function in CD103+ cDC cells, resulting in augmented priming ability of both CD4 and CD8 T cells, without adding a separate adjuvant because the fusion protein itself harnessed the CTA1-adjuvant35. Hence, the fusion protein provided targeting, immunoenhancement and delivery of vaccine epitopes, in one molecule. In agreement with our earlier work with anti-CD103 Mab targeting, the ScFv-approach exhibited strict dependence on CD103-expressing cDCs for its immune stimulating effects29. This was evident from the lack of an effect in CD103−/− mice, and, perhaps, best noted in chimeric mice that hosted cDC1 cells, which were CD103-deficient, and failed to respond. Thus, the target population was restricted to cDC1 and did not depend on cDC2DP cells, despite that the latter carry CD103. In fact, huCD207DTU mice that were deficient in cCD2DP cells in mLN demonstrated full adjuvant and antigenic properties in response to the fusion protein, while Batf3−/−mice, lacking cDC1 cells, did not respond to CD103- or DD-targeting, but reacted to other adjuvants given intranasally 45,46,47.To secure that we investigated migratory cDCs that had bound and taken up the fusion protein following i.n administration we employed FACS-sorting using labeled Yae+ Mab that detects the Eα-peptide on the cDC cell surface5. This way we could identify the exact subset of migratory cDCs that were affected by CTA1-adjuvant and which were instrumental for priming of the CD4 T cells in the draining mLN. Noteworthy, for comparison we sorted migratory cDCs from mLN from unimmunized mice, cells that had been naturally activated and matured, prior to trafficking to the mLN. The scRNAseq analysis was highly revealing and identified a substantial modification of genes expressed in immunized as opposed to unimmunized cDC1 cells, while cDC2 cells were less affected and found within the same cluster in the UMAP. The cDC1 cells from unimmunized mice distributed mainly to clusters 1 and 2, while a majority of CD103-targeted cells were found in clusters 3 and 4. The greater impact on cDC1 cells agreed well with the absolute requirement for cDC1 cells, lost in Batf3-/-, for the adjuvant effect45. Thus, cDC1 cells were distributed in 4 different clusters and a pseudotime trajectory analysis identified significant gene expression changes in CTA1-exposed versus adjuvant-unexposed cDC1 cells. These changes affected genes associated with cell migration, cell signaling and co-stimulation. More specifically, we observed increased expression of genes associated with Th17-priming (IL-1b, IL-6, Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Tnfsf4 (Ox40L), Tnfrsf9 (CD137) IL-12b (p40), Timd4, Cd80, Cd86) along the trajectory in cDC1 cells exposed to CTA1-adjuvant7,55. Strikingly, a GSEA analysis based on gene lists from a previous publication of human inflammatory DC and a Th17-inducing function, supported our interpretation that the cDC1 cells had acquired a Th17 promoting gene signature following CTA1-exposure55. Noteworthy, the gene list used represented inflammatory DC that were thought to be derived from monocytes, genetically more like murine CD11b+ cDC2 cells and not cDC1 cells14,55. But, despite this our comparative analysis showed significant gene enrichment for a Th17-inducing function, similar to the “pro-Th17 gene signature” reported earlier for inflammatory DCs in humans, i.e CD163+DC3s,which are related to cDC2s14,55. Furthermore, the up-regulated expression of IL-1b, IL-6, Tgfb1 and IL-12b (p40) genes we found are clearly linked to a Th17 promoting function by cDCs14,55. Apart from the up-regulated expression of these known Th17-promoting genes we identified several DEG typifying activated cDCs1,54,55. For example, up-regulated expression of Stat3, Stat4, Cytip, Scin, Ccr7, Anxa2, Cd86 and Cd81 genes are all hallmarks of highly activated DCs and could greatly contribute to an enhanced T cell priming efficacy by facilitating cDC1 cell migration and/or antigen presentation in the immune synapse56,58,66,67,68,69. Serpinb9 expression is a marker for antigen-cross presentation by cDC1 cells60. The interaction between tetraspanin CD81 and MHCII molecules is well documented in APCs, although CD81−/− mice have not been investigated for poor Th17 development, only impaired Th2-cell immunity and antibody production, have been reported56,66. Moreover, among the DEGs with strongest association to Th17-development, we find Fabp5, Rel and Ox40L52,70. Expression of Rel links cDC1 cells to the transcription factor NF-kB and signaling events that control IL-23 p19 gene expression and in this way influences Th17 differentiation in CD4 T cells70. The involvement of fatty acid metabolism in Th17 differentiation has been documented before and appears to link DC activity to Stat3-signaling and Th17-differentiation in CD4 T cells51,52. Tnfsf4-expression, encoding OX40L, has been associated with autoimmunity and Th17 cell differentiation, but reported to be expressed only in cDC2 cells and not in cDC1 cells 71,72.We have previously demonstrated that the lung resident M2e-specific Th17 memory cells convey strong protection against influenza virus infection following i.n immunization with CTA1-M2e-DD37. In the present study we improved immunogenicity of the fusion protein by changing the targeting element from DD to scFvCD103 and achieved significantly stronger protection compared to the DD-constructs. This way the efficiency in targeting the fusion protein to cDC1 cells was much improved, although we learned that both the -DD and -CD103 constructs relied on the cDC1 subset for their adjuvant functions. This latter observation was unexpected as cDC2DP cells were also found to bind the fusion proteins, but these cells failed to replace cDC1 cells in Batf3−/− mice. In particular, the -DD constructs, which bound cDC1 and cDC2 cells equally well, were found poorly effective in Batf3−/− mice. Similar to intact CT-adjuvant, both CTA1-fusion proteins were effective at augmenting CD8 T cell priming by cross-presenting cDC1 cells73. This ability has recently been successfully explored by us in a therapeutic vaccine model against tumor metastasis where we observed augmented tumor-specific CTL-induction, which agrees well with previous studies on CD103-targeted vaccine approaches and CT-adjuvant (M. Arabpour et al, unpublished data) 74,75.Functional plasticity in cDCs has previously been observed within the cDC2 lineage subsets and was reported to depend on the level of expression of the Irf4 and Klf4 genes23. While increases in intracellular cAMP repressed these genes and modified the function of cDC2 cells to prime Th17 rather than Th2 responses, there were no modifying effects of cAMP-increases reported in splenic cDC1 cells237. In the present study we found that CT given as an i.n adjuvant was effective in Batf3−/− mice attesting to a cDC2-mediated mechansims of action. By contrast, no dependency on cDC2 cells for the adjuvant effect of the targeted CTA1-adjuvant was observed and Lee et al had no effect of CT or other cAMP-enhancers in cDC1 cells23. Therefore, we may speculate that although CTA1 is the cAMP-inducing element in the CT holotoxin it is probable that the CTA1-fusion protein mediates adjuvanticity in the absence of cAMP-increases. Indeed, preliminary studies have indicated that the effect of the fusion protein may be independent of Gsα-expression and cAMP-induction in CD11c+ cells35. Additional experiments are required, though, to prove this point. Importantly, the CD103-targeting ScFv-element in itself had no adjuvant effect and could not promote Th17 cell development in vitro. This effect was rather a consequence of CTA1-actions on the cDC1 cells, which included enhanced co-stimulation and cytokine production with increased IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 levels in cultured cDC1 cells after exposure to the adjuvant. This was in contrast to the TLR-binding adjuvants, CpG, poly I:C and LPS, which all stimulated Th1 and IFNγ-production and they had no promoting effect on rorγt+ Th17- or IL-17 responses in cultured cDC1 cells48,65. To our knowledge the present study represents a major shift of paradigm as it demonstrates that cDC1 cells show plasticity and under certain conditions, can be inducers of Th17 responses, a function previously thought to be restricted to cDC2 cells. A previous study by Zelante et al documented Th17-inducing ability of lung CD103+ DCs in the context of fungal exposure, but these authors did not discriminate between cDC1 and cDC2 cells and their model for IL-2 producing cDCs, the D1 cell line, expresses cDC11b, rendering this cell the status of a cDC2DP cell25. The present study not only challenges the idea of a functionally non-redundent lineage-restricted cDC1-subset, but it is likely to have fundamental impact on future vaccine adjuvant development and Th17-mediated immune protection, in particular.Materials and methodsMouse strains and immunizationsFemale mice, 6–10 weeks of age, were used for all experiments. C57Bl/6 (CD45.2+) and Balb/c wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from Janvier Labs (Paris, France). OT-II (CD45.1+), OT-I (CD45.1+), Eα-TCR Tg mice76 and Batf 3−/− mice were bred at EBM animal facility at the University of Gothenburg. HuCD207/DTA46 and Itgea (CD103−/−) knock out mice on the C57Bl/ 6 background (were bred at Lund University (Lund, Sweden) and transported to Gothenburg for experiments. Animal experiments were approved by the local Ethics Committee.C57Bl/6 or Balb/c WT mice were immunized i.n with a single dose or three doses with 10 days apart, as indicated. Balb/c mice were used only for influenza virus protection studies because the M2e-peptide is restricted to H-2d37. For comparative studies of adjuvant efficacy between CD103- and DD-constructs immunizations were also performed i.p, as indicated, with admixed soluble antigens; 5 μg 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin (NP-CGG or tetanus toxoid (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark).As alternative adjuvants in Batf3−/− mice we compared the effects of the fusion proteins with ovalbumin (OVA) given together with CT at 1 μg/dose or LPS + CpG at 10 μg doses. Fusion proteins and ovalbumin were given in 5 μM doses, unless stated otherwise. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was sampled 6–8 days after the last immunization or 18 days after inoculation of virus and stored frozen at −20C until analyzed for specific antibody titers by ELISA.Influenza virus challenge infectionImmunized or PBS control Balb/c mice were subjected to a virus challenge infection. Briefly, 2–3 weeks after immunizations groups of ten mice were inoculated with an i.n dose of PR8 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus at 4 × LD50, (corresponding to 2.5 × 103 TCID50). Morbidity (body weight) and mortality were monitored daily for 2 weeks37. Mice were sacrificed when reaching a weight loss >30%.Fusion proteinsCTA1-peptide-CD 103 fusion proteins were produced; Briefly, anti-CD103 single chain antibody (CD103 scFv) cloning and construction was done using regions from both variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) immunoglobulin chains from the anti-CD103 antibody produced by the M290 hybridoma. The desired regions from M290 VH and VL chains were RT-PCR amplified and sequenced. Amplified regions were linked together via the genetic sequence corresponding to the 4 GGGGS linker region to form scFv CD103. This was followed by linking a gene sequence corresponding to the cholera toxin A1 enzyme (CTA1) subunit or its mutated and enzymatically inactive CTA1(R9K) gene sequence which was fused N-terminally of the anti-CD103 scFv fragment. Constructs with peptides incorporated into the fusion proteins were designed as follows; fusion proteins that carried genetic sequences encoding the MHC class II H-2b restricted Eα peptide 52-68 (ASFEAQGALANIAVDKA), the OVA p323 peptide (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR), the MHC class I restricted OVA SIINFEKL peptide and the MHC class II H-2d-restricted influenza virus specific M2e peptide (ETPIRNEWGSR) were engineered and were equipped with Flag-tags. Corresponding fusion proteins with -the DD-dimer instead of the scFvCD103 were expressed with Flag-tags and purified as described before77. The purified material contained no endotoxin (0.1EU per mg of protein), it bound avidly to IgG in solid phase and CTA1 was enzymatically active as determined with the agmatine assay as described77.Adoptive cell transfers and chimeric miceSplenic OT I or OT II T cells from CD45.1+ donor mice were labeled with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Life Technologies) and 1 × 106 T lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into C57Bl/6 (CD45.2+) WT recipient mice. Immunizations were given on day 1 after transfer of cells. Bone marrow (BM) chimeras were made by i.v. transfer of 2 × 106 BM donor cells from Batf3 and CD103-/- or WT mice into irradiated (1000 rad) recipient WT mice. BM reconstitution was achieved by 50/50% BM from Batf3−/− and CD103−/− or WT mice, respectively, so that chimeric mice would have cDC1 cells without (CD103−/−) or with CD103 (WT) expressing cells, while both strains would have cDC2 cells with CD103. Experiments with chimeric mice were initiated at 6 weeks after BM reconstitution.In vitro cell culturescDC–T cell co-cultures were established using highly enriched (>93%) cDCs from mLN taken from immunized or unimmunized WT mice. Briefly, highly enriched cDC1 cells were obtained by stepwise purification using MACS ;involving pan DCs selection (Miltenyi biotec) followed by positive selection with biotin tagged anti-XCR1 beads for maximum cDC1-enrichment (CD103+ CD11b─ DCs) (Stem cell technologies). Purified cDC1s (2 × 104) were then co-cultured (1:10) with autologous, naive OT-II or Eα-TCR Tg CD4 T cells (2 × 105) in 96 well U-bottom plates in IMDM medium containing 10% FCS (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1 mM beta mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml Gentamycin (Gibco) and plated at 2 × 105 cells/well, in the presence or absence of ovalbumin (5μg/ml) or Eα-DD (1 μM) antigen and adjuvants; CTA1-II-CD103 (1 μM), Poly I:C (10 μg/ml), LPS (10 μg/ml) and CpG (2.5 μg/ml) for 48 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. T cell proliferation was determined by flow cytometry using the CFSE-dilution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assay. Cytokine concentrations were determined by ELISA and intracellular staining for IFNγ used labeled anti-IFNγ Mab (BD Biosciences) and flow cytometry for detection.Lymphocytes were isolated from the mLN or lung of immunized or immunized and challenged mice. Briefly, cells from the mLN were isolated by mechanical disruption and lung tissues were enzymatically digested using a kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to obtain single-cell suspensions. Triplicate cultures were performed in 96-well plates (Nunc) and T cell recall responses were allowed 3 days in the presence of medium only or different concentrations of antigen, as indicated in the Figure legends. CD4 T-cell proliferation in vitro used CFSE-labeled OT-I or OT-II cells and cytokine determinations were performed on supernatants.Antibody and cytokine determinationsThe ELISPOT assay was used to determine IL-17 or IFNγ producing cells from isolated mLN or lung lymphocytes. The dual kit for IL-17/IFNγ or single IFNγ spot forming cell (SFC) assessments was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Immuno Spot). Briefly, single cell suspensions of mononuclear cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well and 1 μM of peptide was added and the plates were incubated for 24 h (5% CO2, 37 °C). Cytokine ELISPOTs were evaluated using a CTL ImmunoSpot analyzer. Cytokine determinations using ELISA were used for assessments of cytokines in culture supernatants. Prior to analysis samples were stored at −80 °C until further analyzed. Cytokine concentrations were determined in supernatants by ELISA (Duoset, R&D Systems, UK) and the concentrations of IFNγ, IL22, IL21, IL23, IL6, IL1β and IL-17A was done and given in pg/ml using a standard curve provided by the manufacturer.MDCK and M2CK cells, which are MDCK cells that provide complementation of the M2 protein41,42,78, were seeded in a 96-well plate at 24,000 cells per well. 16 h later, the cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with serial dilutions of serum from individual mice. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS buffer, binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (2000x GE Healthcare NA931V). After washing, TMB substrate (Tetramethylbenzidine, BD OptEIA) was added to every well. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M H2SO4, after which the absorbance at 450 nM was measured with an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio Rad). This assay has been found to correlate well with functional assays of ADCC reactivity 42.Flow cytometryFlow cytometry studies were performed as described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, dead cells were identified by 7-amino-actinomycin D or Live/Dead Aqua LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Staining Kit (Life Technologies). Intracellular FACS stainings were achieved by the Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry used a FACSAriaII or LSRII (BD Biosciences) and cells were analyzed using FlowJo X (Tree Star). Cell sorting of migratory cDC was done using a FACSAriaII (BD). The following fluorophores and conjugated antibodies were used for phenotypic analysis; M2e-specific tetramer-PE and control CLIP-PE and staining was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and followed by labeling on ice with cell surface specific markers for 30 min as follows; CD4 Alexa-700, CD8 AF647, CD3e BUV737, CD45.1 APCe Flour 780, CD69 PE-Cy7 and CD44 FITC. For labeling cDCs, we used CD11c BV421, MHC II (IA-E) Alexa-700, CD11b FITC, CD103 PE, and XCR1. APC AF647, CD19- APC-cy7 and F4/80 BV711 were used for a dump channel. Intracellular staining for detection of transcription factors; Tbet BV421, RORγt PE-CF594, GATA3 PE. T cell proliferation was assessed by CFSE-dilution which applied to both in vivo isolated cells as well as cells from in vitro cultures.In vivo cytotoxicity assayFollowing transfer of 1 × 105 OT I cells i.v. to autologous WT C57Bl/6 mice these were immunized i.n with 5 μM of the fusion proteins 12 h later. Splenocytes were taken from naïve mice and pulsed with SIINFEKL peptide (1 μg/mL peptide). Incubations were done at 4 °C for 1.5 h followed by 37 °C incubation for 30 min. The cells were labeled with CFSE (2 µM) (target cells) or unlabeled Far Red (2 µM)(bystander cells) without adding peptide (negative control); 10 × 106 CFSE and 10 × 106 Far Red labeled splenocytes (20 × 106 cell transfer /mouse) were mixed and transferred to autologous WT recipient mice. After 20 h, mLN and spleens of immunized mice were stained with Live dead aqua dye and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity was then determined by calculating the % killing as a consequence of \(\left( {1 - \left( {\frac{{\% CFSE}}{{\% Far\,Red}}} \right)} \right) \times 100\).Single cell RNAseq and Seurat and Monocle 3 analysisMigratory cDCs (MHC II high CDllc high) from naïve/PBS-treated or i.n fusion protein immunized mice were isolated from mLN from a pool of 7–8 C57Bl/6 mice and FACS -sorted on an Aria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience). cDCs exposed to the fusion proteins were identified on the basis of their expression of the labeled Eα-peptide+ MHC classII -specific Yae Mab. Labeling of cells prior to sorting by flowcytometry (Fusion, BD) included the following specific Mabs Yae, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-B220 and anti-F4/80, as described5. Cells were sorted into IMDM, before being pelleted and resuspended in IMDM-10% FBS. Approximately 5000 sorted celles were loaded on the 10x Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). The scRNA-seq libraries were prepared following the user guide manual provided by the 10X Genomics company. Data from scRNA-seq of DC sorted samples were individually processed using cell ranger analysis pipeline (10X genomics platform) and reads aligned on the mm10 genome assembly. The output form Cell Ranger then further analyzed with Seurat Seurat 3.0. Raw UMI count matrices were loaded and merged into a single Seurat object. Cells were discarded if they met any of the following; percentage of mitochondrial counts greater than 6% per cell, number of unique features either below 200 or above 3500, T cell genes (‘Cd3d’, ‘Cd3e’, ‘Cd3g’, ‘Trac’, ‘Trbc1’, ‘Trbc2’) greater than 0.1 percent and B cell genes (‘Cd79a’, ‘Cd79b’, ‘Ms4a1’, ‘Cd19’), greater than 0.1 percent. Gene counts were log normalized and mean centered and scaled by their standard deviation and the following variables regressed out: the number of UMI and the percentage of mitochondrial counts. Finally, cells were clustered and UMAP applied to further reduce dimensionality for visualization. Differential gene expression was performed using the FindAllMarker function with Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and minimum of 0.25 log fold-change. For analysis using Monocle v3, the Seurat object was imported using the as.cell_data_set function from SeuratWrappers and further processed. Pseudotime analysis was performed using standard settings and with root node selection in cluster 0. Modules of co-regulated genes, differentially expressed across pseudotime, were identified using the function find_gene_modules using a list of Louvain resolution and selecting the one with highest value.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)For GSEA analysis, differentially expressed genes for CTA1 (DD- and CD103) versus PBS in cDC1 population were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test via the wilcoxauc function of the presto package using default parameters (including Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction) and filtered on logFC > 1 and padj < 0.05. GSEA was run on pre-ranked genes using the fgsea package (Korotkevich, G., V. Sukhov, and A. Sergushichev. 2019. Fast gene set enrichment analysis. bioRxiv 060012). For each enrichment graph we report p, padj (FDR q) and NES (enrichment score normalized to mean enrichment of random samples of the same size) values in the figure. ReferencesDurai, V. & Murphy, K.

By Chuck Abbott Chuck Abbott The slow-talking son of an Illinois farm family, Chuck Abbott covered U.S. food and agriculture policy in its many forms since 1988, from farm bills (six so far) and crop insurance reform to school lunch, ag research, biofuels and the Dietary Guidelines. Editor of the daily electronic newsletter Ag Insider published by the Food and Environment Reporting Network and contributor to agriculture.com. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 14, 2022 Close Photo: roibu of iStockphoto.com Nearly 5% of the egg-laying hens in the United States have died in outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the past six weeks, said USDA data on Wednesday. Egg prices were rising faster than the overall rate of food inflation, though there was an ample supply ahead of Easter and Passover. READ MORE: Total birds lost reaches 26.9 million, USDA reports 12 additional cases More than 27 million birds in domestic flocks, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died from HPAI or in cullings of infected flocks this year. Some 18.7 million of them were laying hens. The latest losses were nearly 2 million layers on farms in central Minnesota and northeastern Nebraska. Wholesale prices for a dozen large eggs in the Midwest this week were nearly triple their price of a year ago, according to market analysis company Urner Barry, reported Axios. "What we can say is that the inventory of eggs in the grocery store for your Easter and Passover celebrations remains high," said economist Veronica Nigh of the American Farm Bureau Federation in a blog. "The drawback — you'll have to pay more for them." The high price of eggs "suggests that the market doesn't necessarily believe the [poultry] industry has HPAI contained quite yet," wrote Nigh. Before HPAI was detected on egg farms in early March, there were 390 million hens in the U.S. laying flock. The loss of 18.7 million hens would equal 4.8% of the U.S. total. Outbreaks of "high path" bird flu began a month earlier, on February 8, among turkey, broiler chicken, and backyard flocks. More than 50 million birds died in the 2014-15 HPAI epidemic, "arguably the most significant animal health event in U.S. history," according to a USDA analysis. The losses included 43 million laying hens and pullets, which are hens yet to lay eggs, and 7.4 million turkeys. Some stores ran low on eggs during the epidemic. The final outbreak of the 211 recorded on commercial operations during the bird flu epidemic was on June 16, 2015. HPAI is often spread by migratory birds, and cases subside with the arrival of warm weather and the end of migration season. Two-thirds, or roughly 120, of this year's outbreaks have been in commercial flocks. "Significant detections of HPAI in commercial flocks started about five weeks earlier in 2022, and they have risen more quickly than in 2015," wrote Nigh. If mid-June is the likely end point, "we potentially have a long way to go." In its monthly report on inflation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday that food prices rose 8.8% in the 12 months ending in March but that egg prices were 11.2% higher.

News Flash Home - News & Announcements Posted on: April 14, 2022[ARCHIVED] Advisory: Avian Influenza Confirmed in Washtenaw County Birds Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been confirmed in birds in Washtenaw County. No human illness has been identified, and all individuals potentially exposed to the confirmed cases are being contacted. Washtenaw County Health Department is sharing this information to alert people who own or work with birds, including poultry, to the possibility of infection and recommended precautions. HPAI in birds is not a food safety concern. You cannot get avian influenza by eating properly cooked poultry products. Both wild and domestic birds, including chickens, may be infected with avian influenza viruses. Avian flu viruses spread easily among birds and – while rare –can spread from birds to people. Spread of avian flu viruses from a bird to a person mainly happens through droplets, the same way that human flu viruses spread. If exposed, individuals need to watch for symptoms of influenza for 10 days after their last exposure to the infected birds. Similar to seasonal influenza illness in humans, avian influenza viruses can be treated using influenza antiviral drugs. These medications work better the sooner they are given. If you suspect you may be ill, please contact your health care or urgent care provider.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to people from HPAI viruses to be low. To date, no human HPAI infections have been detected in the United States. Birds or flocks infected with HPAI may not show routine signs of illness. Sudden death is a major indicator of HPAI; however, sick birds may show neurological signs; difficulty walking; lack of appetite, energy or vocalization; significant drop in egg production; swollen combs, wattles, legs or head; diarrhea; or sneezing, coughing or nasal discharge.In Michigan, HPAI has been previously detected in wild birds as well as commercial and non-commercial poultry flocks. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development urges poultry owners to step up their own biosecurity precautions by minimizing the number of people coming in contact with birds, isolating birds from wild birds whenever possible, and disinfecting hands and clothing after coming in contact with poultry.Residents who notice the death of three or more free-ranging birds should report it to the DNR through the Eyes in the Field app or by calling 517-336-5030. If your domestic poultry is experiencing severe illness or multiple death losses, contact MDARD at 800-292-3939.For more information, go to Michigan.gov/BirdFlu, Michigan.gov/AvianInfluenza or Michigan.gov/AvianDiseases.Local COVID information and updates are always available at www.washtenaw.org/health.

The confirmation of bird flu at another Iowa egg-laying farm will force the killing of more than 5 million chickens, officials said Friday, March 18, 2022. Spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings or nasal discharge of infected wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which can contaminate dust and soil. Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo A second commercial poultry farm in Wisconsin has reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu.The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported Saturday that the disease was confirmed in a commercial poultry flock in Barron County. DATCP’s webpage tracking bird flu cases shows the 4​6,507-bird flock was depopulated as of Monday.DATCP officials first confirmed the highly pathogenic avian influenza in a Jefferson County egg-laying facility in mid-March. The flock of more than 2.7 million birds was depopulated by the end of last month. It’s the first time the state has seen the disease since an outbreak that affected nine commercial flocks in 2015.

DATCP has also reported two outbreaks of the disease in non-commercial poultry operations this year, first in a backyard flock of 22 birds in Rock County on April 1 and a 204-bird operation in Racine County on Thursday.Wisconsin State Veterinarian Dr. Darlene Konkle said last week officials believe the first two cases in the state this year were a result of contact with wild birds. The state Department of Natural Resources has found the strain of bird flu in samples collected from wild birds in Dane, Columbia, Grant, Milwaukee and Polk counties.Officials are cautioning poultry owners to use strong biosecurity measures and move birds indoors if possible. DATCP issued an order last week that immediately suspended all poultry shows and exhibits through May 31.Zoos and animal sanctuaries near Milwaukee, Racine and Madison have temporarily closed their aviaries or are taking measures to limit exposure to wild birds.

Print Before influenza cases ravaged through Orange County in the fall of 1918, a battle brewed at the Santa Ana Board of Education over Mexican students. Trustees reneged on their promise to build a Mexican school in time for the new academic year. Meanwhile, the number of Mexican students at Lincoln School had grown by more than 100, an untenable situation for segregationists there who led the charge.According to Board of Education minutes, the board looked at possible Mexican school sites as early as July and moved to purchase two lots but ultimately found construction too costly. Advertisement Supt. J.A. Cranston considered moving two Mexican classes into a Lincoln Elementary “shack” previously used as a changing room for student athletes. The temporary compromise also included separate recess periods so the playground wouldn’t be integrated.Lincoln’s PTA pushed back. Its president decried that past segregation of Mexican students at Washington School in 1913 had ended and presented a resolution before an Aug. 9, 1918 school board meeting.“We protest vigorously against any plan that will mean the location of any Mexican classes upon the Lincoln school grounds, whether in the main school building or in any other building,” it read. “The placing of a Mexican makeshift school upon the Lincoln grounds would be a rank injustice to our school, our teachers and our children.”The resolution passed.Trustees directed staff to open bids on materials to build a Mexican school and vowed by vote to segregate “sub-normal pupils in the grammar schools.”But the opportunity to do so wouldn’t present itself until November when influenza cases surged during the 1918 pandemic’s deadly second wave.By then, Santa Ana became one of the last Southern California cities to shut down gatherings at churches, pool halls, theaters and libraries by way of an Oct. 19 public health order; Cranston closed the schools for a month.The Mexican question remained, especially as trustees considered how to safely reopen classes before Christmas.Dr. John I. Clark, Santa Ana’s health officer, joined various PTA groups in urging that Mexican students be segregated on account of influenza. He even suggested that school nurses conduct flu inspections at Mexican homes.The board ceased sewing, cooking and manual training classes at a building on Church Street, which is now Civic Center Drive, in favor of repurposing it as a makeshift Mexican school until a permanent solution could be found.On Nov. 18, classes resumed, but Mexican students largely stayed home.“It is very likely that a vast majority of the Mexicans were not aware of the reopening this morning,” the Santa Ana Register reported. “Few of them read the daily papers and probably will not learn of the resumption of school until it is passed by word of mouth.” TimesOC Lorenzo Ramirez, late plaintiff in famed school desegregation case, honored by Orange The Orange City Council has issued posthumous proclamation celebrating the Mexican activist’s participation in Mendez, et al v. Westminster, et al. Feb. 9, 2022 Segregation continued in Santa Ana from that morning until an appellate court ruling in Mendez, et al. v. Westminster School District of Orange County, et al 75 years ago today, drove a final legal stake through the heart of the state’s Mexican schools.The board did consider the legality of segregation during a Jan. 13, 1919 meeting after classes resumed the week before. Trustees invited Santa Ana City Atty. George H. Scott to offer an opinion on the matter.He noted that state law allowed Native American, Chinese and “people of Mongolian descent” to be segregated from their white counterparts at school.“There seems to be no provision empowering Boards of Education to maintain separate schools for Mexicans or other nationalities,” Scott, a former judge, opined. “It is entirely proper and legal to classify [students] according to the regularity of attendance, ability to understand the English language and their aptness to advance in the grades to which they shall be assigned.”Long before the Mendez case, Mexican Americans belonging to the Pro Patria Club immediately opposed the segregation of their children at the meeting and filed a petition against it as an unlawful act.The Register reported that parents had been whipped up by the “thoughtless agitation” of a Mexican newspaper in Los Angeles, which stressed the pandemic roots of discrimination.“Excellent progress has been made by the children at the Mexican school,” Cranston was quoted as saying in the Register. “The children themselves like it. They don’t want to go back to the other schools.”The superintendent cited a survey by teachers where it was claimed only one out of 116 Mexican students wanted to return to their former schools in sharp contrast to their parents’ demands.“While the influenza epidemic caused the closing of the American schools,” Cranston continued, “a number of Mexican children who were backward in their classes were told that if they wanted to do so during the vacation they could go to the Mexican school.”Armed with the city attorney’s opinion, the board dismissed the Pro Patria Club’s petition and voted to continue working on permanent Mexican schools “especially for the great benefit to the Mexican children.”Some parents refused to send their children to the Mexican school on Church Street.

Tom Umberg presented a $1.5-million check to help further the construction of the 2-mile historical trail.Oct. 21, 2021 Venecio Ramirez and Francisco Bielman were given suspended sentences for their children’s truancy. A Pro Patria Club official presented a signed statement urging compliance in the community. Three more warrants were issued against Mexican parents, but their children reported to school before being arrested.Later that year, the board purchased two sites for future Mexican schools — one at Stafford and Logan streets and the other at Second and Santa Fe streets.In June, trustees accepted the bid of E.W. Smith to construct a permanent Mexican school; he would later build the southwest-style Floral Park home of Ralph Smedley, the founder of Toastmasters, in 1925.Santa Ana expected its white schools to open on Sept. 10 while construction of Mexican school buildings would be completed by Oct. 1. The late Virginia Guzman was one of many students who attended Fremont, a Mexican school in Santa Ana. Along with her husband, William, she didn’t want the same for their son, Billy Guzman. But the district denied their request that he be allowed to attend Franklin School along with white students.In 1945, William Guzman joined the Mendez case alongside Gonzalo Mendez, Thomas Estrada, Frank Palomino and Lorenzo Ramirez. The class-action suit represented 5,000 Mexican school students in the Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Westminster and El Modena school districts.Mendez and Palomino’s children had, at one time, also attended Fremont. U.S. District Court Judge Paul J. McCormick found Mexican schools to be illegal in siding with the plaintiffs. Santa Ana was one of three districts to appeal but on April 14, 1947, an appellate court unanimously upheld McCormick’s ruling. In June, the Santa Ana Board of Education voted to discontinue their legal fight. Support our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.

Hundreds of birds have been found dead at a suburban Chicago lake, according to wildlife officials, marking the first major avian flu outbreak in the Great Lakes region this year as experts fear hundreds more could soon be found. More than 200 animals were found on Baker's Lake in the Barrington area, far northwest of Chicago. The lake, according to the Forest Preserves of Cook County, is known for bird watching and "is home to one of the most significant heron rookeries in the Midwest." 📺 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are “This is the same flu that is causing massive die offs in our poultry industry through out north America," said Chris Anchor, wildlife biologist for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. The outbreak is the first seen in the Great Lakes Region, though the virus has been impacting birds across the Midwest for the last couple months. Millions of turkeys and chickens at commercial farms in numerous states have been killed this year due to avian influenza. Late last month, the virus was confirmed in wild birds found in three southeastern Michigan counties, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. Chicago-area zoos recently pulled dozens of their birds from outdoor exhibits amid the spread of this year’s highly transmissible strain of the bird flu. Two smaller outbreaks were also reported in Illinois so far this year, affecting backyard flocks in McLean and Carol counties.

Here's where the vote count stands The spread of the disease is largely blamed on the droppings of wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which often show no signs of illness. But Anchor said the mass deaths seen in the suburban Chicago lake mark a shift for the virus. Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter. “This represents a very significant change in the behavior of the virus," he said. "Up until this point we’ve only seen groups of two, three, half a dozen birds succumbing to it. In this instance, we actually have hundreds of birds that have succumbed to it” The timing of the outbreak is also raising alarm for scientists as it comes at a time when many birds are migrating or nesting. “We have millions of birds moving from the south to the north and places like this they can become infected and move the virus along," Anchor said. Unlike other outbreaks that affect farms, this avian flu has proven to primarily move through wild animals, quickly infecting other flocks. “If this was a poultry farm it would have already been depopulated, and that would have been the solution - depopulate and incinerate the carcasses," Anchor said. "But in a wildlife situation, you don’t have that option. All we can do is sit back, monitor it and look for changes in the species that are involved and continue to provide the state pathologist with samples." It remains unclear how long the virus could plague wildlife populations this year. In the last week, half the birds in the popular Baker's Lake rookery, also known as "nesting island," have died. “I’m concerned because unlike us humans, who can wear a mask or get a vaccine, there’s nothing that can be done to help protect these birds," said area bird watcher Wei Xiao.

Department of AgriculturePublished: Apr. 14, 2022, 12:33 p.m.Backyard flock of chickens. (File photo)By Marcus Schneck | mschneck@pennlive.comPoultry and eggs will not be allowed in exhibition at county and local fairs in Pennsylvania through June 16, or until today’s order implementing the ban is rescinded by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.The department announced the temporary quarantine order as an additional step in protecting the state’s $7.1 billion poultry industry from the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which also is known as bird flu.The ban prohibits the presence and display of poultry and poultry products, including eggs, feathers and other parts and items made of these parts at any of the 108 county and local fairs that receive state funding under the Pennsylvania Agricultural Fair Act.Most of the fairs are held late summer through early fall.“Pennsylvania’s agricultural fairs are important educational events for our youth,” Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said. “But the risk to our poultry farmers and our economy outweighs the benefit of displaying poultry at fairs when avian influenza is an imminent threat. The very real experience of weighing risks against benefits is also a tremendously important part of an agricultural education.”Pennsylvania has not had a confirmed case of the disease in commercial or backyard poultry since an outbreak in 1983-84, but it was discovered in a wild bald eagle in the state in December.Infected birds in commercial and backyard poultry flocks have been confirmed in 26 other states, including most states surrounding Pennsylvania.USDA’s website includes a complete listing of confirmed domestic poultry infections as well as those in wild birds.According to the department, genetic analysis of samples taken in other U.S. states has shown that the virus is being spread by infected wild birds.Domestic poultry, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, emus and ostriches, are most susceptible to avian influenza. The disease is highly contagious and often fatal to birds.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.Poultry products and eggs are safe to consume if stored and cooked at proper temperatures.In 2015, following a multi-state outbreak of avian influenza, primarily in the Midwest, the USDA reported losses and response costs of approximately $1 billion.A 2021 study of the economic impact of Pennsylvania agriculture found that Pennsylvania’s poultry industry contributes $7.1 billion to the state’s economy and supports 26,600 jobs. The state’s organic poultry sector leads the nation in sales of both eggs and poultry.Poultry producers have biosecurity plans on file with the department and are constantly reminded to follow plans and keep them up to date. The department has reviewed procedures, inventoried supplies and protective equipment, and has held monthly meetings with poultry producers, veterinarians, USDA officials and other stakeholders monthly, escalating to bi-monthly in February 2022.Pennsylvania’s three animal health laboratories analyzed nearly 200,000 samples for avian influenza last year. The laboratories, which make up the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, have the capacity to test many more samples.Because of avian flu fears, zoos in Pa. and across the country hide their birdsThe department warns that wild birds carry the virus and do not respect property or state lines. Though they may not appear sick, they spread the virus in their droppings and anywhere they land.Anyone visiting a farm should be aware that your vehicles and shoes may carry the virus from other places you have walked. Clean them thoroughly and stay away from poultry barns unless you must be there.If you have backyard chickens – pets or birds raised for show – keep them indoors and protect them from contamination by wild birds or their droppings.RECOMMENDED•pennlive.comCDC calls for expanded bird flu testing after blood tests reveal more human infectionsNov. 7, 2024, 3:00 p.m.Poachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Report sick domestic birds or unusual deaths in your flock 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to the department at 717-772-2852 or email RA-ahds@pa.gov.More information about protecting domestic birds from avian influenza can be found at agriculture.pa.gov or at USDA’s Defend the Flock Program.Contact Marcus Schneck at mschneck@pennlive.com.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

(WLS) -- A deadly illness is sweeping through Baker's Lake near the northwest suburb of Barrington.Hundreds of birds have been found dead.It is one of the most popular locations for bird watchers in the Chicago area. That's because Baker's Lake is home to a large population of birds, from pelicans to herons, cormorants and egrets.A vibrant population filled with hundreds of birds.But it is a population suddenly in danger from the avian flu - also known as the bird flu -- which has apparently spread quickly in the area, killing an estimated 200 birds so far."I think it's incredibly sad. Even more sad because its migration and I hope they don't spread it," said bird watcher Donna Frick.RELATED: Bird flu 2022: Crews dispose of nearly 3M flu-stricken chickens from Wisconsin farmState and federal officials are trying to contain an outbreak of highly contagious bird flu on the farm.The lake is owned by the Cook County Forest Preserve. Wildlife biologist Chris Anchor has recovered the remains of many of the dead birds."I've never seen an outbreak of this intensity that includes this many birds," Anchor said.The deadly strain of the avian bird flu has been sweeping across the country and has killed more than 20 million birds in commercial flocks, as it is easily transmissible to birds in close contact.So far, it's been reported in 24 states, including Illinois. But this is the most serious outbreak reported in the state so far."It's a huge attraction. People come by all the time at the viewing area. There are hundreds of birds," said Ryan Julian, who lives nearby.The Lincoln Park Zoo closed its outdoor bird exhibits last week, moving the birds inside.RELATED: Lincoln Park Zoo joins zoos across continent moving birds inside amid new bird flu outbreakBiologists are also worried about other birds in the outdoors."It would be devastating if this wound up in all the heron rookeries throughout the region," Anchor added.The avian flu is rarely transmissible to humans.

They won't be seen during the Easter weekend, typically a busy one at the zoo.The zoo staff announced April 4 that most birds would be moved from their outdoor public habitats to behind-the-scenes areas that offer more protection from the viral respiratory disease, also known as H5N1, that can be fatal in birds. Ambassador birds shown during educational programs also are sequestered from the public, said Clay Carabajal, zoo public relations supervisor.The move came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of HPAI in a commercial pheasant flock in Erath County, three counties east of Taylor County.The limited feathered creatures on public exhibit include birds of prey, such as hawks and owls, and ostriches. For those birds, "we felt we're better off quarantining on exhibit, and we're just monitoring them. But every other bird is inside," Carabajal said.The precautionary measures includes closing the bird and duck feeding stations in front of the two flamingo exhibits and draining ponds to dissuade migratory and other wild birds from stopping by. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "believes that the risk to the general public’s health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low," according to a March news release.However, the CDC recommends people who have occupations or recreational activities involving birds minimize direct contact by wearing gloves, washing hands with soap and water after touching birds and wearing a mask. Rare cases of illnesses in people from bird flu virus infections have ranged from mild (eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (pneumonia) that can result in death, the CDC said. Still plenty to see and doAll the lions, giraffes, reptiles, fish, lemurs and other zoo animals remain viewable from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (gate closes at 4 p.m.) this weekend.Although visitors won't see many water fowl, they can ride pedal boats shaped like oversized swans, a miniature train that chugs through the park and a musical carousal.In the Elm Creek Building, which begins with the aquariums exhibit and ends with the nocturnal animals exhibit, the middle section where birds fly freely is closed to the public. The measure is not because wild birds could enter, but because visitors' feet could track infected bird fecal matter through the exhibit. If "our birds in the exhibit ended up stepping on it, they would get the disease," Carabajal said about the cross contamination.Visitors can enter the Elm Creek Building exit door to see the creatures of the night, he said.The Bird Rehabilitation Center also continues to operate, caring for sick, injured or orphaned native birds. The staff is taking extra precautions with personal protective equipment and other strategies to eliminate cross contamination to the zoo's bird collection. Where did the birds go?An estimated 200 birds have been moved to nonpublic, indoor holdings throughout the zoo, "even holdings that weren't necessarily theirs to begin with," Carabajal said. Examples include "zebra barn stalls converted into aviaries," he said.The zoo staff has been preparing for the protective measure since at least January when the USDA first began confirming HPAI in other parts of the county, Carabajal said.The last HPAI outbreak in the U.S. occurred about seven years ago, he said. "We had been prepping those indoor holdings to be wild-bird proof, so making sure that pigeons and doves or little sparrows couldn't get in," Carabajal said. The zoo's protocol is to take birds off exhibit if HPAI is confirmed in Texas. ""Every time there's a positive case, it's 21 days before you're cleared to safely put the birds back out," Carabajal said. Based on that timetable, the zoo staff is hoping the birds can return for public viewing in May, he said. With Easter weekend, school trips and other spring activities, the precautionary steps come at a busy time for the zoo. "It didn't happen at a very good time for us, by any means. We were happy that we were able to have birds for our spring break," Carabajal said. The zoo staff is taking advantage of the down time to clean and update the bird exhibits. "The sun here in West Texas is going to do us a giant favor because the sun will bake off all the algae (on the pools). And when those pools do refill, it will look brand new," Carabajal said.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 13, 2022 Close Four of every 10 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) this year have been on a turkey farm, with Minnesota and South Dakota hit the most frequently, USDA data showed on Tuesday. READ MORE: How to monitor flocks and report suspected avian influenza The USDA confirmed HPAI on seven additional farms holding 337,348 turkeys, lifting the U.S. total to just under 25 million birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, since the viral disease appeared among domestic flocks in early February. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service listed outbreaks on 74 turkey farms, with losses of 3.6 million turkeys. The United States produced 214 million turkeys last year. Minnesota was the leading state, raising 40.5 million of them.

HPAI was identified at only nine egg farms but 16.8 million egg-laying hens have died of "high path" bird flu. The Indiana state Board of Animal Health said HPAI was found on Tuesday on a second duck farm in Elkhart County with around 6,000 ducks on the premises. An Elkhart County farm with 4,724 ducks was hit over the weekend by HPAI. More than 50 million birds died in an epidemic of HPAI in 2014 and 2015, including 12% of the U.S. flock of egg-laying hens.

Newsletter Sign Up Newsletter Sign UpSurging Bird Flu Cases in the U.S. Have Come for the Bald Eagle Skip to content Search Home Latest Tech Reviews Science io9 AI Video Deals Best of 2024 Biology Surging Bird Flu Cases in the U.S. Have Come for the Bald Eagle A dangerous strain of the avian influenza has caused the deaths of millions of birds and is spreading fast in wild eagle populations. By Lauren Leffer Published April 15, 2022 | Comments (0) | ð Copied! Photo: Matthew Crowley Photography (Getty Images) Three wild bald eagles found dead in Georgia were confirmed to have died from bird flu on Thursday, increasing the toll from a recent surge in avian influenza cases thatâs caused the death of tens of millions of birds in total. Across more than 25 states, massive numbers of wild and domestic birds are sick and dying from a new version of the avian influenza virus, which has caused multiple prior avian epidemics. Itâs already the worst bird flu outbreak in the U.S. since 2015 in terms of domestic poultry deaths, and itâs burning through wild bird populations at a troubling rate. On Thursday, initial testing of more than 200 deceased waterbirds at Bakerâs Lake forest preserve near Chicago, consisting mostly ofÂ double-crested cormorants, revealed those animals probably died of avian influenza as well. Cormorants seem to have been very susceptible to the disease because they gather at crowded nesting grounds; in contrast, only a few dozen bald eagles have been killed so far, because theyâre more solitary. âThis outbreak in wild bird populations is a lot more extensive than we saw in 2014 and 2015,â David Stallknecht, a bird flu researcher at the University of Georgia, said in an interview with NPR. âJust a lot more birds appear to be affected.â The bird flu outbreak is also heavily taxing the poultry industry. Infected flocks of domestic chickens and turkeys are culled, or killed en masse, by poultry producers in attempts to contain the fluâs spread. As of April 3, the USDA estimated that more than 23 million poultry had been culled so far (more than 50 million were killed in 2015). Those losses are starting to become visible on grocery store shelves, as chicken, eggs, and the processed egg-derived powders that are used in many packaged foods shoot up in price. Avian influenza is an incredibly dangerous disease for birds. In chickens, the worst forms of the virus have a mortality rate upwards of 90%, and usually kill within just two days after destroying multiple organ systems. Bird flu can sometimes jump species and be deadly for people, but for now, humans donât seem to be at increased risk of infection from this particular strain, known as H5N1. Thereâs no reason to avoid birds or eating properly cooked poultry products (aside from the standard environmental ones). In theory, that could change, but there hasnât ever been a single recorded human case of human H5N1 infection in the United States, and since 2003 the World Health Organization has received fewer than 900 H5N1 human infections globally.

An April 1 post of the video from one Facebook user was shared nearly 900 times in less than a week.In the clip from Fauci's October 2004 appearance on C-SPAN, he answered a caller's question and in part of the response said, "The most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself." The Facebook post attempted to compare this approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which Fauci and other leaders and experts are pushing for vaccinations."Check out this clip of Dr. Fauci in 2004 talking about the STRENGTH of Natural Immunity," the post said. "Fast forward 18 years, what happened to this “'science?!'”The clip was posted by multiple accounts and accrued thousands of shares.But Facebook users are taking this clip of Fauci out of context. He is answering a caller's specific question on her flu diagnosis; he is not speaking about COVID-19. Experts say it's not reasonable to apply the same logic to both illnesses given the vast difference in transmissibility and lethality.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunksUSA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the claim for comment.Fauci was talking about the flu shot, and in a specific caseThe clip of Fauci came from an Oct. 11, 2004, appearance on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal," in which he was discussing the flu vaccine.That year there was a flu vaccine shortage, after the world's second-leading supplier of the flu vaccine, The Chiron Corp., saw its company license suspended for problems at a manufacturing plant. That cut America's supply of flu vaccine almost in half and led leaders in public health to recommend that healthy Americans defer getting a flu shot so high-risk people, the elderly and children could have access to the shots. During the nearly 50-minute program, callers from around the country asked Fauci a number of questions about the vaccine shortage and that year's flu season.A 67-year-old woman from Minnesota called into the program to ask Fauci about her 14-day case of the flu. She said that in the past when she got the flu vaccine she would experience flu symptoms for weeks, but when she didn't get the vaccine she would get the flu only once during the winter season. Fauci suggested to the Minnesota caller that she may have an allergy to a component of the vaccine.The C-SPAN host then turned to Fauci and asked him: "She's had the flu for 14 days. Should she get the flu shot?" Fauci's response is where the viral video users have been sharing begins. "Well no, if she got the flu for 14 days, she's as protected as anybody can be, cause the best vaccination is to get infected yourself," Fauci said. "If she really has the flu, she definitely doesn't need a flu vaccine." The interviewer asks again, "She should not get it again?" and Fauci responds, "She doesn't need it – it's the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself." Of course, COVID-19 didn't exist at that time, and it presents an array of threats that the flu does not. The death rate of COVID-19 is much higher than the flu. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 290,000 to 650,000 people die of flu-related causes every year worldwide. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is thought to be up to 10 times higher than most strains of the flu, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Fact check:False claim that a 1997 boycott lowered gas prices by 30 cents a gallon in one dayThe CDC has said that compared with the flu, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people. With COVID-19, people can also take longer to show symptoms, and they can remain contagious for longer periods of time than with the flu. COVID-19 vaccines offer more consistent and safer protection than natural immunity Using the Fauci clip to push for natural immunity instead of vaccines – as many online are doing – ignores several critical points.As noted, the infection that yields natural immunity is much more likely to lead to death from COVID-19 compared with the flu.And the caller in the 2004 clip was already infected, so the question was about whether she should be vaccinated at that point. That's a very different question from whether someone who is not yet infected should get vaccinated or await an infection and the resulting natural immunity.A CDC study from August 2021 confirmed that vaccination offers higher protection than previous coronavirus infection.“This study shows you are twice as likely to get infected again if you are unvaccinated," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement. That study exhibits why Fauci's 2004 influenza vaccine comment cannot be compared to what experts have said about natural immunity and COVID-19. Vaccines for COVID-19 offer more consistent and safer protection than natural immunity. A study from April 2021 found that people who received two doses of shots from Pfizer or Moderna had antibody levels “up to 10 times” higher than those of a natural infection. While COVID-19 immunity provided by vaccine and prior infection are both high, neither offers 100% protection. The vaccine, however, offers more consistent protection against COVID-19, the CDC said. The level of immunity gained after a COVID-19 infection also varies widely, which experts say leaves some people with minimal natural immunity.Fact check: Footage of Slovak politicians pouring water on Ukrainian flag lacks context“Natural immunity tends to be strong, yes,” Shane Crotty, a professor and vaccine researcher at La Jolla Institue for Immunology, previously told USA TODAY. “The reason scientists and public health officials have been more cautious about COVID-19 is because of this big range (of immunity levels) that we’ve seen for COVID-19 in people, which seems different than some other infections.”Our rating: Missing contextBased on our research, we rate MISSING CONTEXT the claim that Fauci said, "The most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself" because without additional information it is misleading.

Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them. Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo Normally at this time of year, staff at Heartland Farm Sanctuary in Verona would be gearing up for the wave of visitors coming to pet, cuddle and admire their adorable menagerie of farm animals.“Lots of sheep snuggles and goat scratches,” said Jamie Monroe, the sanctuary’s communications director. Instead, public and private tours are on hiatus, and the sanctuary’s feathered residents are quarantined in the barn in an effort to protect the chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and emus from the recent avian flu outbreak.

Like Heartland Farm, zoos and animal sanctuaries across Wisconsin are taking precautions to protect their birds.Initially detected in Wisconsin on a Jefferson County poultry farm, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is now believed to have originated with wild birds. And with spring migration in full swing, there is a risk of wild birds bringing the disease to new locations.Monroe said quarantining the animals at the sanctuary is just as disappointing for the birds as it is for prospective visitors.“After a long winter, everybody wants to kind of get outside and stretch their wings, and it’s just not safe. So we’re keeping everyone indoors until it’s no longer a threat,” Monroe said. “We successfully navigated avian flu in 2015, so this is a road we’ve traveled before.”Milwaukee County Zoo’s aviary is temporarily closed to protect its birds, senior staff veterinarian Pamela Govett said. As state’s largest zoo, Milwaukee has an enormous collection of birds — everything from flamingos and hornbills to vultures, penguins and ostriches. A sign is displayed instructing visitors of a closed bird exhibit at the Blank Park Zoo, Tuesday, April 5, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo “Avian influenza can be transmitted by feces, oral, nasal or respiratory secretions. And while we don’t think that the people are going to be transmitting it to the birds, they could definitely track it in on their clothing and their shoes,” Govett said.The zoo has also moved some birds — like ostriches, flamingos and Humboldt penguins — to isolated indoor locations.Govett said the staff who work with the birds or clean the enclosures are operating like frontline workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: ramping up their PPE use to keep transmission risk low.“(Staff) come in from home, change their clothes, change shoes — they have boots designated specifically for the aviary … And they have foot baths that they’re sticking their feet in everywhere to disinfect their feet so they’re not tracking in any feces. And then they are repeating that whole process before they go home,” Govett said.The Racine Zoo, home to a stork aviary, a flock of budgies, African penguins and a raptor roost, is relying on similar precautions, most of which have been in place since the 2015 avian flu outbreak, said Aszya Summers, curator of animal care and conservation education. Chief Marketing Officer Ryan Bickel walks through a shoe disinfectant as he enters a building at the Blank Park Zoo, Tuesday, April 5, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo “Going in and out of bird enclosures, we do foot baths, we wear booties or change shoes every single time. We wear gloves, we wash our hands. And all of that we’ve been doing since 2015. So all of those pieces are still there,” Summers said.As an added precaution this year, the zoo installed tarps over the tops of its bird enclosures, so the animals can be outside without risking exposure to contaminated fecal droppings from wild birds passing overhead.Still, Summers said they may pull birds inside occasionally or ask guests to take additional precautions as needed.“We just asked everyone to be understanding and realize, you know, when we have foot baths, extra hand washes or animals off exhibit, that we’re doing the best that we can for the animals.”Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison issued a statement in March saying its aviary would be closed through April. “We have many endangered birds species on grounds and our main priority right now is to do everything we can to protect them,” said Joseph Darcangelo, deputy zoo director. “We have instituted our disease outbreak protocols to protect our high-risk bird species who live at the Zoo. This includes moving certain birds indoors to prevent the transmission of HPAI from wild birds, especially waterfowl.”According to the statement, the zoo’s flamingos, chickens and penguins were moved indoors and its sandhill crane is being relocated to the Animal Health Center as an added precaution. The current outbreak, the deadliest since 2015, has killed nearly 23 million birds across 24 states.In Wisconsin there have only been three reported sites of domestic infections — the initial Jefferson County egg-laying facility, a backyard flock in Rock County and a poultry farm in Racine County. All of them underwent severe population culling to contain the disease. But there have been at least six instances of infection in wild birds.On Friday, the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced it was suspending all poultry shows, exhibitions and swap meets through May 31 in an effort to stop the spread. They encouraged poultry owners to continue practicing strict biosafety measures and report any signs of the virus in their birds.While the disease can be devastating for bird populations — particularly waterfowl and domestic poultry — it is extremely rare for humans to become infected. In fact, there has never been a reported case of a human being infected with avian flu in the United States. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, proper handling and cooking of eggs and poultry will kill any bacteria or virus present, making them safe for consumption.

By Alyssa Hui Published on April 15, 2022 Fact checked by Richard Scherr Fact checked by Richard Scherr Rich Scherr is an updates strategist and fact checker for Dotdash Meredith brands, including Health and Verywell. He is a seasoned financial and technology journalist who served as editor-in-chief of the Potomac Tech Wire for nearly two decades, and is a regular contributor to the sports pages of The Baltimore Sun. He has also been a news editor for America Online and has contributed to the Associated Press and The Washington Post. health's fact checking process Close Getty Images Biotechnology company Moderna is expanding its mRNA technology. The makers of the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine are now working on two more vaccines: one to protect against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and another for the four endemic human coronaviruses, which can cause the common cold. The new vaccines—for which development programs have only just launched—aim to reduce the impact that respiratory viruses have on public health, especially among older adults who are more susceptible to severe illness, according to a news release from the company. "The U.S. population is aging and it's not hard to predict that common cold viruses will wield an increasingly uncommon burden on our older adults, especially those in caregiving settings," Mark Cameron, PhD, an associate professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine who is not involved in the vaccine development, told Health. "Given the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, especially in older adults, it's welcome news that the companies who've made them are developing new programs to tackle other viral respiratory infections." Two New Vaccines for Common Respiratory Illnesses Of the two vaccines Moderna is working on, the first is a three-in-one combination respiratory vaccine candidate, known for now as mRNA-1230. It's proposed to be an annual booster used to protect against SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. Those viruses are the three most significant viruses that cause respiratory disease in older adults. Though there are vaccines available now for both COVID-19 and the flu, there's no cure or immunization available to protect against RSV, a virus that hospitalizes nearly 177,000 older adults annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 14,000 people—mainly those older than 65, adults with chronic heart or lung disease, and immunocompromised people—die each year from RSV. The second vaccine proposed by Moderna is meant to protect against four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)—specifically HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1—which, combined, account for 10-30% of upper respiratory tract infections worldwide, Moderna said. In theory, this vaccine would protect against some, but not all,causes of the common cold. "Endemic coronaviruses account for anywhere from one in 10 to one in three respiratory infections and aren't the only cause of the common cold. There are hundreds of viruses and their variants causing colds," Cameron said. "However by vaccinating against circulating coronavirus, COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, we begin checking off the top viruses capable of causing harm in older adults, especially those with comorbidities." FDA Authorizes Second COVID-19 Booster Dose For People 50 and Older Benefits of Combination Vaccines Without research and testing data, it's nearly impossible to know what the benefits or limitations would be for these vaccines. And any specifics regarding either vaccine—what they'll look like, how often people will need to get them, how effective they will be, etc.—will all depend on the outcome of testing during studies and clinical trials. Regarding RSV, for which there is no vaccine currently, a safe vaccine is not only urgently needed, but necessary, Chandra Shekhar Bakshi, DVM, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at New York Medical College, told Health. She adds that rolling an RSV vaccine into a triple vaccine, meant to protect against both the flu and COVID-19, would provide greater virus protection for more people. Combination vaccines, which protect against multiple diseases through fewer shots, provide benefits for both patients and caregivers, according to the CDC. These vaccines can mean fewer doctor visits, less pain or discomfort, more affordability, and—most importantly—fewer delays in protection against disease. However, it's important to remember that no vaccine offers 100% protection against any disease. According to Bakshi, there are certain limitations of mRNA vaccines, like "short duration of immunity resulting in a need for repeated boosters." And while the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 have been proven as safe and effective, the long-term safety of mRNA vaccines is continually questioned following reports of adverse events, said Bakshi. This only adds to the hesitancy around vaccines, and mRNA technology in particular. "I expect some hesitancy [for any mRNA vaccines]," Cameron said. "But if public health agencies and medical professionals can clearly communicate the overwhelming safety of arguably the largest vaccine rollout in history to the general public, I also expect the cumulative safety data of new mRNA vaccines to speak in a similar way." What Comes Next? It's important to note that Moderna is very early on in the vaccine development process—the company has simply announced the mRNA vaccine programs, and any vaccines that are developed will need to go through various developmental and clinical trial phases in order for regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. "The company would need to make sure that the candidate vaccines are safe and immunogenic (i.e., they cause an immune response) in animal models and then in small studies of healthy adults," Adam Ratner, MD, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health, told Health. "If all goes well in those kinds of studies, they would design larger clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy." If the design, early-stage trials, and larger clinical trials of these vaccines are successful, "it's likely that combination mRNA vaccines will become part of our yearly vaccination program prior to each cold and flu season," Cameron said. "Depending on variables like one's age, it's also possible that mRNA vaccines will replace the need for multiple trips to the pharmacy for vaccines or boosters given their all-in-one design potential." But even then, should clinical trials show success, decisions would have to be made regarding manufacturing, production, scalability, and rollout of the vaccines. Even after the vaccines are made commercially available, the FDA doesn't stop monitoring their safety and efficacy: The agency continues to watch the vaccines and any side effects that are reported through surveillance systems like the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, and others.

Study: Drop the Needle; A Temperature Stable Oral Tablet Vaccine Is Protective against Respiratory Viral Pathogens. Image Credit: MoonRock/Shutterstock Background Next-generation vaccines must be formulated, manufactured, and administered readily to combat the emerging viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and avert future pandemics. Although innovative vaccines were formulated and manufactured in record time during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, factors such as slow distribution and storage requirements hindered rapid vaccine rollout. Moreover, vaccine reluctance in developed countries, particularly regarding injections, stymies adequate vaccination rates. Hence, next-generation vaccines require novel strategies to prevent severe disease and infection and minimize community transmission of respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. A vaccine tablet stable at room temperature, which uses a molecular toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) adjuvant and non-replicating adenoviral vector 5 (rAd5) technique, has been developed recently. This oral rAd5 modular vaccine technology has been assessed in multiple phase I and II clinical studies, including trials for SARS-CoV-2, norovirus, and influenza, and could be used against various pathogenic viruses. About the study In the present study, the researchers analyzed the mechanism of the mucosal and systemic antigen-specific responses elicited by the oral rAd5-based vaccine tablet against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in both preclinical and clinical studies. The researchers analyzed various types of next-generation vaccines, including oral and intramuscularly administered vaccines’ distribution, formulation, and manufacturing timelines in a pandemic. They subsequently assessed the advantages of the orally administered rAd-based vaccines relative to the intramuscularly delivered rAd-based and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. Further, the differences between the humoral and cellular responses elicited by the mucosal and parenteral vaccinations were estimated. The authors assessed the ability of the oral rAd5 vaccine-induced mucosal humoral responses to protect against viral infection and limit transmission. The team also evaluated novel immune correlates for mucosal vaccines. Finally, the authors determined if the oral rAd-based vaccines exhibit anti-vector responses as observed in the rAd-based parenteral vaccines. Findings The study results illustrated that the oral rAd-based vaccine tablet could be prepared and released in <16 weeks after the antigen design is finalized and used without the requirement of a cold chain. The oral rAd5 tablet vaccine has various benefits relative to standard needle-based vaccination strategies such as triggering protective immune responses at primary infection sites. Related StoriesPublic trust in COVID-19 vaccine science influences vaccine uptake in the USAfrican production of mpox vaccines could secure the continent’s healthCleveland Clinic presents new findings on triple-negative breast cancer vaccineSeveral preclinical and clinical assessments depicted that oral rAd5-based immunization induces T cells and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) that display mucosal homing integrins and improve immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses specific to pathogens. An influenza human challenge research found that combining mucosal-directed cellular and humoral responses affords increased protection against respiratory pathogens. Recent reports demonstrated that the determinants of immunity imparted by an oral rAd5 mucosal vaccine were distinct, including α4β7+ integrin and ASCs, relative to the presently authorized parenteral vaccines. The needle-based systemic vaccine administration has effectively established long-standing immunity to several human pathogens. However, a vaccine platform based on an oral rAd5 tablet has unique benefits over the existing parenteral vaccines, as it could be stored at room temperature, rapidly produced, and easily administered. Oral vaccination with rAd-based tablet induced mucosal antigen-specific responses and limited disease transmission to naïve animals. The anti-vector responses that hinder immunogenicity had a less significant role in orally delivered rAd vaccine tablets than the injected rAd vaccine. Altogether, oral rAd5 vaccines were proven to be safe, immunogenic, and well-tolerated while also demonstrating a unique distribution benefit as a room temperature-stable tablet that could be self-administered and shipped globally. Hence, the deployment of an oral rAd5 tablet-based and room temperature-stable vaccine will be a game-changing technology that will significantly reduce the worldwide burden of pathogenic viral infections. Conclusions Overall, the study findings demonstrated that the oral vaccine based on rAd5 modular technology containing a unique molecular TLR3 adjuvant is deliverable via tablet and does not require injections. This room temperature-stable, enterically coated vaccine tablet induces strong antigen-specific IgAs in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and stimulates mucosal homing adhesion molecules on circulating T and B cells. This innovative vaccine strategy has been tested against various influenza antigens and exhibited effectiveness in both preclinical animal experiments and phase I/II clinical studies, including a human challenge investigation. The oral rAd5 vaccine platform approach is a viable new route for assisting in timely pandemic preparedness and equal vaccine distribution throughout the world. Additionally, the authors stated that further studies evaluating multiple cellular, mucosal, and serum endpoints are required to establish the immunogenicity and identify the determinants of the oral rAd5-based mucosal vaccine tablet efficacy.

(April 6)APThe U.S. is seeing its worst bird flu outbreak in seven years, distressing the poultry industry and sending chicken meat and egg prices skyrocketing ahead of the Easter holiday.And Indiana — which is first nationally in duck production, second for eggs and third for turkeys — is ground zero. The first case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza detected in a commercial flock was reported at a turkey farm in Dubois County on Feb. 8. Since then, the disease has spread to farms and backyards across more than half the country and killed nearly 25 million birds, including more than 180,000 in Indiana.Turkeys and chickens — both for meat and laying eggs — have been hit the hardest. During last week, however, the first case of bird flu in a commercial duck flock in the U.S. was detected in northern Indiana’s Elkhart County, according to Rebecca Joniskan, president of the Indiana State Poultry Association. And a second duck farm in the county tested positive on Tuesday. That area of the state has some of the highest poultry production in the U.S., which puts many farms at risk, according to the Indiana Board of Animal Health. “There is a lot of concern and anxiety within the poultry sector right now,” said Denise Derrer Spears, spokeswoman with the state animal health board. “These are tough times for everyone and all of the farmers we are hearing from are on high alert.” Bird flu cases across the country have spiked in recent weeks, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of March 25, the agency reported 69 flocks with positive cases. By April 12, that number was 170 flocks across 26 states. That exceeds the number of states that were impacted by the 2015 outbreak, which peaked in the late spring between April and May. The USDA describes that event as “the largest poultry health disaster in U.S. history.” The 2015 outbreak mainly hit the Mississippi Flyway, which follows the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and includes several major poultry states such as Indiana. That is the same region being pummeled now. Roughly 50 million birds were killed or destroyed during the 2015 outbreak over the course of six months. This year’s outbreak is already at half of that number after just two months. Bird flu: Indiana outbreak of bird flu continues to growThe bird flu poses a low risk to humans, federal officials said, and proper handling and heating of food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills any bacteria and viruses present. Joniskan stressed that birds affected by this disease do not make their way into the food supply. Still, the economy and grocery prices have not been immune to the effects. Bird flu is driving up consumer prices for eggs and chicken meat that already were on the rise because of inflation. That’s because of all the egg-laying chickens and those for meat that have been impacted by the disease. The weekly average prices for a dozen large eggs is nearly three times what it was this time last year, according to a USDA egg market report. The cost of a dozen eggs neared $3 dollars in recent weeks, which is highly unusual compared to market research. The average price of chicken breasts in the U.S. last week also rose to above $4 per pound at major supermarkets, according to USDA data. Last year, the price was more than $1 cheaper. After the 2015 outbreak, it took several more months for the prices to normalize, according to the agricultural agency. In Indiana, dozens of farms with egg-layers and broiler chickens, or those for meat, have been affected. With the the latest positive cases in Elkhart County, the state is issuing quarantines at the two farms and all other farms within a 10-kilometer radius. For the first farm, that includes 78 other operations, Derrer Spears said. The number of farms affected around the second site is not yet known. Of the 78 operations, 31 are farms that produce table eggs or eggs for hatching, 25 produce chicken meat and the remaining 22 are duck farms, the state said. An additional 200 farms are in a surveillance zone beyond the quarantine control area and are being monitored."Preparedness is right up there in the top two to three things we do," Joniskan said. "While we don't welcome the disease, we do spend time making sure that if it arrives, we can deal with it and handle it responsibly and return to good production." Those farms in the control area must be tested at least weekly, and more often if products such as eggs or birds are moving in and out of the radius. The first round of testing of the 78 commercial flocks was completed over the weekend and all results are negative so far, Derrer Spears said. The second farm is outside that initial control area.That means the states can issue permits so shipments can head out in the afternoons and evenings, she added. Such sampling must be done anytime a farm wants to move product, and this process will continue for several weeks until the control area is lifted. That will happen when the infected farm is completely cleaned and disinfected and disposal of the culled ducks begins. All ducks at the first farm where the most recent outbreak was detected — roughly 4,600 — were killed to contain the spread. This case was discovered on April 7 when the farmer noticed that the ducks were not eating normally, Derrer Spears said. Depopulation is underway at the second farm, which has an estimated 6,000 ducks. The Elkhart cases come more than two weeks after the previous control areas in southern Indiana had been lifted on March 23. Six turkey farms in Dubois and Greene counties had tested positive for bird flu in February and early March, resulting in the destruction of more than 170,000 birds. All of the affected Indiana farms are eligible for indemnity payments from the USDA based on the market value of the birds they lost, Derrer Spears said. They also can be reimbursed for the costs of cleaning, disinfection and disposal. She does not know if any payments have been made at this time.Still, those payments rarely make the farmer completely whole, Joniskan said, and there will be some losses for the farm involved. The southern Indiana farms had made “great progress with clean up and virus elimination” and no new cases had been detected in a month, according to the state. As a result, Indiana officials were cautiously optimistic. “With wild bird migration still happening, we have continued to remain hopeful, but cautious about getting through this season without any more cases in Indiana,” Derrer Spears said. “Unfortunately, that was not to be.” Endangered species: 5 species Indiana has worked to restoreThe avian flu viruses are fairly common in wild migratory birds and waterfowl, according to Derrer Spears, and wild ducks and geese that contract the disease will spread it in their droppings as they fly. Joniskan said that poultry farmers are not seeing lateral spread from farm-to-farm the way the industry was in 2015. She believes many of the biosecurity measures put in place after that outbreak are helping to prevent such spread — "but it continues to be a dangerous disease." Surveillance activities by USDA’s Wildlife Services during February and March did detect bird flu in one wild Redhead duck, according to state director Lee Humberg. The state office is not currently conducting any surveillance work related to the recent detection in Elkhart, Humberg said, but national efforts are ongoing. The U.S. has the strongest bird flu surveillance program in the world, according to the USDA, and the agency is working with its partners to look for the disease in commercial poultry farms, live bird markets and migratory bird populations.The agency recommends that anyone involved in poultry production — small backyard flocks to commercial operations — review biosecurity guidelines to protect the health of their birds. Information can be found at healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.All bird owners should prevent contact between wild birds and their birds, bringing them inside when possible, and report sick birds or unusual deaths to state and federal officials.

With avian flu issues in Ontario, experts are advising people with backyard chickens to watch for signs of it among their flocks and take precautions. (Richard Agecoutay/CBC )Social SharingAs avian influenza spreads across Ontario, officials are urging people with backyard chickens to pay attention to potential signs of infection in their flocks.They're also warning people not to feed wild birds by hand and to ensure bird feeders are kept clean to curb potential spread of the flu.Shayan Sharif, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph, said bird flu is a growing problem in Ontario and across Canada."There seems to be more and more spread of this virus," Sharif, who researches chicken immunity, said in an interview."And I wouldn't be surprised if I saw more spread here in Ontario and perhaps in our neighbouring provinces, including in Quebec and Manitoba."The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says there have been 11 instances of avian flu being confirmed in Ontario poultry flocks between March 27 and April 10. That includes three backyard flocks in Prince Edward County, the Township of Selwyn and the Township of Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation.As well, a wild bird — a red-tailed hawk — was found to have the flu in the Waterloo area in mid-March.In a technical briefing Monday afternoon, officials noted more than 260,000 birds have died of avian flu or have been "depopulated" as part of the national response to the virus. In Ontario, more than 84,000 birds died of flu or have been euthanized.Dr. Mary-Jane Ireland, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's chief veterinarian officer, says this is an unprecedented year for avian flu in Canada and around the world. (CBC)Mary Jane Ireland, Canada's chief veterinary officer, said it's been an "unprecedented year" for avian flu around the globe, with significant spread in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. She said it's the largest number of cases in multiple provinces in recent memory and the first time Canada has seen H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain.When asked why avian flu has been so widespread this year, she said it's because there's a high number of wild, migratory birds with the virus."The environmental pressure in migratory birds is very high right now and I think that's the reason."Keep backyard chickens apart from wild birdsAvian flu isn't only a threat to large poultry farms, but it can impact backyard flocks, CFIA says. Bird owners are legally responsible to notify authorities if their animals become sick.Ireland noted infected birds can shed the virus through saliva, nasal secretions and feces, and it can be spread through bird-to-bird contact or if the birds touch surfaces contaminated with the virus, including food dishes, a person's shoes or the tools used to clean out coops.Ireland said steps people with backyard chickens can take to prevent wild birds from coming in contact with chickens include keeping food and water away from wild birds, and cleaning up spills so as to not attract unwanted birds.Cleaning is also critical at this time, CFIA says on its website"No equipment should be shared with or borrowed from other bird owners. Always clean your hands, clothing and footwear before and after handling birds."As well, visitors to where chickens are kept should be limited, as humans can spread bird flu.Any new chickens should be kept separate from others for at least 30 days before integrating them into the flock, CFIA says. Owners of backyard chickens should also keep their eyes out for the following symptoms that may indicate the birds are sick: High mortality and sudden death. Decreased food consumption. Huddling, depression, closed eyes. Respiratory signs (coughing and sneezing). Decreased egg production. Watery greenish diarrhea. Excessive thirst. Swollen wattles and combs. WATCH | Presence of bird flu in Ontario puts farmers on edge:Presence of bird flu in Ontario puts farmers on edge3 years agoDuration 1:51Farmers in Ontario are keeping a close eye on a deadly strain of bird flu that’s forced some poultry farms into quarantine. At least one expert says consumers shouldn’t be worried because it’s ‘extremely unlikely’ the virus will make its way into the supply chain.Take precautions feeding wild birdsElizabeth Walsh, a Nova Scotia Lands and Forestry wildlife biologist, told CBC News that people with backyard bird feeders might want to consider removing them for the time being."Removing feeders will help stop the virus from spreading. I do realize people enjoy their feeders. However, as a bird lover, we also want to be making sure that … our wild populations are safe," she said.Christopher Sharp, a population management biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ontario, said he's not asking people to take down bird feeders just yet.But he does recommend against feeding ducks and other waterfowl in parks right now."Feeding encourages wild birds to congregate around a food source and can increase the probability of transmission among wild birds," Sharp said in an interview."We do still consider the use of bird feeders as safe, but they should be removed from areas that are open to poultry or other domestic animals."Sharp said backyard bird enthusiasts should also clean their feeders more frequently. He recommends using a weak solution of regular bleach, then ensuring the feeders are rinsed well and dry before putting them back out.When it comes to feeding some birds, like chickadees, by hand, Sharp recommends not doing that for now because "all wild birds can contract the virus."Sharif agreed that people with backyard feeders need to take extra precautions to avoid spreading the flu. "As much as I want to attract the beautiful birds in Ontario to my backyard, this is probably not the best time for that."With files from Richard RaycraftCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Avian flu poses 'significant risk' to Canadian poultry farms as cases reported in multiple provinces Farmers on alert as avian flu found on 4th southern Ontario farm Bird feeders can help spread deadly avian flu, cautions N.S. wildlife biologist Feeding and touching birds could help spread avian flu, expert warnsExternal Links CFIA: Avian Influenza - What to expect if your animals are infectedFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Study: Myopericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: LookerStudio/Shutterstock Background Studies have reported several cases of myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in adolescents and young adults. However, there is insufficient knowledge regarding the mechanism of pathogenesis of myopericarditis post-COVID-19 vaccination. About the study In the present meta-analysis, the researchers compared the presentation of myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination to that after vaccination against other diseases such as influenza, smallpox, and mixed infections. The study also estimated the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis and the related mortality rates post-vaccination. The team searched databases including MEDLINE, Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus for relevant studies and collected data using a prespecified data extraction form. They also evaluated the number of patients suffering from myopericarditis, the total number of vaccines administered, and the related incidence rate. The team defined myopericarditis as an umbrella term that described myocarditis and/or pericarditis. Furthermore, the overall certainty of the evidence was calculated via the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, And Evaluations (GRADE) approach. The researchers examined the difference in the incidence of myopericarditis among subpopulations that were prespecified based on the type of vaccine administered, which were either COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 vaccines such as influenza and smallpox vaccines, either messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID-19 or non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and the age group, which was divided into the pediatric or adult population. Furthermore, the incidence of myopericarditis was compared based on gender and the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of myopericarditis following any vaccination, while the secondary outcomes were the incidences of myocarditis and pericarditis and the related mortality rates after any vaccination. Results A total of 156 full-text publications and 22 observational studies were analyzed, which included 4,05,272,721 vaccine doses. Among the studies, 11 reported 3,95,361,933 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, six reported 2,900,274 doses of smallpox vaccines, two reported 1,521,782 doses of influenza vaccines, and three reported other non-COVID-19 vaccines. Out of the nine studies that described the type of COVID-19 vaccines, 2,90,730,653 and 51,969,677 doses were of mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines, respectively.

Meta-analysis highlights potential ICU reductionThe team reported an overall myopericarditis incidence of 33.3 cases per million vaccine doses. The overall incidence of myopericarditis did not substantially differ after the administration of COVID-19 vaccines compared to non-COVID-19 vaccines. However, a comparison of the COVID-19 vaccine with each non-COVID-19 vaccine showed a remarkable difference between different subpopulations. The incidence of myopericarditis was 1.3 per million doses of influenza vaccine, 132.1 per million doses of smallpox vaccine, and 57 per million doses of other non-COVID-19 vaccines. The incidence of myopericarditis did not significantly differ between adults (aged 18 years and above) and pediatric populations. However, substantially higher myopericarditis incidence was observed in mRNA vaccinees compared to non-mRNA vaccinees. Furthermore, among COVID-19-vaccinees, males aged below and above 30 years had a 10-fold and three-fold higher susceptibility to myopericarditis, respectively, than females aged above 30 years. Additionally, doubly vaccinated individuals showed a higher incidence of myopericarditis than those who were singly vaccinated. Furthermore, the study found that age was negatively correlated to the incidence of myopericarditis in COVID-19 vaccinees. In addition, the incidence of myopericarditis was 16 cases per million doses of any vaccine. Altogether, the likelihood of myopericarditis incidence was lower in COVID-19 vaccinees than in non-COVID-19 vaccinees. To summarize, the study findings showed that the overall incidence of myopericarditis after receiving COVID-19 vaccines was similar to that after influenza vaccination and lower than that after smallpox vaccination. The researchers believe that the individual decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine should be made after considering both the benefits and harm associated with the vaccine.

The samples are being verified at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.The duck flock has an estimated 6,000 birds, the Indiana agency said.The animal health board in an announcement did not say whether the ducks would be destroyed, as happened with six turkey farms in southern Indiana's Dubois and Greene counties. The board also did not disclose whether the birds at the first duck farm would be destroyed when it announced the detection of bird flu there last week.Pending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus that has been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, the board said.So far this year, there have been cases of bird flu in 24 states affecting chickens, turkeys and ducks.The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.Latest in SafetySponsoredSecurity Breach PodcastNovember 1, 2024Boil Water Advisories Can Be ConfusingNovember 1, 20241st U.S. Case of Bird Flu in a Pig Raises Concerns Over Potential Human ThreatOctober 31, 2024Colorado Teen Fights Kidney Failure After Eating McDonald's Quarter PoundersOctober 30, 2024Related StoriesSafetyCDC Calls for Expanded Bird Flu Testing Amid Farmworker InfectionsSafetyBoil Water Advisories Can Be ConfusingSafety1st U.S. Case of Bird Flu in a Pig Raises Concerns Over Potential Human ThreatSponsor Content5 Most Common Small Manufacturing Challenges According to ConsultantsMore in SafetySponsoredIntegrated Systems For Your Food ApplicationPartner with a systems integrator and gain a competitive edge for your business.

That means people with backyard chickens need to protect their flocks, no matter how small.Ministry of Agriculture, poultry industry, call on all chicken owners to practise biosecurityCBC News · Posted: Apr 13, 2022 6:10 PM EDT | Last Updated: April 14, 2022Chickens living in a backyard coop in a home on a busy street in Victoria, B.C. (Kathryn Marlow/CBC )Social SharingB.C. poultry farmers are working hard to keep the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza from their flocks — and they're asking backyard chicken owners to do the same. On April 14, the province announced the first case of the flu in a poultry flock. A farm in B.C.'s North Okanagan is now under quarantine. Before that, one wild bird in British Columbia had been identified with the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu. The eagle was found in Stanley Park in early February, and later died. In other provinces, the virus has already infected flocks, causing more than 250,00 birds to die or be euthanized. At least 31 U.S. states have seen cases of the flu. Avian flu poses 'significant risk' to Canadian poultry farms as cases reported in multiple provincesJennifer Woike and her family, who run Farmer Ben's Eggs, a third generation egg farm on Vancouver Island, says if a small flock of chickens in B.C. were to get sick, the flu could end up traveling to a large producer like hers — and vice versa."That includes those who raise hens in their backyard," said Woike. "They may not have the knowledge or understanding or awareness that this disease could happen in our area with the migratory bird routes."Bird feeders are OK but keep wild birds from backyard chickens as avian flu spreads in Ontario: expertsBirds that winter in the south are currently migrating north, either stopping to rest in B.C. or settling here for the summer. They risk bringing the flu with them. "Anybody who owns poultry should be very concerned about avian flu," said Katie Lowe, executive director of the B.C. Egg Marketing Board. "We want to stop it before it gets into any flock whatsoever." Biosecurity is key Farms like Woike's already have strict biosecurity practices in place to prevent the transmission of pathogens like avian flu.Lowe says backyard chicken keepers should do the same."The best protection for everybody to keep all the flocks in the province safe is biosecurity. That is our best line of defence." So what does that mean? Lowe says chicken owners should make sure their flocks are indoors. If there's no building for them, they should be kept apart from wild birds and other animals with chicken wire or netting. She says owners should also be careful they don't accidentally spread the virus to their animals. To do that, owners should wash and sanitize their hands and put on clean clothing and shoes before interacting with the chickens. Once done, they should wash and sanitize their hands again. Finally, any sick birds must be reported. Sick birds may lay fewer eggs, drink less water and seem listless. The virus hits quickly and can kill birds within 48 hours. Information on how to report can be found here. The H5N1 strain is of little concern to human health.

It’s becoming an industry standard. Marina Bolotnikova April 14 2022, 8:00 a.m. Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Screenshot: The Intercept / North Carolina State University footage that Animal Outlook obtained via FOIA. A hen, hooked up to electrodes, stands alone in a glass cage. She starts panting, thrashing, slumping over, and lunging at the enclosure’s walls, appearing to look for an escape. Outside the cage, researchers point, take notes, and watch her die. These scenes, which took place at North Carolina State University, were documented in 10 hours of video footage recently obtained via public records requests by the organization Animal Outlook and shared with The Intercept. The experiments were funded by the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, a major industry trade group, and took place in the wake of the 2015 outbreak of an aggressive bird flu that resulted in the culling of about 50 million farmed birds — not all of them necessarily infected — across the United States. The researchers were testing what was then a relatively new set of disease control methods: known as “ventilation shutdown,” the process kills the animals through heatstroke and suffocation, similar to dying in a hot car. According to Will Lowrey, the Animal Outlook attorney who obtained the videos, “the suffering is extremely profound.” In 2020, Iowa Select Farms, the state’s largest pork producer, killed healthy pigs, who could not be slaughtered for food due to Covid-induced slaughterhouse closures, by sealing off the airways and pumping in heat: a practice called “ventilation shutdown plus.” In a groundbreaking undercover investigation covered by The Intercept, the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere revealed pigs screaming in distress for hours as they, essentially, roasted to death. Soon after, Iowa Select announced that it was discontinuing its use of the method, commonly abbreviated as VSD+. New documents obtained through federal and state public records requests reveal that, far from being an aberration, the meat industry’s use of this gruesome method is still on the rise — and it’s being abetted by government and organized veterinary medicine. Now, another strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, is tearing through the country. More than 27 million chickens, turkeys, and other birds have been killed or scheduled to be killed — or “depopulated,” in meat industry jargon — since February. Many of these animals were killed with ventilation shutdown plus. In Iowa, the nation’s top egg-producing state, 5.3 million hens at a Rembrandt Enterprises egg factory farm were exterminated with VSD+ last month, the Storm Lake Times reported. (Asked to confirm this report, Chloe Carson, communications director for Iowa’s agriculture department, told The Intercept that she could not disclose the method and denied specifying it to the newspaper, though the story says she confirmed it was the method used. Tom Cullen, the story’s author, said he stands by his reporting and that he’d spoken to local personnel and former company employees with knowledge of the method. When contacted by The Intercept, Sheila Hagen, Rembrandt’s vice president of HR and legal, immediately hung up.) Ventilation shutdown plus was also used in February at two chicken and turkey facilities in Kentucky, according to records from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, which oversees management of farm animal disease outbreaks. In Minnesota, more than 1.7 million birds, mostly turkeys, have been or will soon be depopulated since the state’s first avian flu case on March 25, with an increasing number killed using VSD+ compared to the 2015 bird flu, according to state veterinarian Beth Thompson. In public records first released to Lowrey, requests to use the method have also appeared in Wisconsin and Missouri. The USDA financially compensates meat producers for these killings.

I'm in The videos obtained from NC State are remarkable because the meat industry often claims that undercover footage of cruel conditions taken by activists is doctored or staged. But these videos came directly from an industry-funded study, the raw footage of which was shared with The Intercept. The research tested multiple versions of VSD: ventilation shutdown alone, which entails sealing off airflow to the birds’ cages, causing their body temperatures to rise to lethal levels; ventilation shutdown with additional heat, which speeds the process of killing them via heatstroke; and ventilation shutdown with carbon dioxide, which deprives the chickens’ bodies of oxygen. VSD with the addition of either or both of these is referred to as “VSD+.” The hens took more than 91 minutes to die from ventilation shutdown alone, 54 minutes to die from VSD with supplemental heat, and 11.5 minutes to die from VSD with carbon dioxide, according to a 2017 final report based on the research that was submitted to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association. According to a separate study published the following year by some of the same researchers, time to death is significantly longer for hens in a large, multilevel cage setting, which more closely resembles factory farm conditions than individual cages: 3.75 hours for VSD alone, 2 hours for VSD plus heat, and 1.5 hours for VSD plus carbon dioxide. In some news reports on the current avian flu, sources have said that exterminating birds is more humane than letting them die of the disease. And HPAI is undoubtedly a terrible illness. “Many birds die suddenly, with mortality rates as high as 100% within a few days, though it can also take weeks. The dying birds likely suffer enormously as they struggle to breathe, develop diarrhea, and become paralyzed or otherwise neurologically compromised,” Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary adviser to the Animal Welfare Institute, told The Intercept in an email. In their 2015 funding proposal — asking the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association for $110,075 to support the experiments — the NC State researchers wrote, “The objective is to examine the humane aspects and effectiveness of ventilation shut down (VSD) for depopulating laying hens in cage systems,” but “humane” is not defined in the proposal. “However unpleasant, it should be a primary goal that depopulation (euthanasia) methods strive to meet these standards within the context of the extreme need scale in which VSD would be used.” Other common methods of killing poultry birds — carbon dioxide poisoning and suffocation with firefighting foam — are not as effective on birds used in egg production as on those in meat production, the proposal says. Egg-laying hens in factory farms are typically kept in cramped, vertically stacked battery cages, while chickens raised for meat are packed together on the floor. Although the test conditions shown in the footage — individual hens killed inside plexiglass cubes — aren’t the same environment as a factory farm, the videos suggest the degree of panic and suffering birds experience when they’re killed with VSD. “These are birds in extreme distress,” said Sherstin Rosenberg, a veterinarian who has cared for thousands of chickens and other poultry birds at an animal sanctuary in California, after reviewing the NC State footage. “They are literally fighting for their lives, they’re gasping for air, they’re struggling.” The videos don’t have any audio, but Rosenberg added: “These birds look like they’re vocalizing to me. I think they were probably crying out.” In the global scientific community, she said, “it’s generally accepted that, if one could assume that a procedure would cause pain or distress to a human, you can also assume it would do the same for an animal.” Most Read Congress Is About to Gift Trump Sweeping Powers to Crush His Political Enemies Noah Hurowitz The Answer to Trump’s Victory Is Radical Action Natasha Lennard Trump Didn’t Win Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris Lost It. Akela Lacy Birds used in agricultural research get no protection under federal welfare laws. “The Animal Welfare Act, in the very definition of animals, excludes a number of types of animals used in laboratory experiments. These animals include rats, mice, and birds bred for research, as well as agricultural animals used for agricultural research,” said Jeremy Beckham, research advocacy coordinator for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. The agricultural exemption, he added, is “specifically [because] there are things done commonly to animals in an agricultural context that would be violations of the law if they were done to other research animals.” The names of the researchers were redacted from public records obtained by Animal Outlook. But the 2017 final report lists the lead investigator as Kenneth Anderson, a professor in NC State’s Prestage Department of Poultry Science. Listed as co-investigators were professors Kimberly Livingston, Sanjay Shah, and Mike Martin, who is now North Carolina’s state veterinarian. Wallace Berry of Auburn University is listed as a collaborator. At NC State, the Prestage Department of Poultry Science advertises its “strong industry ties” and is named for the Prestage family, the owners of Prestage Farms, a poultry and pork company headquartered in North Carolina. “If you keep a house full of infected birds, and the pathogens spread through the ventilation air, soon you have many more farms infected. So rapid depopulation is vital,” Shah wrote in an email to The Intercept. “If you just turn off the ventilation system and seal the house, it takes longer for the birds to die than if you provided heat to speed up the process. Of course, CO2 would be faster but we might have supply issues in the event of a large scale outbreak. While the depopulation methods we investigated are not painless, neither are poultry diseases such as avian influenza that has recently infected many farms in NC. Chickens infected with respiratory diseases such as avian influenza also suffer shortness of breath and other painful symptoms and the suffering continues to happen for several days until death occurs. I wish there were less painful options.” An employee in Martin’s office suggested contacting “the university” about the study, adding that “in North Carolina we are using the foaming method to depopulate infected flocks for High Path Avian Influenza.” Livingston was unreachable, and neither Anderson nor Berry responded to The Intercept’s requests for comment, nor did NC State’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which approved the research. Thanks in part to the NC State researchers’ work, the use of ventilation shutdown at U.S. factory farms is increasing in several states. The American Veterinary Medical Association’s depopulation guidelines cite NC State’s research when listing VSD+ as a kill method “permitted in constrained circumstances.” The guidelines note that “a humane approach to the depopulation of animals is warranted, justifiable, and expected by society, but may not be actualized in some cases.” They don’t claim that VSD+ is humane but instead view it as a last resort. In email correspondence from March obtained by Lowrey in a public records request, Tyson Foods requested and received permission from the Missouri state veterinarian to depopulate a chicken facility with VSD+. USDA records show that only one HPAI outbreak has been reported in Stoddard County, Missouri, so far this year. It was detected on the day before the email from Tyson was sent, making it almost certain that the nearly 300,000-bird facility was owned by the meat industry giant. In an email to Lowrey, USDA spokesperson Lyndsay Cole confirmed these chickens were killed with a combination of foam (a method that suffocates birds under a blanket of foam) and VSD. In another email, pertaining to another one of the country’s largest depopulations so far — 2.7 million hens at Cold Spring Egg Farm in Jefferson County, Wisconsin — an APHIS veterinarian asked, “Are we starting VSD+ tomorrow?” Neither Tyson nor Cold Spring Egg Farm responded to The Intercept’s requests for comment. The vast majority of depopulated birds haven’t tested positive for HPAI. If the virus is detected in even one bird, all the birds in the flock must be killed, even if they live in separate sheds. But the decision to resort to cruel cull methods like VSD+ is a crisis of the meat industry’s making. “The tragedy here is that our current methods of raising birds for food production, in enormous sheds with millions of stressed, nearly genetically identical birds in close proximity to one another, has resulted in a situation where outbreaks of diseases like HPAI are nearly inevitable and few options exist for humanely killing infected birds,” Reyes-Illg, the Animal Welfare Institute veterinary adviser, wrote to The Intercept. “Killing methods that are more humane than killing via heatstroke require planning and preparation, and some … require more research to be commercially viable, and none of this seems to be a priority for the industry.” By one count, more than 1,500 U.S. veterinarians, including Reyes-Illg, have urged the American Veterinary Medical Association to reclassify VSD+ as not recommended. AVMA guidelines themselves aren’t legally binding, but they often become the basis for policy. APHIS’s policy on managing bird flu, which draws from the AVMA’s guidelines, states that VSD+ should only be used if other methods — foam or carbon dioxide — won’t be available in time. Foaming is “cruel but not as bad as VSD+,” Reyes-Illg said. As long as animals are mass produced for food, there will be a need to cull animals in emergencies, and companies have an obligation to prepare for that scenario by having supplies on hand to do it in the least cruel way possible, said Peter Sandøe, a bioethicist at the University of Copenhagen. “Not to embark on such preparations in light of what happened recently” — during the mass exterminations of healthy farm animals due to Covid-19 — “is a sign of a dreadful cynicism and lack of compassion on the side of the industry,” Sandøe added in an email. In the European Union, neither VSD nor firefighting foam are considered acceptable kill methods. USDA records indicate that VSD was used to kill birds at four facilities in Indiana in 2016, before the NC State research was published. But the NC State report is the only scientific research cited in the AVMA guidelines on ventilation shutdown in birds, though other studies have since been published on the method in birds and pigs. “I think the AVMA looked to [the NC State] studies and others as some aspect of legitimacy. To say, ‘Yes, this is doable, it’s not that bad,’” said Lowrey, the Animal Outlook attorney. A 2021 letter from the Animal Welfare Institute to the AVMA criticizes the NC State report on numerous scientific grounds and states that it “was so poorly written and/or edited that it was difficult at times to discern what the author was attempting to communicate.” The study uses something called “heat shock protein 70” as a measure of stress in the hens, which both the Animal Welfare Institute and Sherstin Rosenberg said is not a legitimate measure of the animals’ welfare. The funding proposal said the researchers planned to measure corticosterone, a more accepted measure of stress, but the final report makes no mention of it. “State animal health officials and producers carefully weigh the different options to determine the best option for humane depopulation and do not make such decisions lightly,” USDA spokesperson Mike Stepien told The Intercept in an email. “Ventilation shutdown plus heat or CO2 (VSD+) is at times the only method available to meet the 24–48-hour goal to depopulate the birds and end their suffering from the disease.” But if a company can perform VSD plus carbon dioxide, then presumably they have access to carbon dioxide and can kill their birds with CO2 gassing alone — a method Reyes-Illg called “relatively humane” compared to VSD. Stepien explained that “ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) heat is the only VSD+ that has been used in the United States. VSD+ CO2 is theoretical and not yet practical.” As cruel as VSD is in controlled lab experiments like NC State’s, there is evidence that its real-world implementation on factory farms is botched, resulting in animals being thrown away alive. In undercover video footage of the depopulation at Rembrandt Enterprises (as identified by activists and confirmed by The Intercept with images from Google Maps and Rembrandt’s website) last month, Direct Action Everywhere documented dead hens being moved by conveyor belts into dump trucks. But numerous hens caught on film were still alive and left behind inside the battery cage facility, and one was still alive and standing outside after being dumped. Rosenberg said it’s easy to mistake live animals who have been unsuccessfully killed in depopulation for dead. “Based on the large number of birds who are alive, healthy, and alert in the footage, it is a certainty that many more who appeared dead were buried alive,” she wrote in a professional opinion after reviewing Direct Action Everywhere’s videos. With millions of hens hastily exterminated at the facility, even a small proportion of them unsuccessfully killed could result in thousands dumped alive. This is at odds with the AVMA’s standards, which state that VSD+ is permitted in “constrained circumstances” only when “applied in a manner that will produce a 100% mortality rate.” Whatever the kill method used, factory farm conditions make it exceedingly difficult to carry out depopulations with full mortality, Rosenberg said. “We can quibble about degrees of suffering,” she said. “But in the end, they’re all just terrible methods of killing.” Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp Contact the author: Marina Bolotnikova marinanbolotnikova@gmail.com Related Extreme Utah Bill Seeks to Restrict Regulation of Animal Industries Chickens Severely Mistreated at “Humane” California Slaughterhouse, New Video Alleges After Pork Giant Was Exposed for Cruel Killings, the FBI Pursued Its Critics Animal Rights Activists Uncover the Locations of Thousands of Factory Farms Latest Stories Congress Is About to Gift Trump Sweeping Powers to Crush His Political Enemies Noah Hurowitz - Nov. 10 The House is set to vote Tuesday on a bill that would let the administration destroy nonprofits it claims support terrorism.

(Kathryn Marlow/CBC )Social SharingA poultry farm in B.C.'s North Okanagan has been placed under quarantine after a highly contagious and deadly bird flu was detected in its poultry flock, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).The federal agency confirmed the presence of pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in the poultry flock on April 13.Officials placed the infected farm under quarantine, and have begun an investigation into the source of the virus.The CFIA says it will also begin bringing in controls at other farms in the same area. The exact location of the infected farm has not been disclosed.Officials say there is no threat to human health as yet.Last week, the federal agency issued a warning to poultry farms across the country after government authorities began tracking avian flu cases in 12 farms in several provinces, including Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta and Quebec.Avian flu case detected on duck farm in Quebec's Eastern TownshipsVirus spreads through wild birdsIt said the avian flu is spreading through wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada. B.C.'s Ministry of Agriculture says it is working closely with federal agents to monitor the situation in the province."The CFIA is leading the investigation and response, with provincial support for testing, mapping, surveillance and disposal," said Minister Lana Popham.The ministry has also activated its emergency operations centre and will work with the CFIA, producers, industry and other stakeholders to effectively respond to this outbreak and any others that may occur in B.C.Food industry adjusting to large outbreak of avian flu in Canada, around the world"All poultry producers, including backyard poultry owners, are advised to increase their biosecurity practices and to be vigilant and monitor for signs of avian influenza in their flocks," Popham said.In B.C., bird and poultry owners are legally responsible to notify authorities of serious bird diseases such as avian influenza.If owners suspect the disease, they are asked to keep the birds on the property, and to call a local veterinarian or the Wild Bird Mortality Investigation Program hotline at 1-866-431-2473.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia An actor, a hockey reporter, a 12-year-old: These are some victims of B.C.'s toxic drug crisis Nature lovers at TED 2022 in Vancouver hope to keep people grounded for solutions to world problems B.C. communities struck by wildfires and floods brace for spring thawFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

A flock of American white pelicans float on Baker’s Lake on April 14, 2022, near Barrington.Since early February, more than 23 million birds in commercial flocks have been killed by avian flu or euthanized due to the outbreak, mostly outside of Illinois, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Cases have been reported in 24 states this year, with Iowa the hardest hit, The Associated Press reported. While poultry remains safe to eat as long as it’s properly cooked, the prices of eggs and other poultry-related foods are soaring.Federal and state officials said this is the worst avian influenza outbreak in the United States since 2015, when more than 50 million birds died from the flu or were euthanized.In Illinois, officials closed Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge and Emiquon Preserve in west-central Illinois from March 16 to March 25 after a likely outbreak among migratory geese. According to the USDA, avian flu was detected in a handful of wild birds found dead in Will, Champaign and other counties in March. The outbreak at Baker’s Lake appears to be the first large die-off of wild birds from the disease in Illinois, Anchor said. The state pathologist confirmed that seven double-crested cormorants discovered dead at the rookery tested positive for avian flu, he said.Anchor collected the birds a few days ago after wading into the lake near the rookery where he discovered hundreds dead, some of them floating among the cattails and vegetation. Hundreds of birds, including American white pelicans, great egrets and double-crested cormorants among others, crowd together on the rookery in Baker’s Lake on April 13, 2022, near Barrington.Though bird flu typically does not infect people, there have been some rare cases of human infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Anchor cautioned the public to avoid getting near or touching wild birds that look sick or are dead, especially aquatic birds and birds of prey.Lincoln Park Zoo, Brookfield Zoo and other institutions recently brought their birds in exhibits indoors to protect them from wild birds that may be passing along the disease. “It’s a precaution,” Anchor said.Avian flu, in particular, shows up in wild raptors, shorebirds, geese, ducks and other aquatic birds such as cormorants, as well as domestic chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese. And there are many different strains, some less lethal than others.“The recent one is very deadly,” said Michael P. Ward, senior ornithologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey. “If the bird gets it, it dies.”That’s one reason why many cormorants may have succumbed to the disease at Baker’s Lake. These birds are colonial nesters, breeding closely together, making transmission of the disease easy, Ward said.“There’s always avian flu going around, but this highly pathogenic version of it doesn’t show up often,” he said. “It’s usually found with waterfowl in tight areas and can cause a mass mortality event.”“It often burns itself out quickly,” Ward said, adding he hopes that’s what will happen with the birds at Baker’s Lake.Officials are remaining watchful because birds like cormorants are still migrating this time of year and can carry it with them to different areas. A double-crested cormorant circles around about 20 feet from the edge of Baker’s Lake on April 13, 2022.“Herons, egrets, cormorants all get together in these rookeries where the disease can spread rapidly,” Ward said.Though the chances of humans getting avian flu are very rare, Ward said, “It’s something we’re more concerned about these days, given that COVID (likely) jumped from wildlife to humans.”Avian influenza spreads through direct, bird-to-bird contact. It can also spread to birds via contaminated surfaces and materials, including people’s clothing, shoes or hands, according to the USDA.Birds that live in close quarters, like ducks and colonial nesters, are also susceptible to other diseases. Each summer, about a dozen of the birds at Baker’s Lake are found dead from a fungal disease called histoplasmosis or a viral disease called Newcastle disease, said Anchor. Both diseases affect domestic birds, and histoplasmosis can be transferred to humans.Anchor learned about the dead cormorants after being notified by Tom Regan, of Barrington, who was watching birds at Baker’s Lake.“I saw one dead bird and thought, ‘Oh, that’s not unusual with a big colony on the island. Then I see these others dying — about 10 or 20 — seeming to be writhing in pain,'” Regan said.Great egrets, which also nest at Baker’s Lake, were flying around and seemed OK, he said. Great egrets and double-crested cormorants were at one time listed as endangered breeding birds in Illinois.“When you see a large percentage of a population of birds disappear, it’s very dramatic and many people think it’s tragic,” Anchor said. “The birds become disoriented. They become uncoordinated. It’s part of nature.”Reporting these sightings is important, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. If people encounter five or more dead wild waterfowl, water birds or raptors in one location, they should contact their local IDNR district wildlife biologist (www.wildlifeillinois.org/sidebar/contact-an-idnr-district-wildlife-biologist) or USDA Wildlife Services at 866-487-3297.

Your biggest questions, answeredBy Kristine Tarbert | 3 years agoAs the weather gets colder, people are being encouraged to book in for their influenza vaccines, also known as flu jabs or flu shots.If you're eligible, you can get the influenza vaccine for free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). For those who aren't eligible, flu shots are available for a small fee (around $25) from pharmacies and GPs.Vaccination is a safe and effective way to protect you from serious disease caused by influenza and to protect against infection by influenza viruses. Here, we delve into some of the most common questions people might have about the flu shot.READ MORE: Are Aussies getting bored of dieting?Many people might be asking themselves should I get the 2022 flu vaccine? (Getty)Flu symptoms vs COVID symptoms"Influenza is a seasonal viral infection which can cause serious illness. It is caused by a different virus to both the common cold and COVID, although it can present with similar symptoms," Dr Emma Rees, GP Specialist and Founder of digital healthcare solution, Femma, tells 9Honey."If you contract the flu, symptoms will generally be worse and come on more suddenly than those of a common cold. You will often experience fevers, general body aches and fatigue. COVID can also cause respiratory and general symptoms and you can only definitively tell the difference between conditions is by performing a test."The number of cases and deaths in Australia from influenza each year fluctuates. In 2019, before the pandemic, 313,000 lab-confirmed cases and 953 deaths were reported — a number that was 2.7 times higher than the five-year average.In the first two years of the pandemic, flu numbers plummeted due to prevention measures used to content COVID spread. But experts are warning cases will rise again, especially with the emergence of the 'Superflu'.READ MORE: Doctor reveals what one night of bad sleep can do to your brainInfluenza affects people of all ages and can cause severe illness. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Why is it important to get the flu shot?"As flu is a viral infection, treatments are supportive, allowing the immune system a chance to fight the infection," Dr Rees explains."This means that it has the potential to cause serious illness in people with compromised immune systems. It is also very contagious and rapidly circulates in the community."Vaccinations help to prevent people from developing the flu and also reduce the severity of the disease in those who contract it but have been vaccinated."Evidence shows that less people are hospitalised and 31 per cent less people die as a result of contracting the flu when they have been vaccinated."Best time to get flu shot - and why do we need it yearly?Current recommendations are to get vaccinated from April, before the flu season, which generally occurs from June to September.Dr Rees there are two reasons why people are encouraged to have yearly vaccinations."Firstly, the flu virus constantly changes," she says. "Researchers anticipate which strains of the flu are likely to be most common in a particular season and the vaccines are updated to try and offer optimal protection against those strains."The second reason is that an individual's protection will decline over time and the vaccine will need to be updated to improve their immune protection. Evidence has shown that the best time frame for this is annually."Due to continuous changes in the virus and new strains, the World Health Organisation reviews and updates its recommendations for the composition of the vaccine annually. It selects the viruses (mutated versions of the virus) most likely to circulate in the coming season.The Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee uses this recommendation to determine the composition of influenza vaccines for use in Australia.Vaccines prompt the body's immune system to respond. (Getty)Who should get vaccinated?Ideally, everyone can benefit from a flu vaccination but there are certain groups of people who are at more risk of serious illness than others and the vaccination is offered for free for these people."In broad terms, adults over the age of 65, young children between the ages of six months and five, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the age of six months and pregnant women are all in this group," Dr Rees explains."Anyone over the age of five with a chronic medical condition including cardiac, respiratory, neurological, haematological, diabetes, renal and conditions compromising the immune system are also offered free vaccinations."It is worth speaking to your GP if you feel you may be in one of these groups. It is also advised that people working in high risk settings such as hospitals and aged care facilities are also vaccinated against influenza."READ MORE: Doctor reveals viral hack for a better sleepDr Emma Rees is a GP Specialist and Founder of digital healthcare solution, Femma. (Supplied)How effective are vaccines?"Understanding how effective the vaccine is really depends upon the health of the person being vaccinated and how well the vaccine and the circulating strains of influenza are matched," Dr Rees says.Estimates of flu vaccine effectiveness is 40-60 per cent in the United States and 30-60 per cent in Australia. This means 30-60 per cent of those vaccinated are less likely to become seriously ill or die from influenza."For healthy people the figure can be as high as 70-90 per cent, in elderly people figures of 50-60 per cent have been quoted for prevention of hospitalisation and pneumonia," she adds."It is still possible to contract influenza even if you have been vaccinated and if you do develop symptoms, it is best to rest, recuperate and isolate yourself from anyone at risk of serious illness.READ MORE: Are your kids eating too much protein?Everyone can benefit from a flu vaccination but some people are at more risk of serious illness from the flu. (Getty)Flu shot side effectsMost influenza vaccines are safe in adults and children."Many people worry about the side effects of the flu vaccine. It is important to say that it is an inactive vaccine and you cannot get the flu from the vaccine," Dr Rees tells 9Honey."You may however experience symptoms triggered by your immune system mounting its response to the vaccine and these can include a runny nose, headaches and mild temperatures. They usually pass within a few days and you can use supportive measures to ease your symptoms if they do occur."You may also experience pain at the injection site and mild swelling or redness. If this occurs, an ice pack can be helpful and monitor your symptoms. If they fail to improve or get worse, have it reviewed by your doctor."Do I have to space out my COVID booster and flu shot?This year, you can get your flu shot on the same day as your COVID booster."It is safe to have the COVID vaccine and the flu vaccine together. You may experience more side effects when more than one vaccine is administered at the same time but most people will experience no ill effects," Dr Rees says."It is important to note that influenza has been less of a problem during the pandemic due to isolation mandates. This is expected to change now that borders have opened and people can once again travel, so its even more important that we take advantage of the vaccination program in 2022."It's now easier than ever to chat to a GP, because it can all be done online via platforms such as Femma."For a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.Sick of chicken?

Photo by Eyleen Gomez. By Chronicle Staff Share 12th April 2022 An outbreak of influenza A has been identified with seven cases found in St Bernard's Hospital in under two weeks, the Director of Public Health, Dr Helen Carter, has confirmed. Over the last two years Gibraltar has had very low levels of circulating influenza, likely as a result of reduced social mixing and good respiratory hygiene, the GHA said. But unusually for this late in the season, 17 cases have been identified since April 1, and of these seven were found in hospital. “However, we do not test anywhere near as much for flu as we have for Covid-19, so we will not be identifying all of the cases,” a GHA spokesman told the Chronicle. “We anticipate that this is a large under estimate of numbers in the community because people think they have Covid-19, test negative and carry on with life without isolating i.e. staying in if they have a temperature etc.” The GHA said it is unusual for influenza cases to increase this late in the year, which means that whilst the seasonal flu vaccine administered last autumn was very effective, the level of immunity that it offered is now waning. "Whilst influenza is unpleasant, most people will recover within a week,” the GHA said. The GHA advised influenza has very similar symptoms to Covid-19 such as high temperature, cough, blocked nose, muscle aches, sore throat and tiredness. "Individuals who experience these symptoms but test negative for Covid-19 may have influenza A and should stay at home until 24 hours after fever is gone," the GHA said. It is advised those with influenza symptoms should not visit Elderly Residential Services or St Bernard’s Hospital as to do so would put vulnerable relatives and friends at unnecessary risk. "Over-the-counter treatments such as paracetamol can be used to reduce temperature and treat influenza symptoms," the GHA said. The GHA advised the public not to proactively seek a test for influenza. The GHA will only test for influenza at the Primary Care Centre and St Bernard’s Hospital in cases where confirmation of the diagnosis may alter clinical treatment, i.e. if the individual is very young or very old. Dr Carter, said: "This is a reminder that there are a number of respiratory infections, other than Covid-19, that can easily spread and cause severe illness for the most vulnerable in society. If you test negative for Covid-19 but have heavy systematic symptoms such as a fever is important that you: • remain at home for 24 hours after the fever has come down; • do not visit vulnerable relatives and loved ones, particularly in ERS and the hospital." "This is because you are increasing the risk of transmitting influenza onto someone who may be at increased risk of developing severe disease." "For most people flu is unpleasant but they will usually recover within a week without any longer term health effects."

Since the first reported outbreak in a poultry flock Guelph on March 27, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has identified the presence of H5N1 in 12 regions across Ontario as of April 12. Although it isn't a threat to our food safety, it is forcing farmers to kill large flocks of poultry meant for consumption. “Each infected premise has been placed under quarantine. CFIA has established movement control measures and is recommending enhanced bio-security for other farms within that area,” stated by the CFIA website The owners of Growing Hope Farm in Cambridge have a small flock of egg laying chickens, alongside many other farm animals on their property, which so far has managed to stay out of the quarantine zones placed around outbreaks in Guelph and Woolwich Township at the end of March. Sarah and Phillip Martin-Mills have been operating Growing Hope Farm in Preston for six years, and is one of the only properties in the city that is allowed to have poultry on site. They also raise turkeys but haven’t started that yet. Sarah said that comes closer to May. Right now she’s focused on goats. “We're not in the epicentre of it but unfortunately birds can fly, so it can be very easily transmitted.” The local farm isn’t concerned yet but if they become part of the red zone, as outlined on the map tracked by CFIA, they will have to quarantine their birds as well. “We're not in the quarantine zone yet, but it is getting close to us,” Sarah said. “We have free range layers, if we got to that point, we would have to put them in a covered pen or something like that so wild birds couldn’t get at them.” She said she knows of two local hatcheries that sell to the public are in the epicentre of it all. “It’s going to make getting birds for poultry really difficult and then when you do get them you don’t know, right? You have to do all this paperwork to get them out of the quarantine zone and then you have to protect them.” Last Friday, the Ministry of Agriculture put out a release stating that the government is taking additional measures to protect flocks. Lisa Thompson, the Minister of Agriculture for the province issued a minister’s order under the Animal Health Act. The aim is to reduce birds co-mingling with one another, to reduce the spread of the virus. It's a familiar restriction for all of us during the pandemic. On April 9, the movement and participation of birds in events such as shows or educational displays was prohibited. The order is set to expire May 9. “Temporarily reducing direct contact between birds from different locations will limit the spread of avian influenza and protect animal health, and is an important part of a strong bio-security plan,” as stated on the release. “It makes life even more interesting this year,” said Sarah, hopeful birds will fare better fighting their virus than us, as bird migration season ends in a couple weeks.

The unvaccinated population and those with pre-existing conditions continue to remain at risk, which is why wearing masks, maintaining distance and following proper hand hygiene is extremely crucial at this juncture.Apart from the SARs-CoV-2 virus, other respiratory viruses including the Influenza virus continue to circulate, causing cold-like symptoms, which could be mistaken for COVID. In addition, the searing heat wave sweeping different parts of India have also added to the woes of the people, leading to various ailments and complications. According to reports, temperatures have crossed the 40 degrees Celsius (°C) mark, making things worse amid the ongoing pandemic. In light of such circumstances, if you have COVID-like symptoms, it could mean anything. It could either be coronavirus, or a flu or due to the heat wave that is reeling across Indian cities. Also read: Coronavirus: Things immunocompromised people need to keep in mind as COVID-19 restrictions ease2/4How to know if you have COVID or flu?Past variants like the Alpha or the Delta were said to primarily impact the lower respiratory tract, causing more severe symptoms such as high fever, persistent cough, loss of sense of smell and taste, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. In worst case scenarios, people would often complain of shortness of breath, chest pain, breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels. However, the emergence of COVID's Omicron variant led to milder symptoms like a sore throat, cough, runny nose, and sneezing, which could also indicate a flu or a common cold.The major difference between COVID-19 and a regular flu is the extent of its severity and how fast it spreads. The SARs-CoV-2 virus seems to spread more efficiently and causes more severe ailment in certain people, whereas people infected with the flu recover in a few days with just mild illness. Symptoms like shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell or taste are common with COVID-19, but not with the flu. Similarly, headaches, nausea are less prevalent in coronavirus patients, but they're a classic symptom of the flu.3/4Are your symptoms a result of COVID or heat-related illness?From heat rash, cramps to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, heat waves can give light to different types of heat-related illnesses. Depending on the illness, you can develop various symptoms.A heat rash may involve red, itchy skin, small bumps or blisters on the sweaty areas of the body, which can also lead to an infection. Heat cramps are painful and can cause discomfort in the legs, arms and abdomen. Muscle spasms are common. Heat exhaustion could lead to fast, shallow breathing along with muscle aches, headache, irritability, weak pulse and gastrointestinal issues. Dizziness, weakness and loss of consciousness are other common symptoms. A heat stroke can go from mild to severe symptoms. It could lead to dizziness, red, inflamed skin, nausea, high body temperature upto 105 degrees. In severe cases, a person could have seizures, may hyperventilate, experience confusion, agitations and hallucinations. As far as a COVID-19 infection is concerned, there could be some resemblance to the heat wave symptoms such as high temperature, fast, shallow breathing, headache, mental confusion and so on. However, one must take note of the associated symptoms. Look out for other respiratory ailments, such as a sore throat, runny nose, cough or impaired sense of smell and taste. If the body temperature cools down on its own and your symptoms ease off quickly after treatment, it is probably not COVID. 4/4The best way to knowIf you develop COVID-like symptoms, it's best to get yourself tested for COVID-19. You can either opt for a quick rapid antigen test, which could deliver results in no time or an RT PCR test, that takes at least a day to deliver results. However, compared to a RAT test, molecular testing is said to be more accurate and reliable.

ATAGI has stated sedation with vaccination can be considered ‘in special circumstances’. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has issued new advice for using sedation when carrying out COVID-19 vaccinations. The advisory group states sedatives should not be used as a ‘first line option’ in most cases but says they could be a possibility under ‘a tiered approach’. Patients with severe anxiety or needle-phobia as well as certain groups with behavioural disorders would be among those who could be vaccinated under sedation ATAGI says, but only ‘in special circumstances’ where no other options remain. ‘Many individuals with anxiety or behavioural disorders can be safely vaccinated in the community using non-pharmacological techniques, such as a low-sensory stimulation environment, presence of comfort person/object, distraction with music, video or toys, relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy [for anxietyeedle-phobia],’ the advice says. ‘Possible indications for sedation include people with severe anxiety or needle-phobia and developmental or behavioural disorders, where non-pharmacological measures to facilitate vaccination have been exhausted.’ The published advice is described as ‘general in nature’, with authors noting that some health services have developed guidelines on using sedation with COVID-19 vaccination or are currently formulating them. More detailed clinical guidance should be put together in partnership with anaesthetic groups as well as relevant local health services and specialists, ATAGI states. Adjunct Associate Professor Bob Davis, Chair of RACGP Specific Interests Disability, said the advice makes sense and will contribute to providing even more protection. ‘The COVID situation has highlighted the need to consider the special situation of people with intellectual disability and make appropriate adjustments so that they have equitable healthcare,’ he told newsGP. Associate Professor Davis believes the unique circumstances of the spread of COVID-19 have changed the balance of risks and benefits for GPs when they are considering sedation for vaccination. As well as the illness itself, he also highlighted the potential social challenges for some patients with a disability if they are obliged to isolate. ‘If we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic with this particular infection, if it was happening at relatively minor rates, then the urgency of vaccination wouldn’t be there,’ he said. ‘But clearly, with the [case] numbers that we have out in the community, it is.’ Sedation requires informed consent either from the patient, or from a parent, guardian or substitute decision maker if they cannot give it themselves. ‘Sedation should not be used as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements,’ the advice notes. The advisory body says all of the current COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Australia are considered ‘safe and suitable’ for use with sedation and can be considered for co-administration with other vaccines, including influenza. ‘There are no theoretical concerns regarding immunogenicity or effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines if administered under various methods of sedation,’ the advice reads. ‘There are no concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines if administered following use of various medications beyond the safety and risk of sedation itself.’ ATAGI says vaccination could also be considered opportunistically if a patient is undergoing sedation for separate elective surgery – as long as they are not acutely unwell. The type of sedative and sedation should be worked out case-by-case, the advisory group also recommends. The patient’s medical history, available resources and the relevant local sedation procedure guidelines should all be considered. ‘While there are no data on the safety of specific sedative agents given concurrently with any specific vaccine, there are also no theoretical safety concerns,’ ATAGI states. According to the advice, COVID-19 vaccines can be administered regardless of whether the patient is under light or deep sedation. Log in below to join the conversation.

However, the Department of Health says it's unusual to see influenza cases this late in the year, which means the vaccines administered last autumn are now waning. Nevertheless, it says while influenza is unpleasant, most people will recover within a week. However, it can be serious for the very young and elderly.Public Health says the symptoms are similar to Covid-19: A high temperature, cough, blocked nose, muscle aches, sore throat and tiredness. Anyone experiencing these symptoms, but has tested negative for Covid, is advised to stay at home until 24 hours after the fever has passed.Those with flu symptoms should avoid Elderly Residential Services and the hospital to avoid placing the vulnerable at risk.The GHA will not be offering tests for Influenza A, but recommends over-the-counter treatments such as paracetamol to treat symptoms.

Seizures and even coma are the main symptoms that indicate the virus has infected the brain. These neurological manifestations result from direct viral invasion of the brain and an excessive immune response, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Written by Longjam Dineshwori |Updated : April 15, 2022 10:47 AM IST Fear has gripped people in Bihar's Supaul district after samples of birds found dead last month came out positive for avian influenza (H5N1) or bird flu. The district administration has issue direction for culling of chickens in poultry farms located in affected areas. Meanwhile, people in the region have been asked to avoid consumption of chicken. On March 31, over four dozen birds, including crows, ducks, chickens, and other birds were reportedly found dead in mysterious circumstances in Chapkahi village under Sadar police station. Some of the birds were alive but restless. The villagers and local veterinary doctors tried to save them by giving medicines and injections, but they did not recover from the illness. During preliminary investigation, the officials of the Animal Husbandry department suspected symptoms of bird flu. They collected the samples and sent them to the lab in Bhopal for testing. The report has come positive.
